# MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1958 

## 1958 

### General 

In 1958, about a year and a half before Random House acquired Alfred A. Knopf, an event occurred which would have a profound influence on the Modern Library’s subsequent history. That was the arrival of Jason Epstein as a Random House editor. Epstein had started Anchor Books at Doubleday five years before, at the age of twenty-five. Anchor Books pioneered the quality paperback and was widely imitated by other publishers. Epstein acquired a reputation, at an early age, as a brilliant, innovative, ambitious, and successful figure in the publishing world. All of these qualities appealed strongly to Cerf, who also admired Epstein’s aggressiveness. Others found him arrogant and difficult to work with. 

Part of the agreement with Random House allowed Epstein to start an independent imprint of children’s books, the Looking Glass Library, which Random House would distribute and which Epstein hoped would make his fortune; but the Looking Glass Library was discontinued after several years. Otherwise, Epstein was responsible at Random House for Modern Library Paperbacks and was closely involved with the Modern Library itself. 

Despite efforts to revitalize the Modern Library, the profitability of the series began to slip in the 1960s. It is unlikely that another person, less identified with paperbacks than was Epstein, could have saved the Modern Library. It is possible, however, that Epstein may have accelerated the series’ demise. The effort to make the series a vital up-to-date presence in the academic world appears to have been abandoned, either because academia’s response was disappointing or because to do the job right would have been too expensive for the potential return. The inclusion of substantial quantities of contemporary fiction in the late 1960s diluted the Modern Library’s image as a series of indisputably significant books. 

Epstein spent money more freely than any of his predecessors. This was a change from the penny-pinching finances that had characterized the Modern Library in earlier days. In the past, the Modern Library had always been the economic foundation of Random House, but its financial success had depended upon ever-vigilant scrutiny of costs. The series might have survived longer had a real effort been made to keep costs at a minimum. 

### Number of titles 

Nine titles were added and six were discontinued. Swift’s *Gulliver’s Travels, A Tale of a Tub, The Battle of the Books* (1931) was superseded by Swift’s *Gulliver’s Travels and Other Writings.* This brought the list of available titles to 312. 

### Format 

All new titles were published in the standard 7¼ by 4⅞ inch format with the Blumenthal binding, stained top edges, and Kent endpapers in gray. The binding cloth was red, blue, green or gray with lettering on inset panels in black on the front cover and spine. 

### Price 

\$1.65

### Dating keys

### Titles sought, suggested, declined 

Moses Hadas suggested a ML reprint of the edition of ten plays of Euripides that he and John Harvey McLean had translated (Dial Press, 1936), but Penguin Books and New American Library had both recently published inexpensive new translations and Jason Epstein thought the ML should wait (Epstein to Hadas, 14 November 1958). In the end the ML reprinted the University of Chicago Press’s *Complete Greek Tragedie*s, edited by David Grene and Richmond Lattimore (4 vols., 1959; ML reprint, 7 volumes, 1960–63). Eric Bentley suggested a book of six Lope de Vega plays (Bentley to Epstein, 16 November 1958). Klopfer rejected a suggestion to publish a new edition of *Democracy in America* as a ML Giant (Klopfer to Lerner, 13 November 1958).

> Front flap:<br> This thoroughly enjoyable collection is almost a biography of Damon Runyon, the boy who grew up in the West, rode the rods, knew what the inside of jails was like, wrote sports, reported abroad, and became Mr. Broadway. Here are represented the wide range of his experiences and of his writing—early Westerns and sketches of “folks back home” with vivid titles like *The Wooing of Nosey Gillespie* and *At Dead Mule Crossing*; or tales, like *The Informal Execution of Soupbone Pew*, picked up in the hobo jungles. From his days as a newspaper reporter and syndicated columnist come accounts like *The Main Event*, sports verse like *A Handy Guy Like Sande*, and affectionate sketches of “ordinary” people like those of Joe and Ethel Turp or My Old Man. And finally, from Runyon’s great days as a Broadway chronicler, we have Hot Horse Herbie, Nicely Nicely, Gentleman George and their fantastic cronies, speaking again in these pages the peculiar vernacular now immortalized as Runyonese.

> Front flap:<br> Few men have been more widely read—and more misinterpreted—than Jonathan Swift. He did, it is true, call himself a misanthrope and many readers have been quick to regard him solely as a brooding, embittered critic of mankind. 
> Actually, he was an intensely loyal, warm person in his private life and an active, ardent participant in worldly affairs, using his great satiric pen with positive effects on many controversial issues. Readers of *Gulliver’s Travels* already know that the narrative charm of that book is merely one aspect of a work infinitely rich in observation and wisdom. And the broad variety of matters that engaged Swift’s brilliantly incisive mind is fully represented in the many other masterpieces of prose and poetry in this volume. (*Spring 1958*)

A savage satire on man and his institutions, written with great wit and invention, *Gulliver’s Travels* has captivated readers for the past two centuries.

> Front flap:<br> Irwin Shaw was already widely recognized as one of America’s finest writers of short stories and plays when *The Young Lions* appeared. The enthusiastic response of critics was almost unprecedented, and—more importantly—many critics immediately recognized the permanent stature of the novel. “The book is an authentic contribution to the enduring body of American literature,” said one critic. “It will be read long after other successes of the day are out of print and out of mind.” 
> Time has proved their judgments right, for this engrossing novel of men at war is in fact a testament of our century. It is the story of modern man in a moment of extreme ordeal, dramatically told by an acutely sensitive creative writer. The editors of the Modern Library are proud to include it as a work of distinguished and enduring achievement. (*Spring 1958*)

> Front flap:<br> When *The Young Lions* was published in 1948, Irwin Shaw was already widely recognized as one of America’s foremost short story writers and playwrights. But when this, his first novel, appeared, the critical response was more enthusiastic than anyone could have expected—“He reveals in even greater stature the delicious wit, the dramatic sense of scene-making, and the full-hearted compassion of his short stories,” wrote *The Saturday Review*. The story of three young men—a Nazi, a Jew, and an American—*The Young Lions* takes place bestween [*sic*] 1938 and 1945, when the lives of the main characters cross fatally in a Bavarian forest. With this book, wrote *The New York Herald Tribune*, “Irwin Shaw becomes one of the most important of American novelists”; and in the years since, this judgment has been reconfirmed many times.

Pp. [*6*], [1–2] 3–277 [278–282]. [1–9]<sup>16</sup> 

[*1*] half title; [*2*] blank; [*3*] title; [*4*] *First Modern Library Edition* | *Copyright, 1945, 1946, 1951, by J. D. Salinger*; [*5*] dedication; [*6*] blank; [1] fly title; [2] blank; 3–277 text; [278–279] ML Giants list; [280–282] blank. (*Fall 1958*) 

*Jacket:* Non-pictorial in black and strong brown (55) on coated white paper with title and series in black and author in strong brown, all against white background. 

> Front flap:<br> This is the story of Holden Caulfield, a sixteen-year-old boy who, on being dropped by his prep school, decides to spend three days in New York before reporting home. The events of those three days and nights, told in the boy’s own words, form more than a dramatic story. They are the means by which Salinger skillfully portrays the thoughts and feelings of a young boy standing alone and unsure on the threshold of manhood.
> “Mr. Salinger’s novel,” said Lewis Vogler in the *San Francisco Chronicle*, “is funny, poignant, and in its implications, profound. It is literature of a very high order.” The editors of the Modern Library are pleased to include this novel, which is already widely regarded as a twentieth-century classic. (*Fall 1958*) 

Originally published by Little, Brown & Co., 1951. ML edition (pp. [*5*]–277) printed from Little, Brown plates. Published October 1958. *WR* 13 October 1958. First printing: Not ascertained but probably around 10,000 copies. Discontinued 1963/64. 

The ML paid Little, Brown a \$3,000 advance against royalties of 12 cents a copy. Cerf wrote to Arthur Thornhill of Little, Brown early in 1958 that he wanted to publish *The Catcher in the Rye* and Salinger’s *Nine Stories* (516) in successive years. “I believe both books are already available in cheap paperback editions, but that wouldn’t bother us at all. Mr. Salinger is a great favorite today with just the college groups that patronize the Modern Library most heavily” (Cerf to Thornhill, 8 January 1958). The reprint contract, dated 7 February 1958, was for a period of five years. Salinger stipulated that there was to be no photograph of the author on the jacket and that Little, Brown had to approve the jacket copy. 

Printings between 1959 and 1962 were as follows: two printings of 5,000 and 3,000 copies (1959), 7,000 copies (1960), two printings of 7,000 and 10,000 copies (1961), two printings of 15,000 and 10,000 copies (1962). In the following table ML sales of *Catcher in the Rye* and *Nine Stories* chart Salinger’s popularity with precision.

Salinger requested in June 1963 that the ML contracts for *Catcher in the Rye* and *Nine Stories* not be renewed. Thornhill gave six months’ termination notice for *Catcher in the Rye* and indicated that the ML would have the right to dispose of any copies on hand (Thornhill to Klopfer, 21 June 1963). Cerf was “deeply distressed” and wrote to Salinger: “We have always considered these two of the most important books in the whole series and have tried to present them in as dignified a manner as possible.” He noted that the ML had sold nearly 65,000 copies of *Catcher in the Rye* and over 37,000 copies of *Nine Stories* and asked if the ML could continue to publish both books for another three years at least (Cerf to Salinger, 25 June 1963). 

There is no reply from Salinger in the RH archives. Klopfer indicated in July that the RH Production Department had been instructed to make no more printings of *Catcher in the Rye* (Klopfer to Thornhill, 15 July 1963). The ML edition was out of print by the winter of 1963/64; it is included in the ML’s fall 1963 stock list but omitted from spring/summer 1964 stock list. 

The ML appears to have been reluctant to acknowledge that Salinger’s books were no longer part of the series. Perhaps there was a lingering hope that Salinger might change his mind. *Catcher in the Rye* and *Nine Stories* were listed in *Publishers’ Trade List Annual* through 1965 and continued to be included in ML lists in the books themselves through 1969. Numbers of discontinued titles were normally reassigned to new titles the following publishing season; ML 90, the number of *Catcher in the Rye*, was not reassigned to another title until fall 1967 when *Four Contemporary French Plays* (598) was published as ML 90.

> Front flap:<br> This book is guaranteed to give you all fifty-seven varieties of laughter—everything from the side-splitting belly-laugh to the soft inner ripple. 
> These stories are all about Jeeves, the most fabulous gentleman’s gentleman ever invented. From behind his inscrutable facade, the incomparable Jeeves—confessor, savior, confidant—sagely guides the destinies of Bertie Wooster and his friends. And when things get out of hand, as they invariably do, it is Jeeves who tactfully assumes control to settle matters with his customary incredible ingenuity. 
> For this edition, John W. Aldridge has written an excellent introduction which discusses Wodehouse’s talent—a talent that transforms all readers into devotees. (*Fall 1958*) 

Original ML collection selected from *Carry On, Jeeves!* (George H. Doran Co., 1927) and *Very Good, Jeeves* (Doran, 1930). Published October 1958. *WR* 13 October 1958. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72. 

Aldridge suggested a volume of Wodehouse stories in 1956 (Aldridge to Hiram Haydn, 9 July 1956). Cerf indicated that since the ML would be making new plates the maximum royalty would be 10 cents a copy and that it would have to include Wodehouse, his publisher, and Aldridge (Cerf to Aldridge, 19 July 1957). 

Wodehouse wrote that he was “tremendously pleased and flattered” that he would be in the ML but noted that he didn’t think the stories in *Carry On, Jeeves!* were very good. He thought it would be better if the ML used most of the first Jeeves book and all of *Very Good, Jeeves*. He also suggested updating several references in the stories and changing the title to *A Gathering of Jeeves* (Wodehouse to Cerf, 12 August 1957). After discussing the proposed contents with Aldridge, Cerf asked Wodehouse not to alter the table of contents. “Aldridge assures us that he weighed the pros and cons of every story he picked, and thinks that for Modern Library purposes we’ve got just the right selection.” He also asked Wodehouse not to insert updated references in the stories. “Everybody realizes that the Jeeves stories belong to a certain period and . . . up-dating any of the references would simply cause unnecessary confusion and certainly would be a mortal affront to your most ardent admirers.” Finally, he argued for sticking with the title *Selected Stories*. “The latter [*A Gathering of Jeeves*] may sound a little bit better, but it has been our experience that Modern Library titles sell best when they state very clearly what the book contains, without reaching for anything cute or clever” (Cerf to Wodehouse, 19 August 1957). 

Wodehouse contributed an original foreword to the volume. Aldridge’s introduction was written for the ML but also appeared in *New World Writing*, no. 13 (1958), pp. 181–92.

*Jacket:* Non-pictorial in deep yellow (85), vivid reddish orange (34) and black on coated white paper with author in reverse, title in vivid reddish orange on inset horizontal black bar, other lettering in reverse and black, and five inset vertical bars from left to right in black, white, black, vivid reddish orange, and black, all against deep yellow background. 

> Front flap:<br> The writings of Immanuel Kant represent the high-water mark of modern philosophy. Few men have had as broad and profound an influence as he did. Josiah Royce, for example, described Kant as “the thinker upon whom more than upon any other center, modern thought turns as upon a fulcrum.” 
> The sheer bulk of Kant’s *Critique*—in many ways his central work—has often deterred readers. Now, Norman Kemp Smith, in this authoritative and new translation, provides a skillfully abridged edition from which all minor and repetitive parts have been omitted. The editors of the Modern Library are pleased to include it as one of the great books that all readers will want to own. (*Fall 1958*) 

Smith translation originally published in London by Macmillan and Co., 1929; abridged edition published by Macmillan and Co., 1934. ML edition (pp. [xix]–335) printed from offset plates photographically reduced from the abridged edition with index and two part titles omitted, page numerals and entry for index removed from table of contents, motto and dedicatory letter combined on a single page, and signature marks removed throughout. Published October 1958. *WR* 13 October 1958. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71. 

The ML paid St Martin’s Press royalties of 10 cents a copy. In the early 1950s, when the RH College Dept. was considering publishing a moderately priced edition of Kant’s *Critique of Pure Reason* for classroom use, Stein asked about one hundred academics which translation they preferred. Nearly every respondent named the Smith translation. Smith’s introduction incorporates his Translator’s Preface from the abridged Macmillan edition but is otherwise original to the ML edition.

> Front flap:<br> Anne Frank was born in Frankfort, Germany on June 12, 1929. “As we are Jewish, we emigrated to Holland in 1933,” Anne writes in her diary, which she received on her thirteenth birthday. In July 1942 she and her family were forced to take refuge with four others in a back apartment in Amsterdam. There they remained until August 4, 1944, when the *Grüne Polizei* made a raid on the “Secret Annexe” and all the occupants were arrested and sent to German and Dutch concentration camps. In March 1945, two months before the liberation of Holland, Anne died of typhoid in the concentration camp at Bergen-Belsen. Only her father, Otto Frank, survived, and it was he who saw that Anne’s diary was published in 1947. 
> Written with rare insight, humor and intimacy, *The Diary of a Young Girl* is one of the classics of our time. It has inspired a play and has been a bestseller in almost every known language. To hundreds of thousands of people, it represents the true horror and tragedy of the Nazi Occupation.

*Jacket:* Non-pictorial in vivid purplish red (254), moderate greenish blue (173) and black on coated white paper with title in vivid purplish red script on white panel at top; additional lettering in reverse, moderate greenish blue and vivid purplish red on black band at center; author in moderate greenish blue script on white panel at foot. 

> Front flap:<br> *Cousin Bette* is, in the opinion of many critics, one of Balzac’s finest novels—if not, indeed, his finest. 
> Paris during the last century comes alive in this novel as Balzac unfolds the dramatic story of men and women driven by greed, hatred, lust, envy, and ambition. With unsurpassed realism, he depicts their gradual moral and physical degeneration. This “fast-moving, brilliantly conceived study of unbridled brute passion,” as Professor Zulli describes *Cousin Bette* in his Introduction, is added to the Modern Library with pride because it is without doubt one of the great books of our culture. (*Fall 1958*) 

Raine translation originally published in the Novel Library by Hamish Hamilton in London and in U.S. by Pantheon Books, 1948. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published October 1958. *WR* 13 October 1958. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72.
