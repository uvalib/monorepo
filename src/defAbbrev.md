B&L Boni & Liveright

backstrip Portion of a book jacket that covers the spine and remains
visible when a book is shelved between other books. Backstrips of ML
jackets commonly displayed the title running vertically toward the foot
or bottom of the jacket. Author’s names were usually displayed
horizontally at the top of the jacket, and the imprint “Modern Library”
appeared horizontally at the foot, along with a Modern Library device.
It was also common for titles to be displayed horizontally. The only ML
jackets with titles running vertically toward the top were printed in
England for the British publisher Hamish Hamilton, who imported a number
of ML books in sheets in the late 1930s and sold them with tipped-in
title pages and his own bindings and jackets.

Bibliographical edition

> Bibliographers define all copies of a work printed from a given
> typesetting as part of the same edition. In the context of the Modern
> Library, which printed all of its books from plates, an edition can be
> defined as all copies of a work printed from plates made from the same
> typesetting. In this bibliography the source of the plates used by the
> ML is always indicated; thereafter for the sake of convenience this
> bibliography uses the phrase “Modern Library edition” to refer to
> families of Modern Library printings made from the same plates.

BOMC Book-of-the-Month Club

c\. Circa (approximately), used with dates. Example c. 1940

cancel, cancellation

> These terms refer to the removal of one or more leaves from a printed
> book, usually because of errors in the text, censorship, or other
> legal issues. Canceled leaves are often replaced by newly printed
> leaves with altered text. Single replacement leaves and inserted folds
> are usually pasted to the stub of the canceled leaf; inserted
> gatherings may be sewn in.

In the collation, canceled leaves are indicated by a minus sign; leaves
that are canceled and replaced by newly printed leaves are indicated by
the plus/minus sign (±). Leaves that are inserted/added without the
cancellation of printed leaves are indicated by a plus sign. Cancels
made prior to publication are usually found in all copies of the first
printing. The first ML printing of Joyce, *Dubliners* (129.1a) appears
to be an example of this. In all copies examined, the first leaf of the
introduction to the ML edition has been cut out and replaced by a newly
printed leaf.

Cancels made following publication are usually found in the portion of
the printing that remained in the publisher’s warehouse after the
problem was discovered. See *Anthology of American Negro Literature*
(183.a).

chap. Chapter

cm Centimeter or centimeters

col. Color

collation Collation formula

collection A volume consisting of multiple works by a single author

conjunct Two leaves that consist of a single piece of paper folded in
half to form two leaves; a sheet printed in octavo format (8 leaves, 16
pages) produces a gathering where the 1st and 8th leaves, the 2nd and
7th leaves, the 3rd and 6th leaves, and the 4th and 5th leaves are
conjunct.

cont. Continued

© International copyright symbol; transcribed in bibliographical
descriptions when it appears as part of the copyright statement on the
verso of the title page.

dates The date of an event that extends over the course of two or more
years is indicated with an en dash, for example 2006–07; the date of an
event that cannot be assigned to a specific year is dated as precisely
as possible using a slash, for example 2006/07. Approximate dates are
indicated by the abbreviation “c.” (circa).

dating key Beginning in fall 1925, current ML lists for spring or fall
of a given year were printed on ML jackets and at the end of many ML
books. Lists at the end of ML books were printed as part of the last
gathering containing text; lists were not included when the last
gathering did not have enough pages to accommodate them. The dating key
indicates one title added in each season and one title (preceded by an
*x*) that would not be added until the following season and thus makes
it possible to date any ML jacket and any ML book that contains a list
as having been printed by spring or fall of a given year. Important
points to note in using the dating key include the following: (1) ML
titles published in January usually have lists from the previous fall;
(2) lists were not updated after spring 1967, so books with spring 1967
lists may have been printed later—and did not contain jackets with
lists; (3) although jackets can be dated conclusively on the basis of
their lists of ML titles, jackets were sometimes switched from one copy
of a book to another, so the jacket cannot by itself conclusively date
the book inside it, especially when the book has no list of its own. (4)
books printed by offset lithography were often made from photographs of
earlier editions and cannot be conclusively dated.

ed. Editor or edited by

edition A slippery term with multiple meanings. In bibliographical
terms, all printings from a given typesetting are part of the same
“edition.”

edition costs Cf. plant costs

endpapers Distinct from inserted fold. Of two types: paste-down endpaper
and free endpaper.

first edition In popular usage, the first printing of a book. The first
printings of most Modern Library titles published after the Boni &
Liveright period include the statement “First Modern Library Edition” or
“First Modern Library Giant Edition” on the verso of the title page;
sometimes “First Printing.” Statement usually removed from the plates
after the first printing, sometimes not. ML books printed from offset
lithographic plates usually retained the “first” statement on all
printings. Apart from transcribing “first” statements on the books, this
bibliography refers to

> first printing as distinct from first edition.

fly title Title or short title of a book that follows the preliminaries.
The fly title normally lacks a printed page number and is counted as the
first page of the text; its verso is usually blank and is counted as the
second page of the text. When a fly title leaf is present, the first
chapter normally begins on p. 3. In American usage, the fly title is
often referred to as a second half title (*Chicago Manual of Style*)
while British usage commonly prefers “fly title” (John Carter, *ABC for
Book Collectors*). Since the half title is part of the preliminaries and
the fly title is part of the text (or body of the text/numbered in
Arabic not Roman numerals), I have chosen to distinguish them by using
different terms.

folio A sheet of paper folded to form two leaves or four pages of a book

foot The bottom of a page; also the bottom of the spine

gathering Single large piece of paper that has been folded into leaves
for binding

gravure A type of intaglio printing process, in which an image is
engraved onto a rotating copper cylinder.

half title Title or short title of a book that precedes the title page.
Always on recto, usually of first leaf. The half title is part of the
preliminaries that precede the body of the text. Cf. fly title.

head The top of a page; also the top of the spine

headline A heading consisting of a single line at the top of a page;
usually/commonly printed in capital letters. *See also* “running head.”

GBN Gordon B. Neavill

IML Illustrated Modern Library, published 1943–48.

impression A given printing of a book; the term “printing” is used
instead of “impression” in this bibliography.

imprint Statement at the foot of the title page indicating the name of
the publisher and commonly the place of publication. The year of
publication may also be included in the imprint, though many publishers
have relegated the year of publication to the verso of the title page or
omitted it altogether, especially if there is a copyright date.

in. Inch or inches

inserted fold Two conjunct leaves (4 pages) added to a gathering,
usually at the end

inserted leaf A single leaf (2 pages) added to a gathering, frequently
but not always at the end of a gathering

ISBN International Standard Book Number. The ISBN, introduced in 1972,
is an international standard that uniquely identifies specific editions
of books. The ISBN originally consisted of ten digits in four fields
separated by hyphens. The first field indicates the language area or
country of publication; the second indicates the publisher; the third
identifies a specific format in which a given work is available from a
given publisher (for example, hardbound paperback, different series,
with different introductions, etc., or revised versions of a given work,
translations); the fourth is a check digit that allows a computer to
flag ISBN’s that have been entered incorrectly. Check digits range from
0 to 10; since the fourth field is limited to a single digit, “10” is
represented by the Roman numeral “X”. Revised editions of a work have
their own ISBN’s.

Publishers began assigning 13-digit ISBN’s in 2006–07. These have a new
prefix (978 or 979) that makes the ISBN consistent with the 13-digit
system of bar codes known as EAN (International Article Number) that is
used throughout the world. EAN originally stood for European Article
Number, but the acronym was so well established that it remained in use
after the 13-digit system of bar codes was adopted internationally.

Most ML books with ISBN’s were published in the “reissue” format
beginning in 1977. Some ML books with jackets designed by S. Neil Fujita
in the late 1960s and early 1970s also have ISBNs. Nearly all ML books
with ISBN’s printed them on the back panel of the jacket, beginning with
the three digits (394) that indicated the publisher as Random House. The
initial field (“0”) for the English-language area was usually omitted.
These ISBN’s are recorded in complete form with the initial “0” added.

ISBN’s today are printed on the verso of the title page. The only ML
volume included in this bibliography with an ISBN on the verso of the
title page is a late printing of Thomas Mann’s *Doctor Faustus*
**(**582b**).** *See also* SBN.

issue A bibliographical term that is widely misused by
non-bibliographers. An “issue” is created by an alteration of the text
that affects the conditions of publication or sale of some copies of a
particular printing. The alteration usually consists of a change in the
title page. Issues occur only within printings; there cannot be a first
issue without a second issue. For additional information and examples,
see “Issue” under Bibliographical Procedures. The verb “issue” is
sometimes used as a synonym for “publish.”

kraft paper Strong light brown paper made from pulp derived from wood
chips; used for ML jackets between 1977 and the “relaunch” of the ML in
1992.

leaf A leaf has two pages: the recto, which is always an odd-numbered
page, and the verso, which is always an even-numbered page. A leaf can
be grasped between the thumb and forefinger; a page can be touched but
not grasped. Properly speaking, the common phrase “turning the pages”
should be “turning the leaves.”

letterpress A relief printing technology; the inked printing surface is
raised from the printing plate or body of the type. Printing can be done
directly from standing metal type or from relief printing plates cast
from individual pages of standing type; there was a letterpress plate
for each page of text. All ML books were printed from plates. Most ML
books were printed from letterpress plates before the mid-1960s, when
the cost of offset lithography dropped below that of letterpress
printing. One side of a sheet was printed at a time. Except for the
early Boni & Liveright period, each printed sheet consisted of eight or
sixteen pages of text on each side. Printers had to position the plate
for each page so that when the sheets were folded and trimmed, the
printed pages would all be right side up and sequenced in the correct
order. Between 1965 and 1967 the ML converted most of its titles from
letterpress to offset.

linen paper Linen-finish white paper

lithography Printing technology based on the antipathy of oil and water.
The printing surface of lithographic plates is neither raised, as in
letterpress printing, nor recessed into the plate, as in engraving and
etching. *See also* offset.

ML (a) Modern Library series, founded by Albert Boni and Horace
Liveright in 1917 and acquired by Bennett Cerf in 1925. In partnership
with Donald S. Klopfer, Cerf established a new publishing house, The
Modern Library, Inc., to publish the series. The full name of the series
was “The Modern Library of the World’s Best Books.” The short form is
used consistently in this bibliography. In 1936, after Cerf and Klopfer
had expanded their publishing program to include new trade books, the
firm was reorganized under the name Random House, Inc., and the Modern
Library became a subsidiary of its offspring.

\(b\) Trade books like Joyce’s *Ulysses* published under the Random
House imprint before 1936 were copyrighted by The Modern Library, Inc.

*MLC* *Modern Library Collector*, nos. 1–55 (1981–2008). Semi-annual
newsletter edited by Alan Oestreich; nos. 4–55 include a column,
“Bibliographical Notes and Queries,” by Gordon B. Neavill.

ML catalogue Published by Random House; listed new titles, titles
dropped and other information about the series. Published 1925–40?

MLCE Modern Library College Editions, a paperbound series intended for
textbook use in colleges and universities. The first was introduced by
Random House in 1950. The books had introductions by noted academics.
Edited by Jess Stein, who had come to the firm to work on the American
College Dictionary.

MLG Modern Library Giants. A series of full sized volumes with hard
covers introduced in fall 1931. The series was used initially for works
like Tolstoy’s *War and Peace* (1931) that were too long to fit into the
ML’s regular format and for substantial collections and anthologies such
as *The Complete Novels of Jane Austen* (1933) and *The English
Philosophers from Bacon to Mill* (1939). Several titles were published
in both the regular ML and MLG.

MLP Modern Library Paperbacks, the series of “quality” or “trade”
paperbacks published by Random House between 1955 and 1960. The series
was thrown together quickly to give Random House a foothold in the
emerging quality paperback market after the collapse of extended
on-and-off negotiations with Allan Lane to acquire the American branch
of Penguin Books. When Random House acquired Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., in
1960, the Knopf paperback series Vintage Books became Random House’s
primary trade paperback imprint and Modern Library Paperbacks were
phased out. The best MLP titles were added to Vintage Books and the rest
were discontinued.

OCLC Online Computer Library Center in Dublin, Ohio. The OCLC database
of machine-readable bibliographic records, consisting of records created
by the Library of Congress, other national libraries, and OCLC member
libraries, is the largest single source of bibliographic records
included in the online catalogs of libraries in the U.S. and many other
countries. In June 2010 the OCLC database consisted of over 193 million
bibliographic records, each of which is identified by a unique number.
WorldCat, the public version of the OCLC database, is accessible through
many libraries. OCLC includes a separate database of authority records
which indicate the “authorized form” of personal, corporate, and other
names that are used in library catalogs and identify variant forms of
these names that can establish “see” and “see also” references as
authorized forms.

offset A lithographic printing technology where the printing area of a
plate is neither raised (as in letterpress printing) nor recessed into
the plate (as in intaglio technologies such as engraving and etching).
Offset lithography is based on the antipathy of oil and water.
Commercial lithographic printing technologies are known as “offset
lithography” or “offset” for short because the inked image on the plate
is not printed directly to paper but “offset” to a third cylinder
covered with a rubber blanket before being transferred to paper carried
by a third cylinder. The ML printed occasional titles by offset
lithography from the 1930s on, either because the original publisher’s
letterpress plates were too large for the Modern Library’s compact
format or because a work included a large number of illustrations that
would have been too expensive to include otherwise. Printing by offset
lithography was more expensive than letterpress before the 1960s, and
the quality of printing was regarded as inferior. The cost of offset
printing fell below that of letterpress printing in the mid-1960s.
Between 1965 and 1967 the ML converted most of its titles from
letterpress to offset. Many of the ML’s letterpress plates had become
badly worn over the years. Random House employees were encouraged to
search the secondhand book market for first or early printings of ML
titles to photograph for the conversion to offset lithography. In some
cases where use of the original publisher’s letterpress plates resulted
in uncomfortably narrow margins, the ML reduced the size of the type
page photographically, significantly improving the appearance of the
text.

Malraux, *Man’s Fate* (294), published in the ML in 1936, offers an
example of a ML title that was printed initially by offset lithography
so that the type page could be reduced photographically to fit the ML’s
balloon cloth format, then from the original publisher’s letterpress
plates after the introduction of the ML’s larger format in 1939, and
finally in the mid-1960s by offset lithography, with the text reduced
photographically from the original publisher’s edition to make the most
aesthetically pleasing ML printings.

opp. Opposite

page One side of a leaf. The first side of a printed leaf is the *recto*
and bears an odd page number; the second side is the *verso* and bears
an even page number. It is possible to hide a dollar bill between the
verso of one leaf and the recto of the following leaf but not between
recto and verso pages.

paratext Introductions by the author that are unique to the ML edition,
such as Virginia Woolf’s introduction to *Mrs. Dalloway* (1928) or F.
Scott Fitzgerald’s introduction to *The Great Gatsby* (1934); can be
referred to as authorial (or author’s) paratext.

perfect bound Binding where separate leaves are held together with glue,
in contrast to a binding where folded gatherings are sewn with thread;
ML reissues are perfect bound but earlier books are sewn

preliminaries The leaves of a book that precede the text

*PTLA* *Publishers’ Trade List Annual*. This annual book trade
publication consists of listings of in-print books organized by
publisher. Modern Library listings in *PTLA* have been used to establish
the approximate date that ML titles were discontinued in the 1970s and
1980s, after ML jackets discontinued the practice of including complete
lists of ML titles that were updated each time the jacket was reprinted.

quality paperbacks

> Paperbound books published by trade publishers and usually drawn
> heavily from a given publisher’s backlist, as opposed to mass-market
> paperbacks. Anchor Books, conceived by Jason Epstein and published by
> Doubleday beginning in 1953, was the first American quality paperback

> because they are sold in bookstores rather than mass-market outlets.
> In the 1950s they were sometimes referred to as “egghead paperbacks.”

> The ML lost a number of titles in the mid-1950s when publishers
> canceled the ML’s reprint contracts in order to add the titles to
> their quality paperback series.

recto *See* “page”

reissue RH referred to ML titles restored to the series between 1977 and
1986 in distinctive kraft paper jackets as ML reissues. New titles added
to the series during this period were also published in the “reissue”
format. The jackets, designed by R. D. Scudellari, the RH art director,
came in two styles. Nonpictorial jackets with hand-lettered authors and
titles, were used beginning in 1977. The second featured woodcuts by
Stephen Alcorn on the front panel of the jacket with the title in
reverse against a reddish rectangular panel. I have used the phrase
“reissue format” to refer to printings in the two styles.

“Reissue” is an inexact and slippery term and is unrelated to the
technical bibliographical term “issue” (q.v.), which has a precise and
clearly defined meaning but is also commonly used as a synonym for
“publish.”

relaunch Term used by RH to refer to the revival of the ML that began in
1992. Harry Evans, the former editor of the *Sunday Times* (London) and
the president of Random House in the 1990s was primarily responsible for
reviving the ML. ML books published after 1991 are outside the scope of
this bibliography.

RH Random House was established in 1927 by Bennett Cerf and Donald
Klopfer; reorganization in 1936.

RHP Random House Papers, Columbia University, Rare Book & Manuscript
Library. All citations to unpublished correspondence and other
unpublished documents are to the Random House Papers unless indicated
otherwise.

running head A headline, usually but not always printed in capital
letters, that is repeated from page to page or leaf to leaf; the running
head can be the title of the book, a part title, or a chapter title. The
headline is included when referring to the number of printed lines on a
page. *See* *also* term for page numerals below the last line of text.

SBN Standard Book Number. Depending on the country, an 8 or 9-digit code
in three fields developed in 1966 for uniquely identifying books. The
first field identifies the publisher; the second identifies a specific
edition of a book; and the third is a check digit that flags the SBN as
invalid if any of the preceding digits have been entered incorrectly.
Hardbound and paperbound formats of a given book have different SBN’s.

The ML printed SBN’s on the back panel of many jackets in the late 1960s
and 1970s—especially jackets for the “reissue” format introduced in
1976. Some ML books that continued to be sold in 1960s bindings and
jackets also had SBN’s added to the back panel of the jackets. The SBN
was superseded by the 10-digit International Standard Book Number
(ISBN), introduced in 1972. It was common for ML books published in the
1970s and 1980s to print the 9-digit SBN on jackets; with rare
exceptions, they did not include the ISBN on the verso of the title
page. I have noted SBN’s printed on ML jackets between 1966 and 1972;
for books published after 1972, I have converted the 9-digit numbers on
jackets to ISBN’s and have identified them accordingly. *See also* ISBN.

short title The title proper of a work, excluding other title
information such as a subtitle.

shoulder note A side-note in a printed or manuscript book, that is
positioned in the outer margin at the top corner of the page. Also known
as marginal note.

*SRL* *Saturday Review of Literature*, a weekly magazine devoted to
literature and the arts that began publication in 1924; the title was
shortened to *Saturday Review* in 1952. *SRL*’s “Trade Winds” column
that began in the early 1940s was written by Bennett Cerf. For the sake
of convenience, *SRL* is used to refer to both titles of the magazine.

state A bibliographical term that is widely misused by
non-bibliographers. States are created by an alteration of the text in
*some copies* of a particular printing (usually by stop-press correction
or cancellation of leaves). States occur within printings; there cannot
be a first state without a second state.

text block All of the folded printed sheets that comprise the content of
a book/body of the text, including blank pages that are part of a
printed sheet containing text or illustrations, together with any single
or folded sheets that are inserted as part of the content. The text
block does not include the binding or inserted endpapers. A blank leaf
used as a free or paste-down endpaper is part of the text block if it is
part of a gathering containing text or illustrations.

text page All of the printed elements on a page except the headline and
page number; *see also* “type page.”
