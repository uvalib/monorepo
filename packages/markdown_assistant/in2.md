ASSIGNMENT OF PAVILION II TO MS. CHRISTA DAVIS ACAMPORA
-------------------------------------------------------

### RESOLVED, Pavilion II, East Lawn, is assigned to Ms. Christa Davis Acampora, Dean, College and Graduate School of Arts & Sciences, for a term of five years commencing August 2023.

**AMENDMENT TO THE PAVILION ASSIGNMENT POLICY**

RESOLVED, the Pavilion Assignment Policy is amended to add the Dean of the School of Data Science to the Order of Precedence for Lawn Pavilions (other than Pavilion VIII apartments), Montebello, and Weedon House.

**Discussion with University Leadership**

President Ryan expressed thanks to the Board and to the University leadership team for their extraordinary hard work – around the clock in some cases – and dedication to supporting the community over the past few weeks, including personal support of him. He said the challenge for the session is recovery from the tragedy of November 13. He expressed the profound sadness members of the community are feeling about the loss of three truly outstanding young men. Having attended the services for D’Sean Perry, Devin Chandler, and Lavel Davis, as well as the Memorial Service in JPJ, he said he had a much better understanding of just how deep this loss is for the families, their home communities, their teammates, coaches, friends, and classmates. He mentioned the two students who were injured: Mike Hollins and Marlee Morgan. Both are expected to make full recoveries. He named many of the constituent groups most impacted by the shootings, including the members of the police force; students and the faculty member on the bus who witnessed the events; the medical personnel and first responders who attended to the deceased and to the injured; the football team and coaches; friends and classmates of the victims; roommates of accused student Christopher Jones; the Black community at UVA, who have faced a great deal of adversity all semester; and the many students who were sheltering in place and genuinely afraid, including those closest to the incident.

In the aftermath of the tragedy, the University pivoted from business as usual to crisis mode, and he enumerated the many ways this was accomplished, including canceling classes for two days and requiring only designated employees to come to work. Charlottesville City Schools and Albemarle County schools also canceled classes on Monday. On the academic side, deans and faculty were asked to offer flexibility in class attendance and mode of participation, to postpone grades and exams until after Thanksgiving, and then offer pass/fail option.

The Students Affairs staff launched a massive student support response, including designating gathering spaces, ensuring food was available, arranging for walk-in counseling and therapy dogs, and communicating about available resources, including building a web page for resources. They also were in regular contact with students on the bus and other directly affected groups.

Other actions: the basketball game was canceled that Monday night, and the remainder of the football season was canceled, State Police launched a criminal investigation, and we asked the Attorney General to appoint counsel to undertake an external review. To add to the stress, the day after the shootings, the community was again unnerved by social media threats made by Bryan Silva, which turned out to be unrelated, but he was arrested by Charlottesville Police. And, right before the Memorial Service at JPJ there was another threat that required additional security measures to clear.

President Ryan said in many ways, the University community has never felt more like family. People have stepped up to support one another. He named many actions and events including the vigil on the Lawn; 4th Year students rededicating their traditional 5k, and donating the proceeds to the victims and their families; those who spoke on behalf of their teammates and friends at the Memorial Service; Architecture students who built three memorials for display outside JPJ, where people left flowers; athletics teams wearing tributes to 1, 15, and 41 on their uniforms; reworking Lighting of the Lawn; Cavalier Marching Band performances on the Lawn and at the Memorial Service; and student representative to the Board Lily Roberts’ dedication to working on behalf of affected students.

Faculty, staff, and alumni also stepped up in numerous ways, including opening their homes to students and pivoting to accommodate canceled classes and changing academic policies; the Alumni Association and Advancement creating the UVA Strong Fund; Communications documenting the messages painted on Beta Bridge; Steve Farmer identifying financial support for affected students and how to get it to them before they even had to ask; Athletics staff creating beautiful tribute videos shown at the Memorial; efforts to create and send sympathy cards to families; Police diligence in coordinating law enforcement efforts in the immediate aftermath – and providing security in the days that followed; Catering providing free hot cocoa and cookies at student gatherings; UVA Health providing outstanding and compassionate care for the injured students.

Student Affairs worked to arrange for walk-in counseling; organized study breaks and opportunities for engagement for students through the end of the year; and continued to directly support students most affected.

Parents and community members also helped, finding therapy dogs for grieving community members, leaving flowers on Beta Bridge and elsewhere, and much more.

Movingly, there has been an outpouring of assistance from Virginia Tech, tirelessly assisting with all aspects of recovery, from the UVA Strong Fund to the external review to communications.

President Ryan turned over the “item for feedback” to Chief Operating Officer J.J. Davis to lead a discussion on the uncertain outlook for the economy. Many Board members offered insights into the current economic situation, particularly around inflation.

**Remarks by the Rector**

The Rector thanked President Ryan for his comments and for his leadership. He commented on the administration’s extraordinary work over the past few weeks, and he asked for a moment of silence in remembrance of those who were killed and injured.

**Remarks by the Student Representative**

Ms. Lily Roberts’ comments are reproduced verbatim:

_Thank you, Mr. Rector. It is typical for the student member to use the December meeting as an opportunity to provide a reflection on the past semester. While much has occurred around Grounds the last three months, I think it is imperative that I use my time this afternoon to focus on the past three weeks and the loss of the three beloved members of our student community—Devin Chandler, Lavel Davis and D’Sean Perry and the injury of two more—Mike Hollins and Marlee Morgan._

_It is unfortunate to say that it was not outside of the realm of possibility that gun violence would visit our Grounds given the larger context of all too frequent instances of gun violence across the Commonwealth and across the nation. Yet, the reality that such a horrific instance occurred over three weeks ago now is still hard to sit with. Many of you have asked me how the student body is doing in the face of such tragedy. The best answer I can provide to this simple, yet complex question is “considerably unwell.” Many are still deeply grieving the losses of Devin, Lavel and D’Sean, the injuries of Mike and Marlee and the trauma inflicted upon our peers, a beloved Drama professor, and bus driver who witnessed this horror. We grieve while we also try to recover from the twelve sleepless hours of being on lockdown on and off Grounds that put us into high alert. We are also doing so while trying to balance caring for ourselves, our communities and attempting to get across the finish line that is the end of the semester. I have also heard of course that it still feels surreal to so many, as some are still unable to process this tragedy._

_I do not want to focus on my personal relationship to this tragedy too much, but I will share this: I did not personally have the pleasure of meeting Lavel, Devin or D’Sean during my time here, yet I felt that I had lost three loved ones because we shared two common bonds as Black students and students involved in the Arts. They do not get to make contributions to our society and grow old as three Black men in a nation where we see Black people’s lives cut short all too often. As three deeply creative people with a love for the arts, their lives were senselessly cut short after attending a play about the life of Emmet Till on a trip to D.C. described by one student as “once in a lifetime.”_ 

_They lost their lives in a place that I walked through daily as a student both in the School of Architecture and in the Drama Department as part of their Dance Program. One of the first things I heard from my fellow peers following the announcement of their losses was that Devin, Lavel and D’Sean had been in countless music, art and drama classes with students outside of the athletics community. Their presence will certainly be missed Around Grounds on the football field every game day moving forward, in the locker rooms and around JPJ, on Arts Grounds, in every classroom and lab they attended, in the clubs and activities they dedicated so much of their busy schedules and certainly, on the Lawn with their respective classes during final exercises._ 

_As the Board will continue to confront the aftermath of this tragedy for years to come, I believe it is useful for you to envision the spaces and places around grounds the week following what began as another relatively quiet Sunday night around Grounds that ended in tragedy. I will try to capture what our spaces and places were like the week after this tragedy and how creativity and collaboration have been central to our journey toward healing._

_While I cannot even suggest that these 12 hours we spent in lockdown were not among the most frightening many of our students have experienced, there were lights that shined brightly in the darkness, especially the light of three stars that illuminated the night sky after a cloudy day. Though our tear-filled eyes in the silence of the night during the vigil did not all look up to see, President Ryan posted a picture from the vigil that was shared widely on social media by members of the UVA and Charlottesville community. Some of you witnessed the tragically beautiful vigil that occurred Monday, November 14th which VP Hadley mentioned students organized. To take you into that room, while this Board met in our first emergency meeting of the week, student leaders filled Vice President Hadley’s pavilion and started to consider how to support one another and the community at large. Many of these conversations are leaning into the work that the Recovery Work Group President Ryan called is currently working toward. The orange ribbons many of you are wearing were present at the vigil as well—the difference is they were hand-crafted by student leaders and other student volunteers they recruited who sourced orange ribbon and safety pins from every craft store up and down Route 29 and used their hands to craft the ribbons an hour ahead of the quiet vigil in any corner we could find in Pavilion VI._

_Two days later, an invitation to gather from the Department of Drama and Dance went out to the community of students, faculty and staff on Arts Grounds. It read:_ 

_“The Arts Grounds are a sacred space of creation, community, and artistic expression. It is important to our healing that we honor the lives of Devin Chandler, Lavel Davis Jr., and D’Sean Perry; that we extend our healing thoughts to those who witnessed and were injured during Sunday’s tragedy; and that we reclaim the Arts Grounds as a site of healing, learning, and art-making.”_

_I cannot say anything to express to you all how beautiful this brief and healing time on Arts Grounds was. Students followed this event by sharing their artwork, poems, photos, music and other creative contributions on social media and around grounds. It was echoed by the painting of Beta Bridge and the hundreds of messages and small drawings that I encourage you to see in person after this session._ 

_At the Memorial Service, you may have noticed halftone portraits of Devin, Lavel and D’Sean inspired by Kehinde Wiley’s portrait of President Barack Obama and Eto Otitigbe’s rendering of Isabella Gibbon’s eyes on the back of the Memorial to Enslaved Laborers. These beautiful structures were created to provide a place of memorial on Arts Grounds and to display flowers at the memorial service. I hope that this contribution and other designs students are currently working on in the School of Architecture can be considered as we conceive of ideas for a memorial in the future._ 

_The last space I hope to bring us into is a glimpse of the future. I, nor any of us in this room can predict exactly what that may look like, yet, we can lean into some of the lessons we are learning at this time to plan for it. What I can sense about the next semester and possibly the next 10 years is that ‘normal’ cannot be a descriptor we use. The concept of ‘returning to normal’ is concerning to myself and many of the students I have spoken to in the past several weeks because there is a concern that we may go on without recognition of this tragedy and how it fundamentally changes our Grounds. All of the spaces I gave glimpses into are now changed as a result of the night of November 13th—we cannot view these spaces or the people who occupy them as unchanged._

_Last night Professor O’Shaughnessy suggested we not replicate the past but continue to innovate. We might do so by considering the imaginative and empathic ways we have already started to commemorate this event and the losses of Devin, Lavel and D’Sean—whether they be students shifting their architectural studio work to conceive of what a memorial could look like on Arts Grounds, partnerships between student organizations that cater to student athletes and those that encompass students without unique athletic prowess, or continuing to encourage the collaboration and connections between this University and other Universities in the Commonwealth, especially Virginia Tech and UVA-Wise which has been a great support to our students, administrators and overall community in this time._

_We might do so by taking the suggestion Blake D. Morant made in his November 30th article “The Conundrum of Gun Violence: The University of Virginia’s Inevitable Triumph Over Tragedy'' and put our many great resources and mission to work by creating interdisciplinary study of gun violence’s effect on places of education at all levels. This ought not be done to set ourselves apart as leaders of this study or to gain any advantage as the title of the article might suggest, rather this is a venture that could allow us to continue the mission we are founded upon: contributing to the public knowledge base to support the development of an educated and engaged populous. I will take this one step further by echoing my peers in adding a study into safety and security practices as a key study in this overall study. Mr. Morant illustrates that we have done just this after the events of August 11th and 12th._

_We might do so by learning into the spirit of the dozens of individuals who engaged in unexpected acts of kindness in the weeks following the tragedy. We should this unexpected act of malice into an opportunity to practice unexpected acts of kindness and healing in our community._ 

_And lastly, we might continue to allow this tragedy to inform our future by continuing a seemingly simple act that we have relied upon more than I have ever witnessed in my time here: listening. Listening to our students, especially those uniquely impacted by the loss of Devin, Lavel and D’Sean—Black students, student-athletes and students on Arts Grounds. Listening to our faculty and staff who are also in great need having lost students they taught, mentored, and worked with daily._

**Remarks by the Faculty Senate Chair**

Ms. Tish Jennings made the following remarks:

_First, on behalf of the Faculty Senate, I wish to thank President Ryan, Provost Baucom and the entire administration for their efforts supporting our community in the wake of the recent tragedies. The faculty is committed to supporting our students through the current crisis. They have worked tirelessly to modify their courses, assignments, and expectations to help students successfully complete this semester. This has involved a great deal of work we have had to do while they too have been experiencing the effects of this community trauma. The Faculty Senate is working to learn more about what our faculty needs to recover and how best to support them, along with our staff and students._

_This Monday, voting closed on five amendments to our bylaws, which were all passed. Turnout was high with 90% of the faculty senate voting._

_The first changed the minimum number of senators per school to two. this will not affect the allocation of senators from any other school. Senators are allocated to schools and the college by a formula accounting for the number of full-time students and faculty. Policy BOV-006 requires that our Academic Affairs Committee have a representative from each school and the college, for schools that have only one senator, they must serve on this committee. This does not allow for any other school representation on any other committee. It also causes complications when the lone senator from a school cannot be present at a senate meeting, and there is no other person from said school to give a proxy vote to or to represent that school. Batten, Data Science, and Continuing & Professional Studies will now have two senators instead of just one._

_For 64 (83.12%)_

_Against 13 (16.88%)_

_Abstain 0_

_Bylaw Amendment 2: Change in Senate Chair Seat Surrendering Proposed change: That the newly elected senate chair no longer give up his/her seat._

_For 69 (89.61%)_

_Against 7 (9.09%)_

_Abstain 1 (1.30%)_

_Bylaw Amendment 3: Change in Proxies Proposed change: That the senate allow for both general and special proxies._

_For 61 (79.22%)_

_Against 15 (19.48%)_

_Abstain 1 (1.30%)_

_Bylaw Amendment 4: Change in Start Date of Senate Terms Proposed change: That a senator’s term will begin on July 1st._

_For 73 (94.81%)_

_Against 3 (3.90%)_

_Abstain 1 (1.30%)_

_Bylaw Amendment 5: Change in Election of Board of Visitors Representative Proposed change: That the senate elect a slate of three proposed representatives, and the Board of Visitors will choose the specific individual from those three to serve as the faculty representative. The date of the election is to change slightly as well. This was to align our bylaws with the BOV interpretation of VA statute 23.1-1300 and the request to us made by Rector Clement. Thanks to members Hardie and Payne for joining the November meeting of our Executive Committee to help senators understand the BOV perspective and to answer questions._

_For 56 (72.73%)_

_Against 19 (24.68%)_

_Abstain 2 (2.60%)_

_New text reads:_

_7\. Organization of the Faculty Senate_

_E.v. The Faculty Representative to the Board of Visitors will be elected annually for a term of one year.  Nominations will be made in December. A Faculty Representative and two alternates will be presented to the Board of Visitors based on an election to be completed by February 15. For the election, the nominating committee will solicit candidates. The current chair will automatically be included as a candidate in the election, if they are willing to serve. If the chair is willing to serve, the minimum number of additional candidates for the election is two. If the chair cannot serve, the nominating committee must solicit at least three nominations. Nominees may be chosen from current members of the Faculty Senate or from the body of faculty eligible to serve on Faculty Senate._

_Senators will vote for their preferred candidates by rank choice indicating preferences in sequence (e.g., first, second, third, etc.). They do not need to rank every candidate. The individual who receives the most first-choice votes will be presented to the BOV as the Faculty Representative, assuming they were ranked first by at least 50% of the voting senators. If there is no majority candidate, the Faculty Representative will be determined by taking the second choice vote of every senator who did not vote for one of the top two candidates as their first choice and adding that to the tally. The Faculty Representative must be ranked by a majority of voting senators._

_Of the remaining candidates, the two candidates who received the highest number of first- and second-choice votes will be presented as the two alternates, assuming they were ranked by a majority of voting senators. If only two candidates were ranked by a majority of voting senators, the senate will initially present a representative and one alternate. The remaining seat will be filled by a runoff using traditional single-choice voting, and the winner of that election will be the second alternate. For the runoff, all remaining candidates will be on the ballot and additional candidates may be nominated._

_Finally, the Academic Affairs Committee approved a proposal from the School of Data Science to add a Bachelor’s of Science in Data Science. This proposal will be voted on by the full faculty senate at our next regular meeting next Tuesday._
