The Board (a) covenants to fix, revise, charge and collect rates, fees, and charges for or in connection with the use, occupation and services of the Project and, if applicable, the System and (b) pledges such rates, fees and charges remaining after payment of the expenses of operating the Project or, if applicable, the System ("Net Revenues") to the payment of the principal of premium, if any, and interest on the Project Bonds.

Any Net Revenues pledged herein in excess of the Required Payments may be used by the Institution for any other lawful purpose. Section 3. It is hereby found, determined and declared that, based upon responsible engineering and economic estimates and advice of appropriate officials of the Institution, as shown in the Financial Feasibility Study attached hereto as Exhibit A, the anticipated Net Revenues pledged herein will be sufficient to make the Required Payments so long as the aggregate amount of net debt service on the Project Bonds actually payable in any bond year does not exceed the amounts assumed in the Financial Feasibility Study. Section 4. The Board covenants that the Institution will furnish the Treasury Board its general purpose financial statements, within 30 days of their issuance and receipt, audited by a firm of certified public accountants or the Auditor of Public Accounts, which shall include a schedule of revenues and expenditures for auxiliary enterprise systems.

Section 5. The Board covenants that so long as any of the Bonds are outstanding, the Institution will pay to the State Treasurer, not less than 30 days before each interest or principal payment date, the amount certified by the State Treasurer to be due and payable on such date as principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Project Bonds. Section 6. The Board covenants that the Institution will pay from time to time its proportionate share of all expenses incurred in connection with the sale and issuance of any series of bonds that includes Project Bonds (the "Bonds") and all expenses thereafter incurred in connection with the Bonds, including without limitation the expense of calculating any rebate to the United State of the earnings derived from the investment of gross proceeds of the Bonds, all as certified by the State Treasurer to the Institution. Section 7. The Board covenants that the Institution will not take or omit to take any action the taking or omission of which will cause the Bonds to be "arbitrage bonds" within the meaning of Section 148 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, including regulations issued pursuant thereto (the "Code"), or otherwise cause interest on the Bonds to be includable in the gross income of the owners thereof for federal income tax purposes under existing laws. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Institution will pay from time to time its proportional share of any rebate to the United States of the earnings derived from the investment of the gross proceeds of the Bonds. Section 8. The Board covenants that the Institution will proceed with the due diligence to undertake and complete the Project and that the Institution will spend all of the available proceeds derived from the sale of the Project Bonds for costs associated with the Project and appropriated for the Project by the General Assembly. Section 9. The Board covenants that the Institution will not permit the proceeds of the Project Bonds to be used in any manner that would result in (a) 5% or more of such proceeds being used in a trade or business carried on by any person other than a governmental unit, as provided in Section 141(b) of the Code, (b) 5% or more of such proceeds being used with respect to any output facility within the meaning of Section 141(b)(4) of the Code, or (c) 5% or more of such proceeds being used directly or indirectly to make or finance loans to any persons other than a governmental unit, as provided in Section 141(c) of the Code. The Institution need not comply with such covenants if the Institution obtains the written approval of the State Treasurer and an opinion of nationally recognized bond counsel acceptable to the Treasury Board that such covenants need not be complied with to prevent the interest on the Bonds from being includable in the gross income of the owners thereof for federal income tax purposes. Section 10. The Board covenants that for so long as any of the Bonds are outstanding the Institution will not enter into any operating lease, management contract or similar agreement with any person or entity, other than a state or local governmental unit, for all or any portion of the Project without first obtaining the written approval of the State Treasurer and an opinion of nationally recognized bond counsel acceptable to the Treasury Board that entering into such agreement will not cause the interest on the Bonds to be included in the gross income of the owners thereof for federal income tax purposes. Section 11. The Board covenants that for so long as any of the Bonds are outstanding, the Institution will not sell or dispose of all or any part of the Project without first obtaining the written approval of the State Treasurer and an opinion of nationally recognized bond counsel acceptable to the Treasury Board that such sale or disposition will not cause interest on the Bonds to be included in the gross income of the owners thereof for federal income tax purposes. Section 12. The officers of the Institution are authorized and directed to execute and deliver all certificates and instruments and to take all such further action as may be considered necessary or desirable in connection with the sale and issuance of the Bonds. Section 13. The Board acknowledges that the Treasury Board will rely on the representations and covenants set forth herein in issuing the Bonds, that such covenants are critical to the security for the Bonds and the exclusion of the interest on the Bonds from the gross income of the owners thereof for federal income tax purposes, that the Board will not repeal, revoke, rescind or amend any of such covenants without first obtaining the written approval of the Treasury Board, and that such covenants will be binding upon the Board so long as any of the Bonds are outstanding.
