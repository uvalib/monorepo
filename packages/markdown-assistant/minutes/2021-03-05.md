**Discussion with University Leadership**

**High-Level Priorities for the Semester Ahead**

President Ryan presented the priorities that he established last summer. He reviewed the very difficult events of the last year which included the COVID crisis, protests over George Floyd and other killings, the presidential election, and the Capitol insurrection. He said students, faculty, and staff continued to work to care for one another and pursue the missions of teaching, research, and medical care throughout. The year was a success in that regard.

Silver linings in the midst of the pandemic include University leadership (president, executive vice presidents, vice presidents, vice provosts, and deans) getting to know each other quite well quickly. He said it feels as though the leadership has been working together for years and years. He also remarked on the talent and dedication among the entire team in UVA Health.

He complimented the determination and resilience and compassion of students, faculty, and staff, who have looked out and cared for one another and the broader community. The University community has come to appreciate even more how intertwined UVA is with the city of Charlottesville. He also expressed appreciation for the dedication and leadership of the Board of Visitors on several fronts. President Ryan recognized and thanked Rector Murray and Vice Rector Clement in particular. He asked for a brief pause to mark the one-year anniversary of COVID-19 with an expression of gratitude.

**Manage Response to COVID-19**

Work to ensure safe continuation of our core mission

President Ryan spoke about the need to increase restrictions when coronavirus cases spiked in mid-February. With these in place, the cases began dropping and the measures were eased after 10 days. He said if the trends continue, they will relax restrictions further but continue to monitor. He said the students have been overwhelmingly doing their best to follow the health and safety protocols despite how fatigued everyone is with COVID.

Assess and address fiscal and budgetary impact

President Ryan pointed out that the University has experienced $143M in COVID-related expenses and lost revenue over the last two fiscal years. These have been offset by budget cuts, holding down discretionary spending, a hiring freeze, deferring internal debt, capturing one time savings, targeted philanthropy, and federal funds for COVID relief. They hope to receive more funding in the third round of COVID relief under consideration in Congress.

Identify innovations to continue forward

There have been substantial beneficial innovations in work and teaching in the last year and finding ways to continue them is important. The executive vice presidents have been asked to collect information from people across Grounds on innovations that they believe ought to continue, gaps the pandemic exposed, and beneficial ways of working together that ought to continue.

Graduation

President Ryan spoke about current plans for Final Exercises. He said events for the Class of 2021 will not be able to be held in the traditional way. The state has classified graduations as gatherings, and a 25-person limit applies. Regardless of the state restrictions on gatherings or travel, it would not be responsible to invite thousands of guests to Charlottesville for a large event. He said they are surveying current students to get a sense of whether they would prefer to hold modified events this spring or postpone to a future date. No matter what the decision is, degrees will be conferred and there will be a celebratory virtual event for students, friends, and families this May.

For the Class of 2020, plans are underway for an early reunion-type event in the summer of 2022.

**Advance Key Initiatives of 2030 Strategic Plan**

Emmet-Ivy Corridor (Landscape, School of Data Science, Hotel/Conference Center, Democracy Institute)

Over the past nine months, the Board has reviewed and approved architectural designs for both the School of Data Science and the Hotel and Conference Center, as well as their surrounding landscape. Through a competitive proposal process for each project, contracts are in place with Gilbane for construction of both the School of Data Science and the Hotel and Conference Center. Clearing on the site will begin this spring for the construction of streetscape improvements and significant utility infrastructure, followed by the demolition of the Dynamics building in the summer. Completion of the School of Data Science remains on track for 2023, and the Hotel and Conference Center in 2024.

President Ryan said they are hoping to build a new home for the Institute of Democracy, which will be a way to synthesize and accelerate multiple initiatives across Grounds and give them a home at the Emmet-Ivy Corridor. Given the cross-school nature of the work around Democracy, locating the Institute of Democracy at Emmet-Ivy is a perfect way to bridge North and Main Grounds.

Interdisciplinary Research Space and Research Priorities

Two working groups have been convened, one to focus on an interdisciplinary biomedical sciences building and the other on a building adjacent to the School of Data Science focused on interdisciplinary research and learning, with strong interactions between the School of Data Science and the social sciences, engineering, and medicine.

Northern Virginia Strategy

President Ryan said UVA is moving toward a larger presence in northern Virginia with the launch of a new unit, University of Virginia Northern Virginia, that will serve as a conduit and facilitator of a range of new programs for units across Grounds. As return-to-work conditions improve, there will be a staff and media campaign.

Second year housing

Because of vacancies in on-Grounds housing that may continue into the fall, they are taking both a short-term and a slightly longer-term approach to thinking about second-year housing. In the short-term, they will be able to offer housing to transfer students, which will enable them to become part of the UVA community much more easily. Since many of the transfer students are second years, they will have the added advantage of being able to get to know their classmates while also helping the administration understand the kinds of programs that second-year students (whether transfers or not) will find interesting and of benefit.

Over the longer-term, leadership needs some time to think more strategically about the second-year housing experience within the current housing stock, including looking at models specifically designed for the second-year experience. They are currently piloting a program called Connect2Grounds, which will enable second-year students to live together with lower RA ratios and specialized programming. They hope to learn from that model, as well as from students and parents themselves.

With the new Vice President and Chief Student Affairs Officer arriving this summer, it is an optimal time to shift the current housing stock to many more second-year students, with programming and opportunities tailored to them, with an eye to the future of potentially increasing housing stock.

Student Health and Wellness (including completing construction, opening the building, and launching new programming)

Plans are to complete construction on the Student Health and Wellness building in June and begin moving teams in. As a result of lessons learned from the pandemic, modifications to the plans have been made such as additional negative pressure rooms, enhancements to allow for better isolation of an entire medical pod, and touchless features throughout the building. Even though there are increased telehealth and telemedicine capabilities, the hope is that the building will be a safe physical space that fosters community during the day and after hours.

Good Neighbor initiatives (including center for community partnerships, affordable housing)

The Center for Community Partnerships opened, which is UVA’s front door for the community. It is staffed by the Equity Center along with members of the Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, Academic Outreach, and Community Partnerships at UVA Health. Four community-focused working groups, composed of community leaders and UVA representatives, that were first launched last March — but then had to delay immediately due to COVID — have been re-launched.

The Local Economy working group is looking at UVA’s procurement needs and how they can be matched with local and minority-owned businesses.

The Pipelines and Pathways working group is looking for ways to grow UVA’s employment pipeline, with the goal of improving access for underrepresented groups and ensuring that current workers have opportunities for promotion and growth.

The Early Childhood Education working group is looking for ways to increase access to affordable, high-quality educational experiences for children up to age five, with an emphasis on training and supporting local early childhood educators.

Finally, the Affordable Housing Advisory Group, which includes Jim Murray and Lou Haddad, began meeting last month. They will make recommendations related to community engagement, target population, and a development strategy to support the development of 1,000 to 1,500 affordable housing units over the next 10 years. Planning for a comprehensive community engagement effort is underway, which will prioritize inclusion, education, partnership, and listening. A fifth working group, focused on public health, is in process.

**Advance the Honor the Future Campaign**

Continue to cultivate support despite pandemic and economic uncertainty

President Ryan said since early December UVA has had a successful stretch, thanks to Mark Luellen and his team. To date, alumni, parents, and friends have generously committed over $3.35B toward the Honor the Future Campaign. To put this in perspective, it is about 67% of the overall $5B goal and an increase of $100M since the December meeting.

Focus on key priorities: scholarships, university professorships, support for students interested in public service, interdisciplinary research space, and the Democracy Institute

Over $464M in total impact for graduate and undergraduate scholarships is a result of the Bicentennial Scholars Fund. This number is up over $22M since the December meeting. Since launching the Bicentennial Professorship Fund, $350M has been committed to faculty support in outright philanthropy and matching funds.

**Identify Next Round of Strategic Investment Fund (SIF) Investments**

Matching funds for scholarships and faculty chairs

John Griffin established the Blue Ridge Scholars Program in 2014 to support undergraduate students with exceptional academic promise and significant financial need. The University Achievement Awards are designed for Virginia students who have a history of overcoming adversity, are first-generation college students, members of an under-represented minority or ethnic group, come from a low or moderate-income family or have been raised in a single-parent household. For these programs, $10M has been raised. The Bicentennial Professorship matching initiative launched and raised $350M in new funds for professorships.

The Board is aware of the Carter Woodson Institute investment and will establish a new professorship at this meeting, funded by SIF monies. President Ryan spoke about several other initiatives that are being launched in the STEM fields, supporting the Center for Teaching Excellence, and for support of northern Virginia activities.

**Advance Key Initiatives Related to Diversity, Equity, And Inclusion**

Create and charge Naming and Memorials Committee

President Ryan spoke of the new Naming and Memorials Committee, chaired by University Professor Michael Suarez, which has begun work.

Faculty, staff, and student diversity efforts

A number of efforts around faculty, staff, and student diversity, including a $5M grant that will support 30 post docs and three faculty members working on issues related to racial equity, has begun. Dean Baucom has dedicated tenure track positions to scholars working on racial equity across a wide range of disciplines. Funding for the Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion has increased, and, as mentioned earlier, matching funds for the Blue Ridge Scholars and University Achievement Awards have been established.

Support of Carter Woodson Institute

In addition to the funding mentioned above, a Mellon Foundation grant is supporting programming focused on race and place, and Dean Baucom and others have been working on the programming. They plan to produce short films that talk about the history of race at UVA, in Charlottesville, and in Central Virginia, that could be used in several different contexts.

Democracy Dialogues had its first event on January 6. The idea is to bring experts who come at democracy from different perspectives and to engage them in collegial conversation.

Colleagues in the President’s Office have also been working with student groups on Grounds to foster conversations across various lines of difference and ask them how UVA can help them with their work.

**Help Recruit and Onboard Key New Leaders**

President Ryan gave a brief update on key searches and recent hires, including the Vice Provost for Enrollment Steven Farmer.

**Assist UVA Health**

The Novant purchase was mentioned as well as UVA Health’s strategic planning process.

**Assist UVA Wise in strategic planning**

The President said he and his team have been helping both Chancellor Henry and Provost Tricia Folds Bennett on their strategic planning process.

**Remarks/Reports**

**Remarks by the Rector**

Rector Murray spoke about the election of a vice rector at the June meeting. He will step down as rector and Whit Clement will assume the rectorship on July 1. He asked those who were interested in serving as vice rector to let him know by April 15. He said there was no official nomination process. He reminded Visitors that the rectorship is very time-consuming.

Mr. Murray then recognized recent achievements. During the Buildings and Grounds Committee meeting, Mr. Hardie spoke about Alice Raucher’s prestigious election to the American Institute of Architects’ College of Fellows. Mr. Murray recognized Dr. Britt who was recently recognized by the Norfolk community as part of Black History month. Physicians he has mentored have formed the L.D. Britt Society, promoting excellence in health care. There is also a scholarship in his name at EVMS.

Mr. Murray recognized Dr. Cameron Webb who was recently named White House Senior Policy Advisor for COVID-19. Other recognition: researchers in neuroscience discovered that fluvoxemine, usually used to treat depression, may be effective in preventing serious complications for COVID-19 patients. _Newsweek_ named the medical center to its best maternity hospitals 2021 list. Drs. Taison Bell and Andy Wolf were named as outstanding faculty for 2021 by SCHEV.

He called Visitors’ attention to the gifts and grants report in the materials. He said many Board members have stepped up at an important time in the university’s history: Robert and Molly Hardie’s support for the athletics precinct and a Darden fellowship housed at the Jefferson Scholars Foundation, and Barbara Fried’s support of Madison House. He said many Board members have also contributed to the emergency fund for students.

Rector Murray recognized Vice President for Student Affairs Patricia Lampkin and her 40 plus years of exemplary service to UVA. He said she has been a part of the fabric of this place. She planned to retire last summer but agreed to stay on to help with the COVID response in the fall. She insisted on setting March 1 as her retirement date.

Robert Hardie was called upon to read a resolution for Pat Lampkin. He said it was both his pleasure and an honor to read the resolution. Upon motion, the following resolution was approved:

**COMMENDING RESOLUTION FOR PATRICIA M. LAMPKIN**

WHEREAS, a native of Decatur, Illinois, Patricia M. Lampkin took a master’s degree in higher education from the University of Vermont in 1979, and a doctorate in education from the University of Virginia in 1986; and

WHEREAS, Ms. Lampkin began her career at the University in 1979 in Residence Life. She was promoted to lead the division in 1987 as associate dean of students; and

WHEREAS, Ms. Lampkin also served as the compliance officer for the Americans with Disabilities Act from 1991 to 2000; and

WHEREAS, prior to being named Vice President for Student Affairs and Chief Student Affairs Officer in 2002, she served as associate vice president for six years and interim vice president for 15 months; and

WHEREAS, while working in Student Affairs, Ms. Lampkin also taught an undergraduate seminar in honor and ethics and a graduate course in the organization and operation of student affairs programs, in the Education School’s Center for the Study of Higher Education, and co-authored a book entitled _Mountains and Passes; Traversing the Landscape of Ethics and Student Affairs Administration;_ and

WHEREAS, she has received many honors and awards over her career, including the highest honor bestowed by the University upon faculty, the Thomas Jefferson Award for excellence in service; and

WHEREAS, over the past 40 plus years, Ms. Lampkin has mentored and guided countless numbers of students and shaped the extraordinary student experience (often called the University’s “special sauce”) in myriad ways, including launching the Meriwether Lewis Institute for Citizen Leadership in 2014, revamping new student orientation programming, and developing support networks and places to gather for underrepresented students; and

WHEREAS, Ms. Lampkin helped guide the University through difficult and tumultuous times as well as good times, always with a steady hand and a resilient spirit, and always with the best interests of students at heart. Pat herself described her work as “never dull”; and

WHEREAS, Pat and her husband, Wayne Cozart, have in many ways served as the heart and soul of the University. They will be missed on the Lawn, where they extended hospitality—a meal, a shoulder, even a place to sleep, to countless students, faculty, staff, alumni, and friends; in the classroom and the Board room; and in the meetings of the many student organizations they advised, cajoled, and supported; and

WHEREAS, their enduring impact on generations of students will be cherished and remembered for many years to come; and

WHEREAS, Ms. Lampkin retired from the University on March 1, 2021;

\_ \_ \_

Mr. Murray informed the Board that tuition and fee decisions will be postponed until April 13. The Governor and the General Assembly have an opportunity to help the public university students and should be given time to act. He applauded the hundreds of students who have written the Board encouraging them to be frugal. He thanked members of the Board and the administration who spent hours trying to think of ways and analyzing alternatives to keep tuition low in the midst of the pandemic.

**Remarks by the Student Representative**

Student representative Mazzen Shalaby spoke at his final regular meeting of the Board of Visitors. He covered a number of issues.

Mr. Shalaby asked for a moment of silence for a first-year student who passed, Alex Brazukas. He expressed sadness for his family and friends.

Mr. Shalaby said the year has been frustrating because he was not able to accomplish all that he had planned and had to deal instead with the latest emergency. The spike in COVID-19 cases in February was scary but resulted from difficult circumstances and innocent lapses and thousands of students have continued to abide by the guidelines. He said there is a great deal of anger and frustration among students and because they can’t be angry at a virus they are lashing out at others. Many were angry at the fraternities and he suggested the University’s relationship with fraternities should be re-examined.

On a positive note, the University did what was necessary to control the virus and there were just two new cases among students the day before the meeting, and importantly the spike among students did not affect the community. He said many people have made tireless efforts over the past year and should be recognized including workers, the Student Affairs team, and others.

Mr. Shalaby spoke about the importance of affordability and keeping tuition low. He said access is more than just enrollment, it is providing financial assistance such that students can focus on extracurricular activities, clubs, and their studies.

He said UVA should not rush to return to the way it was before the pandemic. Students will need time to get over the financial and emotional burdens of the last year. Mental health is a concern and UVA should focus on helping those who need it but also general wellness.

He spoke about the First Amendment issues at the University. Offensive speech should be fought with more speech and not suppression of speech, both inside and outside of the classroom. Civil discourse should be re-emphasized.

Diversity, equity, and inclusion is another recurring theme this year. UVA must continue working to attract and retain a diverse faculty and student body, and reckon with UVA’s past.

Mr. Shalaby said student self-governance has suffered in recent years. He commended the student leaders who have persevered, and said one issue is the conflicts among groups, talking past each other instead of to one another. He said, “If we listen more than we talk and put each other in one another’s shoes, the sky is the limit.” He said he could have done better in reaching out to groups this year.

Mr. Shalaby ended his remarks by thanking Board members for contributing to the student mutual aid fund. In one week $20,000 were donated. He said he hoped his legacy as student representative is that he improved the community he loves.

**Action Item: Commending Resolution for Mazzen S. Shalaby**

Mr. Murray spoke briefly about Mazzen Shalaby’s time on the Board as the student representative. Dr. Babur Lateef read the resolution and on motion, the following was approved by unanimous voice vote:

**COMMENDING RESOLUTION FOR MAZZEN S. SHALABY**

WHEREAS, Mazzen S. Shalaby of Fredericksburg, Virginia, took an undergraduate degree from the University in 2020 with a major in Political Philosophy, Policy, and Law, and a minor in Economics, and returned to UVA for the 2020-2021 academic year to complete a M.P.P. degree in the Batten School; and

WHEREAS, Mr. Shalaby served as president of the Muslim Students Association and the Virginia Interfaith Coalition in his time at UVA, and served two years on the executive board of the Charlottesville Debate League; and

WHEREAS, Mr. Shalaby is a Jefferson and Echols Scholar, a member of the Raven Society, and resided on the Lawn; and

WHEREAS, in an extraordinary year under difficult circumstances, as student representative to the Board Mr. Shalaby has kept well informed on student sentiment and has conveyed those views to members of the Board in a constructive way, often offering ideas about how issues may be addressed or resolved; and

WHEREAS, Mr. Shalaby’s views are often sought by members of the Board on a variety of matters that go beyond student issues;

RESOLVED, the Board of Visitors commends Mazzen S. Shalaby for his exemplary service to the Board and the University, values his friendship and respects him as a colleague, and wishes him success and happiness in all of his future endeavors.

**Remarks by the Faculty Representative**

Mr. Hockensmith briefed the Board on the Faculty Senate actions that have taken place this year. He said they have made significant progress in terms of the way faculty behave and work during the pandemic. He said faculty senators have been extremely agreeable in the sense that they have better attendance and participation virtually than they did when they met in person.

In September, the Faculty Senate approved three resolutions dealing with the death of George Floyd and supported the Racial Equity Task Force report and the change of name of the School of Education. They talked about working groups for the Collaborative on Academic Careers in Higher Education (COACHE) survey and also the impact of COVID on faculty productivity. The COACHE survey is a climate survey of faculty.

Mr. Hockensmith said the Faculty Senate has been hoping to have a larger role in governance at the University. He thanked President Ryan and Provost Magill who have worked to bring faculty senators in for a number of committees this year.

He reported on a committee looking at implementing the Racial Equity Task Force recommendations and legacy admission policies. The next report comes from the committee next week.

He spoke briefly about the process within the Faculty Senate for recommending names to the Board of Visitors for the faculty representative position. They have struggled with this for several years and ultimately brought only one name forward.

In November, the Faculty Senate convened solely for the purpose of discussing spring term, COVID, examinations, grading, and other matters. In January, they met with the executive leadership: Provost Magill, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer J.J. Davis, and President Ryan.

In February, the Faculty Senate approved a B.A. in Computer Science and a Ph.D. in Data Science and heard about the COACHE survey.

Mr. Hockensmith said he thinks the difference between the Faculty Senate now and the Faculty Senate that the Board has dealt with in the past is that the Faculty Senate is able to have good discussions and come to a consensus a little bit easier now. Part of that is communication; they have developed ways to reach out to faculty beyond members of the Faculty Senate.

**Gift Announcement – President Ryan**

President Ryan said he had one more item which he was saving until the end to end on a high note. Scholarships are a high priority, and they are a high priority of the new dean of the McIntire School of Commerce. He recognized the recent gift made by Board member John Griffin of $5M, matched one to one from the bicentennial fund, to create a scholarship endowment at McIntire and named in honor of his mother Alice Griffin. President Ryan said it will impact the lives of students for generations beginning this fall. He then asked John Griffin to share with his fellow Board members what inspired him to make this gift and to explain to the Board the creativity behind this approach which will help students at McIntire.

Mr. Griffin said he was inspired by two people: Dean Jenkins who has had a terrific start and had a very innovative idea to combine the fundraising needs: scholarships, and support of the new McIntire building. He said the gift is to encourage that and to encourage creative thinking. The second inspiration is his late mother, Alice Griffin, who taught English in the Bronx for 20 years. She was his inspiration to teach. He said he was very happy to have attended the University of Virginia and the McIntire School of Commerce.
