At a called meeting of the Board of Visitors held at the University of Virginia on above date, at 2:30 p.m., in the President's office,

Present: The Rector, and Visitors Buchanan, Craddock, Hunton, White, Harmon, Moore, and President Alderman,

The Board was called to order, and the following resolutions adopted -

Resolved. That whereas it is reported by the Finance Committee of this Board that Messrs Davenport & Co. of Richmond, Virginia, have offered par and accrued interest for the $76,500 of the 5 per cent mortgage bonds of the University of May 1st, 1896, which are held by or for the Astronomical Department of the University, in the name of the "Leander McCormick Observatory Fund";

It is thereupon ordered that the Finance Committee be directed to make sale of the said $76,500. of 5% bonds of the University to the said Davenport & Co., in accordance with their said offer; and the Rector is hereby directed to transfer the same to the said Davenport & Co. upon the order of the Finance Committee.

Resolved: That the Finance Committee be authorized to invest the proceeds of sale of the $76,500 of 5% mortgage bonds of the University of May 1st, 1896 heretofore authorized to be sold to Davenport & Co. of Richmond, Va. and report their action to the next meeting of this Board.

Mr. Moon, attorney for the Board, having submitted the form of a mortgage to secure the issue of bonds authorized by the Board, by a resolution adopted June 11th, 1906, the same was approved, and together with bonds and coupons therein described, is hereby directed to be executed and delivered in the manner and form prescribed by the said resolution of June 11th, 1906, and that the said form of mortgage shall be reordered as a part of the minutes of the meeting, which is accordingly done in the following words and figures, viz:

Deed of Trust. University of Virginia to Virginia Trust Company.

This indenture made, this first day of November in the year One Thousand Nine Hundred and Six, (1906) between the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, a public corporation created and existing under the laws of Virginia, and controlled by the General Assembly of said State, which is hereinafter styled and referred to as the "Rector and Visitors," party of the first part; the Virginia Trust Company, a corporation likewise chartered and existing under the laws of said State, and hereinafter styled and referred to as the "Trust Company," party of the second part; and all persons at any time holding the bonds hereinafter secured, or any of them, parties of the third part.

Whereas, the General Assembly of Virginia at its session of 1895-'6 passed an act, entitled:

"An act to enable the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia to repair the loss sustained by that institution by the fire of October 27th, 1895" which act was approved January 23rd, 1896, and provided for the issue of bonds by the said Rector and Visitors to the amount of $200,000. with interest at not exceeding six per centum payable in forty and redeemable in ten years from their date, and secured by a deed of trust upon the property of the said University. Said act further provided that said bonds were to be exempt from taxation in any manner by the State or by any county, city, town or other corporation exercising powers of taxation under authority of the State, and by said act the sum of ten thousand dollars per annum was appropriated to pay the interest on said bonds and establish a sinking fund for the redemption of the principal thereof; and under the said act bonds to the amount of $200,000 were issued as of May 1st, 1896, and secured by deed of trust on the property of the University to the said Trust Company as trustee, bearing the same date and recorded in the County Clerk's Office of Albemarle County.

And whereas the said General Assembly of Virginia at its regular session of 1906 passed an act entitled "An Act to authorize the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia to issue new bonds, secured by deed of trust, for the purpose of retiring certain bonds now outstanding and secured in like manner," which was approved March 10, 1906, and is in words and figures as follows, to-wit:

"Whereas under and by virtue of an act of the General Assembly of Virginia, entitled, "an act to enable the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia to repair the loss sustained by that institution by the fire of October twenty-seventh, eighteen hundred and ninety-five," approved January (23rd), twenty-third, eighteen hundred and ninety-six, and said-Rector and Visitors issued bonds for the purposes named in said act to the amount of two hundred thousand dollars, which matured in forty years, and were nontaxable and bore interest at the rate of five per centum per annum, and were secured by a deed of trust upon the property, real and personal, of said University, executed to the Virginia Trust Company as trustee, and bearing date on the first of May, eighteen hundred and ninety six, which deed of trust was duly recorded in the Clerk's office of the County court of Albemarle County, and

"Whereas by the terms of said act, the sum of ten thousand dollars per annum was appropriated to meet the interest upon said bonds and provide a sinking fund for the payment of the principal thereof, which said sum is inadequate for both of these purposes, but would be sufficient if said bonds carried a lower rate of interest; and

"Whereas according to the terms of the said bonds and deed of trust, the said Rector and Visitors have a right to call in and pay off the same after ten years from the date thereof, and it is deemed advisable to give to the said Rector and Visitors authority to negotiate a new loan in place thereof, bearing a lower rate of interest and secured by a new deed of trust, but without interfering with the purpose of the General Assembly as declared in said act of appropriating the annual amount as aforesaid on account of the interest and sinking fund; therefore,

"1. Be it enacted by the General Assembly of Virginia, That the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia be, and they are hereby, authorized, at any meeting at which a majority of said Visitors shall be present, to issue and authorize the issue of bonds to an amount not exceeding two hundred thousand dollars, either registered or with coupons for interest, or in part of one class and in part of the other, and convertible from one class into the other at the pleasure of the holder in sums of one hundred dollars each, or any multiple thereof, and bearing interest at the rate of four per centum per annum, which said bonds or their proceeds, shall be used to retire the bonds of the University now outstanding under the act aforesaid, and may be exchanged, dollar for dollar, for the bonds now outstanding, or, may be sold at not less than par value, and the proceeds used in paying off said bonds now outstanding.

"2. For the purpose of securing payment of the said bonds, the said Rector and Visitors are hereby authorized to convey, by deed of trust, any or all the property belonging to, or held by the said University; and the said bonds shall be payable, as specified in the said act of January twenty-third, eighteen hundred and ninety-six, and shall be subject to all the immunities and exemptions specified in said act with respect to the bonds issued thereunder.

"3. In case, however, the holders of the said bonds now outstanding are willing to accept interest at the rate of four per centum per annum thereon, the said Rector and Visitors may in their discretion, cause such bonds, with the coupons annexed, to be so stamped or marked as to show that they bear interest at the rate of four instead of five per centum per annum, in which case no new bonds will be issued."

And whereas at a meeting of the said Rector and Visitors held at the said University on the 11th day of June, 1906, at which eight out of the nine Visitors constituting the Board were present, the following resolution was adopted by the unanimous vote of all the members present.

"Resolved.-

"1. That this Board deems it expedient, in the exercise of the powers conferred upon it by an act of the General Assembly of Virginia, entitled, "An Act to authorize the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia to issue new bonds, secured by deed of trust, for the purpose of retiring certain bonds now outstanding and secured in like manner." Approved, March 10, 1906, to issue such new bonds to the amount of two hundred thousand dollars bearing interest at the rate of four per centum per annum, and secured by deed of trust as hereinafter set forth,

"2. That the bonds of this corporation, to the amount aforesaid, be accordingly so issued, of the denomination of Five Hundred dollars each, bearing date on the first of November, 1906, and carrying interest from date at the rate of four per centum per annum, the principal thereof to be payable forty years after date, but with the option to this corporation to redeem and pay the same, or any of them at any time after ten years from this date; the interest aforesaid to be payable on the first day of May, and the first day of November each year, but the same to cease from and after such time as the principal of the bonds respectively, upon which it accrues, shall be called in for payment; and that the proceeds of said bonds coming into the hands of this corporation shall be devoted exclusively to the purposes specified in said Act.

"3. That the said bonds, principal and interest, shall be secured by deed of trust duly executed with general warranty with this corporation to the Virginia Trust Company as trustee, conveying and assigning in trust to secure the principal and interest of said bonds, all the real estate of the corporation together with all buildings, betterments and improvements erected and to be erected thereon; and also certain of its personal property, to-wit its libraries, statuary and paintings, and all its equipments, appliances, furniture, apparatus, and other similar tangible chattel property used in the conduct of the business of the University, or in connection with the courses of instruction given at said institution, including all tangible personal property of this character and description, which may be hereafter acquired by this corporation; and also all the interest of this corporation in and all its claims to the estate or any part thereof of the late Arthur W. Austin of Milton, in the State of Massachusetts, by whom a certain legacy was bequeathed to this corporation.

"4. Said deed of trust shall be executed, acknowledged and delivered in the name of and for and on behalf of this corporation by its chief officer, the Rector; and attested by its secretary with its corporate seal affixed, and shall contain a provision giving to this corporation, the right from time to time to sell or exchange said articles of tangible chattel property and replace them with others of equal or greater value, which shall be subject to the said deed of trust; and also reserving to this corporation, the right in its own name to demand, sue for, receive, receipt for and collect; and also to commute, compromise and adjust all the said interest of this corporation in and all its claims to the said estate of the said Austin, without the intervention of said trustee company, provided that all amounts realized thereon shall remain in the hands of and be held by this corporation, subject to said deed of trust, except that this corporation may, until the right to foreclose, shall have accrued under said trust deed, use the current income therefrom for and about its current expenses. And said deed of trust shall further contain such other provisions as the said Rector may be advised are usual, apt and proper.

"5. And for the purpose of further securing said bonds, the said trust deed shall contain a covenant that the said buildings shall be kept insured in some one or more reputable fire insurance companies for the sum of One Hundred and Fifty Thousand Dollars, until such time as the aggregate amount of such bonds outstanding shall be reduced below said sum of $150,000.00, after which time an amount of insurance at least equal to all the bonds outstanding shall be sufficient. All such policies of insurance shall be drawn or assigned so that loss, if any, shall be payable to said Trust Company, for the protection of the holders of said bonds. And said deed of trust shall also further contain a covenant on the part of this corporation for the establishment, setting apart and maintenance of a sinking Fund of Two Thousand dollars per annum, out of appropriations made by the General Assembly of Virginia for that purpose, or out of the current revenues of the University, to meet and discharge the principal of said bonds.

"6. The said bonds shall be signed by the said Rector and attested by the Secretary, with the corporate seal affixed, and shall consist of a series of four hundred bonds for Five Hundred Dollars each, numbered consecutively from one to four hundred.

The form of said bond shall be as follows:

"The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, a public corporation created and existing under the laws of the State of Virginia, for value received, hereby acknowledges itself indebted and promises to pay to the bearer of this bond, or in case the same be registered, then to the registered owner thereof, forty years after the date hereof, at the office of the Virginia Trust Company at Richmond, Virginia, the sum of Five Hundred Dollars in the true and lawful money of the United States of America, with interest thereon at the rate of four per centum per annum, thereon from this date until paid, payable semi-annually on the first day of May and the first day of November in each year, at the said office of the said Trust Company, on the presentation and surrender of the proper coupons representing the same hereto attached.

"This bond is issued in pursuance of an Act of the General Assembly of Virginia approved March 10, 1906, entitled, "An Act to authorize the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia to issue new bonds, secured by deed of trust, for the purpose of retiring certain bonds now outstanding and secured in like manner," in which said act was stated that the bonds issued thereunder were to be non-taxable; and this bond is one of an issue of Two Hundred Thousand Dollars of said bonds, the principal and interest whereof is secured by a deed of trust of even date herewith upon all the real estate and certain personal property of the said Rector and Visitors to the Virginia Trust Company of Richmond, Virginia, as Trustee, to be found of record in the Clerk's office of the Circuit Court of Albemarle County.

"In case of default in the payment of the above interest for ninety days after any instalment of the same is due and has been demanded, the principal of this bond, shall, at the option of the holder thereof and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the said deed of trust, become forthwith due and payable.

"The said Rector and Visitors hereby reserve the right to pay the principal of this bond at any time after ten years from this date; and after this bond shall have been called in by the said Rector and Visitors in pursuance of this provision, and after notice of such call shall have been published once a week for four successive weeks in some newspaper published in the City of Charlottesville, Virginia, and for six days in a week for three successive weeks, in some newspaper published in the City of Richmond, Va., all the interest on this bond shall cease and determine and no further interest accrue thereon; and all coupons attached hereto and thereafter maturing shall be and become wholly void and of no effect; but the principal together with any interest theretofore accrued and represented pro tanto by the coupon next thereafter maturing, is to be paid upon the presentation and surrender of this bond and all the said coupons therafter maturing.

"The holder of this bond may cause the same to be registered on the books of the University in the name of such holder, and the same shall be thereafter transferable only on such books, and until there be a further transfer thereof on said books the principal thereof shall be payable only to such registered holder, or to the legal representatives of such holder; the coupons or interest warrants remaining always transferable by delivery; but when assigned to bearer by any such registered holder and such assignment registered on said books, this bond shall again become negotiable and transferable by delivery, and will so continue until again registered in the name of an assignee; and each successive registration shall be endorsed thereon.

"This bond shall not be valid until the certificate endorsed thereon shall be signed by the said Trust Company, or some officer thereof.

"In testimony whereof, the said Rector and Visitors have caused this bond to be signed by the said Rector and sealed with its corporate seal, and attested by its Secretary this first day of November Anno Domini 1906.
