RESOLVED, the Board of Visitors approves the consideration of addenda to the published Agenda.

**Appointment of William G. Crutchfield Jr. to the Health System Board**

On motion, the Board adopted the following resolution:

**APPOINTMENT OF WILLIAM G. CRUTCHFIELD TO THE HEALTH SYSTEM BOARD**

WHEREAS, the Board of Visitors may appoint up to six non-voting public members to the Health System Board with initial terms not to exceed four years and eligibility for reappointment to an additional term;

RESOLVED, William G. Crutchfield of Charlottesville, VA is appointed as a public member of the Health System Board. Mr. Crutchfield’s term is for four years, commencing February 28, 2018 and ending on June 30, 2021.

**Comments by the Rector**

Rector Conner mentioned a one-page document each member had at his or her place, which is a draft of recommended qualifications for service on the Board of Visitors (see Attachment 1), to send to the Governor. Board members were asked to review it and send any comments/recommendations to Susan Harris.

The document is part of work undertaken by a Governance Working Group comprised of John Macfarlane, Mark Bowles, Kerry Abrams (Vice Provost), George Cohen (Professor of Law), and Susan Harris. They were charged by the Rector with looking at different aspects of governance such as qualifications for service on the Board, responsibilities of Board service, creating a Board self-evaluation process and a presidential evaluation policy and process, and metrics for assessing effectiveness of the University’s progress.

**Report by the Deans Working Group**

Dean Risa Goluboff handed out a one-page document that shows recommended priority investments of University funds in response to the events of August 11 and 12, 2017 (see Attachment 2). The Deans Working Group (DWG) was asked to think about what it would take for the University of Virginia to become a leader rather than a victim after August 11 and 12. She said they looked at this from a perspective of safety and security, policy, and the investments the University should make to bring resources to bear on the problems that surfaced during those events.

In December, Dean Goluboff presented a preliminary report about potential investments. In response, members of the Board asked her to work with Melody Bianchetto, Vice President for Finance, along with president-elect Ryan, to develop a proposal. Dean Goluboff said the group’s suggestions are for two phases: 1) immediate investments that are ambitious but very easily could be adopted now and will produce immediate benefits for the University; and 2) longer term investments and new projects and initiatives that require more time for development, including possible structural and strategic changes in the future. She suggested laying a foundation for longer-term investments while leaving room for Mr. Ryan to develop more specific priorities and means for implementing them. Mr. Ryan is in favor of the recommendations.

Ms. Goluboff, on behalf of the Deans Working Group, presented four recommendations for immediate approval and implementation: 1) a one-to-one match for new professorships responsive to August 11 and 12 with a cost of up to $20 million; 2) funding that will expand the Blue Ridge scholars program for out- of -state undergraduates, and the University Achievement Awards for in-state undergraduates, at a cost of $5 million; 3) the “bridging project”, at a cost of $5 million; and 4) a university-wide campus climate survey at a cost of $80,000. Dean Goluboff said there was consensus among members of the DWG for these items and they are being presented to the Board with one voice.

Mr. Walker asked about a communications strategy around these initiatives, and Mr. Macfarlane remarked that if we sprinkle a bunch of seeds around randomly, it comes up from the bottom. Is that approach as effective as a top-down strategy with a vision? He suggested a vision that describes a cluster that is the core of what a center would do and then that becomes the narrative for the communications plan Mr. Walker mentioned.

Mr. Murray addressed funding. He said there were several ways to fund these initiatives. A donor could write a check for $30 million, or the University could raise tuition by $1400 per student and reach $30 million, which is equally preposterous. He said this proposal was presented to the Board for the first time at the meeting, and with four months left in the fiscal year the request is coming at the right time to be included in the budget for July 1. Mr. Murray said Mr. Macfarlane had the right idea about looking from the top down to see if there are outside sources that could be used to fund these initiatives. He named the Concert for Charlottesville fund, and a potential donor who might fund these types of projects. He mentioned a community outreach program discussed in the Commonwealth Engagement committee meeting that found funding from outside the University.

Ms. Goluboff said the DWG thought the items should be funded by the Strategic Investment Fund (SIF). She said there is great urgency in doing them now. Ms. Goluboff said this is an immensely strategic thing to do – to act from a top down place and say that we are committed to funding these things. There is still $32 million left in the SIF for this year.

Rector Conner said he does not like bringing proposals like this to the Board without advance thinking and understanding. These proposals are top down collectively. They are utilizing programs that the Board approved several months ago. The idea was not to come up with something new, but to use the existing investment structure. Mr. Conner proposed approving all of the proposals. On the match for professorships responsive to August 11 and 12, he said there needed to be a little more coordination and more work done on the two prongs. On the bridging project, the DWG should provide more information on exactly what this project entails and run it through the SIF Administrative Committee. This allows the Board to follow the existing process and still keep things moving.

Mr. Murray said we should plan to spread funding for the professorships and bridging over several years.

On motion, the Board voted in favor of a resolution to move forward with the four proposals, with some refinement on criteria to be reviewed by the SIF Administrative Committee.

Dr. Shannon provided a brief description of what the Health System is doing regarding their commitment to diversity in leadership. He said their approach was not about spending more resources, it was about looking at the commitment of leadership to the principles of diversity and inclusion. He has asked all of the Health System leaders to create a succession plan that includes the most talented underrepresented minorities. He said when you look at our deans, we currently have one African American man, no Asians, no Muslims, no Latinos. He said at the end of the day when those 100 new students look at the organizational leadership and only see people like him, we will never create the type of inclusion we need. What he sees missing from the DWG plan is the commitment of leadership to a succession plan that encourages and develops talented underrepresented minorities to succeed them over time.

Dr. Shannon said the second part of this is engaging the community to see how they feel about this plan. He doesn’t think they would feel particularly positive because it is all about UVA. He hosted a group of 75 community leaders at the Health System on February 7 to meet with 300 employees to talk about what the community leaders thought the Health System needed to do. They said they needed to see the University bear witness to the racial discrimination that occurs every day. They did not ask for a climate survey. Dr. Shannon said we don’t need a climate survey because we know exactly what happens every day. He said the minority valet parker currently on staff gets racially insulted at least once a week. The community wants UVA to take a stand on this type of behavior, so management has instructed the valet staff not to park the cars of anyone who exhibits this type of behavior. The Health System deals with patients refusing to be cared for by minorities every day. He said the response is that their patients need to recognize the fact that their care is provided to them by a team of very capable people who bring a diverse perspective to their plan of care. If they can’t see that, they should seek their care elsewhere. Since February 7, the Health System has dismissed two patients who have refused to be cared for by the diverse team. Dr. Shannon said this is what we need to be doing and this is what the community wants to see us doing.

Dr. Shannon suggested using the talented social justice scholars already at the University instead of hiring additional ones. He recommended giving the existing scholars the money to write about what happened instead of hiring others to come in and study what happened. If we wait, the world is going to comment on this and UVA will not have its voice out there. None of this costs any money.

**Report by the President**

President Sullivan said recent news reports have reminded us of the need to remain vigilant with regard to Title IX compliance and the protection of minors who come to UVA for various reasons. Having the right people is critical. We’re entrusted with the students who come to UVA to learn; we’re entrusted with the young people who come here for summer camps and other programs; and we’re entrusted with the care of patients and their families in our Health System. We need high-character people in roles throughout the University, and our faculty and staff need to understand and uphold our highest values in their work.

Having good processes in place leads to good decision-making, because a good process requires us to think about the considerations that should precede any decision. For example, a good hiring process leads us to consider values such as expertise, diversity, and character in the people we bring to UVA. If we do make a mistake, a good process leads us to review the mistake, acknowledge it, and try to learn from it. Finally, people may fail, and processes may fail — and that’s why we need good systems. In the case of protecting minors, where problems have occurred at Michigan State and earlier at Penn State, we have protective measures in place in our day care centers and summer camps, and in our hospital and clinics, and we have protective systems for other places on Grounds that routinely deal with children. No university is perfect, and every university experiences problems from time to time. Having good people, processes, and systems in place is the surest way to keep our University on the right path.

President Sullivan gave an update on the General Assembly’s budget process, which will be finalized next week.

Last month at an event to honor Greg Swanson, who was the first African-American student admitted to UVA, President Sullivan announced the launch of a new presidential commission to explore and report on UVA’s role in the period of racial segregation. The work of this commission will be similar to, and will complement, the work of the President’s Commission on Slavery and the University, which for the past five years has explored UVA’s historical relationship to slavery and its legacies. As with many universities and many states at the time, UVA and the Commonwealth of Virginia were involved in segregation and other practices related to racial inequality. Virginia was the epicenter of the Massive Resistance movement in the 1950s that sought to oppose public school desegregation. During this period, public schools in Charlottesville were closed to prevent desegregation, although the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals eventually overturned the closings.

There are stories of complicity in the age of segregation; at the same time, there are stories of bravery and heroism among many people at UVA who took action to oppose segregation and its underlying beliefs. As we continue to celebrate UVA’s bicentennial, this new President’s Commission will be part of the ongoing effort to tell the full story of the University’s history over the past 200 years. The commission will begin its work this spring, and it will continue under President-elect Jim Ryan when he assumes office. Commission membership will include faculty, staff, students, and members of the Charlottesville/Albemarle community.

President Sullivan also spoke about another project launched this spring, the Rural Virginia Initiative. The rural areas of the Commonwealth face particular — and particularly intense — challenges related to education; health and healthcare, including the opioid crisis; economic development; and workforce training. She has assembled a group of faculty and administrators who have expertise in these areas. This group will discuss these challenges in rural Virginia and consider solutions. They will produce a white paper and share it with the relevant state agencies, and conclude their work this semester.

**Comments by the Student Representative to the Board**

Bryanna Miller said student self-governance lives, which was evidenced by the honor report given during the Academic and Student Life Committee and by the other presentations over the course of the year. She thanked the Board for creating and approving a student comment period.

Ms. Miller recommended that a student from The University of Virginia’s College at Wise speak to the Board at least once a year to give their perspective. She also recommended having a student representative added to the Health System Board.

The division that we are seeing in our society is also being reflected in the student population. Ms. Miller told the Board she appreciated increases in the number of diverse students who are able to attend the University through scholarships.

Ms. Miller said she will continue to work on some projects until the end of her term. One of them is developing better student engagement protocols for the different departments and divisions. For example, the Lambeth Field conversation (regarding converting the field for use by the softball team) could have been helped by having more intensive protocols about how we engage the community and how we better engage students. This will be particularly important during the (presidential) transition period. With the help of Phoebe Willis and Devin Rossin, she will start a Community of Trust Working Group with student leaders and staff members to define more clearly what the Community of Trust is and how the University community can best support it.

She made brief laudatory comments about Brendan Nigro, the representative to the Board for 2018-2019. She said she hopes to stay close to the University and looks forward to keeping up with the Board.

**Remarks by the Faculty Senate Chair**

This was the last report from Alf Weaver; his Faculty Senate chair terms ends on May 31. His successor will be Peter Brunjes from the Psychology Department. Mr. Weaver reported on four items:

1.  The Faculty Senate invited Human Resources staff to one of their meetings to explain how faculty benefits work, how their benefits are determined, and how faculty get paid. He said he was surprised to hear that our self-administered health care plan costs less than the state- administered plan.
2.  The Faculty Senate revisited their most recent faculty survey, which was conducted in 2011. Salaries was the first concern and the Senate is very pleased with recent progress. The second concern was diversity. The University is moving in the right direction and they are grateful for that.
3.  Mr. Weaver promised the Faculty Senate a self-learning topic this year, and the topic he chose was “How to Retire.” They are holding a workshop on March 29 on how retirement works including a panel discussion with faculty guides, HR staff, and emeriti professors. This will give future faculty the opportunity to discuss how they would like to see retirement structured.
4.  The Faculty Senate Executive Council met with President-elect Ryan last month. They had an excellent session at which he shared some of his goals and the faculty shared some of their aspirations. They have already mutually agreed to support each other.

Mr. Weaver concluded by saying the Senate has now enjoyed several years of joint accomplishments with the University administration and the Board. He offered special thanks to President Sullivan, Tom Katsouleas, Pat Hogan, Rick Shannon and his predecessor, Mimi Riley. He thanked the Board for their enthusiasm and willingness to take care of our great institution.

**Report on Security and Safety Measures**

Mr. Hogan reviewed the recommendations brought to the Board in December by Margolis Healy and MSA Security. The University is adding 18 new positions, including an Associate Vice President for Safety and Security, a threat assessment case manager, and 10 sworn police officers. He said it has been a challenge to fill these positions. He and others are evaluating and enhancing the threat assessment team’s mission, policies, procedures, and membership. Improvements will be made to surveillance, infrastructure, and building security. The University is procuring a mobile safety application called Live Safe and developing and executing an enhanced training plan for police officers.

Mr. Hogan said the University is currently spending over $30 million on safety and security, and there will be an increase of about $6 million in the next fiscal year. An additional $2.35 million is needed for one-time projects, and there is also a need for a new public safety facility, which could cost as much as $40 million.

Mr. Macfarlane asked Mr. Hogan to come back in June with recommendations for the College at Wise. Mr. Conner asked for a comparison of what we paid 10 years ago for safety and security.
