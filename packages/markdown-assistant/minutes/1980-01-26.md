RESOLUTION ON THE EDUCATION OF INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On November 29, 1979, Governor Dalton wrote the Rectors of all Virginia institutions of higher education in which he requested that each governing board "undertake an indepth review of all their policies relating to foreign students ..., including tuition and fees, and adopt a comprehensive policy statement which is in the best interest of the institution, the Commonwealth of Virginia and the United States of America." In his introductory paragraph, he said that it had been brought to his attention that "Virginia tax payers are heavily subsidizing foreign students in our State-supported institutions of higher education and that many of our governing boards have no comprehensive board policy regarding admissions, financial aid, tuition and fees and other important facets related to enrolling foreign students. In addition, I believe that because foreign students enjoy tuition and fee rates which are considerably below the full cost of instruction, Virginia students, as a result of the 70/30 formula through their tuition and fees, also subsidize foreign students."

STATEMENT BY DR. FRANK ROYAL
----------------------------

Dr. Frank Royal asked for assurance that there will be an equal opportunity clause in the contract between the supplier of the new telephone system and the University, and he asked that documentation of this clause be sent to members of the Board. The President gave assurances that the telephone contract will, as other University contracts do, include an equal opportunity provision.
