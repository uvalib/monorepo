RESOLUTION TO APPROVE ADDITIONAL AGENDA ITEMS

RESOLVED, the Board of Visitors approves the consideration of addenda to the published Agenda.

**Comments by the Rector**

The Rector asked Dr. Britt to give a brief report on the Medical Center Operating Board, which met on March 2. The report may be found at the following link: [http://www.virginia.edu/bov/meetings/'17%20Mar/'17%20MAR%20REPORT%20FROM%20MCOB%20MEETINGS%20FOR%20BOV.pdf](http://www.virginia.edu/bov/meetings/'17%20Mar/'17%20MAR%20REPORT%20FROM%20MCOB%20MEETINGS%20FOR%20BOV.pdf)

Mr. Goodwin asked Visitors to please hold two dates in April: April 13 for Founder’s Day, and April 20 for the annual retiring faculty member dinner. He called on Mr. Conner to say a few words about the upcoming Board Retreat, which is scheduled for August 4 and 5 in Charlottesville.

**Report by the President**

President Sullivan spoke about the University’s Bicentennial, which is now just seven months away. The Cornerstone Plan continues to guide the path into the University’s third century, and she provided some examples of activity such as the programs offered through the Center for Teaching Excellence, and the hiring of Philip Bourne in the School of Medicine, who will serve as the new director of the Data Science Institute, which emerged from the Cornerstone Plan. The Brain Institute, another product of the plan, has awarded cross-disciplinary funding for its first seven projects to study epilepsy, aggressive brain tumors, and depression, among other areas of focus. A third pan-University institute will be announced in mid-May.

President Sullivan spoke about advances with the Total Advising initiative and focused on the career advising part of the program. This year is proving to be another strong year for employment for UVA students: more than 50% of graduating students in the McIntire School of Commerce have accepted positions already. This is higher than previous years, and it may serve as an early indicator of the outlook for the rest of the schools, because Commerce School recruiters conduct their recruiting much earlier in the academic year. The Batten School is reporting great success, with four of the Master in Public Policy students named finalists for the prestigious Presidential Management Fellowship. This is a highly selective national program, with only 6% of applicants selected.

In the College and other schools, interest in career events and activities is extremely high. This spring’s job fair saw an all-time high attendance, with 211 companies and nearly 2,000 students attending. The Educator’s Expo also attracted hundreds of students, and the Peace Corps recently ranked the University number five on its list of top volunteer-producing colleges. All of these results reflect the Career Center’s new model of providing active, relational, industry-specific advising and connections. The President provided statistics that indicate a very active career placement program. The Career Center team is partnering with the College to create new ways to engage students in the classroom. For instance, in January, a J-term class offered by the Statistics department, in partnership with employers, provided skill development in data analytics. The Career Center will play a major role in the new Dathel and John Georges Advising Center in Clemons Library, which is under construction, with projected completion this fall. A search for a director of the Advising Center is underway; the Center will offer a wide range of advising services for students.

President Sullivan said in the early days of implementation of the Cornerstone Plan, we saw the steady, but gradual, emergence of new programs and activities. Now, halfway through the third year of implementation, we are seeing a multiplier effect, with strategies combining to create an enormous output of new activity and programming, touching all corners of University life. We are building strength on strength, and success is breeding success.

President Sullivan asked for approval of the Gifts and Grants Report, which on motion made and seconded, was approved unanimously by voice vote.

**Comments by the Student Representative to the Board**

Ms. Willis thanked Visitors for the opportunity to serve on the Board over the past year. She divided her report into three areas of opportunity.

The first area is computer science. Currently, the computer science program is housed in the Engineering School. Priority registration is given to Engineering students majoring in computer science and second priority registration is given to Arts & Sciences students majoring in computer science. There is an increasing demand for access to computer science courses at the University, but there is insufficient space and faculty to meet this demand. Ms. Willis said this topic was mentioned at the Academic Forum on February 17, which included Elizabeth Cranwell, Nina Solenski, and Archie Holmes. She recommended that as we think about what skills and knowledge students will need in the next 10-20 years, the Academic & Student Life Committee look into possible ways to increase access to computer science courses- whether through online education or some other tool. The US News & World Report recently ranked the top 200 Global Universities Computer Science Programs, including many liberal arts universities, and the University did not appear in the rankings.

Ms. Willis spoke about the Student Health building project, which is a top priority for many University students. She said she heard that the building is on schedule and an architect should be selected this summer. She asked that the University continue to think long-term when building this new center and not just build it with current capacity in mind.

Finally, Ms. Willis focused on dining services for students. Although the food quality has increased since she was an undergraduate (she gave credit to Mr. Hogan and the Aramark team) she hears often from students who do not like the food in the dining halls. They believe other Virginia universities have better food. She researched this before presenting, and found that in the Princeton Review’s Best Campus Food, they ranked Virginia Tech #4, JMU was ranked #7, and the University was not ranked in the top 20.[\[1\]](#footnote-1) Virginia Tech does their dining in- house, but JMU has a contract with Aramark, the same food provider as the University. She said it may be worth exploring if Aramark does anything differently at JMU.

Ms. Willis again thanked Visitors for the opportunity to serve as the student member this past year; she said she was thrilled with the selection of Bryanna Miller as her successor and she looks forward to working with her over the coming months.

Following Ms. Willis’ remarks, Mr. Goodwin praised Ms. Willis for her work with the Board and read a commending resolution. The Board approved the resolution by unanimous voice vote and gave Ms. Willis a standing ovation.

**Comments by the Faculty Senate Chair**

Comments by Ms. Riley are provided verbatim as follows:

This afternoon I would like to start by once again talking about the social climate at the University. When I spoke to you in December, I noted that that there was more tension on Grounds than at any time that I can remember—but also that the University community has risen to the occasion with a welcome and remarkable increase in community engagement. That is still true. We continue to participate in difficult conversations. We have had protests, but they have been respectful. We have also engaged in ways that many people don’t expect. For example, some of my colleagues are deliberately seeking scholarship opportunities with people with whom they may philosophically or politically disagree. The academy has become one of the few places for such debate.

Faculty are very concerned about how immigration issues affect us. We aspire to be a global academic leader of universities. One of our missions is to take the Jeffersonian model of public education to the world. That means that we must be able to freely travel in the world and invite the world in to our community. Our research depends on our ability to collaborate with scholars both here and abroad. As Silvia Blemker told you yesterday, many of our post-docs and graduate students are foreign nationals. Many of them, including many from countries that are not the seven directly implicated, are now re-thinking their futures. In the past, many of those students have become productive citizens of this country. Others have become our best ambassadors to the rest of the world. It is incumbent upon us not to lose this very important form of diversity. Our standing as a global institution depends on it.

In the midst of this turbulence, we have not lost sight of our daily work. When I started in this position, one of my goals was developing real partnerships to build research at UVA. We as faculty have recognized that we can’t just complain about the difficulties of doing interdisciplinary work; it is up to us to help find solutions. This morning, Lisa Messeri spoke about becoming cognizant of the processes involved in becoming a better teacher. We need to think broadly about research in the same way. Last month, Jeff Walker and Nina Solenski did a presentation to the faculty senate about the BOV research committee. The faculty senate has been working with the Provost’s office in many different ways to build research potential. We are excited that the new VPR will be starting in August. We look forward to some of the initiatives to teach faculty to be better partners in development. Yesterday Terry mentioned some of the really innovative networking tools that are being developed by the library. Those are essential to identifying potential outlier collaborations. For example, from my own experience—speaking of “vexing problems”—yesterday we spoke of the opioid crisis. We heard about a program at Wise; Rick Shannon then spoke about addiction work in the health system. I can tell you that Chris Ruhm, at Batten, is working on economic aspects. In the law school, Richard Bonnie and I are working on a National Academies committee on opiate regulation. So far, we’re all working in parallel; but it might be really exciting if we could work together. Without effective tools we cannot find each other. We also need to find tools that help us work together. That may mean additional collaborative space. In this “new century” that may be both physical and virtual. The research enterprise is changing rapidly, and we as faculty have to be able to change with it.

After the way I started this afternoon, it may seem odd for me to say, but I am now encountering remarkable optimism on Grounds. As you know, I am now engaged in a great deal of faculty outreach; and I have been seeking views on what the University should look like in the next decades. There is an appetite to be not just the best public institution in higher education but to be a beacon for all universities—and a sincere belief that if we are bold, we can succeed. Faculty have told me that UVA is one of the jewels of this country and we should embrace seeking to be the best. As President Sullivan has noted in the past, we live in a time that absurdly allows us to talk about being “elite” only in the context of our sports teams. We have allowed others to capture what that means. For many people, “elite” now means exclusive. We need to take it back; “elite” means excellence. Our faculty are proud to be part of this elite institution.

Finally, I want to thank you. Last June, when I first spoke to this body, I asked you to get to know us better. And you have done just that. We had the retreat in August, the dinner with another set of faculty in December. Many of you come to Grounds so often that I’m a little worried about your jobs and families. I know that getting to know each other has helped us work together. And I am proud of what we have—and what we will—achieve together.

**Strategic Investment Fund**

Mr. Goodwin summarized funding commitments made through the Strategic Investment Fund (SIF). To date, the SIF is committed to $170 million in grants with $100 million of this amount dedicated to use as matching funds for private gifts to the Bicentennial Scholars Fund. He estimated that over the next three fiscal years, the Board will probably average about $40 million in annual commitments.

This past January, the Rector and Vice Rector met with the deans of each of the schools and encouraged them to think of “Big Ideas.” Deans may make proposals with a target date of submission of April 1, and for proposals that involve more than one school the deadline is April 14. Mr. Goodwin said only one proposal for funding was advanced to the Board for this meeting: $10 million for the School of Engineering and Applied Science Multifunctional Materials Integration Initiative. He said the equipment is state- of the- art and it is necessary to attract the kinds of grants needed in this area and to retain important faculty. It has a life of at least a decade.

On motion duly made and seconded, the Board approved the following resolution by unanimous voice vote:

RECOMMENDED STRATEGIC INVESTMENT FUND PROJECT

WHEREAS, the Board of Visitors created the Strategic Investment Fund on February 19, 2016 to fund investments that support the vision and aspirations of the highest levels of excellence in the University’s academic, research, and healthcare missions; and

WHEREAS, the Faculty Evaluation Committee reviewed and assessed proposals and provided their analysis to the Advisory Committee; and

WHEREAS, the Advisory Committee reviewed and conducted further assessment of these proposals; and

WHEREAS, the Advisory Committee recommends funding for the following proposal that will materially enhance research, research infrastructure, and the academic experience:
