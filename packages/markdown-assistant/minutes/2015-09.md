**NCAA Certification**

**The Rector explained that Board members are boosters under the NCAA rules, and so annually, the Board is trained on NCAA compliance issues. He said the lesson here is, if in doubt, ask before you act. The rules are very complex and it would be quite easy inadvertently to cause a violation that would be detrimental to the athletics program. The Rector turned the session over to Eric Baumgartner, Associate Athletics Director for Compliance to provide the training. Mr. Baumgartner spoke about institutional control, stating that the President is responsible for the athletics program, and she has delegated day-to-day control to the Athletics Director and himself. He said a “representative of athletic interests” retains that definition forever, and Board members are such. A representative of athletic interests may not recruit student athletes. Prospective student athletes should be referred to the coaching staff. He said benefits provided to student athletes cannot be more than what is provided to others.**

**\_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_**

**The Rector called on Ms. Fried to lead the Pledge of Allegiance. Rector Goodwin welcomed the newest Board Members present: Mark Bowles, Jimmy Reyes, Jeff Walker, Tammy Murphy, and the faculty representative Joe Garofalo.

**Rector Goodwin reminded Visitors to let the Board Office know if they are able to attend Fall Convocation on October 23. He then turned the meeting over to President Sullivan to give her report.**

**Report by the President**

**President Sullivan gave a report on the Cornerstone Plan (the Plan) implementation one year into the timeline. She passed around a written report, and she articulated the 8 principles for implementation: 1) ensure our actions conform to our values; 2) maintain our commitment to access and affordability; 3) seek opportunities to serve the Commonwealth; 4) leverage technology for maximum gain; 5) pursue continuous improvement as the source of ongoing excellence; 6) make collaboration an institutional hallmark; 7) seek opportunities to enhance our global perspective and presence; and 8) align resources with aspirations. She highlighted some areas of progress over the past year.**

**President Sullivan reviewed expenditures for the Plan. She said internal money was redirected to the Plan and there was some significant philanthropy.**

**She said the Residential Culture initiative has been active, including increasing “COLA” seminars from 45 sections to 66 sections, and ramping up career services including a “bootcamp” for graduates. There has been great enthusiasm from alumni around engaging with students, including serving as mentors.**

**On the Research initiative, the Licensing and Ventures Group had the best year ever supporting faculty research. The Data Science Institute is fully deployed and other institutes and affiliations are underway including a partnership with the Max Planck Institute focusing on alternative energy. Online materials were greatly expanded and there is increased undergraduate student engagement in research.**

**Student engagement also is apparent in the increased numbers of students studying abroad. In 2014-15, 2,468 undergraduate students studied abroad. Global activities are so strong that the University was recognized with the Paul Simon Award for Campus Internationali-zation.**

**Assembling and Supporting a Distinguishing Faculty activities include making interdisciplinary hiring possible, and streamlining the faculty search process in a number of ways.**

**Savings have been identified in a number of areas so resources can be redeployed to support academic excellence and affordable access. Ms. Sullivan identified where and how these savings are being redeployed.**

**The full power point presentation is available in the materials for the meeting.**

**Comments by the Student Member**

**Mr. Judge made the following comments:**

**To start the academic year, I’ve decided I want to use this student report to highlight many of the positive advances being made by students across grounds. In order to do this, I’ve engaged with around fifty student organizations, all of which are specifically working on early semester initiatives. However, please keep in mind that this is just a brief snapshot of everything happening.**

**It’s important to note that some of these initiatives are a direct response to events from last year, while others are entirely proactive. And that a number of these initiatives have received strong administrative support. This support comes in many forms like resource allocation, collaborative planning, and even simple recognition. In fact, initiatives that receive administrative support have seen a large increase in impact and success.**

**The first group I’ll talk about is the Sexual Violence Prevention Coalition (or SVPC). The Sexual Violence Prevention Coalition is the umbrella organization that coordinates prevention efforts between One in Four, One Less, Feminism is For Everyone, ADAPT, and Peer Health Educators. This year they have seen unprecedented increases in both awareness and activism regarding sexual violence prevention. Every student has now taken a mandatory online module, most have engaged with the Green Dot training program (either through training or an overview talk), and the Sexual Violence Prevention Coalition has received an outpouring of engagement with the Hoo's Got Your Back Campaign.**

**Also new this year, every first year student will have a conversation with a member of One in Four or One Less via a program entitled "Dorm Norms." In partnership with Housing and Residence Life, the University's peer education groups led discussions on bystander intervention, survivor support, and the culture of the University. Advocacy groups designed the discussions to humanize prevention messaging and provide a space for students to engage with their peers on the topic during the end of the Red Zone period. For many, Dorm Norms provided proof that sexual violence prevention extended beyond administrative mandates. The SVPC is currently putting together a structure to allow any student to engage as an advocate for prevention.**

**The University Programs Council is a second example of an organization making a cultural impact on grounds. Their new initiative, “After Hours” is the product of input coming from students within the University Programs Council and from President Sullivan's group on climate and culture. “After Hours” is a series of alternative weekend programming that consist of 6 events per week, running in the late night time frame. Their events typically start around 7:00 p.m. and run until 2:00 in the morning. They have also helped create a program called “Newcomb Late Night.” This allows students to use Newcomb Dining Hall and select restaurants until 2:00 in the morning every Thursday through Saturday. So far, these events have been very successful and have provided much needed alternative programing for students on weekends. The University programs Council’s goal is to continue expanding the program as they begin to see a distinct shift in late night culture.**

**Another organization, PULSE (an acronym that stands for Perspective, Understanding, Leadership, Sustained, Exchange) is a college retreat designed to explore identity, leadership and inclusion. It is the latest addition to Sustained Dialogue's work to shape lifelong leaders and activists who will help build a more inclusive campus environment. At the PULSE retreat, participants have the opportunity to build relationships with students from across grounds while sharing experiences on topics such as mental health, sexual orientation, race, socioeconomic status, and more. They recently received a $19,000 grant from the Jefferson Trust to fund four more retreats over the span of the next two years. This will establish a student-run tradition for first and second years to experience a space for self-exploration and multicultural awareness.**

**Next, I’d like to discuss advances in advising. The University Peer Advising Link (or ULink), a group which has previously presented in front of the Board, has more than doubled their operation in the last year. This year, ULink is advising 1,207 first-year students throughout the College, Engineering, Nursing, and Curry Schools. Advising topics frequently range from living situations, to internships, to major selection, truly creating a total advising experience. The Black Student Alliance has also increased its advising impact, by creating the Black Book, which I have here with me. This booklet provides first-year students with helpful information regarding lingo and traditions, restaurants to try, tips for success, and many other subjects. This is easily one of the most innovative and accurate examples of how we should think about total advising from a student perspective.**

**I’d also like to take a minute to acknowledge the efforts implemented by Student Council. Student Council has changed its recruitment process this year in an attempt to create a more inclusive and effective organization. They will no longer deny any applicants. Instead, they will accept every student who applies and is willing to work towards the organization’s mission. This open model gives every student the opportunity to engage in the University’s affairs.**

**And finally, I would like to mention some of the recent initiatives supporting mental health. The week of September 7th through 11th was National Suicide Prevention Week. Students around grounds, including our local chapter of To Write Love on Her Arms, have worked collaboratively with faculty and administration to create awareness for mental health. This is one of the most significant issues in our community and all college communities for that matter. I would like to add that CAPS, Student Affairs, and Director Tim Davis have all been incredible resources and advocates for the student body. Mental Health is a primary focus for all students at the University and I can best demonstrate this through a brief anecdote. The other week I was asked to speak to a group of first-year students and give them advice from the perspective of a fourth-year. It didn’t take long to realize I had no idea what to say. So I started asking friends and strangers what they would want a first-year to know. Across the board, fourth-years wanted new students to know about mental health. They want them to know how to ask for help, when to ask for help, when to help others, and most importantly they want to get rid of any stigma surrounding seeking help. This is a unified issue and one our community is working on as a whole.**

**So, this concludes my brief snapshot. And, my underlying point is that the student body is more engaged and proactive than I’ve ever seen. I really mean that. If you take one thing away from this report, please know that great advancements are being made by students and the more support of any form they receive from the Board, faculty, and administration, the more of an impact they’ll be able to leave. And the better this institution will become.**

**Thank you.**

**Mr. Katsouleas commended Mr. Judge on a fantastic report. He said it was a hallmark of a very good university when students come and leave changed in a positive way, but it’s a hallmark of a great university that as a result of those students it remains changed in a positive way. Rector Goodwin encouraged Mr. Judge to mention student concerns in future reports.**

**Mr. Griffin encouraged Mr. Judge to speak briefly about the open forum he is planning. He said it would take place either in late October or early November; Board members would be invited to hear from students. Mr. Judge said the organizers are considering a theme that would focus on the University in the next century. Mr. Griffin said they would apprise Visitors of the date once it has been decided, and he thanked Mr. Judge for his work on this initiative.**

**Comments by the Faculty Senate Chair**

**Rector Goodwin introduced Dr. Nina Solenski, chair of the Faculty Senate. She said there are a total of 82 faculty senators who are either appointed by the deans or voted in by their peers. There are a total of nine Faculty Senate committees that meet quarterly or more frequently, depending on their agendas.**

**Dr. Solenski said communication and engagement will be a theme for the year, including communicating with students, the General Faculty Council, the College at Wise Faculty Senate, and the state Faculty Senate.**

**Dr. Solenski spoke about the Faculty Survey from 2012. There were about 2100 respondents throughout all the schools. The most positive items highlighted from this survey were faculty collegiality – they like who they work with; faculty are committed to the institution; and faculty are satisfied with benefits. Areas to improve include faculty salaries; service (parking concerns); and transparency and communication. The faculty want the evaluative process to be transparent, consistent, and annual. They are also concerned about the financial revenue streams and understanding the transparency of this – how does this work, where does it go? Dr. Solenski said the new Responsibility Centered Management (RCM) model will do a good job of providing that much needed transparency.**

**Mr. Goodwin commented that he was surprised the annual review process was not consistent. Dr. Solenski said it is school-specific and department-specific and they all have not been consistent in the past. Mr. Garofalo said he believes this process is better now than when the survey was taken. The President reminded the Board in 2012 she mandated an annual review in order to receive a merit increase. She said they are making good progress but there is still room for improvement. President Sullivan said the Annual Faculty Report is not standardized and there has been strong resistance to standardizing it, which makes the IT application a little more challenging. The Provost Office has had a task force working on this for a couple of years. Rector Goodwin said on behalf of the Board he would like to state that this is not acceptable; it should not take a couple of years to have an annual review form in place. He said he wanted the faculty members to know that the Board does not like this. He asked the Provost to bring them up-to-date at the next meeting on how much longer it will take to have a good review system in place. Mr. Goodwin also said the Faculty Senate prepares well in advance for the briefing to the Board on important issues and he wants faculty to know the Board is listening.**

**Dr. Solenski concluded her presentation by reviewing faculty recruitment and retention concerns. She said the faculty would like to see sustained competitive salaries; benefits expansion to include tuition, wellness, parking, and a childcare subsidy; more promotion of the Charlottesville environs; spousal hires; professional growth opportunities; an emphasis on core values; and faculty governance and autonomy.**

**Gifts and Grants Report**

**President Sullivan gave the following Gifts and Grants report:**

**Summary of Fiscal Year-To-Date through August 31, 2015**
