He pointed out that the University submitted budget amendments to the General Assembly including $4 million toward the cost of a heater/chiller plant, a request for funding to support several research institutes graduate medical education programs and indigent care services. $325,000 in budget amendments would fund televising five University courses for Clinch Valley College students.

### 5.11 Inspections:

Each phase of the services specified is subject to inspection during the contractor's operations and/or after completion of that phase. Should any defective or unaccomplished work be brought to the attention of the contractor by the Building Services Superintendent or an inspector, the contractor shall meet with the Building Services Superintendent, or his representatives, Mr. Ronald Porter or Mr. Lawrence Keys, to discuss the work in question within three (3) hours after notification of faulty performance. Work determined unsatisfactory by the Building Services Superintendent or his representative after the discussion, or the contactor's failure to discuss the work in question, will constitute a breach of contract by the contractor, and shall entitle the University to any one of the remedies mentioned in Section 3.12.
