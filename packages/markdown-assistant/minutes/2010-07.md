# RESOLUTIONS ADOPTED BY THE BOARD OF VISITORS

## JULY 9-10, 2010

### PAGE

### Resolution to Approve Additional Action Items 8197

The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia

### Bond Resolution Appendix

July 9-10, 2010

The Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia met, in Retreat and in Open and Executive Session, at the Hilton Virginia Beach Oceanfront Hotel Friday, July 9, 2010, and Saturday, July 10, 2010; John O. Wynne, Rector, presided.

A. Macdonald Caputo, Hunter E. Craig, The Honorable Alan A. Diamonstein, Ms. Susan Y. Dorsey, Ms. Helen E. Dragas, W. Heywood Fralin, Marvin W. Gilliam, Robert D. Hardie, Ms. Sheila C. Johnson, Ms. Glynn D. Key, Mark J. Kington, Vincent J. Mastracco Jr., The Honorable Lewis F. Payne, and Stewart H. Ackerly, were present.

Also present were Ms. Teresa A. Sullivan, Leonard W. Sandridge, Paul J. Forch, Arthur Garson Jr., M.D., Ms. Colette Sheehy, Ms. Carol Wood, Ms. Nancy Rivers, Ms. Susan G. Harris, and Ms. Jeanne Flippo Bailes.

Present as well for the sessions on July 9th were Ms. Yvonne B. Hubbard, Gregory W. Roberts, and George A. Stovall.

## Friday, July 9

The session on Friday, July 9th, began at 1:05 p.m., and was led by the Rector.

The Rector reviewed the agenda for the Retreat and introduced Ms. Sullivan, president-elect, who gave a synopsis of the discussions she has had already with administrators, faculty, and friends of the University, and she reviewed her schedule for the coming months. She said she will be the speaker at Fall Convocation.

Ms. Sullivan said she does not plan to start a new strategic planning exercise immediately. She will work with the University leadership to integrate previous planning.

She said she has done substantial work on productivity as the chair of a National Research Council panel. The University is a trendsetter with regard to the traditional measures of productivity, but there is more that can be done. She plans to analyze “gateway” courses with an eye toward improving achievement in those courses. A redesign of these courses is occurring throughout the country. She said she is not proposing “dumbing down” the courses, but rather finding creative ways to make students successful.

Ms. Sullivan said she will also look at cost controls, internal budgeting, and succession planning this year.

Board Members made a number of suggestions about productivity, including looking at faculty teaching loads. Mr. Fralin said Ms. Sullivan should think about suggestions on improving productivity to provide to the Virginia Commission on Higher Education Reform, Innovation and Investment.

***

### Performance Measures

The Rector gave some background information on the Performance Measures materials, which were provided to the Board in advance of the meeting. He stated that this is the fifth year the Board has reviewed the Performance Measures. He sees secular change in higher education that requires institutions to develop goals in certain areas that will lead to long-term success. Higher education has not been traditionally goal oriented and that must change. He said the state does not have long-term goals either.

The Rector introduced Ms. Colette Sheehy, who said there are 43 measures. Where possible, data has been trended and compared to a select number of peers. The Medical Center has a separate set of measures.

Ms. Sheehy said it was not possible to talk about all of the measures, and so she and the other speakers will review with the Board those that look at rankings, new measures, and those containing data of particular interest. Ms. Sheehy introduced George Stovall to review the measures on rankings.

Mr. Stovall said the University tied with UCLA for 24th overall on the U.S. News and World Report undergraduate rankings for 2010. In the graduate rankings, most notable was the Education School moved up 10 positions since 2009. Both peer and superintendent rankings increased, which comprise 40% of the total ranking.

Dr. Garson pointed out that the rankings for different schools are composed of different factors. For instance, School of Medicine rankings include a researcher ranking, and Graduate Business includes rankings by recruiters. Arts and Sciences is entirely reputational.

Mr. Stovall said there are some international rankings including Jiao Tong which is very research oriented. The University improved in all three geographical areas in this ranking. The National Research Council is planning to release rankings, but they have not been released yet.

Mr. Stovall discussed the measure on innovation as a percentage of the University’s overall sponsored research as compared to peers. He said UCLA and Berkeley are not included because the University of California System lumps all of the schools together. Duke is not included either because their numbers are outliers to the extent that they may not be measuring the same thing. Virginia ranks above Vanderbilt and UNC, but below the University of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Cornell.

Mr. Stovall showed a graph of University sponsored program awards by school. Awards overall have grown by 58% over the last ten years. Medicine has by far the most awards.

A chart showing federal research expenditures indicates that Virginia is lower than peers. Size and the number of faculty in research areas are factors.

Graduate student rate of graduation shows that this rate has stayed fairly steady at between 60 and 63% over the last ten years, which is above the peer mean.

Mr. Stovall reviewed several statistics about female and minority faculty turnover. He admitted that the overall numbers are so small that the statistics may not be very meaningful. The high turnover quotient may be attributed to a low number of hires rather than a high number of people leaving.

Mr. Stovall reviewed faculty hiring statistics for five years. The yield on offers was higher in 2009 than past years.

Following a ten minute break, the Rector asked Ms. Sheehy to continue the presentation.

Ms. Sheehy reviewed the capital campaign progress per month, which declined in 2008 and 2009. She said a bequest campaign, which has a goal of pledges of $400 million, is at 59% of goal. Fiscal year 2010 new campaign commitments stand at about $160 million.

Ms. Sheehy said that Yoke San Reynolds had created two measures on overall institutional financial health: Equity Ratio, which is total net assets divided by total assets, and free cash flow margin, which is cash generated through operations that remains after the bills are paid. The University’s free cash flow margin is slightly under 2% for 2009. The more free cash flow in the institution, the better it is able to invest in new ventures. If the margin is negative, this shows that the institution is using debt for operations.

Ms. Sheehy concluded her remarks with a third measure of long-term financial strength: efficiency, i.e. educational expenditures versus reputation (peer assessment). US News and World Report ranks the University 64th in financial resources and 24th in reputation. Of the top 50 schools in the rankings, only five rank below the University in financial resources.

The Rector said the takeaways from the presentation include the need for levers to deans to encourage advancing the University’s goals; a greater focus on innovation; and more effort to find opportunities for attracting research dollars.

***

### Early Action

The Rector began by explaining that three years ago the University had “early decision” which was a binding program. This was abolished without input from the Board. Now there is concern about losing really good students who want to apply early and get the process over with. Many of the top institutions have either early decision or early action. He introduced Greg Roberts, Dean of Admission, who gave the presentation.

The University’s current system includes a January application deadline and April 1 notification with a deposit deadline of May 1. The University currently receives applications from November 1 through January 1. In most years, the staff evaluates between 3500 and 4000 applications during this period. Every file is read twice; deans read about 30 files per day. The first reader makes an initial admission decision; the second reader is one of three senior deans. They do not track their decisions as they go. At the end of February, they look at the decisions overall and by school and residency. This past year they received more applications than in the past, and the offer rate decreased to 32%.

There are three primary early action programs in place across the country: 1. Single choice where an applicant may apply to only one school early; 2. The middle of the road, in which an applicant can apply early action to multiple schools but not early decision; and 3. Unrestricted, in which an applicant may apply anywhere early. The first program is in place at Yale and Stanford. The second program is fairly rare. The third program is the most widely used.

Mr. Roberts said his proposal falls within the third category. It would set November 1 as the application deadline, and January 31 as the decision/notification date. The University’s decision may be to offer, deny, or defer admission to the regular cycle. Applicants would have until May 1 to respond, which is the same as regular admission. Mr. Roberts said the first year the early action program could be in place is for the 2012 admission year.

Yvonne Hubbard, Director of Student Financial Services, gave a brief overview of the process for applying for financial aid. She said financial aid letters are now issued by April 1. Early action would allow them to push the process back a bit. It is possible to do estimated financial aid calculations if necessary. The key is to identify students early in the process and educate them and their parents about the availability of aid and how to apply for it.

The Rector commented that he would prefer a mid-December decision date rather than January 31. Mr. Roberts said this would require a substantial increase in staff to process applications in such a short period of time.

### Approval of the Series 2010 Bond Resolution

The Rector asked Mr. Sandridge to present the bond resolution item. Mr. Sandridge said the Board authorized the bond issuance at its June meeting. The issuance is for taxable Build America bonds in the amount of $250 million. There is a lower effective rate with the Build America Bonds than tax-exempt bonds. The plan is to close the bond issuance on July 28, 2010. The long-term bonds will be issued for projects previously approved by the Board for construction and financing.

On motion, the Board approved two resolutions:

### RESOLUTION TO APPROVE ADDITIONAL ACTION ITEMS

RESOLVED, the Board approves the addition of items to the Agenda, for consideration by the Board.

### THE RECTOR AND VISITORS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA BOND RESOLUTION AUTHORIZING AND SECURING $250,000,000 TAXABLE GENERAL REVENUE PLEDGE BUILD AMERICA BONDS SERIES 2010

The full text of the resolution is included as an Appendix to these Minutes.

The Rector recessed the meeting at 5:05 p.m.

## Saturday, July 10

The Rector opened the meeting at 8:30 a.m., and asked for motions to continue in Executive Session.

### Executive Session

Upon adopting the following motions, the Board went into Executive Session at 8:35 a.m.:

That the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia convene in Closed Session for the purpose of discussing and/or approving personnel actions involving the appointment, reappointment, transition, nomination, evaluation, performance, compensation, and resignation of specific University officers and employees as provided for in Section 2.2-3711 (A) (1) of the Code of Virginia.

That the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia convene in Closed Session for the purpose of discussing specific legal matters and litigation where such discussion in an open meeting would adversely affect the negotiating or litigating posture of the public body, as provided for in Section 2.2-3711 (A)) (7) of the Code of Virginia.

***

The Board resumed its meeting in Open Session at 9:40 a.m., and adopted the following resolution certifying that its discussions in Executive Session had been conducted in accordance with the exemptions permitted by the Virginia Freedom of Information Act:

That we vote on and record our certification that, to the best of each Board member’s knowledge, only public business matters lawfully exempted from open meeting requirements and which were identified in the motions authorizing the closed session, were heard, discussed or considered in closed session.

## New Financial Model

The Rector began by explaining that the Governor has formed a Commission on Higher Education Reform, Innovation and Investment, which will force the University to consider how it will fund itself in the future. A major issue is productivity, and this is a tough subject for academics—teaching, learning and research are not an assembly line. He said secular change is occurring in higher education in this nation. Institutions have been overspending for far too long and there is not enough money now to go around. The Governor is looking to find continuous improvement and shared practices.

The Rector asked Mr. Sandridge to begin the presentation. Mr. Sandridge said his objective was to provide information that would create discussion about the issues. He said an examination of the University’s revenue sources reveals that the two major sources are tuition and private funds. He pointed out that these are not new issues, but there are going to be proposals in state government and among constituents, and it would be best for the University to be in the lead and not merely reacting.

### Situation Analysis - Environment

Student demand for the University’s product is very high, and there is pressure to increase in-state enrollment to 75% from the 69-70% of undergraduate enrollment that it is now. It has been demonstrated, however, that a student will have a 96% chance of admission to at least one of four state schools if they apply to all four including JMU, William and Mary, Virginia Tech, and UVA. The University has put a “stake in the ground” on the 70/30 in-state, out-of-state ratio.

Mr. Sandridge said the University received 23,000 applications in 2010, a record number. In 2009, the University awarded 14% of the degrees awarded by state public institutions.

Undergraduate tuition is a major source of revenue. Some will be concerned about tuition increases they perceive to be too high, while others understand a couple of institutions in the state, including the University, have the ability to help themselves and at the same time help the state by not asking for additional funding. Financial aid is critically important to any discussion of tuition, and if the University increases tuition in any substantial way we will need to look more carefully at support for middle-income families.

Mr. Sandridge said that out-of-state students pay 249% of the cost of education while in-state students pay just 67% of the cost of education. The University is dependent on out-of-state tuition to support programs including medical education and graduate education.

Efficiency is an issue for higher education generally. The University, relatively speaking, is operating on a very efficient framework. Even so, we need to demonstrate that we continue to implement strategies to gain efficiencies and reduce costs.

Mr. Sandridge said we are at a point where we ought to consider some bold moves, however, we need to be able to demonstrate to the public and state government that we know what we’re doing.

### Situation Analysis — Resource Facts and Figures

Mr. Sandridge turned to Ms. Sheehy to provide some facts and figures. Ms. Sheehy pointed out that the gap between the 1990 general fund appropriation per in-state student inflated and the actual appropriation is now close to $8,000. There is less funding per student in total than 20 years ago. For the first time, in-state students are paying more in tuition than the state is paying on their behalf.

The “base budget adequacy” model, which is what the state (not the University) has determined as the minimum cost of an in-state student’s education, includes a policy that the state should pay 67% of the cost of education. In fiscal year 2010, the state funded 44.5% of the cost. Ms. Sheehy emphasized that this model is a state calculation; for instance, the Law School pricing is well above base budget adequacy, which reflects their determination of the costs to function as one of the top ten law schools in the nation.

Not only has the state reduced funding for the University over time, it now takes some money generated by the University for the state general fund. Net general fund support in 2010-2011 will be $145.3 million, a drop from $147.3 million in 2009-2010. Adding in non-general fund reversions to the state, the total state operating support to the University will be $133.6 million in 2010-2011, a drop from $139 million in 2009-2010. In other terms, state funding has dropped from approximately 37% of the University’s 2001-2002 educational and general budget to about 17% of the budget for 2010-2011. The state non-general fund support for capital projects has dropped significantly for the 2010-2012 biennium.

### Situation Analysis — Productivity Gains and Cost Containment

Ms. Sheehy said higher education is very focused on cost containment. Some institutions have used outside consultants, but others have established internal task forces. She said the consultants generally come up with very similar lists for different institutions and we are well aware of the areas that they identify.

The University has worked to contain costs in many of the areas identified at other institutions. The areas we have focused on are educational enhancements, centralizing services, improving space utilization, streamlining and/or automating processes, reorganizing and forming partnerships, finding ways of creating revenue, managing assets better, and outsourcing. Ms. Sheehy provided examples of the University’s efforts in all of these areas. For instance, the University has outsourced student e-mail, the information technology “help desk”, dining and mail services, surplus property handling, vehicle rental, child care, arena management, and at least 26 other services partially or wholly outsourced to multiple vendors.

Ms. Sheehy listed some standard measures of outcomes, including a 2008-2009 six-year graduation rate of 93%; a top 25 ranking among national universities by US News and World Report; growth in undergraduate student enrollment which has been 1,273 since 2000; we have avoided layoffs; we have reduced the staff turnover rate from 10.9% in fiscal year 2008 to 2.4% through the third quarter of fiscal year 2010 (Ms. Sheehy stated this may be as much the economy as anything else); faculty salaries average 29th among AAU institutions and in the 30th percentile in the SCHEV faculty salary group (the goal has been the 60th percentile); and the student/faculty ratio has increased from 15 to 1 to 16 to 1.

### Situation Analysis — Cost of Degrees

Ms. Sheehy said there is no nationally accepted methodology of what it should cost to award a degree. The University is developing a methodology to determine that number for each school. She presented some statistics that were issued by NCHEMS showing that the funding per bachelor’s award at the University is $128,908, with total funding for all degree awards at $73,590. The methodology for determining these numbers is not apparent.

## Institutional Priorities

The second part of the presentation focused on institutional priorities. Ms. Sheehy said two major priorities are sustaining current operations and enhancing academic programs. She said Dr. Garson would address academic programs. One of the most pressing issues in sustaining current operations is faculty and staff salaries. The University’s faculty and staff have not received a raise in three years. Other funding priorities are supporting operations and maintenance for new facilities, offsetting future state budget reductions, funding deferred maintenance, keeping the commitment to the College of Arts and Sciences on future funding, and hiring new faculty as necessary, particularly in Architecture and the School of Engineering.

Dr. Garson focused on the Commission on the Future of the University priorities for his presentation on academic goals. He said the first goal is enhancing the student experience. One of the ideas that has gained some momentum is adding a fourth-year “capstone” requirement in the undergraduate curriculum which consists of a major research project and paper.

Dr. Garson said studying, improving, and expanding the University’s international engagements was a priority, both by bringing programs to the University and providing opportunities for our students to study abroad. Ms. Dorsey added that one of the advantages of having international students at the University is the prospect of bringing global commerce to Virginia.

A third academic goal is to advance the University’s standing in science, research, and technology. Among other strategies that he outlined briefly, Dr. Garson said this could be accomplished through targeting incremental dollars to faculty in three to five pan-University areas.

## Tools for Addressing Institutional Priorities

The final part of the presentation examined the tools available to address the University’s priorities.

Ms. Sheehy said increasing tuition is a primary method of addressing the funding needs. Options include increasing tuition for all undergraduate students, resetting the price of undergraduate education for entering students with full implementation over four years, or creating differential tuition for the different schools. The concern about differential tuition is if it is based on the actual costs to educate students, Nursing, Engineering, and Education have the highest costs and these are areas in which we want to encourage students to study.

Ms. Sheehy showed graphs of undergraduate in-state and out-of-state tuition and fees compared to peers. At $9,872, the University is only slightly above the public average of $8,617 and far below the private average of $38,924 for in-state tuition. In-state tuition is well below the overall average of $18,315. At $31,872, the University exceeds the overall average for out-of-state tuition, which is $29,469. The public average is $25,020. Only Michigan has a higher out-of-state tuition among the public peers.

Enrollment growth is another way to generate revenue and to attain critical mass in certain disciplines. By growing in total number of students, the University can increase the number of in-state seats without changing the 70/30 ratio.

Annual Giving is an area that has been identified as having potential for additional revenue. Only 18% of current alumni contribute, with an average contribution per donor of $709.

Ms. Sheehy said there are opportunities for improving efficiency and containing costs which are being pursued at the University. She mentioned making Procurement Services a self-sufficient operation, more effectively utilizing the space available at the University rather than building or renting new space, and focusing on energy conservation. She said a program to retrofit energy hog buildings is underway and the goal is to save enough money to cover inflation of energy costs, i.e. to keep the costs constant.

Ms. Sheehy said the University is looking at consolidating services where feasible by examining duplication of services.

Dr. Garson presented some measures to improve academic efficiency including the creation of the Center for Effective Teaching in Higher Education, examining faculty teaching and workloads to be sure they are in line with school expectations, and right-sizing departments and majors including looking closely at courses with fewer than 10 students.

Although the University leads public peers in graduation rates, any improvement would affect efficiency. An additional way of improving efficiency and effectiveness is through partnerships such as the PRODUCED in Virginia program that results in a bachelor of science in Engineering degree without ever stepping foot on the University Grounds. This is a combination of community college work with online courses. Distance education does not require additional on-Grounds resources.

Dr. Garson said another initiative is to add a teaching requirement for all Ph.D. programs because teaching can be delivered at a lower pay rate than with tenure track faculty. In addition, doctoral students will benefit by designing a course, leading a class, and demonstrating to potential academic employers that they have more experience than other candidates who have not served as teachers of record.

Dr. Garson said increasing the courses designed to illustrate connections across a discipline using learning centers will produce a more effective, integrated, active learning environment and non-track faculty or graduate students could cover the learning centers. Virginia Tech’s Math Emporium uses this model.

Dr. Garson’s final point was that moving some students through the undergraduate program in three rather than four years would conserve resources and increase the number of graduates. It was pointed out that motivated students can do this now. Although some leave in three years, many take more credits than needed for graduation and stay for the full four years.

In closing the session, the Rector thanked the presenters and asked if there were any additional questions. Hearing none, he moved on to the final session of the Retreat.

### Board Activities—Committee Structure

The Rector said in order to hold a vice rector election, eleven Board Members must be physically assembled in one location. After some discussion, the consensus of the Board was to hold the election the afternoon before the September 14 meeting.

The Rector asked the Board Members to send him their preferences for committee membership by the following week. He said he would announce committee chairs by the end of the month. He plans to hold open the Finance committee chair until the vice rector is elected.

The Rector said the performance measures can be related to Board committees, and he thought it would be appropriate to have each committee cover the applicable metrics in their meetings. He said there were too many issues at the moment to address this, and so he would put this off for a year in the hope that it would be pursued in the future.

On motion, the meeting was adjourned at 12:50 p.m.

For the purpose of providing funds to finance and refinance the acquisition, construction and equipping of the Project, the Board, pursuant to the powers granted it under Section 23-75 of the Code of Virginia of 1950, as amended, has determined to adopt this Resolution (the "Board Resolution") authorizing the issuance of general revenue pledge bonds of the University as Series 2010 Bonds (the "Series 2010 Bonds").
