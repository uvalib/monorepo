The annual meeting of the Rector and Visitors was held on this date at 9 o'clock a.m. There were present the Rector, C. Harding Walker, and Visitors Carson, Hart, Hull, McIntire, Munford, Rinehart, Scott and Williams.

The minutes of the meeting of April 30, which had been copied and mailed to the members, were approved.

The President made the following announcements:

Attendance; Total enrollment for the year, 2,165.

The President presented the resignations of Dr. L. A. Calkins, Professor of Obstetrics, and Mr. H. H. Lannigan, Instructor in the Department of Physical Education, whereupon the following resolutions touching their resignations were adopted:

RESOLVED, That the Rector and Visitors of the University accept the resignation of Dr. L. A. Calkins, Professor of Surgery and Gynecology. Dr. Calkins has carried forward his work with energy and skill, and the Rector and Visitors wish him continued success.

RESOLVED, That the Rector and Visitors of the University accept the resignation of Mr. H. H. Lannigan, Instructor in the Department of Physical Education. Mr. Lannigan has served this Institution for twenty-four years, and is retiring on account of physical disability. The Rector and Visitors desire to record their appreciation of his services.

Upon the recommendation of the President, leave of absence was granted to Prof. H. P. Johnson in the following resolution adopted:

RESOLVED, by the Rector and Visitors of the University that leave of absence be granted Professor H. P. Johnson, Associate Professor of English Literature, for the session 1929-30, for travel and study abroad.

Upon the recommendation of the President, the following were elected to the Faculty of the University:

* Dr. David C. Wilson, Associate Professor of Psychiatry and Neurology, at a salary of $3,750, incumbency to begin Sept. 1929.
* Mr. Wayne Dennis Acting Assistant Professor of Psychology for the session of 1929-30, at a salary of $2,800.

* Mr. Leslie H. Buckler, Associate Professor of Law, for a term of 3 years, at a salary of $3,750 per session, incumbency to begin Sept. 15, 1929.

In connection with the filling of the chair of Public Health and Hygiene, a letter from the State Board of Health to the Visitors was presented, protesting against the filling of the said chair without consultation with them. Following a general discussion of the matter, the following resolution offered by Judge Carson was adopted: (Mr. Williams voting in the negative giving as his reason his desire to postpone the election to the next meeting of the Board set for June 24); Mr. Hull also voted in the negative for the same reason.

RESOLVED, That the resolution proposed electing Dr. Kenneth F. Maxcy Professor of Public Health and Hygiene, be adopted; but, in view of the protest recently submitted by the Board of Health of the State and out of courtesy to them confirmation of his election be postponed until the meeting called for June 24, 1929, and

The President be requested to ascertain from the officers of the Board whether, in view of the facts disclosed by the report of the committee of the Medical Faculty appointed to recommend a professor to fill the chair they will not withdraw this protest, or whether in view of the facts disclosed by said report they desire to insist on their protest and to state the reasons therefor.

That it is the hearty desire of the Rector and Visitors to work in harmony with the State Board of Health and to secure its active cooperation in the work of the department of Medicine of this University.

In order that vacancies existing in the Faculty may be filled during the summer, the President was empowered to fill such vacancies as set forth in the following resolutions adopted:

RESOLVED, by the Rector and Visitors that the President of the University, in consultation with the Deans and committees appointed by the President from the staff be empowered during the summer to employ those professors who have been authorized by the Board but who have not yet been selected. It is understood that all actions of the President and Committee will be brought to the Board for ratification at their next meeting.

At a meeting of the Board in June 1927, authority was given for the promotion of certain members of the Faculty in the Department of Medicine, which promotions were to have been reported to the Board for confirmation, but which were overlooked. The President, in accordance with the foregoing, presented the names of Dr. J. Edwin Wood, M. D. to be promoted from Asst. Professor to Associate Professor of Internal Medicine, and the promotion of Dr. H. B. Mulholhand from Assistant Professor to Associate Professor of Medicine, both to date from Sept. 15, 1927.

The following special appropriations were approved:

The following resolution of thanks from the Professors of the University to the Rector and Visitors, in connection with the salary increase, was received and ordered copied upon the minutes:

We, the members of the teaching staff of professorial rank, informally assembled, take this means of expressing to you our sincere thanks for your cooperation in securing the adoption of the new salary scale for all ranks of teachers of this University.

The undertaking had its difficulties and perils. It could not have been accomplished without the wholehearted support of your special committee and of your entire membership. The most crucial point in the project was necessarily to convince the Governor of the State of the expediency and importance of a measure that directly affects too small a number of citizens to have a widely popular appeal.

As appointees of the Governor, and eminent business and professional men who are in contact with all regions of the State, your judgment upon the matter was bound to carry great weight. Had you not generously given your time and thought to the plan, both in your committee and in your full board meetings here and in Richmond, it is hardly conceivable that it could have carried.

We beg, therefore, that you will accept this assurance of our deep appreciation of your successful advocacy of the measure that means so much to us individually, and also, we are sure, to the future of our University.

The request of Dean James M. Page for the use of the home at present occupied by him, free of all rent, was considered but his request was disallowed.

The President stated that the General Athletic Association of the University of Virginia was faced with financial difficulties of so serious a character that it seems necessary for the University to advance a very considerable sum of money in order to prevent the credit of the Athletic Association from becoming impaired, a condition which of course would reflect most seriously upon the University itself.

The President stated further that looking toward this end a tentative agreement had been reached by the administrative officers of the University with the Executive Committee, which is the governing board of the General Athletic Association has requested the Attorney for the University to prepare a contract for execution by the President and Secretary of said General Athletic Association which contract is to be submitted to the Rector and Visitors of the University for consideration. The President then presented to the meeting the instrument in question, which consists of a preamble and form of contract as follows:

The General Athletic Association of the University of Virginia finds itself indebted to various parties, and in varying amounts, aggregating $40,000. Furthermore, additional funds will be needed for salaries and for other necessary purposes during the period which will elapse between June 1st, 1929, and September 15th, 1929, at which latter date said Association will have revenues from which to meet its current expense.

A meeting of the Executive Committee of the said General Athletic Association was held on Friday, May 24th, 1929, at which meeting this situation was discussed, and a proposal was made that a contract be entered into between said General Athletic Association and the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, whereby said the Rector and Visitors will undertake, from the general funds of the University, to provide funds of the University, to provide funds for the liquidation of said indebtedness, and for the general expense aforesaid.

At said meeting it was further proposed that the said Association shall execute and deliver to said the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, its bond or bonds in evidence of the amount so advanced by said the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, said bond or bonds to be payable at such times and upon such terms as may be agreed upon by said parties.

And at said meeting the Bursar of the University of Virginia, (now Mr. E. I. Carruthers) was appointed Treasurer of the General Athletic Association of the University of Virginia, his term of office to begin on June 15th, 1929, and to continue for such term as may be prescribed in the contract to be hereafter entered into between said Association and said The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia.

And at said meeting the President and Secretary of said Association were instructed to proceed at once with the preparation of said bonds and contract, and to execute the same on behalf of the Association, and under its corporate seal.

NOW, THEREFORE, THIS CONTRACT, made this 1st day of June 1929, by and between the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, a Virginia Corporation, hereinafter called the "University of the first part, and General Athletic Association of the University of Virginia, a Virginia Corporation, hereinafter called "the Association" of the second part,

WITNESSETH:

That in consideration of the situation outlined in the foregoing preamble, and in order that the credit of said Association may remain unimpaired, said University hereby agrees that it will proceed as promptly as possible to place in the hands of the Treasurer of said Association sufficient funds to pay all indebtedness of said Association, as of the date of this contract, and also to pay such additional amounts as may be found to be due by said Association up to September 15th, 1929, including all current expense of said Association, to September 15th, 1929, provided the total of all of said sums shall not exceed the sum of $40,000.00.

Payment of all accounts which have accrued prior to June 1st, 1929, shall be made by said Treasurer, upon presentation to him by the President of said Association of a statement of all such accounts due and payable as of that date, which said accounts shall be approved for payment by said President.

All bills accruing on or after June 1st, 1929, shall be paid by said Treasurer, upon approval of such bills by the Director of Athletics of the University of Virginia.

And said Association, on its part, hereby agrees that, in consideration of the foregoing undertakings on the part of said University, it will execute and deliver to said University, its ten bonds in the sum of $4,000 each, all dated June 1st, 1929, in the years 1930, 1931, 1932, 1933, 1934, 1935, 1936, 1937, 1938, 1939. All of said bonds shall bear interest at the rate of 6% per annum, said interest to be paid semi-annually, on the 1st days of June and December of each year.

It is distinctly understood, however, that should the total amount which is paid out by the University for the Association's account prior to September 15th, 1929, be less than the aggregate sum of said bonds ($40,000.00) then said Association shall receive a credit equivalent to the difference between the total of all sums actually paid out by the University for its account, up to September 15th, 1929, and said $40,000.00. This credit shall be entered upon the bond or bonds of last maturity of said series. In other words, if a total of $38,000.00 is paid out by the University on this account, a credit of $2,000,00 shall be entered upon that one by said Association's bonds which matured ten years after date. If a total of $34,000.00 is paid out by said University on this account, that one of said bonds which matures ten years after date shall be marked paid and cancelled, and delivered to said Association, and that one of said bonds which matures nine years after date shall have marked upon it a credit of $2,000.00.

Furthermore, said Association hereby agrees that so long as any part of the principal of or interest upon any one or more of said bonds remains unpaid, all funds of said Association, from whatever source derived, shall be collected by the Treasurer of this Association, who, during the whole of this period, shall be the Bursar of the University of Virginia. Said Treasurer shall have entire charge of the collection and disbursement of said funds and this Association upon the recommendation of said Treasurer and with the approval of said Director of Athletics will appoint such assistant or assistants to said Treasurer as may be found necessary to enable said Treasurer to properly perform his duties as such. Said Treasurer shall set up and maintain a system of accounting for said funds and shall render to this Association on the 1st day of October, 1929, and on the 1st day of each month thereafter during the life of this contract an account of the condition of said funds as of the 30th day of June, 1930, and as of the same date each year thereafter during the life of this contract.

And the accounts of said Treasurer may be audited at the expense of this Association at such time or times as said University may direct.

After the payment of such present indebtedness of the Association as may be certified to said Treasurer by the President of the Association, as hereinbefore set out, said Treasurer shall make no further payment on any account except upon voucher or requisition of said Director of Athletics.

And said Association hereby agrees to require said Treasurer to enter into bond in the sum of $15,000.00, with surety satisfactory to the University, and conditioned for the faithful performance of his duties as Treasurer of this Association, the premium or premiums upon said bond to be paid from the general funds of the Association.

This contract is executed in duplicate.

IN TESTIMONY WHEREOF, said The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, has caused its name to be signed hereto by C. Harding Walker, its Rector, and its corporate seal to be hereto affixed by E. I. Carruthers, its Secretary, and said General Athletic Association of the University of Virginia has caused its name to be signed hereto by J. K. Slean, its President, and its corporate seal to be hereto affixed and attested by W. E. Byrd, Jr., its Secretary.

THE RECTOR AND VISITORS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA

(signed) C. Harding Walker, Rector.\
Attest: E. I. Carruthers, Secretary.

GENERAL ATHLETIC ASSOCIATION OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA

(signed) John K. Sloan, President.\
Attest: W. E. Byrd, Jr., Secretary.

The President also presented to the Board the ten bonds for $4,000.00 each referred to in said contract, all of which have been properly executed by the President and Secretary of the General Athletic Association of the University of Virginia on behalf of that Corporation.

A full discussion of the whole situation was had, and it was thereupon

RESOLVED, That in the opinion of this Board it is necessary for the preservation and protection of the credit and good name, both of the General Athletic Association of the University of Virginia, and of the University itself, that the indebtedness of said Association referred to in the foregoing contract be paid as promptly as possible, and in order that this may be accomplished this Board approves said contract in all respects, and hereby authorizes and requests the Rector to execute the same in the name and on behalf of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, and the Secretary of this Board is also requested to affix the seal of the University to said contract, attest the same and deliver an original copy thereof to the President of the General Athletic Association to the end that the terms of said contract may become effective and binding upon the parties thereto.

The President then stated to the meeting that since June 1st, 1929, the date of execution of said contract and said bonds by said General Athletic Association, it has been found that instead of needing the sum of $40,000.00 to defray its indebtedness and current expenses, the General Athletic Association will, in all probability need as much as $48,000.00. When this fact was ascertained practically all the members of the Executive Committee of the General Athletic Association had left the University for their homes, so that it was practically impossible for a meeting of said Executive Committee to be held. The contract above referred to could not be changed or amended without further action of said Executive Committee, and as said contract provides for the execution of only ten bonds of $4,000.00 each, aggregating $40,000.00 it is not possible at this time to provide for other bonds except under the terms of a new contract.

There is no question, however, of the fact that the University should place in the hands of the Treasurer of said Association funds sufficient to meet in full all of the obligations of the Association. Furthermore, under the conditions with which the Association is faced there is no question of the fact that as soon as the members of its Executive Committee return to the University a supplemental contract will be authorized under which two more bonds for $4,000.00 each will be executed on behalf of the Association and delivered to the University. These bonds should bear even date with the bonds already delivered (June 1st, 1929) and should bear 6% interest from date until paid, and should be payable on or before eleven and twelve years after date. In other words, said bonds will simply be made a part of the same series with those authorized under the contract aforesaid.

Pending the execution of said supplemental contract and delivery of said two new bonds, such additional funds as the necessities of the Association may require, over and above the $40,000.00 already provided for in the contract aforesaid, should be deposited with the Treasurer of the General Athletic Association.

A discussion of this situation was thereupon had and it was further

RESOLVED that the Bursar be and is hereby requested to place in the hands of the Treasurer of the General Athletic Association, out of the general funds of the University, such amounts over and above those provided for in the contract aforesaid as may be necessary to defray the total indebtedness and the necessary current expense of the General Athletic Association, provided the total amount of such additional necessary funds does not exceed the sum of $8,000.00, thus making the total advancements authorized a sum not exceeding $48,000 in the aggregate. And as soon as practical a supplemental contract be prepared by said General Athletic Association and submitted to this Board, together with the two bonds of said Association for $4,000.00 each, of even date with the bonds heretofore executed by said Association and of like tenor therewith, except that said two bonds shall be payable on or before eleven and twelve years after date respectively; that if it is not necessary to pay out the full sum of $8,000.00 in addition to the $40,000.00 hereinbefore appropriated the bond of last maturity be given a credit corresponding with such deficiency in like manner as is provided for a similar credit in the contract above referred to.

The Committee appointed by the Rector and Visitors to study the problem of the establishment of an athletic fee in the University of Virginia submitted a report favoring said fee, whereupon the following motion duly made and seconded, was adopted:

RESOLVED, by the Rector and Visitors of the University that beginning with the session 1929-30, all students admitted to the College Department of this University be charged an athletic fee of $12.50. The payment of this fee will entitle such students to free admission to all athletic contests on our home grounds.

Allocation of the house on Monroe Hill occupied by Professor Sparrow, was made in the following resolution adopted:

RESOLVED, that the house on Monroe Hill, at present occupied by Professor Sparrow, be signed to Dr. Alfred Chanutin, at an annual rental of $300, subject to the usual conditions as to upkeep.

The President stated that the Committee on University Commons deemed it advisable beginning with the session 1929-30, to run the University Commons with regular dining hall service instead of the cafeteria service which has been given for several years, and that in order to make the change it will be necessary to recondition the building; that there is at present a balance to the credit of the Commons operation account of $7,500. In connection with the foregoing report, the following motion duly made and seconded was adopted:

RESOLVED, by the Rector and Visitors that the University Commons be changed from a Cafeteria to a regular dining hall beginning with the session 1929-30; that all equipment and alterations to the interior of the building needed to accomplish this purpose be authorized, at a cost not to exceed the amount which has been earned and reserved for expense of operation by the University Cafeteria.

The following report on DuPont Scholarships for 1929-30 was received, approved, and ordered spread upon the minutes:

I have the honor to transmit to you herewith the report of the Committee on Award of DuPont Scholarships for 1929-30.

A special meeting of the Rector and Visitors was held on this date at 8 o'clock p. m. The main purpose for which the meeting was called was to give the opponents of the establishment of a coordinate college at the University of Virginia a hearing in the matter.

There were present the Rector, C. Harding Walker, and Visitors Carson, Hull, McIntire, Munford, Rinehart, Scott, and Williams.

Messrs. Murray McGuire, R. B. Tunstall, Richmond Maury, Bowles, John Sloan, Hunter Faulkner, and O'Connor Goolrick appeared and were given an hour and a half in which to present reasons in opposition to the establishment of a coordinate college for women at the University of Virginia or in the immediate vicinity thereof. The Board took no action in the matter at this time, deferring same to a future meeting.

In reference to the election of Dr. Kenneth F. Maxcy, confirmation of which was deferred to this meeting, Dr. Flippin stated that he had had a conference with Dr. Ennion G. Williams, Director of Public Health of the State and several members of the State Board of Health in an effort to have the Board withdraw its protest in the selection of Dr. Maxcy and that while there was no objection on the part of the State Health Officer or the members of the Board to Dr. Maxcy, they were not willing to withdraw their protest to the manner of his selection. Following a general discussion of the matter, on motion of Mr. Scott, the action taken at the meeting of the Board on June 10th, electing Dr. Kenneth F. Maxcy, Professor of Public Health and Hygiene, at a salary of $6,500, incumbency to begin Sept. 15, 1929, was unanimously confirmed.

Dr. Flippin presented a communication from Dr. Ennion G. Williams, Director of Public Health, in reference to the promotion of Dr. W. E. Brown of the Blue Ridge Sanatorium to a full professorship and the increase of his salary to $3,000 per session. In connection with the foregoing Mr. Scott moved and it was adopted:

RESOLVED, that Dr. W. E. Brown be promoted from Assistant to Full Professor of Physiotherapy, and that his salary be made $3,000 per session, beginning with the session of 1929-30.

Mr. Scott, Chairman of the Finance Committee, stated that the Massachusetts Gas Company would issue to the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia rights on 440 shares of its stock in the Austin Estate, and asked that authority be given the Rector to sign such certificate when received, and stated further that he thought it would be advisable to sell the rights and also the 440 shares of stock; whereupon the following motion, duly made and seconded, was adopted:

RESOLVED, that the Rector be and is hereby authorized to sign on behalf of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia such certificate or certificates of rights to be issued by the Massachusetts Gas Company on the 440 shares of its stock standing in the name of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, and to sign on behalf of the said Rector and Visitors the certificate of stock to the Massachusetts Gas Company for 440 shares of its stock. RESOLVED FURTHER, that the Finance Committee be and is hereby authorized to dispose of said rights and stock if it is deemed for the best interest of the University to do so.

The Bursar communicated to the Board a demand from the State Treasurer, acting under authority of the Reorganization Act, that the Sinking Fund cash, now held by the Virginia Trust Co., be deposited in the State Treasury, and in a letter to the Bursar under date of June 8th, stated that the Virginia Trust Co. is to continue as the custodian of the securities, and credit such interest and payments to the Treasurer of Virginia will honor all authorizations for purchases of securities for the Sinking Fund upon approval of the Finance Board of the University of Virginia, or any official or board of the Institution having authority to make investments, and checks will be drawn by the Treasurer of Virginia against the Sinking Fund in payment of purchases of securities for the Fund; that the 3% interest now allowed by the Virginia Trust Company on uninvested funds will be added to the corpus of the Fund.

Pursuant with the foregoing the following motion, duly made and seconded, was adopted:

RESOLVED, that the Virginia Trust Company be and is hereby authorized and directed to deposit with the Treasurer of Virginia the cash on hand belonging to the Sinking Fund of the University of Virginia, and to hereafter deposit, with the said Treasurer the funds arising from maturing securities or from sale of securities, together with any income received from the securities in said Fund.

The President presented a list of capital outlays and additional expenses of operation items, which he wished the Board to approve, to be presented to the Governor, to be included in the biennial budget for the University of Virginia for 1930-32. The tentative requests were considered and approved.

On motion the meeting then adjourned.

We, the members of the teaching staff of professorial rank, informally assembled, take this means of expressing to you our sincere thanks for your cooperation in securing the adoption of the new salary scale for all ranks of teachers of this University.

The undertaking had its difficulties and perils. It could not have been accomplished without the wholehearted support of your special committee and of your entire membership. The most crucial point in the project was necessarily to convince the Governor of the State of the expediency and importance of a measure that directly affects too small a number of citizens to have a widely popular appeal.

As appointees of the Governor, and eminent business and professional men who are in contact with all regions of the State, your judgment upon the matter was bound to carry great weight. Had you not generously given your time and thought to the plan, both in your committee and in your full board meetings here and in Richmond, it is hardly conceivable that it could have carried.

We beg, therefore, that you will accept this assurance of our deep appreciation of your successful advocacy of the measure that means so much to us individually, and also, we are sure, to the future of our University.

I have the honor to transmit to you herewith the report of the Committee on Award of DuPont Scholarships for 1929-30.
