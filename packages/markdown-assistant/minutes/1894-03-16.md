2. An additional sum, say Ten Thousand Dollars, to be invested in the Massachusetts Hospital Life Insurance Company in a manner similar to the investments made by the testator in his life time, so as to make the income from the $80,000, already so invested, up to the sum of $3,600. per annum, as a provision for the children of the testator, the respective interests of Florence and Henry Austin to be payable as directed by the Will, and that of Mrs Carroll as she may desire, (which is understood to be, that she proposes to surrender and release her portion—;$1200—;of said income to said Florence and Henry, in proportions of $800. to Florence, and $400. to Henry, so that they shall respectively receive, Florence $2000., Henry $1600., and Mrs Carroll herself, nothing). Said annuitants, Florence and Henry Austin, to unite in the compromise, and agree in consideration thereof, to accept this investment in full, and to release the estate of the testator, and the University of Virginia, from any further liability to them.

3. The residue of the Estate collected and in the hands of the Executor and the Trustee to be equally divided between Mrs. Carroll & the University of Virginia, without unnecessary delay, such division to be made as of the 1st day of January 1894 as follows:

   a) The stocks and public bonds to be equally divided in kind, so far as practicable.

   b) The mortgages, notes, and any odd shares of stock, or bonds, to be appraised by three competent and disinterested persons, mutually agreed on, or selected by the court which may deal with this subject, and be by these divided and arranged into two equal parcels or lists, having regard to market value at the time of such division, to be allotted, by lot: one to Mrs Carroll and the other to the University of Virginia.

4. The moiety to be assigned to Mrs Carroll to be her absolute estate, and the moiety to be assigned to the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia to be the absolute property of said Corporation. Each moiety to carry interest accruing thereon, from and after the 1st day of January 1894.

5. The sums retained (clause # 1) and any other funds which may come to the hands of the Executor, from unadministered funds, to be paid over to the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, as the same shall become available, and

6. The $90,000.00 invested in the Massachusetts Hospital Life Insurance Company, to be the absolute property of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, in remainder after the lapse of the lives of Florence Austin and Henry Austin, respectively—;and to be paid over accordingly.

7. The sanction and approval of such Court as is mentioned above is to be obtained by Mrs Carroll, within twelve months from the date of the approval hereof by the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, and during the life time of Mrs Carroll: it being expressly understood, that if Mrs Carroll should die before the arrangement is fully consummated in every respect, nothing herein contained shall be construed in any wise to interfere with the right of the University of Virginia to succeed to the whole estate in remainder according to the provisions of the said Will.

A proper form of contract of compromise and agreement to be prepared and executed by all parties in any wise interested, including the Executor and Trustee under said will, and each of the annuitants, as well as Mrs Carroll, and the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia."

"I respectfully dissent from the above for reasons already stated. I am opposed to any compromise of the bequest. If I agreed to any, the above strikes me as the best for all parties. But I do not favor any."

The Medical Faculty this day submitted a report in reference to the reorganization of the Medical School an extract from which is in the following words and figures, viz.

Report to the Rector and Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia on the present condition and needs of the Medical Department of the University.

A report of the character indicated by the above heading having been called for by the Rector, the following views and suggestions of the Professors in the Department of Medicine is submitted to the Faculty to be forwarded to the Board. 1st It is desirable that, before the Chair of Anatomy be permanently filled, some redistribution of subjects be made in certain of the schools, in order to secure a more rational connection between the subjects taught in each of these. It would be well that

(a) The chair hitherto known as that of "Anatomy and Materia Medica" be hereafter designated the chair of Anatomy and Surgery", and that under the latter head regional anatomy and operative surgery be taught.

(b) The Chair hitherto known as that of "Physiology and Surgery" be hereafter designated the Chair of "Physiology and Therapeutics", and that under the latter head be taught the subject of Materia Medica as hitherto understood, and that

(c) there be established, if possible, "Adjunct Professorship" of Pathology and Hygiene", to which shall be assigned the didactic and laboratory teaching of Pathology and hygiene (at present attached to the Chairs of Surgery and the Practice of Medicine), the proposed Adjunct Professor becoming responsible for the laboratory portion of the teaching in histology and bacteriology.

2nd In filling the Chair of Anatomy (either as at present constituted, or with the proposed modification), and the proposed Adjunct Professorship of Pathology and Hygiene (if established), it is suggested as both desirable and important that due notice of the vacancy or vacancies be given by public advertisement, following in this respect the usual practice of the University, in order that open competition may as far as possible secure the candidacy of the best men available.

3rd If the suggestion of an Adjunct Professor for Pathology and Hygiene be adopted there will be entailed an addition to the charges on the University funds of $1500.00 a year as salary for such Adjunct Professor.

It is assumed that for the salary ($1000.00) at present paid an Assistant to the Chair of Physiology and Medical Biology (jointly) a competent assistant can be secured for the Chair of Medical Biology and the Adjunct Professorship of Pathology and Hygiene (jointly), so that no additional expense need be counted on in this direction.

Thereupon, it is resolved

1st That the recommendations aforesaid be and the same are hereby adopted and the Medical School be reorganized in accordance with said recommendations, to take effect with the commencement of the next session.

2nd That the Chairman of the Faculty be requested to advertise at once in accordance with the usage heretofore prevailing in such matters, for applicants for the position of Anatomy and Surgery, and the position of Adjunct Professor of Pathology and Hygiene, such, such applications to be filed before the Board at its next meeting.

3rd That the Faculty be requested to appoint a Committee whose duty it shall be, in conjunction with the Executive Committee of the Board to make such enquiry as may be deemed necessary as to any applicants for either of said positions for the information of the Board.

Resolved, that $14700 be appropriated for repairs to the Public Hall and that the sum of $150.00 expended by order of the Rector upon the Medical Hall, in addition to the sum heretofore appropriated therefor, be approved and allowed.

Resolved, that the account of Profr W. M. Thornton amounting to $52.60 for his expenses in attending to the interests of the University before the Legislature during its recent session, be allowed, and that the same be paid by the Proctor to Profr Thornton.

In accordance with the request of Mrs Leita M. Kent, it is

Resolved, that it will be agreeable to the Board to receive the interest on her obligation to the University semiannually on the 1st of February and the 1st of August instead of annually as heretofore.

Mr. T. S. Martin offered the following preamble and resolutions, which were seconded:

The Medical Faculty having brought to the attention of the Board the recent change of name of the new Medical College at Richmond, Va, in such a manner as to do injustice to the University, it is resolved,

1st That the consideration of said matter be postponed to the next meeting of the Board.

2nd That it is the judgment of the Board that no notice should be taken in our Catalogue of said new College, its name or its methods.

Mr McCabe moved as a substitute for the foregoing the following resolution, which met with a second;

Resolved that the following announcement be made in the Catalogue of the University of Va for 1893-94.

The Medical Department of the University of Va is not to be confounded with the recently incorporated "University College of Medicine" at Richmond Va.

The vote was taken on the substitute first and it was defeated by vote of 3 in favor to 5 against it, viz,

Ayes- the Rector and Messrs McCabe and Patteson.

Nos- Messrs McCormick, Watts, T. S. Martin, R. W. Martin and A. C. Gordon.

The previous question was then called and the vote taken on the original resolutions and resulted in their adoption.

Resolved that hereafter the Proctor shall not require Students to pay more than one months board in advance at a time, but any student may, if he choses, pay three months in advance.

On motion of Mr Patteson. Resolved that the funds of the University shall be deposited in as nearly equal a manner as is practicable in the Bank of Albemarle and the People's National Bank, a bond of indemnity to be required from both banks in the same amount.

This resolution is not to take effect until the close of the present session.

On motion the consideration of Mrs Towles' application for opening a public road through the University grounds, and Profr Thornton's suggestion & Estimate for an Electric plant for lighting etc. was postponed to the next meeting of the Board.

On motion the Board adjourned sine die.
