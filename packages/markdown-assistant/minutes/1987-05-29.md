## ATTACHMENT = UNIVERSITY HOSPITALS CONTRACT WITH U.S. JET CORP. DESCRIPTION OF PROPOSED CONTRACT BETWEEN THE RECTOR AND VISITORS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA AND U.S. JET CORPORATION WASHINGTON, D.C.

### BACKGROUND AND SERVICE

On August 31, 1984, the University of Virginia Hospitals established a medically-equipped professionally-staffed helicopter service known as Pegasus. This highly successful service has assisted physicians in rapid transport of hundreds of patients to destinations throughout the region.

Due to high utilization of this service and increased demand for long-distance transports, the University of Virginia Hospitals proposes the establishment of a critical care, Charlottesville-based Fixed-Wing Air Ambulance to service the State of Virginia and its bordering states (800-mile radius of Charlottesville).

This program will allow the University of Virginia Hospitals to provide a State-wide service which is not currently available. Much of the State, excluding metropolitan areas, is remote from the facilities of a major medical center with Level I trauma center designation. It has been demonstrated through national studies, and our own program, Pegasus, that air ambulances allow faster response times than do ground ambulances to calls more than fifteen minutes travel distance. For shorter distances, the ground ambulances have more favorable response times. The same concept is true regarding fixed-wing transports. The helicopter transport service, Pegasus, is very efficient within a radius of 150 miles of Charlottesville, but becomes more inefficient with regard to costs and response time beyond the 150-mile radius. A fixed-wing aircraft is faster and more efficient between the 150-800 mile range. The proposed air ambulance service will make a rapid response critical care air ambulance available to all citizens of the Commonwealth who require medical care, regardless of their ability to pay.

At present, there is no immediate response hospital-based fixed-wing air ambulance service in the State of Virginia. The University of Virginia Hospitals proposes to provide an immediate response medical flight service program which will serve as a primary response vehicle to areas of the Commonwealth which are not feasible for rotor-wing access due to weather and distance considerations. The University of Virginia's helicopter program, Pegasus, has had success during the first three years of operation and has transported over 1,500 patients. However, Pegasus has not responded to requests for helicopter evacuation nearly 600 times due to weather conditions. We have missed approximately 400 flights because of flights-in-progress, about 90 flights due to maintenance requirements. The availability of a dedicated fixed-wing aircraft will significantly reduce the missed calls due to weather and virtually eliminate missed calls due to flights-in-progress and maintenance. In addition, the fixed-wing aircraft will serve as an alternative to Pegasus and the Newborn Emergency Transport Service (NETS) for long-distance flights (150 nautical miles), therefore establishing a two-component system which all transports from 0-150 mile radius of Charlottesville would be handled by the rotor-wing aircraft and transports from 150-500 mile radius of Charlottesville will be assigned to the fixed-wing service. This two-component system would be highly cost effective and provide total access to a medical facility to anyone in the Commonwealth. The air ambulance will be based at the Charlottesville/Albemarle Airport and staffed by a specialty transport team consisting of critical care nurses, nationally registered paramedics, and IFR-certified pilots.

The aircraft and crew would be capable of responding within 30 minutes from the request for service for any of the following needs: on-scene transport (local squad transporting the patient to the local airport), transport of drugs and supplies to disaster or major incident areas, organ transport, and interhospital treatment of patients.

The fixed-wing aircraft will be capable of landing in any one of over 50 airports within the Commonwealth, virtually providing multiple service capabilities to anyone in the Commonwealth within one hour.

Five (5) companies (Corporate Jet, Aeromed International, U. S. Jet Aviation, Atlantic West Aviation, Class 1 Aviation) submitted proposals to the University in response to our R.F.P. The low bidder was Medical Air Rescue Company of Rapid City, South Dakota. Due to financial difficulties of Medical Air Rescue Company's parent company, Westward Community Health Care, the second lowest bid from U.S. Jet Aviation of Washington, D.C., was selected.

The University of Virginia wishes to lease for a period of two years a fixed-wing service from U.S. Jet, Inc., Washington, D.C. The service will provide the University with six (6) pilots, a twin-engine Beechcraft King Air C-90 and a back-up Beechcraft King Air B-90 (to be utilized when the primary aircraft is not available due to maintenance) equipped with: oxygen, air, suction, adult and pediatric monitor and defibrillator, neonatal isolette, oxygen blender and ventilator, Doppler monitoring, and non-invasive blood pressure monitoring equipment.

The cost of this service is $30,000.00 per month and $385.00 per hour flown and includes the following:

* 6 Pilots
* Beechcraft King Air C-90
* Intensive Care Unit Package
* A Back-up King Air B-90 (to replace the Beechcraft C-90 when maintenance is required)
* All Aircraft Maintenance
* Hangar Facilities

Total yearly cost including medical personnel is $550,000.00. This cost, based upon 200 patients per year, is supported totally by revenue generated from the service.

The University requests Board of Visitors approval to contract with U.S. Jet Corporation subject to the review and approval of contract documents by the Legal Adviser's Office and University Management.

## ATTACHMENT B = UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL CONTRACT WITH ARA SERVICES DESCRIPTION OF PROPOSED CONTRACT BETWEEN THE RECTOR AND VISITORS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA AND ARA SERVICES

### BACKGROUND

For several years, the University of Virginia Hospital has had a dual food service operation in confined contiguous areas. The University Food Service operated the cafeteria with support from their food center on Ivy Road and less than adequate support and production space on-site. The Hospital operated the patient food production and distribution from the main kitchen. The Replacement Hospital is scheduled to come on line with a large modern cafeteria and new methods of patient food production and distribution. These anticipated changes brought on by the Replacement Hospital along with the inefficiencies of our current setup, as well as complaints with quality and service from our cafeteria, generated a management decision to unify food production, distribution, cafeteria and catering services into a contractually provided service.

A Request for Proposal was developed and targeted at nationally recognized companies with experience in serving major teaching hospitals preferably with resources and experience in opening and operating new facilities within our current planning and budget forecasts. The University Hospital was successful in attracting the interests of seven companies that met its requirements, of which three competitive proposals were received. Negotiations with these three vendors were accomplished, and ARA was selected.

The negotiated contract provides for the protection of the Hospital's current employees as long as they provide satisfactory service. Upon attrition and to meet current vacancies created by the withdrawal of University Food Service, ARA will staff with ARA employees.

The cafeteria will operate 24 hours/day, 7 days/week with a full service menu for our off-hour employees. ARA will buy through ARA or State of Virginia resources, whichever is in the best interests of the Hospital.

The Hospital will control the menu offerings, quality, prices charged in the cafeteria and the performance of ARA employees.

ARA has accepted this for a management contract fee of $52,000 per year and costs. The costs (including the management fee) are constrained to the established budget for the year. As an incentive to improve efficiencies and performance, a bonus plan is included. Should ARA come in under the budget, the savings will be shared 10% for ARA and 90% for the Hospital. Should they be able to increase volume in the cafeteria, the increase would also be shared in like manner.

Because of technicalities of maximizing the benefits of ARA purchasing outside the State purchasing constraints and to not have ARA considered as "agents" of the Hospital, the total dollar volume of the contract may be as much as $3,000,000/year, related to patient volume. However, the specific value to ARA will be considerably less, more in the range of $150,000, related to the management fee and the bonuses from increased volumes and savings.

The University requests Board of Visitors approval to contract with ARA subject to the review and approval of contract documents by the Legal Adviser's Office and University Management.
