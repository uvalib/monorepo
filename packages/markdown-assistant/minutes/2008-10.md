### ACC Certification

The Rector read the annual “Governing Board Certification Form Academic Year 2008-09,” as he is required to do by the Atlantic Coast Conference:

**“As Chairman of the Governing Board at the University of Virginia, I attest that:**

1. Responsibility for the administration of the athletics program has been delegated to the Chief Executive Officer of the Institution.
2. The Chief Executive Officer has the mandate and support of the Board to operate a program of integrity in full compliance with NCAA, ACC and all other relevant rules and regulations.
3. The Chief Executive Officer, in consultation with the Faculty Athletics Representative and the Director of Athletics, determines how the institutional vote shall be cast on issues of athletic policy presented to the NCAA and the ACC.”

The Certification is signed by the President in addition to the Rector.

The Rector then asked the President to give his customary report.

### Report by the President

The President spoke principally to the State budget situation: the Governor’s Office, he said, is now projecting a budget shortfall of as much as $2.9 billion. The University and other state agencies have been asked to submit plans to cut spending by 5%, by 10% and by 15%.

For the University, this would mean cutting by $7.6 million at 5%, and up to $22.8 million at 15%. To cover this latter cut in our state budget would mean reducing all existing budgets by 6.2%.

A budget reduction plan was submitted to Richmond on September 26th; the University will receive precise reduction requirements later in the fall.

This reduction, the President pointed out, will be in addition to the $9.7 million reduction put in place in 2007-08.

The Capital Campaign continues in spite of the economy. A Virginia 2020 weekend retreat was held at Manchester Village, Vermont recently; another is planned in Phoenix in November. Two 2020 retreats will be held in the spring, including one for parents of current students.

### Gifts and Grants Report

Philanthropic giving to the University and its related foundations for the current fiscal year – which began July 1st – through August 31st, came to $22,806,660.29, a decrease of $13,217,849.17 (or 36.7%) over the same period last year.

The President noted, however, that although giving levels are down from last year, they are comparable to the 2005-2006 fiscal year levels for the same period.

The Nursing School, the Jefferson Scholars Foundation, the Claude Moore Health Sciences Library, the Center for Politics, the Women’s Center, and the Law School have shown significant increases in giving over the previous year.

Listing some significant gifts since the previous Board meeting, the President noted an additional bequest of $1,500,000 from the estate of Gertrude S. Greenslade for the use of the College; a gift of $1,000,000 from Mr. and Mrs. C. Dice Hammer for the Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery in the Medical School; a gift of $1,000,000 from Mr. and Mrs. Raymond J. Harbert for the Joel B. Piassick Research Professorship in Law; and a $750,000 grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation for “An Electronic Imprint at UVa Press.”

### Resolution Approving the Gifts and Grants Report

**RESOLVED**, the President’s Gifts and Grants Report is approved.
