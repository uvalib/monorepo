A called meeting of the Rector and Visitors was held on this date at ten o'clock with the following members present; The Rector, Fred W. Scott, Visitors Corbitt, Garnett, Rinehart, Lewis C. Williams and R. Gray Williams, and President Newcomb.

Minutes of the previous meeting which had been copied and mailed to the members, were approved.

The President announced the following gifts:

in aid of Prof. L. B. Snoddy's auroral expedition during summer of 1939.

The President presented to the Rector and Visitors a resolution approved by the Executive Committee of the Board at a meeting held on March 8, 1939, reading as follows:

RESOLVED, by the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the claim of the University Hospital, $895.10 against Mrs. Kirkwood Otey, of Charleston, West Virginia, be and the same is hereby cancelled, for reasons set out in a letter from W. Allan Perkins, Esq., Attorney for the University, dated February 14, 1939, to the President, said cancellation, however, to be conditioned upon authority from the Comptroller of Virginia or such other official as may be authorized to act.

He further presented a letter from Hon. A. P. Staples, Attorney General of Virginia, addressed to Mr. W. Allan Perkins, under date of March 28, 1939, and Mr. Perkins' reply thereto, dated March 30, 1939.

After full consideration by the Board, the following resolution was unanimously adopted:

RESOLVED, by The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that said claim shall not be cancelled but that action at this time shall be suspended in connection with the claim of the University Hospital, $895.10, against Mrs. Kirkwood Otey, of Charleston, W. Va.

President Newcomb, who had attended a conference of the beneficiaries of the Estate of Conrad Hubert, Executors and Trustees of the estate, submitted the following report for consideration and adoption:

By a decree entered in the Surrogate's Court of the County of New York, on the 14th day of March, 1939, in the matter of the Judicial Settlement of the Account of Proceedings of C. Bertram Plante and Bankers Trust Company, as Executors and Trustees of Conrad Hubert, deceased, it is ascertained and determined that all assets of said estate remaining in the hands of said Executors and Trustees have been distributed except the following:

Note for $30,208.43 of Temple Terrace Assets Company, Inc., and note for $26,912.45 of said Temple Terrace Assets Company, Inc., the total estimated value of said two notes being $1750.00;

75 shares Glenalla Realty Corporation, estimated value of which if $115,728.62;

1875 shares Orange Belt Realty Corporation, common, and 1875 shares of Orange Belt Realty Corporation 8% preferred, estimated value of which is $187,500.00.

The total estimated value of all of said undistributed assets being $304,978.62

And after providing for the payment of $6284.86 on account of commissions to the Executors and Trustees, and an attorneys' fee of $185.30 to messrs. Plante, Edwards & Abrahams, Attorneys for the Trustees, said decree proceeds with a statement in detail of the respective interests of the several legatees under the will of said Conrad Hubert in and to said fund. The interest of the University of Virginia therein being stated by said decree to be as follows:

(1) An undivided participation three-eightieths (380) interest in the note of $30,208.43 of Temple Terrace Assets Co., Inc., dated June 13, 1928, due June 13, 1933, @ 7% and in the note of $26,912.45 of Temple Terrace Assets Co., dated June 13, 1928, due June 13, 1933, @ 8%;

(2) 3Â¾ shares of capital stock of Glenalla Realty Corporation;

(3) 93Â¾ shares of common stock and 93Â¾ shares of 8% preferred stock of Orange Belt Realty Corporation.

And said decree provides that the institutions named therein, one of which is University of Virginia, may within thirty days after date of said decree (that is, on or before April 14, 1939) file the consent provided for by said decree to distribution of said assets in kind.

The proposal is made, however, that in accepting distribution of said assets in kind, the institutions interested therein shall direct said Trustees to issue and deliver to Ernest E. Quantrell, Bernard Reswick, and David Weinstein, as Voting Trustees, under and pursuant to the terms and provisions of a proposed Voting Trust Agreement, dated March 24, 1939, their respective interests in said notes of Temple Terrace Assets Company, Inc., and the shares of stock above described.

Said Voting Trustees will then issue and deliver to each of the beneficiaries, or to their respective nominee or nominees, certificates for the number of shares of said corporation transferred by said beneficiaries, respectively, to said Voting Trustees, it being contemplated that said beneficiaries are to direct said Voting Trustees upon receiving the several interests of said beneficiaries in and to the notes aforesaid to transfer said notes either to Glenalla Realty Corporation or Orange Belt Realty Corporation as an additional contribution to the capital of the Corporation, to which said interests in said notes are transferred. Thus, the delivery of the certificates for the number of shares respectively transferred by the different beneficiaries will reflect the respective interests of said beneficiaries not only in the shares of stock but in said notes.

There is presented herewith a form fo consent to distribution by the Executors and Trustees of said Conrad Hubert, deceased, of said notes and of said stock.

There is also submitted herewith a form of agreement for execution by all of the remaining individual and corporate beneficiaries under said will. Said agreement sets out in detail the conditions under which the assignments to said Voting Trustees above referred to are to be made, defines the duties and obligations of said Voting Trustees, and provides in detail for the management of said trusts for the term of three years beginning as of the date of the execution of said agreement, and ending on the 24th day of March, 1942, the purpose of said Trust Agreement being to turn over to said Voting Trustees all of the assets which are now subject to distrivution and which consist of the interest in the two notes above referred to and the assets of said two corporations, which assets consist mainly of large tracts of land, some improved but the greater portion unimproved, situated in Florida, and about which we are not accurately advised.

The question presented to the board is whether it is wiser for the University to consent to the transfer of its interests as above set out to said Voting Trustees, or whether we should refuse to agree to such transfer and insist upon immediate sale of the University's interest in said estate and a settlement for such amount of cash as such sale will produce.

After full consideration of the whole subject, the following resolution was adopted:

RESOLVED, that the Rector or President be, and is hereby requested and authorized, in the name and on behalf of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, to execute consent to acceptance in kind of the distributive share of the University in the Estate of Conrad Hubert, deceased, from C. Bertram Plante, and Bankers Trust Company, as Trustees, instructing said Trustees to deliver such distributive share to Ernest L. Quantrell, Bernard Reswick and David Weintesin, as Voting Trustees under and pursuant to the terms and provisions of a Voting Trust Agreement dated March 24, 1939, copy of which consent is ordered to be filed with the minutes of this meeting. And that the Secretary be and is hereby authorized and instructed to affix the corporate seal of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia to such consent and acceptance, and to attest the same.

And be it further

RESOLVED that the Rector or the President be and is hereby authorized and requested, in the name and on behalf of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, to execute said Voting Trust Agreement of March 24, 1939, the Secretary being hereby authorized and instructed to affix the corporate seal to said Voting Trust Agreement and to attest the same, and to deliver said consent and voting trust agreement to Messrs. Plante, Edwards and Abrahams, Attorneys, 61 Broadway, New York City, said consent to be filed by said Attorneys with the Clerk of the Surrogate Court for the County of New York, File No. P-691-1928, and said Voting Trust Agreement to be delivered to said Ernest L. Quantrell, Bernard Reswick and David Weintwein, a copy thereof to be filed with the minutes of this meeting.

Sloane, Anderson Bros., The John Van Range Co., Scanlen Co., John G. Kolbe, The Straus Co., S. Blickman, Inc., Ezekial and Wellman, Southern Equipment Co., Thalhimers, American Sterilizer Co., Charlottesville Hardware Co., F. O. Schoedinger, Barker-Jennings Hardware Corp., Max Wocher & Co., American Hospital Supply Co., Gilmore, Hamm and Snyder, Omohundro Electric Co., Westinghouse Electric Supply Corp., and City of Charlottesville Gas Department; that said bids had been duly received, opened and publicly read: NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, That the bids listed in the preamble hereof be filed and presented to Frank E. Hartman, Superintendent of Buildings and Grounds of the University of Virginia, and that said Frank E. Hartman is directed to forthwith tabulate said bids, and at the earliest practicable moment, report to this New Buildings Committee of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia his findings as to the lowest and best bidders.

Passed this 16th day of February, 1939.

Whereas, Frank E. Hartman, Superintendent of Grounds & Buildings, pursuant to a resolution heretofore adopted, has tabulated and considered all bids heretofore received for the furnishing of equipment for the said Neuropsychiatric Building, Docket, Va. 1101-F, and has duly made his recommendations to this New Buildings Committee of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, and it appearing from said recommendations and Report that

are the lowest and best bids,

NOW, THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED BY THE NEW BUILDINGS COMMITTEE OF THE RECTOR AND VISITORS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA, AS FOLLOWS:

Section 1. That the bids as above set out in the report of Frank E. Hartman, Superintendent of Buildings & Grounds, in the total sum of $14,619.37, are hereby accepted, determined and declared to be the lowest and best bids; however, these awards shall not be effective until the awardees shall have been notified in writing by J. L. Newcomb, President of the University of Virginia, of such awards. That upon the awardees being notified in writing, contracts for the furnishing of said equipment, as heretofore prescribed by the plans, specifications, and contract documents, shall be forthwith executed for said equipment.

Section 2. That J. L. Newcomb, President, is hereby authorized and directed to execute said contracts in the name of and for and on behalf of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia.

The foregoing report was approved.

A list of contracts on P. W. A. Docket Va. 1312-F, Restoration of Rotunda, ranging from $100.00 to $1,000.00 was presented to the Board. All of these contracts have been approved for award by the Regional Director of P. W. A. in Atlanta.

Heretofore it has been the understanding that on all contracts involving amounts under $1,000.00 no formal resolution of award by The Board of Visitors was necessary. Instructions have just been received, however, from the Regional Director that this rule applies only to contracts involving amounts less than $100.00. It is necessary, therefore, that a formal resolution of award be adopted with reference to all of the contracts upon which prices range from $100.00 to $1,000.00 heretofore approved by the Regional Director and which are included upon the list referred to. It was thereupon resolved that award be and is hereby made to each of the contractors whose names appear upon said list and whose bids in the amounts set opposite their names respectively were the best and lowest bids received in each case for furnishing the material described on the work to be done as shown under the heading "Description" upon said list and a copy of said list is ordered to be spread as a part of the minutes of this meeting.

And it was further RESOLVED that any and all action heretofore taken by the University of Virginia, its officers, or agents with reference to any one or more of said Contracts be and is hereby approved, ratified and confirmed, and Frank E. Hartman Superintendent of Buildings and Grounds of the University of Virginia, is hereby directed, authorized and empowered to execute any and all said contracts as enumerated upon said list in the name and on behalf of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, and the Secretary is hereby authorized to affix the seal of the University and attest the same.

A loan to the Society of $20,000, dated June 15, 1934, payable five years after date, with interest @ 6% per annum, payable semi-annually, was extended for ten years from June 15, 1939 with interest at 5%, payable semi-annually, with the stipulation that at least $500.00 be paid each year on the principal.

This corporation advised the University that it was preparing to refinance an issue of $19,000 1st mortgage bonds, and $14,000 2nd mortgage bonds, dated January 23, 1934, payable November 25, 1938, with interest @ 6%, secured upon its property on West Main Street, by new issue @ 5%, dated from May 25, 1939, and that the bonds of these issues now held by the University, $16,500 of the 1st mortgage issue and $5,000 of the second mortgage issue (the latter bond being personally endorsed by Mr. Hollis Rinehart) would be either taken up, or, exchanged for bonds of the new issue as the University may desire. On motion it was

RESOLVED, That the bonds of the R. S. Cole Motor Co. now held by the University, as set out above, be exchanged for like amounts of the new issue, with the $5,000 second mortgage bond being endorsed by Mr. Hollis Rinehart.

(Mr. Rinehart was excused from voting.)

The President reported that the University had issued its notes to the above corporations for the purchase of equipment for the University Press, and that there were now outstanding the following notes:

To the American Type Founders Corporation

* 32 notes of $41.64 including interest @ 6%
* 16 notes of $84.12 including interest @ 6%
* To the Mergenthaler Linotype Corporation
* 28 notes of $185.00 plus interest @ 6%,

that authority had been given by the Attorney General for the purchase of these notes from the endowment funds of the University, and that the Alumni Board of Trustees of the University of Virginia Endowment Fund desired to take over the said notes. This action was approved by the Board.

The meeting then adjourned.
