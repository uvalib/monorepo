## APPROVAL OF MINUTES OF MEETING OF THE BOARD OF VISITORS, ON MAY 13-15, 1999, AND JULY 23-24, 1999

On motion, the Minutes of the Board meetings of May 14-15, and July 23-24, were approved.

The Rector introduced The Honorable Wilbert Bryant, Secretary of Education of the Commonwealth. Secretary Bryant, who did not address the Board, stayed for the morning session of the Board meeting.

Mr. Robertson, in his capacity as a member of the Governor's Blue Ribbon Commission on Education, reported briefly on the work of the Commission. The Commission's final report is due in February and the Commission should finish its work in March.

The President gave a brief report on several matters. He remarked that the athletic programs at the University would receive stronger academic support than they have now. He also spoke of the need to strengthen the University's Intramural programs. He told the Board of recent discussions about the possibility of building a new arena in the center of Charlottesville. These discussions - with the potential developer and with the City - he said have gone as far as they can for the moment; the University appears to be the only major source of funds for the project. The problem now is to find a major donor or donors.

The President said the firm Korn-Ferry has been engaged to help in the search for a new Vice President for Information Technologies and Communication. Dr. Reynolds, the Interim Vice President, the President said is doing a fine job.

The Board at this meeting, the President pointed out, will begin discussion of how the University is to develop from the beginning of the new century. In addition to the four planning commissions already in place and at work, he said he envisions a fifth commission which, among other charges, will work on how to implement the recommendations of the present four commissions.

The Rector invited comments from Members after the meeting on whether the schedule of this meeting - Friday morning through midday Saturday - is satisfactory or whether the Board should return to its recent schedule of Thursday afternoon through midday Saturday. He also suggested that the Retreat next summer be held once more at Upper Brandon in Prince George County and in July, unless a meeting that month conflicts with Members' plans.

The Board resumed its meeting as a full Board at 1:50 p.m., in Open Session. All Members present for the morning session were in attendance, with the addition of William H. Goodwin, Jr.

The Board approved the following motions and went into Executive Session at 1:55 p.m.

* That the Educational Policy Committee of the Board of Visitors go into Executive Session for the purpose of discussing personnel matters pertaining to the appointment, assignment, reappointment, promotion, performance, compensation, discipline, separation and resignation of specific faculty members of the University of Virginia, as provided for in Section 2.1-344 (A) (1) of the Code of Virginia.

* That the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia go into Executive Session to consult with General Counsel on the status of pending and threatened litigation, as provided for in Section 2.1-344 (A)(7) of the Code of Virginia.

* That the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia go into Executive Session to discuss a personnel matter: specifically, the performance goals and assignments of Senior Management following completion of the University's Capital Campaign, as provided for in Section 2.1-344 (A)(1) of the Code of Virginia.

## GIFTS, GRANTS, AND CONTRACTS

The President reported on gifts and grants; his report essentially was a summary of giving during the fiscal year which ended on June 30th. Private giving during that year came to $122.2m and the total raised in the Campaign by June 30th was $946.9b. The President noted that the $1b Campaign goal probably will be reached around the beginning of 2000. The Report was accepted by the Board.

## STATEMENT BY THE RECTOR

The Rector read the following statement, adopted by the Board by resolution:

The Board of Visitors unanimously endorses the University's continuing commitment to recruiting and enrolling students of diverse talents and backgrounds. It also supports the changes made by the President in the University's undergraduate admission system. The admission system considers each applicant on the basis of his or her merits, in an equitable manner, and in accordance with law.

Every student admitted under our policies is qualified to attend. Each one deserves the finest education we can offer. By any measure, the University boasts one of the strongest student bodies in American higher education. Its students graduate on-time and on-track at higher rates than those at all but a handful of institutions. The academic successes of its African-American and other minority students are the envy of every major university. The system works. We are prepared to defend it.

Cultivating diversity within the University community takes commitment, but brings indisputable benefits. The Board and the administration consider maintaining diversity a top priority now and in the years to come.

The following resolution was adopted:
