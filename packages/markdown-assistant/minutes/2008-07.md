#### 7703

#### APPROVAL OF LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL – AMENDING THE GOVERNMENT DATA COLLECTION AND DISSEMINATION PRACTICES ACT AS IT PERTAINS TO THE COLLECTION OF DRIVER’S LICENSE NUMBERS

**RESOLVED, the Board of Visitors approves and endorses the proposed legislation to allow for the collection of driver’s license numbers from faculty, staff, and students.**

**The proposed legislation, which follows, would amend §** [**2.2-3808**](http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000+cod+23-76.1) **of the Code of Virginia:**

**§ 2.2-3808. Collection, disclosure, or display of social security number.**

**A. No agency shall require an individual to furnish or disclose his social security number or driver's license number unless the furnishing or disclosure of such number is (i) authorized or required by state or federal law and (ii) essential for the performance of that agency's duties. Nor shall any agency require an individual to disclose or furnish his social security account number not previously disclosed or furnished, for any purpose in connection with any activity, or to refuse any service, privilege or right to an individual wholly or partly because the individual does not disclose or furnish such number, unless the disclosure or furnishing of such number is specifically required by federal or state law.**

**B. Agency-issued identification cards, student identification cards, or license certificates issued or replaced on or after July 1, 2003, shall not display an individual's entire social security number except as provided in § 46.2-703.**

**C. Any agency-issued identification card, student identification card, or license certificate that was issued prior to July 1, 2003, and that displays an individual's entire social security number shall be replaced no later than July 1, 2006, except that voter registration cards issued with a social security number and not previously replaced shall be replaced no later than the December 31st following the completion by the state and all localities of the decennial redistricting following the 2010 census.**

**7704**

**This subsection shall not apply to (i) driver's licenses and special identification cards issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles pursuant to Chapter 3 (§ 46.2-300 et seq.) of Title 46.2 and (ii) road tax registrations issued pursuant to § 46.2-703.**

**D. The provisions of subsections A and C shall not be applicable to licenses issued by the State Corporation Commission's Bureau of Insurance until such time as a national insurance producer identification number has been created and implemented in all states. Commencing with the date of such implementation, the licenses issued by the State Corporation Commission's Bureau of Insurance shall be issued in compliance with subsection A of this section. Further, all licenses issued prior to the date of such implementation shall be replaced no later than 12 months following the date of such implementation.**

#### APPROVAL OF LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL – REPEALING THE REQUIREMENT THAT THE BOARD OF VISITORS REPORT ANNUALLY ON THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA’S PROGRESS

**RESOLVED, the Board of Visitors approves and endorses the proposed legislation to repeal the requirement that the Board of Visitors report annually on the progress of the University of Virginia.**

**The proposed legislation, which follows, would repeal § 23-80 of the Code of Virginia:**

**§ 23-80. Annual report of board.**

**The board shall, before the first day of October, annually, deliver to the Comptroller a report to the General Assembly of the progress of the University, its receipts and disbursements during the year ending on the first day of July preceding, and the amount of salary received by each professor, including fees received from the students.**

#### 7705

#### APPROVAL OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA’S COLLEGE AT WISE’S POLICY AND PROCEDURES TO COMPLY WITH HOUSE BILL 1058

RESOLVED, the Board of Visitors approves The University of Virginia’s College at Wise policy and procedures to comply with House Bill 1058, adopted by the Executive Committee of the Wise Board on July 8, 2008. The policy and procedures follow.

WHEREAS, House Bill 1058 was passed during the 2008 General Assembly Session to require the release of the educational record of a dependent student, as defined by 20 U.S.C. § 1232g, to a parent at his/her request; and

WHEREAS, 20 U.S.C. § 1232g, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (“FERPA”), generally defines “dependent student,” consistent with the Internal Revenue Code, as a student who does not provide over one-half of his/her own support for the calendar year in which the taxable year of the taxpayer begins; and

WHEREAS, the bill requires that the governing boards of each institution shall establish the policies and procedures necessary to comply with the legislation;

RESOLVED, in accordance with HB 1058 and commencing the effective date thereof on July 1, 2008, The University of Virginia’s College at Wise Board hereby affirms as College policy the aforesaid requirement to release the educational records of dependent students to their parents upon request, which shall be implemented as follows:

1. The University of Virginia’s College at Wise Office of Information Technology shall electronically solicit dependency status from all incoming and returning students and shall store such data on the College’s central student system of record; and

2. A parent also may provide his/her tax records to the College to demonstrate a student’s dependent status to ensure that such status is accurately recorded in the central student system of record; and

#### 7706

3. The College’s Provost and Senior Vice Chancellor shall designate the office within his/her division as being primarily responsible for collecting and responding to requests from parents of dependent students for academic records; and

4. The Vice Chancellor for Administration shall designate the office within his/her division as being primarily responsible for collecting and responding to requests from parents of dependent students for non-academic records; and

5. Appropriate personnel in the offices charged hereunder shall consult the College’s central student system of record to confirm a student’s dependent status prior to furnishing educational records to parents under this policy; and

6. The foregoing is subject at all times to the authority and direction of the College officials charged hereunder to develop and implement specific procedures as may be desirable or necessary including designating other College offices or personnel to respond to requests for records under this policy as may be necessary or appropriate under the circumstances.

#### ELECTION OF MR. BILLY K. CANNADAY, JR. TO THE FACULTY

RESOLVED that the following person is elected to the faculty:

Mr. Billy K. Cannaday, Jr. as Professor of Continuing and Professional Studies, for the period October 1, 2008 through May 31, 2014, at an annual salary of $250,000.

Sketch: Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University: B.A., 1972; Hampton University: M.Ed., 1980; Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University: Ed.D., 1990; State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 2006-2008; Distinguished Leader in Residence, University of Richmond Jepson School of Leadership, 2004-05; Superintendent of Chesterfield Public Schools, 2000-2006; Superintendent of Hampton Public Schools, 1994-2000.

#### 7707

#### APPOINTMENT

Mr. Billy K. Cannaday, Jr. as Dean, School of Continuing and Professional Studies, for the period October 1, 2008 through May 31, 2014.

The Board recessed for the day at 4:40 p.m.

### Saturday, July 26 – Session on University Facilities

The Board resumed its Retreat, in Open Session, at 9:05 a.m. The Hon. Lewis F. Payne, Chair of the Buildings and Grounds Committee, opened the session and asked Ms. Sheehy, Vice President for Management and Budget, to lead the discussion. Ms. Sheehy was assisted by David Neuman, Architect for the University; Tim Rose, Chief Executive Officer of the University of Virginia Foundation, and Donald Sundgren, Chief Facilities Officer for the University.

The discussion was centered on a thorough review of the University’s facilities – their location and condition, operation and maintenance, considerations of new construction versus renovation, maximizing current space, addressing future space needs, and so on. The role of the UVa Foundation was considered and there was a discussion of the use of the University’s historic structures.

In summary, the several schools of the University in general will have adequate space by 2011, though future growth will require more space and special facilities are needed (as, for example, a new museum, concert hall, drama and music facility). The condition of current space generally is acceptable in many areas and renovations already planned will address conditions elsewhere. The Medical School and the Alderman Library will require some attention, however. Emphasis should be placed on renovating existing facilities and there is room to grow within the existing Grounds if space is utilized properly. Parking, however, will continue to be an issue.

#### 7708

Mr. Wynne and Mr. Payne commended the presenters on their work, and Mr. Payne singled out Mr. Neuman for his work not only on the presentation, but on his work as Architect since he has been at the University.

***

On motion, the Board adjourned at 11:40 a.m.

## ATTACHMENT I

(The President’s Annual Report)

**John T. Casteen III**\
**Annual Report, 2007-2008**\
**Prepared for the Board of Visitors**

This report should be read alongside Mr. Sandridge’s annual report on the University’s financial condition and the University’s annual report (www.virginia.edu/president/report07).

### Introduction

FY08 was a year of (1) returns on several long-term undertakings; (2) following several years when searches often did not go well, seamless successions in several key leadership positions, particularly in core academic functions; (3) completion of needed facilities following sustained effort over several years; (4) improvements in our financial condition because of implementation of restructuring and other new financial freedoms enacted by the General Assembly; (5) continuing growth in available non-state revenues from both endowment income and vigorous progress in annual and other cash giving; (6) a successful capital campaign now beyond its mid-point and (perhaps counter-intuitively) gaining momentum despite a tough economy; and (7) completion of several major building projects, with others now commencing. This report deals with each of these topics in greater detail, and with some of my own activities in other areas.

The broad leadership transition of FY08 may prove to be the most significant of these mile marks. Dr. Garson became provost in July 2007. In the year since he assumed his new duties, we have found, thoroughly vetted, and appointed five new deans: Paul Mahoney, Law; Meredith Woo, College; Dorrie Fontaine, Nursing; Steven DeKosky, Medicine; and Billy Cannaday, Continuing and Professional Studies. Tom Skalak has become vice president for research. He has added considerable stature to that function and accepted broad new responsibilities, not least among them responsibility for fund-raising for the sciences and for graduate education. We will soon appoint a new vice provost for international programs, this officer also to assume considerably greater responsibility. We hope to appoint the first dean of the Batten School in the fall. By the time these appointments are completed, we will have installed nine new academic leaders—or 10, if we include Bob Pianta, who was named dean of the Curry School in May 2007, just prior to Dr. Garson’s appointment. Assuming their new duties almost simultaneously, these persons have brought fresh perspectives, bold ideas, and strong visions to the University—all necessary components of growth and progress within the academic enterprise. These searches and the planning that preceded them and occurred during them went forward with awareness of Mr. Sandridge’s and my own eventual departures from our offices. This new generation of leaders will guide the University into the next decade and beyond. Mr. Sandridge and I have been meeting with Mr. Fralin and Mr. Wynne at regular intervals throughout the year to ensure that we meet the Board’s expectations for orderly, planned transitions.

Dr. Garson and Mr. Sandridge assumed responsibility in the spring of 2007 for completing a broad academic plan. The Commission on the Future of the University presented preliminary findings at the February 2008 Board meeting, and the Board passed a resolution supporting the broad strategies at that meeting. This spring and summer, commission members are refining initiatives, preparing budgets, and proposing metrics to measure progress. Commission chairs will make final recommendations at the Board’s October 2008 meeting.

The commission’s report is published online at www.virginia.edu/planningdocuments/commission. Assuming that we use it consistently, this document will be a blueprint for work done during the next decade and beyond. Like any good plan, it will require regular assessment and retuning. No doubt some parts of it will change, and other parts will turn out to have missed some point as future events change the landscape. Those things said, the driver of progress in a collegial environment is constant attention to planning and consensus—a quality embedded as deeply in this plan as in the VA2020 plans whose life spans are now winding down. We learned in the school of hard knocks of the early 1990s that the University cannot be all things to all people—that leaders must acknowledge hard choices and stand accountable for hard decisions. Our strategy is to strengthen core resources while funding selected new efforts that will further distinguish the University. To the extent that we plan and choose well, we will build a strong foundation for future excellence.

**During FY08 we made additional commitments to science and engineering. The Board has endorsed three major research buildings —one for Medicine, one for Engineering, and one for the College and Graduate School. Together, these buildings add more than 195,000 square feet of research space to lab buildings already planned for Engineering and Medicine, bringing the total capacity now in design or construction to some 300,000 square feet. These new buildings will support and sustain ongoing faculty work and attract new talent at all levels. Among other recommendations, the planning commission has identified science and technology as critical areas for building strength and further distinguishing the University from its competitors. In these uncommonly expensive and important fields, we have good motives to use scarce resources efficiently and to adopt or adapt best practices from elsewhere as we build new strength here.**

The restructuring legislation brought new responsibilities of several kinds. These include promoting economic development, particularly in SW Virginia, improving public schools whose performance has declined in recent years, and perhaps most notably meeting students’ need for financial aid to bridge the gap between demonstrated need and whatever state and federal sources may provide.

AccessUVa, the Board’s successful strategy to meet financial need that state and federal providers previously covered, has become a national model of success, albeit a costly one. AccessUVa enabled some 848 students to enter in 2007. The total cost of the program this year was $53.8 million. Our agreement with VCCS guarantees admission, based on satisfactory grades in specified required courses, to graduates of Virginia’s 23 community colleges. The agreement is having a measurable effect: in 2005-06, we had 193 new VCCS transfers; in 2006-07, we had 234; in 2007-08, we had 300. As we have gained new freedoms because of restructuring, we have recommitted ourselves to ensuring access and affordability for all students who are academically qualified to come to the University. The Board’s initiative in creating AccessUVa was ahead of the field. National media frequently acknowledge that, and rank us with the nation’s best.

During FY08, an unusual concurrence of factors has shaped for us a moment of great opportunity. A rising generation of new University leaders; priorities and recommendations from the planning commission; the restructured relationship with the state; a stable financial base and renewal of our triple-A bond ratings; excellent returns on investments from the last capital campaign, and strengthening of the endowment—these events of the current moment have energized the community and provided momentum for the second half of the capital campaign.

### University Finances

*Tuition*. In-state undergraduate students will pay 9.9% higher tuition and fees in the fall of 2008 than they did last fall. Out-of-state undergraduate students will pay 6.6% more; in-state graduate students, 8% more; and out-of-state graduate students, 4.2%. These increases track the long-term plan adopted by the Board in 2005. They are roughly in the middle of increases in competitive universities.

*Endowment*. Although UVIMCO’s performance continues to compare well against its peers, results have not been as strong this year as in previous years. As of May 31, 2008, UVIMCO oversaw the investment of $5.2 billion, which includes the University’s endowment and foundation assets as well as current funds invested in the long-term pool. (These totals do not include other assets such as the Boar’s Head Inn properties and the unsold Kluge lands.) Total return for the eleven months ended May 31, 2008, was 7.8%.

*Medical Center Finances*. The Medical Center’s budget is 44% of our total budget. The hospital’s operating margin for FY08 is expected to be 3.3% to 4.0%, which falls short of the budget target. Predicted average operating margins of 4.2% are in the financial plans for the next six years. In addition, the Medical Center continues to be recognized nationally for its leadership in operational, clinical, and quality performance.

***Debt and AAA Ratings.* In May 2008, in connection with our issuance of $235 million of bonds for construction projects, the three major rating agencies (Standard & Poor's, Moody's, and Fitch) confirmed our long-term debt rating of AAA or the equivalent. Among public universities, only the University of Texas System has the same profile. The University of Michigan has AAA ratings from two of the major rating agencies. The rating agencies’ commentaries highlight the University’s “prestigious academic reputation,” “impressive” student demand, “substantial balance sheet resources” (including a sizable endowment and historically low levels of debt), “strong record of fund-raising,” “historically good financial performance” including healthy operating performance at the University’s medical center, and “reduced dependence on state support” for general operations and capital projects.**

**In 2003, when we exited the state’s VCBA program for debt financing, we implemented a new debt portfolio program. VCBA’s bonds are 20-year fixed-rate bonds. Our new debt program uses a portfolio of floating-rate and fixed-rate bonds of varying maturities and repayment structures, as well as commercial paper (CP). After five years, we have the only CP program among Commonwealth agencies. This debt-portfolio approach has enabled us to reduce interest costs significantly. For example, our 2003 floating-rate bonds alone have generated $8.3 million of savings when compared with the cost if the same amount had been issued as fixed-rate bonds. If we had received approval to structure the entire 2003 issue as variable-rate bonds, we would have saved another $11.7 million over the last five years. To manage the greater market risk, we have built a reserve against floating rates. Ultimately, excess funds in these reserves can be recommitted for University priorities.**

***Impact of the 2007 Investment Legislation*. A 2007 Code amendment, effective July 1, 2007, allows us to invest University funds generally in equities and long-term corporate bonds. Previously, investment of funds that were not gifts or investment income was dictated by the Investment of Public Funds Act (IPFA). During this first year, we moved several large reserves that traditionally had been invested in UVIMCO’s IPFA-compliant Aggregate Cash Pool into equity funds, such as the UVIMCO Long-Term Pool. The higher return on these investments has had the anticipated effects: investing our Health Insurance Reserves for a higher return will moderate next year’s (and succeeding years’) increases in employer and employee premiums, providing a financial benefit to employees and freeing up University funds for other purposes. Similarly, higher returns on our Capital Renewal Pool have allowed us to attain more quickly our targeted reserves to buffer interest-rate volatility, with the surplus available to be released for other University uses. The third large pool that we now invest for higher return is the Medical Center’s depreciation reserve. Bond counsel approved the transfer of this reserve from the state to the University in May 2005, but there was no financial advantage to transferring it without the ability to invest beyond the constraints of the IPFA. With the new investment legislation, we began in the spring of this year to transfer an amount from this trust into UVIMCO’s Long-Term Pool. Over the next three years, we expect to recoup $300 million to be invested as a quasi-endowment.**

***Ongoing Financial Effects of Restructuring*. The restructuring legislation allows us to invest certain non-general-fund reserves that were previously invested by the State Treasurer, who distributed the earned interest to us and other state agencies. Ms. Reynolds has developed a vehicle to (1) provide higher investment returns to the units that hold these reserves, and (2) generate new revenues to fund central University priorities. Called the Internal Bank, this new vehicle gives our constituent units access to liquidity when it is needed, and to short- and medium-term market rates on their reserves. In turn, the Internal Bank pools the liquidity requirements, thereby reducing the necessity of holding all these reserves in overnight funds. Using our new computer system and cash models, we can now invest some of these reserves for an extended period in higher-return vehicles, as the 2007 investment legislation allows. Using this mechanism, we expect to earn considerable new revenues to fund central University priorities.**

***Facilities and Administrative (F\&A) Rate Negotiation.* Ms. Reynolds negotiates our facilities and administrative (F\&A) rate (i.e., overhead rate) with the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), which is our cognizant federal agency for government-sponsored research awards. (Each university that receives federal R\&D funding is assigned a cognizant agency as a means of verifying consistent treatment of multiple supported programs.) Through 2003, our F\&A rate was 48%, the national average for state universities. In 2001, we changed our approach to the negotiations and finalized a three-year agreement, followed by a two-year extension through 2008. This agreement increased our F\&A rate from 48% to between 51.5% and 52.5% each year. Assuming no growth in the research base expenditure, each 1% increase in the F\&A rate nets $1.3 million to the University. With assumptions of modest research growth and phased-in changes in the rate, we expected the new agreement to yield cumulative incremental recoveries of $36 million for the five years FY04 - FY08, but after four years the actual additional F\&A revenue totals $42.6 million. This revised estimate means that over five years we should receive cumulative increased revenues of $53 million instead of the $36 million originally calculated.**

We are entering a new negotiation cycle with DHHS. The first step was to submit a proposal for new F\&A rates based on actual costs compiled for our base year, FY07, and allocated using a model mandated by the Office of Management and Budget. We submitted this proposal in March 2008. During the next 12 months and following completion of the DHHS audit, the next negotiation will occur. Since the 2003 negotiation, we have incurred significant capital construction costs for non-research buildings. Consequently, we experienced an increased allocation of facilities costs to non-research buildings and a corresponding reduced allocation to research buildings. We were able to justify proposing an F\&A rate of only 53.3% for research. It should be noted that the average “haircut” (reduction from proposed to audited/negotiated rates) was 5.3% for our region’s DHHS negotiations in 2006-2007. We expect, however, to negotiate a rate between 49% and 50%. Growth in F\&A revenues in the next contract period will have to come primarily from increase in research volume instead of an increase in the rate. Negotiation strategy will be finalized over the next few months.

### Fund-raising

Although philanthropic cash flow decreased by 5.24% to $256 million through May 2008, cash flow is up nearly 25% from FY06. This reflects record cash flow in FY07, including substantial gifts from the Ivy Foundation ($45 million), Phillip Morris USA ($25 million), Richard and Sherry Sharp ($10 million) and Frank Batten ($5 million pledge payment on $100 million pledge). We remain on course to increase the base for annual giving to $350 million by the end of the current campaign and to reach our cash-flow goal of $275 million in FY08.

The campaign total is $1.69 billion at the end of May 2008. This figure includes $1.54 billion in gifts and pledges and $150 million in future support. We have met 56.3% of our $3 billion goal in 55% of time elapsed. A good all-in estimate for July 1 is $1.72 billion.

Recent notable gifts include a $4 million pledge payment from the Claude Moore Charitable Foundation, and a $4 million bequest from the estate of Robert C. Hancock for U.Va.-Wise.

Other notable gifts in FY08 include: $35 million in pledge payments from Batten Foundation and $15 million in pledge payments from Frank Batten, Sr., for the Batten School; $7.92 million gift-in-kind from Albert Small representing residual interest not previously transferred in the Small Library’s First Edition, First Printing of the Declaration of Independence; $6.7 million, associated with longtime donors Mrs. Hunter Smith and the late Carl Smith: the former Amvest headquarters building at the Boar’s Head Inn; and $7,535,954 from Paul T. and Sonia Jones.

A full list of major gifts in FY08 appears in an appendix at the end of the narrative portion of this report.

*President’s Fund for Excellence*. Authorized as an emergency measure by the Board as part of our response to the loss of $52 billion in state General Fund in 2002, and subsequently made permanent as a means to provide one-time, unique, and short-term funding when base budget is not available for significant activities, this fund has become an essential tool. We use it to finance the most critical faculty-retention commitments, to finance otherwise unbudgeted but essential expenditures for research technology, to fund development activities when other funds are not available, as necessary to cover operational needs resulting from state budget cuts, and to finance other strategic initiatives while Dr. Garson and Mr. Sandridge develop permanent base funding. Disbursements last year, among other objects, included operating support for the College of Arts and Sciences (funds originally requested for graduate student fellowships but diverted by the interim dean to other objects), and another sum to address deficiencies in budgeting for required modern language courses—a recurring problem; the Miller Center; the Library, including the Clemons Library refurbishment and landscaping, part of the cost of transporting the Weicker papers to Special Collections following Sen. Weicker’s gift of the papers, and a rare, complete series of the Virginia Gazette; and the Virginia Quarterly Review, which Dr. Garson and Mr. Sandridge are phasing to normal base budget support. The fund also provided support for the Academic Chair Leadership Program; a new Faculty Orientation Program; the Southwest Virginia Economic Development Plan (restructuring); and faculty support, including Hunter Rawlings’ appointment as a part-year University Professor, and the Architecture School’s Learning Barge project.

Commitments for 2008-09 include ongoing funding for the Academic Chair Leadership Program; the Faculty Orientation Program; the Southwest Virginia Economic Development Plan; Global Health Scholar Awards; and last-resort scholarships for students in University study-abroad programs. We will provide new support for an archaeological research project and for the Woodson Institute’s fellowships and programs, as well as salary support for various personnel as they move to unfunded lines that will eventually acquire base funding within the budget. I have made a $1 million commitment for the new College dean’s initiatives.

### The State Budget and Salaries

The 2007 budget bill authorized salary increases of 4% for staff members, administrative and professional faculty members, teaching and research (T\&R) faculty members, and graduate teaching assistants, but made no provision for the second year of the biennium. The Board provided additional funds to address compensation shortfalls for staff. The 2008 budget bill authorizes salary increases of 2% for staff members, administrative and professional and T\&R faculty members, and graduate teaching assistants.

***

### Faculty and Staff Compensation

In 2003-04, the Board adopted the goal of increasing faculty compensation to market levels by 2006-07. In FY05, the Board defined market level as a position between the 15th and 19th ranks among AAU universities. Since that time, supplements approved by the Board have allowed us to close the gap between our average T\&R faculty salary and the average paid at the university ranked 19th in salaries among AAU universities from $7,000 in 2002-03 to $700 in 2007-08.

Because the state-authorized increase for FY09 is only 2%, the gap between the 19th rank in the AAU survey and the University average salary will increase during FY09. Accordingly, the Board has asked us to further examine our options and bring forward a recommendation of how to address this issue.

For the sixth year, the Board has allocated $250,000 to address staff compensation inequities and deficiencies. This fund is designated for increases for employees whose salaries fall in the lower third of the salary distribution for similar positions and whose increases are not provided by the state.

### Academic Matters

**Faculty Recruitment Status Report by Gender (as of 5/20/08):** During academic year 2007-08, 113 offers were made for tenure and tenure-track faculty positions at the University. Of those offers, 70 offers (62%) were extended to men and 43 offers (38%) were extended to women. Sixty-six percent of the offers made to men were accepted, and 62% of the offers made to women were accepted. Ms. Fraser, the vice provost for faculty advancement, has designed and implemented a declination survey to track why offered candidates turn us down. Preliminary findings suggest that one significant factor for many candidates has been a lack of available employment for candidate spouses/partners. This barrier is commonplace in universities not located in major urban areas. As one of several strategies to remedy this problem, we recently became a founding member of the Mid-Atlantic Higher Education Recruitment Consortium (HERC). HERC supports the efforts of member institutions to recruit and retain outstanding faculty administrators and staff through the sharing of information and resources. Membership in HERC will strengthen our competitive edge in hiring and retention, and will give us opportunities to interact with regional colleagues and stay on top of best practices and national trends in faculty development.

### Separations During the 2007 - 2008 Academic Year (as of 6/13/08)

Sixty-three tenured and untenured tenure track faculty separated from the University (21 female, 42 male). This represents an 8% decrease over totals reported for Academic Years 06-07, but this number will climb slightly as final numbers come in over the summer. Of these, one was African-American (female); 2 were Asian-American (one female, one male); 57 were white (17 female, 40 male); one was Hispanic/Latino (male) and two were of unspecified race/ethnicity (both female).

### Faculty Mentoring and Career Development

During academic year 20007-08, Ms. Fraser offered a variety of programs for new faculty, including a year-long series of activities and for newly hired tenure track faculty called “Getting Started at U.Va.” Ms. Fraser also conducts a year-long development program for department chairs called the Institute for Leadership Excellence in Academic Departments (ILEAD). Participating chairs enhance their leadership and management expertise, increase their knowledge of the organization and fiscal policies, form relationships with other leaders throughout the University, and develop solutions for effective departments. With the Teaching Resource Center, Ms. Fraser developed the Professors as Writers Program that gives faculty members the opportunity to work on their writing skills through workshops, grants for editorial or coaching support, and resources and support for peer writing groups.

### Academic Quality Assurance: Reaffirmation of Accreditation

In December 2007, we successfully completed the decennial reaffirmation of the University’s general (i.e., regional). This process covers all schools and all functions. The Commission approved us with no conditions attached. This followed significant remedial actions taken during the reaccreditation process to address past non-compliance with the federally-mandated procedures for gaining approval of substantive changes in academic programs. The Commission reviewed and accepted a new internal monitoring mechanism prepared by Dr. Garson and Ms. Phillips early last fall, as well as a process-management system developed with Ms. Deily’s support. With regard to substantive changes, the Commission is tightening oversight of all member institutions in order to comply strictly with federal law. Although this results in more stringent requirements with which the University must comply, I am comfortable that Dr. Garson and his colleagues will keep us in compliance going forward. With the reaffirmation now in hand, we must now implement our Quality Enhancement Plan (QEP), which aims to strengthen student-faculty engagement. Dr. Garson and Mr. Adams will lead this effort.

***

### Professional School Accreditations in 2007-08

The Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) has reaccredited the B.S. degree program in Aerospace Engineering and the B.S. degree program in the School of Engineering and Applied Science, both until 2011.

***

### NRC Rankings

The Office of the Vice President for Research and Graduate Studies managed our submissions for the National Research Council rankings. These rankings, published approximately every decade, assess research doctorate programs in the United States. The 2007 assessment, representing a substantial increase in the scale and scope of data collection, has been completed. Thirty-nine U.Va. doctoral programs participated in the assessment. More than 800 U.Va. faculty received questionnaires, and 88% responded (2% above the national average). In addition, more than 300 doctoral candidates received questionnaires, and 73% responded (1% above the national average). The NRC is expected to release the final report in late September 2008.

***

### NSF Rankings

The most recent annual NSF research expenditure rankings (FY06) place us 48th in total federal R\&D expenditures. Our countable external federal R\&D expenditures have increased from $199 million to $204 million. Our ranking as to scale among all research universities for total research expenditures is 72nd. Our total research expenditures have increased from $235 million to $239 million.

***

### International Activities

Our current study-abroad sites include Australia, the Bahamas, Brazil, El Salvador, Egypt, China, Costa Rica, France, Germany, Ghana, Ireland, Italy, Jamaica, Jordan, Morocco, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Peru, South Africa, Spain, Tanzania, Tibet, and the United Kingdom. In addition, we maintain exchange agreements with some 50 universities in 20 countries. Students in these exchange programs pay tuition to U.Va. for credits earned abroad.

Some 1,900 University students studied abroad in 2007-2008. This year saw an increase of undergraduate student participation in semester-long programs. Fall semester saw an increase of 21%, while spring semester participation rose by 17%. Summer and J-term enrollments continue to be strong and steady.

While the top three destinations this year were in Western Europe (Spain, United Kingdom, and Italy), China tied with France as #4, and Peru tied with Ireland as the #5 destination for the first time. The numbers for Latin America continue to increase. Our chief areas of opportunity for the near future appear to be Latin America and Asia. Our well-established programs, such as the ones in Jordan, Lyon, Peru, and Valencia, are gaining national prestige and are attracting larger numbers of students who are pursuing their degrees elsewhere. The number of non-U.Va. students in our programs increased by 11% in 2007-2008. In 2007-2008, we continued to expand programs with specific academic focus, specifically targeting majors that have been historically underrepresented in study abroad.

Some graduate and professional schools are beginning to add international components to their programs. The McIntire School of Commerce has built an international experience into its masters-level programs. Nursing is developing Global Health Partnerships. Medicine is actively facilitating overseas medical rotations for students and residents. Engineering has launched an Office of International Programs, and has assigned one faculty member in each department to counsel students on international studies. Medicine, Nursing, and Engineering are currently collaborating on an innovative J-term program in Guatemala. These steps acknowledged, we continue to lag behind peer universities in developing programs of this kind. See my annual goals at the end of this report.

### Semester at Sea

Our partnership with the Institute for Shipboard Education and its Semester at Sea program continues to grow. Nine University faculty members are participating in this summer’s voyage. Karen Ryan is the academic dean. Future academic deans will include: Len Schoppa (Politics), fall 2008; Reg Garrett (Biology), spring 2009; Michael Smith (Politics), summer 2009; Robert Chapel (Drama), fall 2009; and Mark White (Commerce), spring 2010.

Some 21 U.Va. students are on board this summer, and 10 or so are registered for the fall voyage. Heretofore, we have not actively encouraged our own students to enroll in this program. We will begin focused efforts to raise these numbers in the fall. A proposal for flat-tuition for our native or currently enrolled students is in design. This model would permit in-state students who are receiving financial aid to go on voyages.

### Universitas 21

U21 celebrated its 10th anniversary last year, with Delhi University, the newest member, bringing the total number of institutions in the network to 22. Peter Low continues to serve as the University’s U21 Manager, directing our activities in U21, as he has since we joined the network in August 2001. Tim Garson will soon assume these duties.

I will continue serving as Chair of U21 LBG through the Annual Meeting in May 2009. Universitas 21 LBG is the corporate entity that manages the affairs of the network, Universitas 21. As chair of the network, I am also chair of the company, Universitas 21. Universitas 21 LBG manages licensing arrangements between members and U21Global and oversees academic programs offered by U21Global through U21pedagogica Ltd (a wholly-owned subsidiary quality assurance company). At the Annual Meeting in May 2008, I was appointed to the U21 Global Board, and I left the Boards of U21 Equity and U21pedagogica. U21pedagogica has its offices and staff here. Peter Low chairs that Board.

After hosting the 4th annual U21 Summer Conference on student research here in July 2007 – the most successful program yet, with 80 participants from 17 U21 institutions – we have sent five students and one faculty member to the 2008 Summer School at the University of Birmingham. This is a program for graduate students and their advisors.

U21’s collaborations include OECD (most recently a conference on human capital development with a major presentation by Gerald Baliles); ACCA (the international accountancy organization) which sponsors several U21 events, including the summer conference here; the UN (a second annual symposium on UN Millennium Development Goals, held this year at University College Dublin, on “*Strategic Partnerships with the Developing World: A New Direction for Universitas 21 in Research and Education,”* with Dr. Garson and several other faculty members participating and making presentations—see the following paragraph); the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, AIFOMD (a global organization training trainers for UN MDGs); and the International Association of Humanitarian Medicine (co-sponsoring the “*Global Partnership in UN MDG Education and Implementation Workshop”* to be held at the University in September in conjunction with the 2008 U21 Health Sciences Annual Meeting here). In addition, U21 cosponsors an innovative low-tech telemedicine program with the Swinfen Charitable Trust. Swinfen links local practitioners in isolated and distressed areas by email and digital imaging with Medical School faculty members who provide consultations but receive no fees.

The UN’s Millennium Development Goals have been endorsed by the US Government and accepted as goals for collaborative work by the AAU, NASULGC, U21, and other NGOs. This set of goals will come up repeatedly during the next several years. The goals are: to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger; to achieve universal primary education; to promote gender equality and empower women; to reduce child mortality; to improve maternal health; to combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases; to ensure environmental sustainability; and to develop a global partnership for development.
