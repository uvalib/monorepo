## Approval of the Minutes of the April 13, 2007 Meeting of the Board of Visitors

On motion, the Minutes of the Board meeting held on April 13th, were approved.

## Election of the Vice Rector

Pursuant to the terms set forth in the Manual of the Board of Visitors, the Rector asked the Secretary to conduct the election of the Vice Rector.

Ms. Key nominated Mr. Wynne for the position. There being no other nominations, the Secretary closed the nominations and took a roll call vote. All Members present voted for Mr. Wynne, and the Secretary declared him elected.

## Election of the Executive Committee

Noting that this meeting is the designated Annual Meeting of the Board, the Rector reminded Members that at the Annual Meeting, the Executive Committee must be elected, special committees extended (special committees must be extended annually) and the standing committees appointed.

The Rector proposed the following slate for the Executive Committee: the Rector (Mr. Fralin), the Vice Rector (Mr. Wynne), Mr. Caputo, Ms. Dorsey, Mr. Farrell, and Mr. Fitz-Hugh. Their terms are to begin on July 1st.

The Rector called for a motion to approve consideration of additions to the published Agenda of the meeting.

On motion, the following resolution was adopted:

RESOLVED that the Board of Visitors approves the addition of items to the Agenda for consideration by the Board.

## The Tragedy at Virginia Tech

Noting that the tragedy that occurred at Virginia Tech on April 16th, is on the minds of all Virginians, the Rector told the Board that he, the President, and others attended the memorial services in Blacksburg and that there were memorial services in Charlottesville, both in local churches and at the University. He said that a number of University staff went to Blacksburg to help out and that there was a general outpouring of grief and sympathy from students and faculty at the University.

He asked for a moment of silence for the victims at Virginia Tech and encouraged Members to reflect on the bonds that unite the two schools, bonds which have been strengthened by the events of April 16th. That strengthening, he said, is a very positive thing.

## NCAA Orientation

The Rector reminded Members that once a year, the Board invites someone from the Athletics Department to review with the Board the its responsibilities toward the University athletic programs. Essentially, he said, this means a review of the Board obligations under the NCAA rules and a listing of what Members can and cannot do, particularly with regard to recruiting.

The orientation was conducted by Mr. William S. Flippen, Jr., Director of Compliance in the Department of Athletics. His summary of the NCAA rules is appended to these Minutes as Attachment A.

## Introduction of Coaches

Mr. Littlepage, Director of Athletics, introduced three coaches whose teams have had successful seasons this year: Mr. Brian Boland, Head Coach of Men Tennis; Ms. Julie Myers, Head Coach of Women Lacrosse, and Mr. Kevin Sauer, Head Coach of Women Rowing. Mr. Boland spoke, briefly, on behalf of his two colleagues.

## President Report

### Security Efforts

### Personnel Changes

### The Batten School

The Rector asked the President to give his customary report.

The President reviewed briefly the security efforts in progress at the University as a result of the shootings at Virginia Tech. These include:

* Clarifying operating procedures for the immediate cancellation of classes and the closing of the University to all but essential personnel.
* Creation of an emergency management office.
* Planning for upgraded security requirements for all new buildings and those scheduled for renovation.
* Conducting in-service training for faculty, student affairs staff, and others on laws regarding the admission and retention of students who seem potentially dangerous.
* Reviewing policies on employee terminations or disciplinary actions to minimize the risk of violence and to protect staff.
* Accelerating the installation of a student/employee notification system that simultaneously distributes text, e-mail, and web messages to cell phones.
* Exploring the installation of a Grounds-wide siren and public address system to warn of imminent danger.

The President then noted several personnel changes: Dr. Garson, the Dean of the School of Medicine, will become the Provost this summer; Dr. Sharon Hostler, currently Associate Dean of the School of Medicine, will serve as Dean ad-interim.

Mr. Robert Pianta will become Dean of the Curry School of Education this summer; Mr. Breneman, the current Dean, will remain on the faculty.

Ms. Lancaster, the Dean of the School of Nursing since 1989, will step down next year. Ms. Stallard, the Dean of the School of Continuing and Professional Studies, will leave at the end of the summer to become the President of Strayer University in Washington.

The President told the Board that he hopes the new Dean of Arts & Sciences will be named shortly.

The President then described the work being done on the planning and implementation of the Batten School. There is a large committee at work; the co-chairs of the committee are Mr. Breneman, the current Dean of the Curry School, and Mr. Eric Patashnik of the Politics Department. The co-chairs have met with faculty at the Center for Public Leadership at the Kennedy School at Harvard, and with faculty at Duke and Berkeley.

The five-year BA/MPP program in public policy, which was created before the Batten gift was made but which in due course will become part of the Batten School, will enroll its first class this fall. There are 30 students in the entering class, all rising fourth year students from a variety of undergraduate majors.

## Gifts and Grants Report

### RESOLUTION ACCEPTING THE GIFTS AND GRANTS REPORT

Turning to his customary gifts and grants report, the President said that philanthropic giving to the University of Virginia and its related foundations was $249 million for the fiscal year through April 30th, an increase of $57 million, or 29.7%, over the same period last year.

Among the significant gifts received since the April Board meeting are $1,894,109 in deferred giving and for unrestricted use from Susan S. and John O. Wynne. The Wallace H. Coulter Foundation has made a $1,000,000 grant for the Translational Research Partnership Fund between the Medical and Engineering Schools.

RESOLVED, the Report of Private Gifts for the period March 1, 2007 - April 30, 2007, is accepted.

The Preliminary Meeting ended at 9:55 a.m.

## Mr. and Mrs. Schwartz on the "Role of Parents at the University"

Ms. Dorsey, as Chair of the Student Affairs and Athletics Committee, asked Ms. Lampkin, Vice President for Student Affairs, to introduce Ms. Sheryl and Mr. Barry Schwartz of Oakton in Fairfax County.

Mr. and Mrs. Schwartz have been members of the Parents Committee, the Annual Giving Advisory Board and founding members of UVa Families, among other organizations at the University. Their son Robert, who was an Echols Scholar, took his B.A. in 2005 and their daughter, Lauren, has just completed her first year in the College.

Under the general heading of Role of Parents at the University, Mr. and Mrs. Schwartz described some of their experiences and impressions of the University, as well as their children. It was a positive report by enthusiastic supporters of the University who are not alumni, and was well received by the Board.
