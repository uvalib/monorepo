A special meeting of the Rector and Visitors was held on this date with the following members present:

* The Rector, C. H. Walker
* Visitors, Duke, McIntire, Miss. McVea, Oliver, Williams and the President.

The President announced the following attendance for the session 1922-23

Prof. Fiske Kimball, Supervising Architect, submitted a memorandum on the cost and income of the Faculty Apartment House; also a memorandum regarding two extra items of cost on the New Gymnasium amounting to $2,017.75. The memorandum of cost of construction of the Apartment House shows the total estimate of $82,999.18, with some further necessary expenses of grading, putting in walks and approaches, which would bring the total sum up to about $84,000.00, income from rentals $11,580.00; interest on investment, insurance and other operating charges $6,464.50; net income $5,115.50.

With respect to the foregoing the following resolution was adopted:

**RESOLVED,** That the President be and he is hereby directed to apply to the Alumni Board of Trustees to increase the appropriation for the erection of the Faculty Apartment House to a sum not to exceed $84,000 to complete and improve the said building.

With respect to the New Gymnasium Prof. Kimball reported an expenditure of $1,677.10 for increased depth and spread of footings where water was encountered, and $340.65 net increase in plumbing and heating matters, primarily for the installation necessary at this time, of drains needed for the future swimming pool equipment. These amounts being in addition to the original appropriation and the same were approved.

The Architect's fee of $2,800.00 for plans, specifications and supervision of construction of the Faculty Apartment House, estimated as 4% on the contract price of $70,000.00 was approved, which amount was included in the estimated cost of the structure.

Messrs. McIntire and Duke, a special Committee appointed in connection with the study of the general development of the Hospital and Medical School group, reported that at a meeting on July 24th, 1922 it was understood and agreed that Dr. Fiske Kimball is to have for the design for the general development of the Hospital and Medical School group a compensation of from $350.00 to $500.00 as he may name, and for the designs, working drawings and specifications of the proposed wing, called the McIntire Wing, his compensation is to be 4% on contract price. The foregoing report was approved.

Prof. Fiske Kimball presented a preliminary sketch of his study of the development of the Hospital and Medical School group, which was examined by the members present, but no action was taken in connection with the same.

With regard to the construction of the new McIntire Wing to the Hospital, bids for which were opened this day, Prof. Kimball reported the lowest bid to be $84,831.00, and as this sum was so in excess of the fund donated for its erection, the matter was re-committed for further study and report to a later meeting.

Prof. Charles Hancock submitted the following report on the cost of heating with a view to making recommendations as to a fair distribution of charges for heat.

I have made very careful study of the cost of heating to the University from the new central station with a view to making recommendation as to a fair distribution of charges for heat.

The following results are actual costs to the University per one hundred square feet of radiation:

To the fixed charge there should be added a charge for coal. Estimates show 2.4 tons of coal per heating season required for each one hundred square feet of radiation. Our contract price of coal this year is $5.16 per ton, but there seems to be little probability of getting coal now at so low a price.

It would seem that the fairest way to manage the very variable item of coal would be to charge each season the actual cost of coal to the University, charging to each one hundred square feet of radiation 2.4 tons per season at the current price.

It will be of interest to you to know that the new heating system is now in operation in East Range, East Lawn, Rotunda, West Lawn, West Range, Cafeteria, Peabody Hall. Within a few weeks installation will have been completed in the Biological Laboratory, Medical Hall and Nurses' Home. Of the present buildings south of Ivy Road there will remain only the three large buildings at the southern end of the Lawn, the old infirmary and the Brooks Museum to be equipped for hot water heating from the central station.

I will take this occasion to call your attention to the fact that the present boiler capacity is insufficient for any addition of radiation. If additions to the present radiation are contemplated, such for example as the new wing of the hospital, provision should be made for increasing the boiler capacity.

The Board approved the general principle of basing the charges for heat to the residences and other buildings on the grounds to $7.50 per 100 square feet of radiation to cover actual cost of operations plus actual cost of coal.

Prof. Charles Hancock brought to the attention of the Board a claim of W. E. Beaton, night watchman during the Summer Quarter, who fell into an open ditch in which construction of pipe line for the heating system was in progress, covering damage to clothing, medical attention and loss of time in the total sum of $60.00. The matter was considered and laid on the table.

The plans for the proposed Chi Phi Chapter House to be erected on Rugby Road, upon the ground of the University, were presented, examined and the following resolution adopted:

**RESOLVED,** That the Rector and Visitors approve of the architecture and plans of the Chi Phi House and authorize the Chi Phi to go forward with its erection, in accordance with the resolution of the attorney of the University, Mr. W. Allen Perkins, et out in the following: A tentative draft of the lease from the University to Alpha Chapter of Chi Phi Fraternity was presented to the meeting by W. Allen Perkins, Attorney for the University, and after being read before the meeting, was fully explained by him. Mr. Perkins further stated that he had been advised by one of the members of the Alpha Home Association, which is a corporation organized by the Alumni of the Alpha Chapter of Chi Phi, that it was more than probable that both the active Chapter and the Alumni organization would desire to have the present lease made with the Alpha Home Association instead of with Alpha Chapter of Chi Phi. The following resolution prepared by the attorney of the University, referred to above, was thereupon adopted:

**RESOLVED,** That the lease in its present form is acceptable to the Board, and Mr. Perkins is requested to find out from the Alpha Chapter of Chi Phi and from the Alpha Home Association just how these organizations desire the lease to run. Upon obtaining this information, Mr. Perkins is further instructed to forward the present lease to the Rector, who is hereby requested to execute the same on behalf of the University, either in its present form, or so amended as to make the lease with the Alpha Home Association instead of with Alpha Chapter of Chi Phi.

THIS DEED OF LEASE made this 2nd day of October, 1922 by and between the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, a corporation, hereinafter called the Lessor, party of the first part; and Alpha Home Association, a corporation, the members of which are Alumni of the University of Virginia, who are also Alumni members of the Alpha Chapter of Chi Phi, and which is hereinafter called the Lessee, party of the second part - both of said corporations having been created and existing under the laws of the State of Virginia -

**WITNESSETH:**

THAT for an in consideration of the rents, covenants, stipulations and conditions hereinafter contained, the said Lessor doth lease and demise unto said Lessee, to be held by the said Lessee for the term of ninety-nine (99) years, commencing on said 2nd day of October, 1922, all that lot or parcel of land known as "Site A" on plat of Warren H. Manning to be found of record on the Minute Book of the above named Lessor, which said lot is situated a short distance north of the Fayerwether Gymnasium building, lying along the western side of Rugby Road, and being adjacent to the lots now occupied by the Kappa Sigma Fraternity and by the Delta Tau Delta Fraternity, on which said "Site A" said Lessee is to proceed as promptly as possible with the erection of a fraternity house.

And said Lessor reserves as rent for the said land so long as the same is occupied by said Lessee the sum of one dollar ($1.00) per annum, payable at the end of each year; that is to say, on the 1st day of October of each year during the term of this lease; but this lease is made and shall continue in force only upon the condition that the lessee will fully and faithfully perform on its part each and all of the covenants, stipulations and undertakings hereinafter set forth.

And said Lessee agrees and covenants to and with the said Lessor as follows:-

**FIRST.** That it, the said Lessee, will pay to the said Lessor the sum of one dollar ($1.00) at the end of each year so long as this lease shall remain in force.

**SECOND.** That said Lessee will erect upon the said lot above described a building to be used by said Lessee for the purposes of a students' chapter or fraternity house at said University, said building to cost not less than $       to be constructed of hollow tile, faced with brick, roofed with metalor slate, and of the dimensions and style and according to the plans and specifications of Eugene Bradbury, Architect, copies of which are hereto attached as a part of this contract; it being further understood that said fraternity house shall be placed on the lot in question upon the exact location which has heretofore been approved by said Lessor and accepted by said Lessee.

**THIRD.** That the said building so erected shall be used exclusively for the purposes of a students' chapter or fraternity house and for lodging rooms by the individual members of said Lessee and the members of Alpha Chapter of Chi Phi, which is the active chapter of Chi Phi Fraternity at the University of Virginia; that unless the consent of said Lessor over the signature of its Rector is first obtained, said Lessee will not sublet or assign said premises, or any part thereof, during the term, or permit the use thereof otherwise than by said Alpha Chapter of Chi Phi and its members, and the members of said Lessee.

That during the use and occupation of said building as aforesaid, and so long as said lease shall remain in force and effect, said building shall be cared for and kept in order and in such reasonable repair as the Superintendent of Grounds and Buildings, or other duly designated officer of said Lessor, shall require, at the expense of the said Lessee and without charge to said Lessor; and such repairs shall include restoration in case of damage or destruction by fire.

**FOURTH.** That the said building shall be at all times as fully subject to the inspection and visitation of the authorities of said Lessor for police purposes and the ends of discipline, and for sanitary and other purposes of a similar nature, as are any of the buildings owned by said University.

**FIFTH.** In the event the said Lessor shall at any time in the future change its views as to fraternities, and desire to recall any and all rights that may have been granted herein, then and in that event the said Lessor shall have the right at any time to revoke any and all of the rights and privileges granted, conveyed or given hereunder, and take possession of said building and upon payment to the said Lessee for such building of such price as may be agreed upon by said Lessor and said Lessee, and upon failure to agree upon a price, the same shall be fixed by arbitration - one arbitrator to be selected by each party, and the two selected to choose an umpire - the award of said arbitrators and their umpire, or of any two of them, shall be final and binding upon both parties.

**SIXTH.** That in case of the breach of said Lessee or its failure to observe any of the covenants, agreements or conditions hereof, or if said building shall be used in a manner not satisfactory to the said Lessor, or if said Alpha Chapter of Chi Phi shall be dissolved or discontinued, then and in any of said events, after sixty (60) days notice given in writing by said Lessor through its Secretary, or through any other authorized agent or officer of said Lessor, at any time after such breach, to any member or officer of the Lessee found at the University, or if no such member or officer be there found, then without notice, the Lessor shall have the right to enter upon its records the fact of such default or breach of such covenant, condition or agreement, or of the unsatisfactory use of said house by the Lessee as aforesaid, or of said declaration of discontinuance, and this lease shall thereupon be determined and terminated and the said leased property and the buildings and improvements thereon shall thereupon revert to said Lessor, who shall have the right to require its Superintendent of Grounds and Buildings, or such officer or agent as may be designated by the Lessor, to take possession of the said building, land and improvements thereon, and the same shall become and continue the absolute property of the said Lessor, free and forever discharged from any and all rights and claims of said Lessee hereunder.

Provided, however, if the said building shall revert to said Lessor as aforesaid in consequence of the dissolution or discontinuance of the said Alpha Chapter of Chi Phi, and within five years after said building shall have so reverted the Chapter shall be revived and restored, to its former standing and position and if said Lesee as so revived and restored shall within such five years make application to said Lessor for restoration to its rights and privileges under this lease, the said Lessor shall thereupon be bound to restore the same on the same terms and conditions as are hereinbefore set forth, provided that evidence satisfactory to the Lessor is presented to it of the good standing of the Lessee as revived and restored, and of its ability to perform thereafter the obligations of this lease; otherwise the leasee shall not be entitled to a restoration of its rights and privileges as aforesaid.

**SEVENTH.** That in the event of failure on the part of said Lessor to exercise its rights hereunder to terminate this lease under the provisions of the SIXTH section above, such failure shall not be taken or considered as in any manner constituting a waiver of any of the rights of the Lessor as hereinbefore set forth to terminate this lease as above stated, and take possession of the building as aforesaid, in case of any subsequent or other failure, default, or breach on the part of the Lessee. And the said Lessor agrees and covenants to and with the said Lessee that on the payment by the said Lessee of said annual installment of rent as aforesaid, and on the full and faithful performance and discharge by said Lessee of all covenants, stipulations and agreements herein contained, the said Lessor will, on payment to it by said Lessee of $25.00 renewal fee, execute and deliver at the request of said Lessee, a new lease of the above demised premises for another term of ninety-nine (99) years to commence on the expiration of this lease, subject to the same rents and to the same covenants, agreements and conditions as hereinbefore set out, so that the demise hereby created may be renewable and renewed from time to time.

**ATTEST:**\
William H. Echols, Secty.

Mr. Shields M. Goodwin and Dr. R. M. Page, representing the Kappa Sigma and Delta Tau Delta Fraternities respectively, appeared before the Board and urged the location of the Chi Phi House on top of the hill instead of on the grade with their respective Fraternity Houses. After a full discussion of the matter by the Board, the request was, in view of all the circumstances, respectfully declined.

The petition from the Zeta Psi Fraternity for the site behind the Kappa Sigma House, on which to erect a Chapter House, was disposed of in the following:

**RESOLVED,** That the matter be referred to the Committee on Buildings and Grounds of the Board, the Superintendent of Buildings and Grounds of the University, the attorney for the University and Dr. Fiske Kimball.

The President read a letter from Governor Trinkle asking, in view of every indication, that the State's revenues for the current year will be considerably below the estimates made by the Auditor of Public Accounts, upon which the Budget was prepared and upon which the appropriations for the current year were predicated, that the most rigid economy be observed in all State institutions during the remainder of the current bi-ennium, and the following action was taken thereon:

**RESOLVED,** That the Rector and Visitors authorize the President to assure the Governor that they will use all possible economy in the operation of the University consistent with contractual obligations and the absolute necessities of the institution.

In connection with the conversion of $85,000.00 of the First Liberty Loan Converted Registered Bonds, being part of the $100,000.00 from the gift of Col. Payne, designated by the President to be used in the erection of the New Gymnasium, the following action was taken:

WHEREAS, It will be necessary for the University to dispose of $85,000 of the First Liberty Loan Converted Bonds in order to provide funds with which to construct the new Gymnasium, therefore be it

**RESOLVED,** That we, the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, University, Va., hereby authorize and direct Dr. Edwin A. Alderman, President of the University of Virginia, to sign and endorse for transfer, either for sale or conversion to coupon form, the following First Liberty Loan Converted Bonds, registered in our name:

* Bonds Nos. 2009-10-11-12-13-14-15 for $5,000 each
* Bonds Nos. 1197-98-99-1200-01 for $10,000 each.

The following communication was received from the Bursar in connection with the distribution of the income from the E. W. James Estate:

**In reference to E. W. James Estate Income**

In 1908 the University of Virginia received a certain portion of the estate of E. W. James by bequest, as set forth in the following paragraph:

"The remainder of my estate I leave to the University of Virginia on the following condition - that for the space of fifteen years it give one-half of the entire income of the estate to the Confederate Home near Richmond, Virginia and that it pays to Helen Wood Rogers and Frances W. Rogers $25.00 a month each during their lives, and to my servant Emma White the sum of $15.00 a month during her lifetime"

The first payment on account of income was received by the University on the 14th of July 1908, which, under the terms of the will, would make the last payment to be received on account of one-half of the income only complete with the January payment 1923, after which date the University should receive the entire income. The funds belonging to this estate are held by our depository, the Virginia Trust Company, with the exception of about $2000.00 held by the Court in Norfolk to guarantee the annuities to Helen Wood Rogers and Frances W. Rogers. Emma White, referred to in the above paragraph had died prior to the death of Mr. James.

Realizing that the period for which we would receive only one-half of the income would soon expire I took up the matter with the Virginia Trust Company and it then developed that the said Company had not been furnished with a copy of the will, but were acting under a resolution of this Board, adopted April 10th 1908, reading as follows:

**RESOLVED,** That the Finance Committee be authorized to receive from the Norfolk Bank for Savings & Trust, and turn over to the Virginia Trust Company, the securities of the Estate of Edward W. James, and to make arrangements with the said Company for the safekeeping of the securities, the collection of the interest and dividends thereon, and the payment to Fanny Rogers Curd and Helen Wood Rogers, the annuity of $25.00 to each of them, and the payment of the net residue of the income, one-half to the R. E. Lee Camp C. D. No. 1, Soldiers Home for fifteen years and the balance of the income to the Bursar".

Under date of May 29, 1908 Mr. John W. Craddock, the Chairman of the Finance Committee wrote the Virginia Trust Company enclosing them an order on the Norfolk Bank for Savings and Trust for the securities and cash belonging to the estate; gave them certain directions for holding same and directing the disposition of the income as per the aforesaid resolution, a copy of which was enclosed them, and which was the only direction they had received as to the disposition of the said income. The Virginia Trust Company has from the beginning distributed the income in accordance with this resolution, that is to say, they have made monthly payments to the two ladies, charging same against the income, dividing the remainder between the Soldiers Home and the University. This disposition of the income had never been called in question by the Soldiers Home.

I find in my James Estate file the following letter of May 30th., 1908 to Judge George L. Christian, Richmond, Va., of the firm of Christian & Christian, who were representing the Soldiers Home in all the court proceedings in certain matters in connection with the estate:

"I am authorized to inform you that the Finance Committee of the University of Virginia has entered into an agreement with the Virginia Trust Company of Richmond, Va., as depository for the securities of the estate of the late Edward W. James, bequeathed to the University of Virginia under terms and conditions with which you are familiar. Under the arrangement with the Trust Company it is to collect all income from the said estate and remit of the net proceeds of same, semi-annually, one-half to the Soldiers Home and the remainder to the Bursar of the University of Virginia."

As the Virginia Trust Company had not been furnished with a copy of the will and decree of Judge McLemore of the Circuit Court of the City of Norfolk, who had been petitioned to construe certain portions of the will, and at their request I furnished them copies of said papers. Upon going over them they called my attention to the fact that the terms of distribution as set forth in the resolution adopted by the Board did not agree with the terms contained in the will and the decree of Judge McLemore.

That portion of Judge McLemore's decree dealing with the matter in question, reads as follows:

"—; but said Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia shall have and hold the property so turned over to it subject to all the conditions imposed by the last will and testament of the said E. W. James, deceased, which bears date on the 31st of January 1900 and was duly admitted to probate in the Corporation Court of the City of Norfolk on the 24th day of October 1906, and that the Rector and Visitors of the University, after deducting a proper attorney's fee for counsel for said the University of Virginia for services in the case of Thompson et als vs The National Bank for Savings & Trust, Admnr et al shall pay over to R. E. Lee Camp No. 1 Confederate Veterans, called in said will Confederate Home near Richmond, Va., for its Confederate Home, one-half of the entire income of the said estate annually for the period of fifteen years and pay to Helen Wood Rogers the sum of $25.00 per month during her life, and to Fannie W. Curd, called in said will, Frances W. Rogers, the like sum of $25.00 per month during her life."

From the foregoing it will be seen that the question of distributing the income, as has been the practice during the past fifteen years, hinges entirely on the construction of the word entire as stated in both the will and the decree, but it would seem very clearly to have been the intent of Mr. James to give the Soldiers Home one-half of the entire income and for the University to pay the two annuitants out of its portion, because at the end of the fifteen year period the University would come into full possession of the entire income.

In thinking the matter over it occurred to me that there may have been reasons at the time the Board passed the resolution referred to above for changing the method of distribution and accordingly I took the matter up with Mr. John W. Craddock with request that he give me any information that might help us in a solution of the problem. He replied that he could remember nothing of any reason for making any change and that it was evidently an oversight on the part of the Committee when the resolution was prepared.

During the period of fifteen years the University will have received, if the terms of the will and decree are to obtain, $4500 more than its share of the income; that is to say, there will have been paid to the annuitants during the fifteen year period the sum of $600 per year, making a total of $9000, charged against the fund before its distribution, whereas the whole sum should have come from the University's half.

After a very careful study of this whole matter I am convinced that the University will be due the Soldiers Home the sum of $4500 when the period for the distribution of the income shall have been completed. If this view of the matter meets with the approval of the Board I would suggest that it be handled as set forth in the accompanying resolution.

I wish to express however haltingly - my deep appreciation of the generous kindness you have shown me during my illness, - a kindness which has made my sickness much more tolerable and my recovery more certain and complete.

I shall always remember your action in my difficult position as demanding of me an ever increased loyalty to our University and to my labors in its behalf.

With profound gratitude for the interest you have taken in my welfare, I am

When our Board of School Trustees decided recently to erect a school for the colored population of this place the most suitable site was found to be on the land now owned by Mr. John Armstrong Chaloner. We asked Mr. Chaloner to donate ten acres of land for this purpose. Mr. Chaloner considered the matter carefully and decided he wanted to do it because of his love for the people of Roanoke Rapids and his desire to do something for the colored people of this section. He explained, however, that he had made a deed of this land to the Universities of North Carolina and Virginia but that he thought since he was to have the use of this land during his lifetime that there would be no difficulty in conveying in fee simple to our School Board. He suggested that we have our lawyer investigate the case which has been done. Our attorney advises that the most suitable way to convey this land is to have a deed signed jointly by Mr. Chaloner and the proper authorities from the two universities. I have just written Dr. Chase to determine whether the University of North Carolina would be willing to join with the University of Virginia in making the deed. We asked for ten acres because we thought that was the smallest part we could get along with. Knowing your spirit and interest in the cause of education I feel that you will understand our position and that there will be little difficulty in getting the proper acceptance of this arrangement.

If the University of Virginia decides to convey its interest to our School Board, I should like for you to advise just what authorities should sign the deed. We thought it might be the Board of Visitors or the officers of the University. Direct information covering the whole case will be appreciated.
