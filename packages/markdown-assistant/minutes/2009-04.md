## April 2-3, 2009

The Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia met, in Open Session, at 1:10 p.m., Thursday, April 2, 2009, in the Board Room of the Rotunda; W. Heywood Fralin, Rector, presided.

Present were John O. Wynne, Daniel R. Abramson, A. Macdonald Caputo, The Honorable Alan A. Diamonstein, Ms. Susan Y. Dorsey, Ms. Helen E. Dragas, Thomas F. Farrell, II, Robert D. Hardie, Ms. Glynn D. Key, Austin Ligon, Vincent J. Mastracco, Jr., The Honorable Lewis F. Payne, Don R. Pippin, and E. Darracott Vaughan, Jr., M.D.

Rahul Gorawara, the Student Member-elect, also was present.

Present, too, were John T. Casteen, III, Leonard W. Sandridge, Alexander G. Gilliam, Jr., Paul J. Forch, Arthur Garson, Jr., M.D., Ms. Susan A. Carkeek, William B. Harvey, R. Edward Howell, David J. Prior, Ms. Yoke San L. Reynolds, Ms. Colette Sheehy, Thomas C. Skalak, Ms. Susan Harris, and Ms. Jeanne Flippo Bailes.

Edmund W. Kitch, Chair of the Faculty Senate, was present as well.

(At the lunch in the Rotunda which preceded the meeting, the Board met Mr. Tony Bennett, the new head Men’s Basketball coach.)

The Rector asked Mr. Hardie to lead the Pledge of Allegiance.

### Approval of the Minutes of the Meeting of February 5-6, 2009

On motion, the Board approved the Minutes of the last Board meeting, held February 5th and 6th.

### Approval of Resolution to Consider Addenda to the Agenda

As is required by the Manual of the Board of Visitors, the Board approved the following resolution permitting it to consider addenda to the published Agenda:

RESOLVED, the consideration of addenda to the published Agenda of this meeting of the Board of Visitors is approved.

### Introduction of Mr. Gorawara, the Student Member-elect

The Rector introduced Mr. Rahul Gorawara, the Student Member-elect. Mr. Gorawara, who is from Buffalo Grove, Illinois, is both a third year undergraduate student and a first year graduate student: he will take degrees in two subjects from the School of Engineering and one from the College in May; he is a first year graduate student in the Batten School, from which he will take a degree in May, 2010.

Mr. Gorawara will become the Student Member at the conclusion of this meeting of the Board.

### Comments by the Rector

The Rector made several announcements on Board matters and encouraged Members to attend Founder’s Day at The University of Virginia’s College at Wise on April 13th.

He then called on the Secretary to read a statement into the Minutes:

The University of Virginia Art Museum: Statement on the Naming of the Museum

“There has been confusion over the years about the proper name of the University’s Art Museum, which was built in the 1930s. It has been called the Bayly because the bequest that paid for part of it was made in honor of Thomas Bayly, but the proper name for it should be The University of Virginia Art Museum. As best as I have been able to ascertain, this is the name that was given to it when it opened, but as is typical of that era, there is no recorded Board resolution covering this.

So in an attempt to resolve the confusion, and assuming that this name was approved by the Board when the building was finished, I want to read into the record in the Minutes of this meeting that the name of the museum is The University of Virginia Art Museum.”

### Report on Plans for Entertaining Former Board Members

The Rector reminded the Board that – following the recommendations made by Mr. Diamonstein’s committee – at the February meeting he had charged the Secretary-elect and the Secretary with identifying a home football game to which former Board Members could be invited in the fall. He then called on Ms. Harris, the Secretary-elect, to report.

Ms. Harris said she and the Secretary had identified the football game with Texas Christian University, set for September 12th – which immediately follows the September meeting of the Board – as the best date. They suggest, too, that there be a formal program of about an hour, involving both current and former Members, before the game. The program would include an update on University issues of the moment.

The Rector said it seemed a workable plan and he asked Ms. Harris to proceed with organizing it.

### Naming of Rice Hall

The Rector called on the President to present a resolution on the naming of the Information Technology Building at the School of Engineering; the groundbreaking for the construction of the building will take place on April 17th.

The President explained that Paul G. Rice and his wife, Gina, who live in Warrenton, have made a significant gift – the second largest, in fact, in the history of the School of Engineering – toward the construction of the building. He proposed that the building be named Rice Hall in recognition of the Rices’ gift.

On motion, the Board approved the following resolution:

# NAMING OF THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ENGINEERING BUILDING RICE HALL

WHEREAS, Paul G. Rice, an alumnus of the School of Engineering, and his wife, Gina, of Warrenton, through the Rice Family Foundation, have made a splendid gift to the School of Engineering, the second largest ever given to the School; and

WHEREAS, the Rice Family Foundation gift will provide a significant portion of the funding for the Information Technology Engineering Building, to be built at the intersection of Whitehead and Stadium Roads; and

WHEREAS, the groundbreaking for this building will take place on April 17, 2009;

RESOLVED, the Board of Visitors names the Information Technology Engineering Building Rice Hall and thanks Mr. and Mrs. Rice for their generosity and support.

---

### Summer Orientation

The Secretary presented the schedule for the Summer Orientation sessions and urged Members to continue the custom of a Board Member opening each session with a short speech on the importance of the Honor System.

### President’s Report

The Rector asked the President to make his customary report.

The President referred to three things put at Members’ places: “Scientific Jefferson Revealed,” a new book by Martin Clagett; a Garden Week insert from DP Magazine with articles about Carr’s Hill and Morven; and a copy of the Morven website pages.

Recalling his written report to the Board last month, the President outlined funding that will be available to the University through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA): the University will receive $10.7 million in ARRA funds in 2009-10 to offset the Governor’s recommended $23.1 million cut in General Funds, which would leave a net reduction of $12.4 million in 2009-10.

So far, the University has submitted proposals for competitive grants totaling $2.9 million: all are proposals to the National Institutes of Health, save an application for an Americorps grant for the College Guide Program.

The Governor, he said, has not taken action to fund proposals received under the economic stabilization portion of the funds available to the state.

The University has received $1.1 million to pay for detailed planning of Ruffner Hall.

The President then reported on development related trips he has made in the last month to Florida and to Hong Kong, as well as trips planned later in the spring.

### Gifts and Grants Report

Turning to his report on gifts and grants received since the last meeting of the Board, the President said that philanthropic giving to the University and its related foundations for the current fiscal year, as of February 28th, amounts to $172,990,411, a decrease of 15.51% from the amount given in the same period last year. Despite the economic situation, gifts to the University in a number of categories have shown increases over the same period in the last fiscal year.

Among significant gifts received in this reporting period are a grant of $1,000,000 from the Wallace H. Coulter Foundation to the Biomedical Engineering Department in the School of Medicine; a grant of $720,000 from the American Cancer Society to the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology in the Medical School; a $400,000 grant from the Dana Foundation to the Pathology Department in the Medical School; $399,000 from the Andrus Family Fund to the Institute of Environmental Negotiation in the School of Architecture; and a pledge of $350,000 from the Manley Family Foundation toward the South Lawn Project.

A significant new pledge is $10,700,000 from the Hunter Smith Family Foundation for the Cavalier Marching Band Rehearsal Hall, as well as a pledge of $4,000,000 to The University of Virginia’s College at Wise for the Dining Commons.

Other important new pledges are $1,000,000 from the William Stamps Farish Fund to the McIntire School; $500,000 from Dr. Gwo Jaw Wang and Mrs. Chen-Mei Wang to the School of Medicine; and $500,000 from Timothy J. Ingrassia (a former Student Member of the Board) for the Echols Scholars Program.

The Rector asked for a motion to approve the Gifts and Grants Report. The motion was made, seconded, and the Report was approved.

The Rector called on Mr. Payne to make an announcement:

### Gift in Honor of Mr. Farrell

Mr. Payne, as a member of the law firm McGuire Woods, read a letter from Mr. Richard Cullen of the firm, addressed to the President.

“Dear John:

“Inspired by the example of our former partner and great friend, Tom Farrell, McGuire Woods commits $65,000 to the Clarence B. Cain Scholarship. As you may know, Mr. Cain was Tom’s Resident Assistant during the future Rector’s first year at the University. Our firm is pleased to support this and the related Ridley Scholarship Fund which does so much to ensure a rich and diverse student body.”

---

The Board recessed meeting as the full Board at 1:50 p.m., and began meeting in Committee.

### Board Dinner

The Board Dinner in the Dome Room of the Rotunda on April 2nd, as is customary, was given in honor of retiring members of the faculty of the University.

---

The Board resumed meeting as the full Board at 12:25 p.m., on Friday, April 3rd. All Members were present.

After adopting the following motions, the Board went into Executive Session:

That the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia convene in Closed Session for the purpose of discussing and/or approving personnel actions involving the appointment, reappointment, transition, nomination, evaluation, performance, compensation, and resignation of specific University officers and employees as provided for in Section 2.2-3711 (A) (1) of the Code of Virginia.

That the Board of Visitors convene in Closed Session to consult with General Counsel regarding his privileged legal report to the Board on pending and anticipated litigation affecting the University, as provided for in Section 2.2-3711 (A) (7) of the Code of Virginia.

### Executive Session

The Board met in Executive Session until 12:45 p.m. when, after adopting the following resolution, it resumed its meeting in Open Session:

That we vote on and record our certification that, to the best of each Board member’s knowledge, only public business matters lawfully exempted from open meeting requirements and which were identified in the motion(s) authorizing the closed session, were heard, discussed or considered in closed session.

---

### The Board Retreat

At the Rector’s request, Mr. Wynne, the Vice Rector, reported on plans for the Board’s Retreat in July; he distributed copies of a proposed outline of the Retreat Agenda, which was considered and agreed to by the Ad-Hoc Committee on Revenue Sources on April 1st (see the Minutes of that meeting for the complete text of the proposed outline of the Retreat Agenda). Mr. Wynne reminded the Board that the Retreat will be held July 10, and 11, at the Boar’s Head Inn in Albemarle County. He said that the necessary materials will be distributed to Members well in advance of the Retreat, and he urged that this material be read and considered before the meeting. The Retreat, he said, “will not be a dog and pony show.”

All Members were present for the Final Session of the Board meeting.
