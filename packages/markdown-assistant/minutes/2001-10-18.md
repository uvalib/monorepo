The Rector asked the Secretary to read the annual ACC Governing Board Certification Form, which attests that responsibility for the administration of the athletics program has been delegated to the President of the University. The Atlantic Coast Conference requires that this Form be read to the Board once a year.

The President gave his customary report, announcing first that the Honorable Emily Couric, who represented Charlottesville and Albemarle County in the Virginia Senate and who was a great friend of the University, had died during the night.

After reviewing the State Budget projections for the forthcoming biennium, and their implications for the University, the President gave his usual report on gifts and grants made to the University. The Board accepted the Report.

Mr. Crutchfield said faculty members he has talked to have expressed serious concern about the implications of possible State Budget cuts on University programs. He suggested that the University community be kept apprised of any cuts and of the University’s response to them. The President replied that he and others in the administration have met with faculty groups in this regard and will continue to do so.

Mr. Goodwin commended the President, Mr. Sandridge and the Rector for their leadership over the past year.

The Board adjourned at 11:50 a.m., to begin Committee meetings.
