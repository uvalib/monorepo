A student who is admitted as a graduate student will be classified in each semester as full time or part time, by the Dean of the School of Law. A student classified as full time will pay the full graduate tuition and the full comprehensive fee, a student classified as part time will pay tuition of $105 per semester if a Virginian, or $220 if an out-of-state student, plus the comprehensive fee.

Any student not in residence at the University who is preparing a dissertation under the active supervision of a member of the faculty, or who wishes to return to receive a degree or take an examination, will pay a $15 registration fee for that semester and will be exempt from all other fees.

Before a student may be advanced to candidacy for a graduate degree, he must have paid full tuition and fees for at least two semesters, or the equivalent.

Any person who is undertaking any form of academic study with the University, including supervised research, must be registered as a student and pay the prescribed fees.

6\. RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the section in the Board's resolution of 14 October 1961 (Minutes, Board of Visitors, University of Virginia, No. 12, 14 October 1961, p. 293) included under the paragraph heading entitled "Return of Fees" be and it is hereby revised and re-enacted as follows. Return of Fees - A student withdrawing within five days after registration shall have his tuition and one-half of the comprehensive fee, less $10 to cover cost of registration, refunded. If he withdraws voluntarily after the fifth day of the semester and before the middle thereof, his tuition and one-half of the comprehensive fee shall be refunded pro-rata. No refund of room rent shall be made.

If the student is required to withdraw from the University at any time during the semester, or if he withdraws voluntarily after the middle thereof, no refund of tuition or the comprehensive fee for that semester shall be made.

The President recommended that, in the future, he be authorized to adjust the tuition charges for part-time students in proportion to the tuition schedule as adopted by the Board. Approval of this proposal will make it unnecessary to require Board action in changing the individual amounts in the several catalogues of the schools affected. The Board will continue to approve the tuition schedule for full-time students.

Accordingly, the following resolution was adopted:

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the President be and he is hereby authorized to prescribe the charges for tuition to be made for part-time students, these charges to be in proportion to the tuition schedule for full-time students as approved by the Board.

The Statement was submitted to and approved by the University Senate on 29 May 1964.

After amending the Statement by substituting the words "Commonwealth of Virginia" or "Commonwealth" for the word "state" when it appeared in the Statement, the Board adopted the following resolution:

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the following Statement of Institutional Purpose be and it is hereby approved.

A university is a community of scholars having as its central purpose the enrichment of the human mind by stimulating and sustaining a spirit of free inquiry directed to an understanding of the nature of the universe and man's role in it. This central purpose is served by activities designed.

To make a living reality in the consciousness and the daily lives of the students and faculty the special historic commitment of this University to the character of its members, symbolized in the invitation carved upon its portals to "Enter by this gateway and seek the way of honor, the light of truth, the will to work for men."

2\. To give to able undergraduates the highest quality instruction leading to baccalaureate degrees in the arts and in the sciences, not merely by transmitting established skills and knowledge, but by developing their ability to think, to respond to ideas, and to test hypotheses and interpret human experience anew.

3\. To train young men and women for the professions in

(a) Undergraduate schools and programs leading to degrees in Architecture, City Planning, Commerce, Education, Engineering and Applied Science, and Nursing, and

(b) Graduate schools and graduate professional programs leading to advanced degrees in Arts and Sciences, Architecture and Planning, Business Administration, Education, Engineering and Applied Science, Law, and Medicine.

4\. To perform graduate instruction, study, and research directed to the advancement of knowledge, and to make discoveries on the frontiers of knowledge available to students, scholars, and the general public through all appropriate means.

5\. To offer various kinds of public service to the Commonwealth of Virginia and the nation through specialized knowledge and research as may be provided by the various special divisions and institutes of the University.

6\. To provide programs of continuing education.

7\. To co-operate with and assist other colleges and educational institutions, especially in the Commonwealth of Virginia, through the experience, counsel, and facilities of the University, to make the greatest possible contribution to education in the Commonwealth, and beyond its borders.

8\. To establish appropriate new programs, schools, and degrees, and to undertake such advanced and special research as the educational requirements of the Commonwealth of Virginia and the nation may indicate.

9\. To serve as the intellectual and cultural center of the Commonwealth of Virginia, especially through special programs, lectures, drama, music, and library services.

The President reminded the Board of its approval, on 1 June 1962, (Minutes, Board of Visitors, University of Virginia, No. 12, 1 June 1962, pp. 333-334) of a Joint Agreement between the College of William and Mary in Virginia the University of Virginia, and the Virginia Polytechnic Institute, dated 1 July 1962, providing for the establishment of the Virginia Associated Research Center to operate and manage a space radiation effects laboratory to be constructed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The Joint Agreement, in Section X, provides that the Agreement "may be changed or amended at any time or from time to time by and with the consent in writing of the governing bodies or duly authorized committees thereof of the three institutions, parties hereto, but not otherwise." One of the stipulations of that Agreement was that the Director of VARC "must be a ranking scientist as well as a capable administrator." The Governing Committee, composed of the Presidents of the three institutions, now desires to change the requirements for the position of Director of VARC to provide that he be a capable administrator.

Accordingly, the following resolution was adopted:

WHEREAS, in accordance with provisions of Chapter 604, Acts of Assembly 1962, the governing bodies of the College of William and Mary in Virginia, University of Virginia, and Virginia Polytechnic Institute approved as of July 1, 1962 a Joint Agreement for the operation and management of a space radiation effects laboratory to be constructed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in the area of Hampton Roads, Virginia, and
