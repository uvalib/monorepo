**RESOLVED, the Board of Visitors resolutions entitled Approval of Stole for Board Members as a Part of their Academic Regalia dated October 8, 1983, and Academic Costume of the Rector dated October 7, 1959, are hereby rescinded.**

**Remarks by the Rector**

**Mr. Goodwin spoke briefly about the Retreat, scheduled for August 14 and 15. He said the afternoon session on August 14 will be a visioning session with a cross section of faculty, 60 in all, including the deans. A facilitator from Darden, Michael Lenox, will lead the participants through an exercise to imagine the university in 10 to 20 years. All participants will also be invited to dinner that evening. He said the following day will be devoted to a couple of big topics — specifically, growing the research enterprise, and the bicentennial and campaign for the third century.**

**Mr. Goodwin thanked Helen Dragas, whose second term on the Board ends June 30, for her service. Ms. Dragas made responsive comments, including that she respected everyone at the table.**

**On motion, the following resolution was approved:**

**RESOLUTION COMMENDING HELEN E. DRAGAS**

**WHEREAS, Helen E. Dragas took a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Virginia in 1984 and a MBA from the Darden School of Business Administration in 1988; and**

**WHEREAS, Ms. Dragas is President and Chief Executive Officer of The Dragas Companies, a diversified real estate concern in the Hampton Roads region. Ms. Dragas also serves on the Board of Directors of Dominion Resources, Inc.; and**

**WHEREAS, Ms. Dragas was awarded the inaugural “Lee Evans Award for Management Excellence” by the National Association of Homebuilders and _Builder_ magazine in 1999, and was named Best Builder by _Builder_ magazine in 2009; and**

Ms. Dragas also received the Humanitarian Award for Inclusive Communities in Virginia in 2011. In 2013, For Kids, Inc., granted her the Phoenix Award; and**

**WHEREAS, Ms. Dragas has served on numerous boards and commissions, including the University of Virginia Alumni Association Board of Managers, the Norfolk Academy Board of Trustees, the Virginia State Transportation Board, the Hampton Roads Partnership, Virginia Beach Vision, the State Council for Higher Education in Virginia and the Commonwealth Transportation Board; and**

**WHEREAS, Ms. Dragas was appointed to the Board of Visitors by Governor Kaine in 2008 and was reappointed by Governor McDonnell in 2012; and**

**WHEREAS, Ms. Dragas was elected Vice Rector in September 2010, and served as the first female rector from July 2011 through June 2013; and**

**The Rector stated that all of the retiring Board members will be honored at a dinner on September 15th and asked them to save the date.**

**Remarks by the President**

**President Sullivan made the following remarks:**

**During this Board meeting, you’ve heard about the progress we’re making in the Cornerstone Plan. Today Tom Katsouleas discussed the UVA Brain Institute, the second in a series of pan-University institutes we’re developing as part of the plan. And in Finance Committee yesterday you heard about faculty hiring that’s part of our plan’s strategy for sustaining excellence during a period of generational turnover in the faculty.**

**Enhancing our global activities is another priority in the Cornerstone Plan. As part of that effort, last week I completed my most extensive international trip on behalf of the University. I traveled to five Asian cities in 11 days, and I was joined at various locations by Deans Baucom, Zeithaml, and Stam, as well as other UVA faculty members.**

**During the trip, I gave keynote addresses at Tsinghua University in Beijing and at the American Center of Japan in Tokyo; I participated in panel discussions in Singapore, Hong Kong, and Shanghai; I joined U.S. Ambassador Caroline Kennedy for a roundtable discussion with Japanese students in Tokyo; and we held receptions with alumni and parents in all five cities.**

**The trip had several purposes: to seek out new collaborations with Asian university partners; to explore opportunities for UVA students in study-abroad and internships; to engage our alumni throughout Asia; to raise awareness of UVA among Asian leaders in higher education; and to generally expand UVA’s opportunities in the region.**

**Expanding UVA’s global dimensions is important, because we need to prepare UVA students for today’s increasingly global economy. We achieve this by sending our students into the world to study, work, and conduct research; by bringing international influences to UVA; and by integrating global issues into our curriculum and extra-curricular activities.**

**Our new major in Global Studies offers our students four tracks or areas of concentration: in Global Development; Global Public Health; Environments and Sustainability; and, Security and Justice. About 120 students enrolled in the major in its first year in 2014-15, and that number doubled in the academic year that just ended.**

**We’ve also increased our offerings in study-abroad, research, and service overseas. 25 years ago, UVA had fewer than 10 faculty-led study-abroad programs, with even fewer exchange agreements. Today, we have more than 50 UVA-managed study-abroad programs, and we have exchange agreements with more than 80 universities.**

**In addition to study abroad, students need to have the opportunity to work abroad, so we launched a Global Internship program two years ago. This summer, we placed about 50 students in internships in 17 countries on 6 different continents. Several of our schools have their own internship programs.**

**To strengthen this effort, UVA’s Career Center has created a new Global Careers Taskforce to help our students obtain internships and other career-oriented experiences overseas. The taskforce brings together school-based career centers and units across the University to provide a streamlined approach to advising, employer relations, and alumni engagement.**

**In this morning’s Advancement Committee discussion of transformative gift ideas, we heard Jeff Legro’s proposal to form the “Virginia Global Guarantee” to make global experiences available for all UVA students. We know these experiences are important, because research has shown that students who study and work abroad outperform their peers in numerous ways, including creative, complex, and analytical thinking.[\[1\]](#footnote-1)**

**In addition to sending our US-born students abroad, it’s important for them to have the chance to interact with students and faculty from other nations on Grounds at UVA. About 8% of our undergraduates are foreign citizens, and they come from 130 different nations. This international diversity benefits all of our students. All of our students will work in teams with people from all over the world when they begin their careers, and interacting with international students now prepares them for that future.**

**Because of their experiences at UVA, many of our students continue to pursue international experiences after graduation. Three UVA students received Davis Peace grants to work on youth-engagement initiatives in Ghana this summer. One UVA alumna won a Mitchell Scholarship and will attend University College Dublin to pursue her MBA. One student and one alumnus will be part of the inaugural class of Schwarzman Scholars that will study for a one-year degree at Tsinghua University. Another student won a Rhodes Scholarship, and will spend the next two years at Oxford.**

**The U.S. State Department named UVA one of its “Top Producing Institutions” for Fulbright awards for 2015-16, when we had 14 Fulbright awardees. This year, 10 students were offered Fulbrights, and 8 accepted. We also saw a 45% increase in our number of Fulbright applications this year, showing that there’s broad interest across the student body.**

**Just as we prepare UVA students for leadership on a global scale, we need to strengthen our global network as we prepare to launch our next campaign.**

**This will require us to build a support structure of mobilized and well-connected alumni, parents, and friends all over the world, and that process is already well under way. We have more than 9,000 alumni living in 150 foreign countries. We have 19 active UVA Clubs abroad, and during the past year alone we held 140 events overseas, in 27 different countries. More than 40% of our international alumni have made at least one gift to UVA.**

**Part of UVA’s DNA in its third century will be its ever-increasing global character and the expansion of the University’s horizons around the world.**

**This does not mean that we’ll sacrifice our commitments to Virginia and the nation. Our mission as a public university is to serve our citizens here at home. Instead, UVA will be both local and global; both Virginia-centric and global; both US-focused and global. UVA can be all these things, all at the same time.**

**Comments by the Student Representative to the Board**

**Ms. Phoebe Willis made the following remarks:**

**Thank you Rector Goodwin. Before I start my report, I would like to thank Daniel Judge for everything he has done as Student Member of the Board. Daniel’s many initiatives, including student forums with Board members and first year dorm talks, have set the bar high for all future student members. Daniel’s willingness to include me in his meetings this spring helped me understand first hand all of the work he has put into the position and I am so appreciative of Daniel’s mentorship over the last couple of months. I’m also happy to report that after all of his hard work, Daniel was unable to attend today’s meeting because he is out enjoying the beautiful weather on a fishing trip.**

**Besides enjoying the outdoors, one other thing I picked up from Daniel is to have a theme for my reports. I would like to focus this report on informing the Board about three successful student-led initiatives that will have profound impacts on the University for the next school year and beyond.**

**The first student initiative I will discuss is the Multicultural Center. After two years of collaboration between the Office of the Dean of Students and the Multicultural Student Center Initiative, the Multicultural Center will open this fall in the lower level of Newcomb Hall. Newcomb Hall was chosen for the location because it is centrally located on Grounds and serves as the University's student union building.**

**The center will be designed to bring different groups in the University together and facilitate dialogue about a broad array of topics surrounding multiculturalism. Though the planning is not yet complete, it is expected the Center will be run by student staff members, similar to the LGBTQ center. In addition to the student staff, three Dean of Students Office staff members who concentrate on multicultural programming will be located in the center and available to students for services and support.**

**The Multicultural Student Center Initiative praised administration in their help finding an appropriate space for the center. The planning for the Center is being done this summer by the Office of the Dean of Students and the Multicultural Student Center Initiative and they plan to gather input utilizing student surveys, in order to ensure the Center is an inclusive space for all students. In addition, they asked that any Board members interested in plans for the space please contact them as they would love to have the opportunity to tell you more about the project.**

**Now I will just give a brief overview of the second student initiative which is the Honor Audit Commission formed by the Honor Committee, because many of you heard about it earlier today in the Academic & Student Life Committee. This Commission is in response to the outcome of this year’s University-wide vote on the Honor Committee’s sanctioning policies, as well as the heightened level of discussion about the Honor system in our community in recent years. Such a commission was last utilized during the 2000-2001 school year.**

**Beginning this summer, the Honor Audit Commission will plan and carry out a comprehensive, external review of the Honor system over the next two academic years. The Commission will focus on three areas; sanctioning, case processing, and outreach/education. The Commission will be comprised of students, faculty, administrators, and alumni, and will evaluate Honor’s sanctioning, case process, and engagement with the broader University community, ultimately recommending steps the Honor Committee can take to more closely align its procedures and efforts with the interests and needs of the UVA community.**

**Along the same ideas of collaboration and meeting the needs of the UVA community, Emily Lodge, the Student Council President, decided to found the Presidential Senate this past spring. The Presidential Senate is an organization of student representatives from a broad range of student organizations that aims to harness their collective forces to bring awareness to University issues.**

**The Senate is currently comprised of 125 organizational representatives. (All CIOs, agencies and special status organizations were contacted to join) At each meeting, 3 presenting student groups are given 10-15 minutes to present their issue and answer questions from the Senate. At the end of the meeting, the representatives vote on the issue they think is the most urgent to address. Every month there will then be a single issue that all student organizations and administrators can work to address as a collective force.**

**For example, the Senate met once this spring and voted that the Student Memorial Garden was its April issue. After 12 years of the project being “in the works” facilities has subsequently agreed to give them the funds to finish construction plans. The Presidential Senate has three planned meetings this fall and would like to invite any interested Board members to attend.**

**These are just three examples of a multitude of student-led initiatives at UVA. If any Board members are interested in learning more about an initiative or attending a meeting, please do not hesitate to let me know. Attending any of the events I just mentioned would be a great way to see student self-governance in action and to meet some of the impressive students on Grounds. I would like to close my remarks by emphasizing my commitment to work with all students and the Board to making this university the best it can be. I look forward to a productive year.**

**Thank you.**

**Comments by the Faculty Senate Chair**

**Ms. Margaret “Mimi” Riley made the following comments on behalf of the Faculty Senate:**

**I’d like to take a few minutes to introduce myself—and then take a quick look back at the past year and then review some priorities for the year ahead.**

**I’m a Jersey girl—raised in the gravitational pull of New York. If anyone had told me when I was 18 that I’d live most of my life in Charlottesville Virginia, I would have told them they were crazy. But soon after I came to the University, I discovered that I had come home. The roots now run deep—I have even come to like orange.**

**I work in the areas of law and regulation of the biosciences and health policy. My work here provides a good picture of how interdisciplinary faculty today may be. As you know, my primary appointment is in the law school, but I have a secondary appointment in the medical school. For several years I taught the moral dimensions in policy making class at the Batten School—co-teaching with a colleague from Darden. And I work on research projects with colleagues across grounds and regularly teach classes in a number of schools. I think that you will all find that a law professor who understands faculty in multiple disciplines, and understands the health system, can make a useful partner.**

**For the Faculty Senate, the biggest development of the past year was of course having a faculty member, Joe, invited to sit on the BOV. For us—and I hope you will agree—this has been a tremendous success. And we are very excited about Nina joining you beginning in July.**

**This past year has, I am happy to say, been considerably less traumatic than the year before. But it has been a year of profound change. We have a new Provost, 7 new deans as of this summer, the RCM is in place, we have new Title IX and Clery administration, we are developing a new HR system as part of organizational excellence, we have named a new Pan-University Institute and we are in the process of hiring many new faculty. All of that change has been objectively good—but it is still disruptive. Fortunately with a good partnership President Sullivan, all three of the EVPs—Pat Hogan, Tom Katsouleas and Rick Shannon, and also members of the Board, we have had good communication and advice and information have freely flowed both to and from the faculty. I hope that we can build on that foundation in the coming year.**

**Part of the role of the Faculty Senate is to understand the concerns of the broader faculty and the Senate leadership has spent considerable time doing just that this past year. We, together with the Provost’s office, surveyed the faculty using an instrument prepared by the Harvard Collaborative on Academic Careers in Higher Education--Coache. That instrument provides a broad look at faculty concerns and satisfaction and will allow us to compare ourselves with peer institutions and with our past selves. We will have the results of that survey this summer and I look forward to discussing it with you in the future.**

**Nina and I also spent a great deal of time this year talking to individual members of the faculty in a less formal fashion and I can share a few themes resulting from those discussions.**

**Faculty members have a new sense of excitement about research at the University. There is a perception that many of the planned and effected changes—both within and as a result of the Cornerstone Plan—will provide better research infrastructure and support. They are also excited about the potential for new colleagues and research partnerships. And they are inspired by new leadership. There are some concerns too—of course, there can be disagreement about priorities. Bold thinking doesn’t just happen; it has to be taught—and faculty also need to be taught how to talk about their bold ideas to the outside world.**

**With the renewed focus on research, some faculty members have also urged us not to forget the importance of teaching. UVA has a well-deserved reputation for excellent teaching, and we do not want to lose sight of that. As was noted yesterday, it is often much more difficult to measure success in teaching than research-- but students and faculty know it when they see it.**

**Finally, I don’t think that I need to tell anyone in this room that we are living in an era of considerable turmoil in higher education. UVA’s success in this era will be dependent on trust, communication and some luck. We have made great strides in building both trust and communication. Faculty members play a crucial role as bridges between students, staff, the administration-- and the Board of Visitors. I urge you to get to know us. The Board has taken an important step towards this in making faculty part of the August retreat. I hope that we can make many more opportunities—both formal and informal—through the coming year.**

**Thank you.**

**The schedule above outlines the available staff resources for the Corporate Compliance and Privacy Office (Office). The schedule is developed based on required work from federal, state, and other regulatory agencies, risk assessment models, requests from Medical Center management, and analyses of work performed in prior years. The hours available for Corporate Compliance and Privacy projects have been reduced (by 2,080 hours/1 FTE) due to the vacancy of the Chief Corporate Compliance and Privacy Officer. This schedule will be readjusted after that position has been filled on a permanent basis.**

**The Office staff consists of the following positions:**

*   **Chief Corporate Compliance and Privacy Officer – currently vacant (0 hours)**
*   **Interim Corporate Compliance and Privacy Officer / Program Coordinator (2080 hours)**
*   **Compliance and Privacy Senior Analyst (2080 hours)**
*   **Compliance and Privacy Analyst (2080 hours)**
*   **Compliance and Privacy Specialist (25% of full time position – 520 hours)**

**The schedule includes hours allocated for professional development activities. During FY17, Office staff plan to attend the Society of Corporate Compliance and Ethics Basic Compliance and Ethics Academy, the Fairwarning Ready Certified Professionals Training Program, the Health Care Compliance Association Compliance Institute and the Enforcement Compliance Institute, and relevant webinars and/or other educational sessions for professional development. These professional development activities are vitally important and provide the Office an opportunity to network with other compliance and privacy professionals; obtain information on emerging issues; and gain knowledge on issues that compliance and privacy professionals encounter daily.**

**Hours for other activities related to the Office include serving on relevant committees throughout the Medical Center. The Interim Compliance and Privacy Officer will continue to attend such meetings to determine if the Office provides added value. These hours also include the time allotted to review the annual Office of the Inspector General (OIG) Work Plan and solicit feedback from Management regarding the risks identified by the OIG that apply to our setting. This document and related communications are used to determine the Office’s scheduled projects.**

**After removing hours for professional development, leave and holidays, and other activities, there are 5,255 hours remaining for Corporate Compliance and Privacy Office projects.**

**The Office promptly responds to and investigates issues of suspected violations related to compliance and privacy. Inappropriate, but accidental, disclosures of protected health information comprise a large number of the privacy investigations. Each of these accidental disclosures is assessed to determine if the incident is a reportable breach (i.e., when a patient is provided with another patient’s protected health information). The hours allocated to this function are included in unscheduled privacy projects.**

**The University of Virginia Health System’s Notice of Privacy Practices was last reviewed and updated in 2013. This document will be reviewed this fiscal year and any applicable and relevant changes will be made. The hours allocated to this review are included in unscheduled privacy projects.**

**Developing and conducting training accounts for approximately 965 hours (18%) of the Office’s work hours. Special and unscheduled projects account for approximately 2,090 hours (40%) of the Office’s work hours.**

**Total**

**2,200**

**The hours allocated above for work related to privacy and training have not been reduced due to the staff vacancy because of the importance of these activities to the Medical Center. The Office provides content for compliance and privacy-related topics for the mandatory new hire and retraining modules each year. The content is based on trends observed through risk assessments, auditing and investigations; law and regulatory changes; and industry needs. In addition, the Office provides additional training as requested from departments. The Office regularly participates and presents at the Housestaff Orientation.**

**In order to avoid duplication of resources, and a desire to participate in a partnership across the continuum of compliance-related departments, the Office meets regularly with the University’s Chief Audit Executive and staff and the University Physicians Group Director for Audit and Compliance and staff, in order to coordinate and work together to assure that the Health System’s risk are appropriately addressed. During these meetings, ongoing and anticipated projects are discussed.**

**The fully detailed project schedule has not yet been determined; however, there are two industry-specific high-risk areas that will be assessed:**

*   **The 340B Pharmacy Drug Pricing Program continues to be a high risk area, due to the complexity of the requirements, regulatory scrutiny, and high dollar volume. The Medical Center Pharmacy staff has policies and procedures in place to ensure compliance with the Program. Our Office will review their policies and procedures and audit plan to assure that they are in compliance with the Program.**
*   **The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services’ Two-Midnight Rule continues to be a highly-audited billing rule. This Rule originated from the Recovery Audit program when CMS identified high rates of error for hospital services rendered in a medically-unnecessary setting (i.e., inpatient rather than outpatient.) The Office has conducted a thorough review within the past two years, and will continue to review the necessity of inpatient vs. observation status with each inpatient billing review the Office completes.**

**The Office will continue its seamless working relationship with Health Information Technology on some key emerging risk areas such as cybersecurity, the security and process of texting patient information, and cloud computing safe and secure initiatives. There is growing concern among the industry on the security and protection of the data stored on medical devices. This topic was contained in the 2015 OIG Work Plan where the OIG reported that computerized medical devices such as dialysis machines, radiology systems, and medication dispensing systems that are integrated with electronic medical records (EMRs) pose a growing threat to the security and privacy of personal health information. The OIG said they will determine whether hospitals’ security controls over networked medical devices are sufficient to effectively protect associated electronically protected health information (ePHI) and ensure beneficiary safety. The Office will gather best practices and standards from throughout the industry, and provide that information to Health Information Technology for their review.**

**Some additional Office-related activities that are planned for this fiscal year, and will require the need for significant resource hours, are the implementation and go-live of the MD Audit Compliance Software. This software will be used to support sampling, complete root cause analysis, and identify and reduce compliance billing risks. Additionally, the Office will pursue ways to reduce the use of paper in the Office in order to be in line with the University of Virginia’s Sustainability Plan; to be better stewards of the environment; and resolve the lack of space for filing of documents in the Office. The Office is investigating solutions that will allow for scanning documents in to a database and the electronic storage of older files.**

**Scheduled projects account for approximately 2,200 hours (42%) of the Office’s scheduled work hours.**

**Proposed expenditures in 2016-2017 total $264,355, of which $250,000 will be funded from the 2016-2017 allocation with the balance of $14,355 to be drawn from the projected 2015-2016 year-end balance.**

**_Chemistry_ – The 2016-2017 Pratt fund allocation for Chemistry is $250,000. The department proposes to allocate $220,000 of the 2016-2017 allocation for support of outstanding graduate students. In addition, the anticipated 2015-2016 year-end balance of $143,000 will also be applied to graduate support in 2016-2017. Pratt funds are critical in providing competitive support to a highly recruited group of first-year graduate students. The department is committed to deploying built up balances in its Pratt accounts in support of a multi-year effort to include funded graduate students in the start-up packages of new hires.**

**The department proposes to use the balance of the 2016-2017 distribution, $30,000, along with $28,654 from the anticipated FY 2015-2016 year-end balance of $50,020, to provide summer wages to faculty holding key departmental administrative posts, including the graduate program director, the undergraduate program director, and the associate chair of the department.**

**Proposed expenditures in 2016-2017 total $421,654, of which $250,000 will be funded from the 2016-2017 allocation with the balance of $171,654 to be drawn from the projected 2015-2016 year-end balance.**

**_Mathematics –_ The 2016-2017 Pratt fund allocation for the Math Department is $150,000. The Department of Mathematics proposes to allocate $108,374 in 2016-2017 in partial support of the salaries of Whyburn Postdoctoral Fellows. Internationally recognized for its excellence, the Whyburn postdoctoral program brings new PhD recipients in mathematics to UVA as faculty instructors for three years of teaching and research. Pratt funds will support 40% of the academic year compensation of four Whyburn fellows in 2016-2017.**

**The department proposes to allocate $35,000 in faculty summer wages for faculty members who serve as mentors for undergraduate students participating in the department’s summer research program and for the associate chair.**

**The department proposes to spend $20,000 in 2016-2017 to provide fellowship support for students engaged in PhD research. This funding allows the department to be competitive with peer institutions in attracting graduate students.**

**The department also proposes to spend $15,000 in support of computer upgrades and related costs to facilitate the continuation of faculty research programs.**

**Proposed expenditures in 2016-2017 total $178,374, of which $150,000 will be funded from the 2016-2017 allocation with the balance of $28,374 to be drawn from the projected 2015-2016 year-end balance.**

**_Physics –_ The 2016-2017 Pratt fund allocation for Physics is $250,000. The department proposes to allocate $202,912 in 2016-2017 for fellowship stipends. Pratt funds are a critical component of competitive fellowship packages used to attract and retain highly qualified PhD candidates to the graduate program in Physics. They help to provide a level of support that enables first-year graduate students to participate in research groups prior to selecting a research advisor. This support is simultaneously beneficial to new faculty in developing their research programs.**

**The department proposes to allocate $47,087 of the 2016-2017 allocation for summer wages for three new faculty members and for a month of summer wages for the associate chair.**

**The department will continue to draw down uncommitted reserves in the Pratt Equipment account to fund critical equipment needs, both for instruction and research, as components of start-up packages for new faculty, as cost-share on sponsored grants, and through other forms of research support to the department.**

**Proposed expenditures in 2016-2017 total $673,214, of which $250,000 will be funded from the 2016-2017 allocation with the balance of $423,214 to be drawn from the projected 2015-2016 year-end balance.**

**_New Faculty Start-up Fund_ – A total of $3,093,011 is requested by the College to use as components of start-up packages associated with new hires and to support other strategic needs.**

**SCHOOL OF MEDICINE — $3,395,000 allocation for 2016-2017**

**The March 31, 2016 market value of the Pratt Bequest for the School of Medicine is $49.9 million. The $3,395,000 request from the School of Medicine detailed below represents the regular allocation of $1,300,000 and a special distribution of $2,095,000 to support graduate programs and central research efforts.**

**_Support and Training of Student Researchers - $1,310,000 -_ Graduate students and postdoctoral fellows are central to a successful biomedical research program. A modest institutional share from the Pratt bequest supplements funds from federal government training programs and charitable foundations to attract exceptional students. For the 2016-2017 fiscal year, the School of Medicine proposes to use $210,000 of its Pratt funds allocation to support graduate research assistants. These individuals are critical in enhancing the quality of research in the PhD and MD/PhD programs at the University, and the success of these programs has a direct impact on the quality of faculty research at the School of Medicine.**

**Additionally, the School of Medicine would like to utilize $1.1 million to support its MD/PhD students enrolled in medical school. The MD/PhD program at UVA is nationally known and extremely selective with less than ten students enrolled annually. For each student enrolled, all tuition and fees during the medical student years and research years are funded institutionally or through grants. By leveraging the Pratt’s bequest for medical student scholarships the School is able to continue funding this high profile program.**

**_Core Facility Support - $2,085,000 –_ Research core facilities – including, but not limited to: the Small Animal Multimodality Imaging Core, Advanced Microscopy Facility, Biomolecular Research Facility, Gene Targeting & Transgenic Facility, Biorepository, BioNMR Core, and the Exercise Physiology Core – provide access to large, expensive equipment and techniques that otherwise would not be available or cost-effective to individual investigators. These facilities operate on a fee-for-service basis; and, after development costs and other expenses, the core facilities average a cost recovery of 69%, with differential funded by Pratt allocations. These resources provide a competitive advantage to acquiring emerging technologies, and they are critical to the School of Medicine’s success in recruitment and retention of faculty and its ability to continue to grow its externally funded research programs.**
