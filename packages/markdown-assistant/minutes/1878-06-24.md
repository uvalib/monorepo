On motion the Board adjourned to meet tomorrow at 8 A.M.

The Board met in pursuance of adjournment on yesterday.

Present the same members as on yesterday with the addition of Mr. Conrad who arrived this morning.

On motion the following resolution was adopted: The Board of Visitors having maturely considered the recommendation of the Faculty for the appointment of a Committee of their body, with whom the Board may confer in certain cases, doth Resolve.

That this Board deems it very desirable that it should have an opportunity to obtain information and suggestions, from the Faculty, without delay, on important recommendations contained in their reports, and on any other subjects of difficulty that may come before it, and doth therefore declare, that on the notification of this Board, that such information and suggestions are desired, the Faculty may be heard through a Committee of their own selection, unless in any case a different mode may be deemed advisable.

On motion, Resolved, that a Committee of three be appointed to consider and report on the following subjects.

1. How much is given or surrendered to each student messing by the University- Whether or not it is expedient to return to the plan formerly followed of assigning to each Boarding House certain dormitories for the year; the Mess being treated as a Boarding House.

2. Whether the Board paid by each student should not be reduced and how much?

Messrs Randolph, Whitehead and Hart were appointed Committee under the foregoing resolution.

Mr. Stuart, the Rector, appeared and assumed his position in the Board.

The following Reports \&c were received through the Chairman of the Faculty, viz-

* Annual Report of the School of Animal & Agricultural Chemistry.
* Inventory of apparatus \&c in charge of Mr. Dunnington Adj. Prof. of Animal & Agricultural Chemistry.
* Application of Mrs. S. E. Massie, widow of Henry Massie deceased for the Hotel lately kept by her husband.
* Class Reports of such of the Schools as were not submitted on yesterday all of which were referred to the appropriate Committees.

The Committee on the Conduct of Schools submitted the following report, which upon being read and considered on motion was approved and adopted.

Gentlemen- Your Committee on the "Conduct of the Schools" beg leave to submit the following report.

1. To express their gratification at the full report furnished by each professor.
2. To congratulate the Board of Visitors and the Faculty on the orderly conduct and studious habits of the past session and the number & high grade of graduates reported.
3. The mode of applying discipline to students absent from class or neglecting class work is slow and cumbrous; and inefficient because ending in leave to withdraw from College or expulsion in incorrigible cases the punishment would not be wisely inflicted where the fault was in one school only. We recommend therefore that the Professor in whose class such neglect has occurred should be empowered on consultation with the Chairman, who should also decide whether to bring the special case before the Faculty or not, and with his consent to drop the offender from the Roll of his class. The student having the right to appeal from the Professor and Chairman to the Faculty.
4. The committee is fully aware of the numerous difficulties surrounding the subject of the length of examinations. In written examinations the tendency is always too great length, it is to be feared in some instances that they degenerate into physical rather than mental tests.

Your Committee therefore urge upon Professors the importance of making every effort to make their examinations as short as is consistent with a fair and full test of the candidates' knowledge.

5. Your Committee have been much impressed with the importance of the establishment of a School of English in the Institution as urged by three of the Professors. We quote the following extracts—; Prof. Price says "If the authorities of the University could so act by establishing a professorship of the English language here, as to encourage and require the study of the English both at the University itself and in the Schools that feed the University, immense impulse would be given to the successful study of the Greek, to all other philological studies of the University and to the general culture of our undergraduates and graduates. The young men in the great majority of cases, come up to us so grossly ignorant of their own language as to be wantonly unfit to learn the other languages that they try to study", Prof. Schele in speaking of the state of preparation in his class as compared with previous years says—;"Inferior in the whole, an inferiority especially perceptible in the want of a thorough English education". This subject is beginning to much agitate the educational world and the necessity of a more careful and scientific study of the English language both with regard to its effective use and with respect to its relations to other studies is generally recognized. In many other institutions chairs of the English language have been established and courses of instruction are now offered their students much superior to anything the University now offers. We are not willing that the University of Virginia shall be behind in this matter and we greatly lament that our financial condition seems to render the immediate erection of such a Chair perilous if not impossible.

6. The Professor of Modern languages requests than an additional hour should be given time for his senior classes of French and German each week. The Catalogue shows only two hours during the week assigned him for Senior French; if practicable we would suggest to the Faculty that an additional hour should be assigned Prof. Schele for his Senior French Class. The Senior German Class having three hours per week we fear additional time could not be assigned.

We regret to be obliged to disapprove of the Professor's request to be allowed to decline to form a class in any one of the Modern Languages when there is not at least three students in that class as also the request that students be prohibited from studying more than two modern languages in one session. While we may regret the labor imposed on the Professor we do not think it right that the Institution should fail to afford instruction in any study embraced in her recognized schools that a student may select.

7. The Professor of Natural Philosophy urgently requests an appropriation in addition to his annual appropriation to enable him to purchase certain articles necessary for his School. He states that his school has no good Air Pump, nor Spectroscope, nor modern electroscope of any kind nor a gramme machine.

These articles seem to us of such prime importance that notwithstanding the urgent need of the greatest economy we recommend if possible an appropriation of two hundred dollars for that purpose.

8. Your Committee hope that at their next meeting the Faculty will be ready to report a plan for modifying the Degrees to improve the present requirements of the Institution on that subject. In our opinion it is a matter of great importance to the institution.

9. Your Committee ask that the Board of Visitors will request the Faculty to prepare a printed form for their reports as being more convenient for them and also for the Committee.

Your Committee asks leave to make a special report on the subject of the School of Applied Mathematics & Analytical Chemistry. They have not as yet such information as they may obtain by consultation with the Professor.

For the same reason we ask leave to be allowed to make a similar report on the School of Analytical and Agricultural Chemistry.

The Board met pursuant to adjournment on yesterday. The Rector in the Chair. Present the same members as on yesterday.

The Committee to whom was referred the application of the Proctor for leave of absence reported the following resolution which on motion was adopted: viz

Resolved- That the Board accede to the request of the Proctor that he may be absent from the University from about the 10th of July until the first week in September, it being understood that the Proctor will see to it that all matters needing his attention during that period shall be cared for by a competent person.

The Chairman of the Faculty presented to the Board the Applications respectively of Messrs Henry E. Harris and T. W. Harrison, (with his remarks appended to each), to be allowed to stand special examinations which being read and considered-on motion- Ordered- That the applications of T. W. Harrison and Henry E. Harris for leave to stand re-examinations on certain subjects, be recommitted to the Faculty with the recommendation that the applications be granted, if in the opinion of the Faculty the circumstances of each case make it proper and the interests of the University will not suffer thereby.

On motion the Board adjourned to meet tomorrow at 9 A.M.
