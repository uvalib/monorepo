## REPORT ON LEGISLATIVE MATTERS

The President summarized the actions of the 1987 General Assembly that will impact the University. He discussed the favorable actions providing for salary increases for the second year of the biennium, the satisfactory outcome of the proposed reduction related to excess enrollments and the outcome of appropriations for the Thornton Hall remodeling project.

In non-budgetary areas, he was pleased with the actions related to admissions policy. This calls for studies by the State Council of Higher Education. It did not set quotas for out-of-state enrollment.

Also acceptable was the favorable action on the Emergency Room Retention Bill, which will be helpful to our hospital officials.

He noted also that the General Assembly took no action on the bill to regulate charitable foundations. He said that the University was also pleased with the favorable action on the Pound Animal Seizure Act.

The President concluded by expressing concern about the bill passed by the General Assembly which effectively uncaps the mandatory retirement age. The President said that it was hoped this would not happen until the provisions of Federal legislation becomes effective, however the General Assembly decided, and acted to provide that uncapping should occur immediately to all except fire and police personnel.

## GIFTS, GRANTS AND CONTRACTS

The President said that so far, this has been a very good year for gifts, grants and contracts. He noted that in the Finance Committee Mr. Peavey had spoken very encouragingly about gifts to the University. With respect to contracts, the President said that income for a two month period (January and February 1987) is $9.3 million. For the fiscal year to date, the income is $40 million, with four months of the fiscal year remaining. All indications point to our high level of funding in spite of federal cutbacks. The President pointed with particular interest to the fact that the list of corporate contracts is quite extensive. The gifts, grants and contracts were approved.
