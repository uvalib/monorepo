At a meeting of the Visitors of the University of Virginia at the said University on Monday the 3d. of Oct. 1825. at which were present Thomas Jefferson Rector, James Madison, James Breckenridge, Joseph C. Cabell, John H. Cocke, Chapman Johnson and George Loyall.

In pursuance of the resolution of the board of the 5th. of March last, on the subject of a claim of Mr. Bonnycastle to the discharge of a certain bond for 500.Â£ sterling given by him to the British government, the Rector having agreed with him that the money for payment thereof should be advanced by the University to be repaid by him in instalments, RESOLVED that the board approves of the sd agreement, and of the provisional measures taken by the Rector in his letters to Rufus King, and Peter Barlow, bearing date the 30th. of June last, for it's advance, if required by that government.

Resolved that the Board ratifies and confirms the purchase lately made by the Rector of 132. acres of land of John M. Perry, lying between and adjacent to the two parcels of 107-8/10 and 153, acres heretofore owned by the University, which purchase was made on the proposition of the Rector with the approbation of the following members, to wit, of James Madison, James Breckenridge, John H. Cocke, Joseph C. Cabell, and George Loyall, previously expressed in letters from them individually to the Rector, and the payment already made towards the same, is approved.

Resolved that the board approves of the advance of 18,000. Dollars to William Hilliard, agent for procuring the library, of the deposit made in the hands of Rufus King esquire, of 6300.D. for the purchase of a Philosophical apparatus, and of that of 3157.50 in the same hands for articles necessary for the Anatomical school, with the instructions relative thereto given by the Rector, and also of the purchase, and payment of 500.D. for Doctor Emmet's Chemical apparatus and collection of minerals.

Resolved that the temporary application of 5000.D. of the library fund, which was lying unemployed in the bank of Virginia, to take up the note for the like sum, lent by the Farmer's bank of Virginia to the University, thereby saving it's interest, and also of so much of the said fund as was necessary to make the first payment to Perry, is approved, and that the same sums be replaced from the general fund when necessary.

Resolved that Francis Walker Gilmer be appointed Professor of the school of Law.

Resolved that it be communicated to the Faculty of the Professors of the University, as the earnest request and recommendation of the Rector & Visitors, that so far as can be effected by their exertions, they cause the statutes and rules enacted for the government of the University, to be exactly and strictly observed; that the roll of each school particularly, be punctually called at the hour at which it's students should attend; that the absent and the tardy, without reasonable cause, be noted, and a copy of these notations be communicated by mail or otherwise to the parent or guardian of each Student respectively, on the first days of every month during the terms, instead of the days prescribed in a former statute for such communications.

That it is requested of them to make known to the Students that it is with great regret that some breaches of order, committed by the unworthy few who lurk among them unknown, render necessary the extension to all, of processes afflicting to the feelings of those who are conscious of their own correctness, and who are above all participation in these vicious irregularities. While the offenders continue unknown, the tarnish of their faults spreads itself over the worthy also, and confounds all in a common censure. But that it is in their power to relieve themselves from the imputations and painful proceedings, to which they are thereby subjected, by lending their aid to the Faculty, on all occasions towards detecting the real guilty. The Visitors are aware that a prejudice prevails too extensively among the young, that it is dishonorable to bear witness, one against another. While this prevails, and under the form of a matter of conscience, they have been unwilling to authorise constraint, and have therefore, in their regulations on this subject indulged the error, however unfounded in reason or morality. But this loose principle in the Ethics of school boy combinations, is unworthy of mature and regulated minds; and is accordingly condemned by the laws of their country, which, in offences, within their cognisance, compel those who have knowledge of a fact, to declare it for the purposes of justice, and of the general good & safety of society, and certainly, where wrong has been done, he who knows and conceals the doer of it, makes himself an Accomplice, and justly censurable as such. It becomes then but an act of justice to themselves, that the innocent and the worthy should throw off with disdain all communion of character, with such offenders, should determine no longer to screen the irregular and the vicious under the respect of their cloak, and to notify them, even by a solemn association for the purpose, that they will cooperate with the Faculty in future, for the preservation of order, the vindication of their own character, and the reputation and usefulness of an Institution, which their country has so liberally established for their improvement, and to place within their reach those acquirements in knowledge, on which their future happiness and fortunes depend. Let the good and the virtuous of the Alumni of the University do this, and the disorderly will then be singled out for observation, and deterred by punishment, or disabled by expulsion, from infecting with their inconsideration the institution itself, and the sound mass of those which it is preparing for virtue and usefulness.

Although nocturnal absences from their Chambers, occasionally happening, are not entirely forbidden, yet if frequent, habitual, or without excusable cause, they should be also noted and reported, with other special delinquencies to the parent or guardian.

The Rector and Visitors, impressed themselves with the beneficial effect, and the necessity of strict examinations of the Students, on the topics of the lectures and lessons delivered them, recommend this practice to the consideration and attention of the Professors.

The Board, considering that it will be for the benefit of the school of Medicine that its Professor should have opportunities of keeping in mind, to a certain degree, the practical part of his profession, and of acquiring moreover a knowledge of the peculiarities of disease incident to our climate and country, are of opinion that, besides the habitual practice within the precincts of the University, allowed by a former resolution, he be permitted also to act as a consulting physician elsewhere, so timing these avocations however as not to interrupt the regular business of his school.

The 4. acres and 55/100 of lands purchased of Daniel A. Piper and Mary his wife, since the date of the Statute defining the Precincts of the University, and adjacent to the public road as now established, are made a part of the sd Precincts.

Resolved that it be recommended to the Faculty of Professors, in their appointment of a Janitor, to have regard to his qualifications in law as a witness to transactions passing within his notice, and that such a Janitor be allowed wages not exceeding 200.D. a year, and a room to lodge in, he dieting, and otherwise finding himself.

Resolved that on a renewal of the leases of the Hotels, it shall be made a covenant and condition of the leases that the tenant shall furnish no entertainment in his tenement for pay or compensation of any kind, to any one who is not a Student of, or attached to the University, or a member of his own family: nor shall he permit his tenement, or any part of it, for or without compensation, to be used for any other than the purposes of a Boarding house. The Faculty of Professors, on these questions, shall be judges of the matter of fact, and, finding it true, shall decide either on the immediate determination of the lease, & removal of the tenant, or his continuance on such special conditions as shall satisfy them against a repetition of the offense.

Resolved that the 35th. enactment be amended by striking therefrom the following words \`within those precincts, within their own chamber, or in diet, a seat of degradation in his schoolroom of longer or of shorter duration, removal to a lower class, imposition of a task'.

Resolved that the 36th. enactment be amended by striking therefrom the word `minor' and inserting in lieu thereof the word `major'.

Resolved that the 39th. enactment be amended by striking therefrom the words \`impose a task'.

Resolved that the 43d. enactment be amended by striking therefrom the following words `and repetitions of such offences by expulsion from the University' and inserting in lieu thereof the following words `or any of the minor or major punishments at the discretion of the Faculty'.

Resolved that the 43d. enactment be amended by adding thereto the following words \`that every occupant of a Dormitory permitting these offences therein, be subject to any of the minor punishments at the discretion of the Faculty'.

Resolved that the Faculty shall have the power, for offensive conduct, of removing the Occupant from any dormitory.

Resolved that if a Student be irregular in all his classes for more than a month, after his parent or guardian has been informed, the Faculty shall have the discretionary power to dismiss him from the University.

Resolved that the Faculty shall have power from time to time to prescribe regulations of police, not inconsistent with the laws of the land, or the enactments of this Board, which regulations shall be submitted to the Visitors at their next succeeding meeting, and shall be in force till disapproved by the Visitors or repealed by the Faculty.

The Board then adjourned to tomorrow.

Tuesday Oct. 4. the board met according to adjournment. Present the same members as yesterday.

On complaint from the Faculty of certain riotous proceedings of some of the Students on the nights of Sep. 30. and Oct. 2. and of insults on some of the Professors the whole of the Students were called before the board of Visitors. They were exhorted to state to the board the facts which had taken place with their knowledge, whereupon 14. of them came forward and acknowledged that on the night of the 2d. they had masked & disguised themselves and gone out on the lawn where they had made some noise but denied they had committed any trespasses or insults on the Professors, and on their engaging to appear before the board of the Faculty and to repeat to them the information now given, they were dismissed.

The board receives from Messrs. Key and Long a written declaration that in consequence of the transactions which had taken place, and particularly of a remonstrance of the day before subscribed by 65. students they could no longer remain in their present situations, that they had lost all confidence in the signers of that remonstrance, and cannot, and will not meet them again.

The board adjourned to tomorrow.

Wednesday Oct. 5. the board met according to adjournment. Present the same members as yesterday.

Resolved that the 47th. enactment be amended by inserting after the word `chewing' the words `or smoking'.

No Student shall appear out of his dormitory masked or disguised in any manner whatsoever which may render the recognition of his person more difficult on pain of suspension or expulsion by the Faculty of Professors.

Intoxication shall, for the first offence be liable to any of the minor punishments, and any repetition of the offence to any of the major punishments.

Resolved that the 40th. enactment be amended by inserting after the word `dissipation' the words `of profane swearing'.

No person who has been a student at any other incorporated Seminary of learning shall be received at this University but on producing a certificate from such Seminary or other satisfactory evidence to the Faculty with respect to his general good conduct.

The Professors being charged with the execution of the laws of the University, it becomes their duty to pursue proper means to discover and prevent offences. Respect from the Student to the Professor being at all times due, it is more especially so when the Professor is engaged in this duty. Such respect therefore is solemnly enjoined on every Student, and it is declared and enacted that if any Student refuse his name to a Professor, or being required by him to stop, shall fail to do so, or shall be guilty of any other disrespect to a Professor, he shall be liable to any of the punishments minor or major.

Resolved that the compensation to the Accountant whom the Committee of accounts has employed or may employ at any time to be 10. Dollars a day while employed.

The act of Congress imposing an additional duty of 15. per cent on works of marble having been passed after the marble capitels for the Portico of the Rotunda had been ordered, it is considered as retrospective and unjust, and that it will be proper to apply to Congress for a remission of that portion of duty thereon, and as it may be thought by that body but a just encouragement to science to relieve the University from the old as well as new duties on the marbles recently received for the same building, it will be expedient to bond the whole duties for 8. months to give time for application to Congress on the subject.

And thereupon the members executed the requisite bond in their individual characters, instructing at the same time the Proctor to retain in his hands always, a sufficient sum to pay the duties old and new if ultimately required.

Resolved that 400. copies of a new edition of the enactments of the board of Visitors for the government of the University be printed, in which the amendments made since the date of each enactment shall be incorporated, so that the same shall read, in form and substance as now established.

The board being of opinion that so much of the grounds of the University as can be conveniently applied to that purpose, should be laid off in lots for the uses of the Professors, the Proctor and keepers of the Hotels, rent free, but to be enclosed and improved at their expense, therefore

Resolved that the Proctor, under the direction of the Executive Committee do cause such lots to be laid off, and assigned to the several pavilions & Hotels and to the Proctor's house.

Resolved that on the supposition that the Renters of the Hotels might reasonably have expected 33. boarders for the term at the rent of 200.D. in which they have been more or less disappointed, the Board of Visitors deem it just that in consideration of the particular circumstances of the present year an abatement should be made in the rent of each in the proportion of the number of boarders each had, and the time of his boarding with them combined.

The board adjourned to tomorrow morning.

Thursday Oct. 6. the board met according to adjournment. Present the same members as yesterday.

Resolved that Mr. Johnson, Mr. Cabell and Mr. Loyall be appointed a Committee, whose duty it shall be to consider and inquire what system may be digested for the better government of the University; that they be especially charged with the duty of considering how far it may be practicable and prudent to connect with the University a Court having cognisance over misdemeanors committed within the precincts of the University, and over those committed by members of the University, within the county of Albemarle; and that they report thereupon to the next meeting of the Visitors.

Resolved that for the purpose of receiving the report of the Committee appointed by the preceding resolution, and of acting thereupon, and for the transaction of such other business as may then require attention, an extra meeting of the board be held on the second Monday in December next.

A communication from the Faculty of Professors is received in the following words, to wit, \`University of Virginia. Ordered that Wilson Miles Carey having on the night of the 1st. instant resisted the authority of a Professor, used violence against him, and excited others to follow his example, and for abusive epithets concerning the said Professor, be expelled from the University. Copied from the minutes of the Faculty. Robley Dunglison Secretary. George Tucker chairman of the Faculty. Oct. 6. 1825.' Resolved that the said sentence is unanimously approved by the board of Visitors.

Another communication from the said Professors is received in the following words, to wit, \`University of Virginia. Ordered that William L. Eyre having on the night of the 1st. inst. promoted a riot by repeatedly using indecent and opprobrious language respecting some of the Professors during the disturbance of the night in question, and having refused to give his name when called upon by two Professors, be expelled from the University. Copied from the minutes of the Faculty. Robley Dunglison secretary, George Tucker, chairman 1825. Octob. 6.' Resolved that the said sentence is unanimously approved by the Board of Visitors.

A third communication from the said Professors is also received in the following words, to wit, \`University of Virginia. Ordered that Robert A. Thompson having, in the night of the 1st. inst. armed himself with a stick for the purpose of resisting the authority of two Professors, be expelled from the University. Copied from the minutes of the Faculty. Robley Dunglison secretary. George Tucker, chairman. Oct. 6. 1825.' Resolved that the said sentence is approved by the Board of Visitors.

A letter is received from T. H. Key and George Long in these words, to wit, \`To the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia. Gentlemen. The undersigned Professors of the University of Virginia hereby tender to you the resignation of their respective chairs. T. H. Key. George Long. Oct. 6. 1825.'

Resolved that Chapman Johnson, Joseph C. Cabell & John H. Cocke be a Committee to communicate to Professors Key and Long the objections which occur to the board to the resignation of their offices as proposed in theirs of this day, and to confer with the said Professors on the subject of that letter.

Resolved that the said Committee do make known to the Faculty of Professors the proceedings which have been had upon their communication of the 2d. day of this month, relative to the disorders in the University, which have lately occurred, and that they also make known to them the names of those Students who voluntarily acknowledged themselves present and agents in some of the transactions complained of.

The Board adjourned to tomorrow.

Friday. Oct. 7. 1825. The Board met according to adjournment. Present the same members as yesterday.

Resolved that the Proctor be charged with the duty at all times, as the Attorney in fact of the Rector and Visitors, of preventing trespasses and intrusions on the property of the University real and personal, and of recovering its possession from any person who shall improperly withhold the same, and, for this purpose, that he institute such legal proceeding as may be proper. It shall also be his duty to lay before the civil authority, and to communicate to the proper law officer, such information as he may at any time have, and as may be calculated to prevent or punish breaches of the peace, trespasses and other misdemeanors within the precincts of the University, or committed by Students elsewhere, and especially that he take the proper measures to bring the late offences at the University before the civil authority.

A motion was made in the following words, to wit \`After the present year, the annual vacation shall commence on the 1st. of August and terminate on the 14th. of September. There may moreover be allowed a recess of all the schools for two weeks at Christmas. This regulation curtailing the next session to six tenths of the usual length, the fees of the Students for that session shall be reduced accordingly. But this resolution shall be suspended till approved by all the Professors. The said motion was ordered to be laid on the table.

Resolved that the Board of Visitors do not accept the resignation of the chairs of Professors T. H. Key and George Long. The Proctor is requested to communicate this resolution to those gentlemen.

Resolved, that in case of vacancy in the office of any Professor happening during the recess of this board, it shall be lawful for the Executive Committee to make such temporary arrangement for discharging the duties of the vacant chair as they may deem expedient, provided that such arrangement be not for a longer time than the next meeting of the board. If such vacancy shall involve the breach of contract on the part of any Professor, the Proctor shall be required to cause an action of Covenant, or other proper action to be brought upon the Contract, unless the Executive Committee shall deem it inexpedient.

A form of a Report, as annually required to be made to the President and Directors of the Literary fund, on the funds and condition of the University, was then proposed, amended, and agreed to, in the following words.

To the President and Directors of the Literary fund.

In obedience to the law requiring that the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia should make a Report annually to the President and Directors of the Literary fund (to be laid before the legislature at their next succeeding session) embracing a full account of the disbursements, the funds on hand, and a general statement of the condition of the said University, the said Rector and Visitors make the following REPORT.

That which was rendered on the 5th. of October of the last year informed the President and Directors of the Literary board of the state of preparation to which we were then advanced towards getting the institution into actual operation, of the measures taken for procuring Professors for the several schools, for purchasing some books and apparatus, and of the ground of hope then existing that it might be actually opened on the 1st. day of Feb. then next ensuing. It was not however until the 7th. of March that, the Professors of Antient & Modern languages, of Mathematics, of Natural philosophy, and of Anatomy and Medicine, being in place, the Institution was opened, and put into operation. Professors of the schools of Moral philosophy, and Natural history were received at short intervals afterwards: but no satisfactory engagement having been effected, till lately, of a Professor for the chair of Law, that school has not yet been opened, nor is it decided whether it will be most eligible to put it into operation at this advanced season of the year, or to await the beginning of the term in February next. The commencement on the 7th. of March was with about 40. students. Others continued to arrive from day to day at first, and from week to week since, and the whole number matriculated on the last day of the last month of September was 116. Few more can be expected during the present term, which closes on the 15th. of December next. And the state of the schools on the same day was as follows.

In the school of Antient languages were 55. scholars.

From the information received from different quarters we have reason to expect a large accession to our numbers at the commencement of the next term. The dormitories now provided can accommodate 218. Students. The neighboring town of Charlottesville perhaps 50. more. But should more be offered they could not be received. Ex-boarders too will labor under serious disadvantages, as, besides increased opportunities of relaxed order, they must lose the use of the library, the books of which cannot be permitted to be carried out of the precincts of the University.

A printed copy of the statutes and regulations enacted by the board of Visitors for the government of the University is now communicated. We have thought it peculiarly requisite to leave to the civil magistrate the restraint and punishment of all offences which come within the ordinary cognisance of the laws. At the age of 16. the earliest period of admission into the University, habits of obedience to the laws become a proper part of education and practice. The minor provisions and irregularities alone (unnoticed by the laws of the land) are the peculiar subjects of Academical authority. No system of these provisions has ever yet prevented all disorder. Those first provided by this board were founded on the principles of avoiding too much government, of not multiplying occasions of coercion, by erecting indifferent actions into things of offence, and of leaving room to the Student for habitually exercising his own discretion. But experience has already proved that stricter provisions are necessary for the preservation of order, that coercion must be resorted to where confidence has been disappointed. We have accordingly, at the present session considerably amended and enlarged the scope of our former system of regulations, and we shall proceed in the duties of tightening or relaxing the reins of government as experience shall instruct us in the progress of the institution; and we are not certain that the further aid of the legislature itself will not be necessary to enable the authorities of the institution to interpose, in some cases, with more promptitude, energy & effect than is permitted by the laws as they stand at present.

The lands heretofore purchased for the use of the University, consisted of two parcels, about half a mile distant from one another; the one of 153. acres, comprehending a small mountain, peculiarly adapted, and important to be secured, for the purpose of an Observatory, whenever the future advance of circumstances may render such an establishment desirable. The other of 107-8/10 acres, made up of several small purchases, which constitute the site of the University itself. Between these is a parcel of 132. acres, which besides the consolidation of these possessions, and other and great conveniences offered by it, lies in the way of the water necessary for the supply of the establishment, which is brought in pipes, through it, from the high lands to the site of the University. From the benefit of this communication, we were liable to be cut off, at any moment, by the owner of this parcel of lands. It was lately offered to us, and at a price thought reasonable, to wit, at 50.D. the acre. We had, several years ago, paid 40.D. for the parcel adjacent on one side, and 100.D. the acre had been given by an individual for a larger parcel adjacent on another side. The consideration that the purchase would so far lessen the funds for finishing the Rotunda, called certainly for serious hesitation. But the supply of water indispensable to the establishment. The irrecoverable loss of it, if sold out to individuals in lots, as proposed by the proprietor, made it, in our view, an over-ruling duty to secure the University against so irreparable an injury, and we concluded the purchase. This now gives to the institution a tract of nearly 400. acres, beyond the limits of which it has nothing to desire.

The last Report stated that, in addition to the sum of 19,370.40Â½ which had been paid or provided towards the building called the Rotunda, there were still remaining, of the general funds, a sum of about 24,000. D. applicable to that building; that this sum, although not sufficient to finish it, would put it into a state of safety, and of some uses, until other and more pressing objects should have been accomplished. It has been indispensable to finish the Circular room, destined for the reception of the books; because, once deposited in their places, the removing them for any finishing which might be left to be done hereafter, would be inadmissible. That has therefore been carried on actively, and we trust will be ready in time for the reception of the books. The other apartments of indispensable use were, two for a Chemical laboratory, one for a Museum of Natural history, and one for Examinations, for accessory schools, and other associated purposes. An additional building too for Anatomical dissections, and other kindred uses, was become necessary. We are endeavoring to put these into a bare state for use, although with some jeopardy as to the competence of the funds.

On representations to the General government of the interest which the legislature of Virginia had given to their University in certain claims then depending between them, of the great disadvantages under which that institution must labor, without the books and apparatus which this donation was to supply, that government did not hesitate to aid us with an advance, on account, of such a sum as might cover that given to the University. A Catalogue of books for the Library was thereupon prepared, an Agent employed to purchase them, wherever they could be obtained cheapest & best, and a sum of 18,000.D. for this purpose was placed at his disposal. A previous sum of 7,677.81 had been advanced by the general fund for the purchase of books, and apparatus of immediate necessity; and a sum of 6000.D. appropriated on loan towards preparing the room in the Rotunda destined for a Library, making together 31,677.81. For the purchase of a Philosophical apparatus, a sum of 6000.D. was deposited in London (having cost here 6300.D.) a list of the proper articles, and their selection & purchase were committed to a character there highly qualified for the execution of the charge, and another sum of 3000.D. was deposited in London (having cost here 3157.50) for the acquisition of articles necessary for the Anatomical school, which with 500.D. paid for a chemical apparatus, and 289.58 for transportation and other miscellaneous expenses, amount to 41,924.89 leaving a balance of 8,075.11 for defraying incidental expenses, which will be considerable. A good proportion of these articles we are in hopes to receive this autumn, and the residue in the ensuing spring. Some donations of mineral collections have already been received, others destined for the University are known of, and it is believed we shall, in this way, be supplied sufficiently for all the purposes of education. Much too may be expected from the future industry of the alumni themselves of the University, when they shall have entered on the active business of life.

The receipts by the Collector of arrearages of subscriptions since the date of our last report have amounted to 2734.89 and the balance still to be expected is 4306.53Â½ leaving a sum of 4500.D. desperate as believed.

The accounts for the receipts, disbursements and funds on hand for the year ending with the late month of September, as rendered by the Bursar and Proctor are given with this Report.
