Third. In case at any time it shall be deemed for the interest of the endowment that the securities should be sold and the proceeds invested in other securities, it is understood that the re-investment shall be in securities of the best class, the safety being looked at more than largeness of return.

The Board desires to express its gratitude to Mr. George H. Byrd for his liberal and important contribution for preserving the records of the History and Literature of Virginia, which the Board deems a specially appropriate memorial to his gifted son, Alfred Henry Byrd, who was at once distinguished not more for his great success as a student here than for his personal love for the University of Virginia.

The Board orders that every book purchased with the revenue derived from the Alfred Henry Byrd fund shall have printed clearly on a card to be pasted on the inside cover of such book the following words - "Purchased by the Alfred Henry Byrd endowment fund in aid of the Library of the University of Virginia".
