A special meeting of the Rector and Visitors was held on this date at 8 o'clock P. M., with the following members present: The Rector, C. Harding Walker, and Visitors Buchanan, Carson, Hull, McIntire, Munford, Rinehart, Scott, and Williams, and President Alderman.

The minutes of the previous meeting, copies of which had been sent to the members, were approved.

The President announced the attendance for the winter session, **2137**.

The following gifts and bequests were announced:

Upon the recommendation of the President the following members of the faculty were unanimously elected as per resolutions following

RESOLVED, by the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that Dr. Scott Buchanan be and is hereby elected Associate Professor of Philosophy at the University of Virginia, at a salary of **$4,250** per annum, incumbency to begin September 15, 1929.

RESOLVED, by the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that Dr. Duncan Clark Hyde be and is hereby elected Acting Associate Professor of Economics at the University of Virginia for the session 1929-30, at a salary of **$3,750**, incumbency to begin September 15, 1929.

A number of ladies representing educational and civic clubs of the state, among whom were Miss Cornelia Adair, representing the State Teachers Association, Miss Nora Houston of Richmond, and Mrs. John H. Lewis of Lynchburg, representing the League of Women Voters; Mrs. Dexter Otey, of Lynchburg, and Mrs. Edna Ramsey Richardson, of Richmond, representing the American Association of University Women, Mrs. J. K. Bowman, representing the Business and Professional Women's Clubs; Miss Lucy Mason, representing the Young Woman's Christian Association, Mrs. J. H. Cohn, representing the Council of Jewish Women, and Mrs. Randolph Maynard, of Richmond, chairman of the group, appeared before the Board in the interest of the proposed establishment of a Liberal Arts College for Women under the auspices of the University of Virginia. No action was taken on the matter at this time.

Messrs. Murray McGuire, J. H. Neff, D. J. Wood, J. K. Sloan, of the Athletic Council of the University of Virginia appeared before the Board requesting the creation of the position of Athletic Director with academic rank with a salary to be paid either entirely by the University of Virginia, or jointly with the General Athletic Association, and that a fee be set up by the University to be known as an athletic fee to be charged against the students as a part of their University expenses. Following the hearing in the above matter the Board adopted the following resolutions:

RESOLVED, that the position of Athletic Director be established in this University, and that the President be authorized to make a selection of a suitable person for the position, and report the same to the Board for confirmation.

RESOLVED, that the Rector appoint a committee composed of the President and Mr. Newcomb to consider and report upon the advisability, of establishing an athletic fee in the University, and to make a recommendation as to the amount of such fee, if approved.

A special committee on professorial salaries appointed at the last meeting of the Board submitted its report as follows:

At the annual meeting of your body on Jule 11th, 1928, following the presentation of resolutions from the professorial staff concerning an increase in the salary schedule "a Committee consisting of Messrs. Hull, Buchanan and Carson was appointed to study the whole question of the salary scale, and report to the Rector and Visitors." Upon the urgent request of said Committee the Rector consented to serve as a member of the Committee.

After an extended study of statistical data concerning professorial salaries at various institutions located in all sections of the United States, your Committee met at the President's house, at the University of Virginia, on January 22nd, at eight P. M. At this meeting there were present, the Chairman, the Rector, and Senator Buchanan. Judge Carson was unable to attend because of sickness.

At this meeting we heard a committee appointed by the professors, verbally express their reasons for the requested increase in salaries. These reasons were supplemental to the printed report of the professors, which had previously been distributed to the several members of the Board. After the professors had stated their reasons and retired, President Alderman forcibly set forth his reasons why increases in salaries should be granted, discussing the subject from the standpoint of the Administration.

The Committee then studied sympathetically the professors' plan, which is set forth in Proposed Scale No. 1, a copy of which is hereto attached. This scale provides for a maximum salary for a full professor of **$7,500** with a minimum of **$6,000**. It was explained that if this scale should be adopted, it would require an annual appropriation in addition to our present University budget of **$191,575**. Although the Committee sympathized with the professors' proposal, it was quite evident that this proposal could not be adopted on account of the greatly increased cost.

Your Committee then studied a counter-proposal offered by the professors for adoption in case the money could not be found to adopt immediately their Proposed Scale No. 1. A copy of said counter-proposal, designated as Proposed Scale No. 2, is hereto attached. This contemplates the accomplishment at the end of six years of Proposed Scale No. 1. To meet this Proposed Scale No. 2 would require for the first year an appropriation, in addition to our present University budget, of **$68,375**; in the second year the appropriation would have to be further increased to the extent of **$41,500**; in the third year to the still further extent of **$39,500**; in the fourth year **$34,550** more, in the fifth year **$48,000** more, and in the sixth year, when the full Proposed Scale No. 1 would be attained and made effective, **$39,250** more, so that these accumulated increases, figured on the basis of our existing professorial staff, would amount in the sixth year to an increase over our present University budget of **$271,175**. It was thought by your Committee that the University's finances would not justify the adoption of this plan, and moreover they did not feel that they would care to commit the Board over a period of six years.

After a rather full discussion, the Committee unanimously agreed to recommend to the Rector and Visitors the adoption of a salary scale known as Proposed Scale No. 4, which is hereto attached. This scale provides for a minimum salary of an instructor **$2,000**, maximum **$2,600**; assistant professor minimum **$2,800**, maximum **$3,400**, associate professor minimum **$3,750**, maximum **$4,250**, full professor minimum **$4,800**, maximum **$6,000**. This scale is spread over a period of thirty-three years from the first year instructor to the maximum for the full professor. That is to say, a man coming on our faculty with the rank of instructor at the age of twenty-five and being promoted according to this schedule would reach the maximum full professor's salary at the age of fifty-eight.

The Committee hoped that the **$6,000** maximum would enable us to attract to the University's service those professors whom we desire to have, and to hold in service most of our professors who are called to other institutions. The added annual cost of adopting this proposed scale for the existing members of the teaching staff is **$85,625**. It is suggested that this addition to the budget be cared for in the following manner:

1. **$26,000**, now appropriated by the University for Service Scholarships and fellowships, be released for this purpose and these scholarships and fellowships be charged against that part of the DuPont Fund specially allocated to the to the field of scholarships and fellowships.

2. That **$30,000** be appropriated to this purpose from that part of the DuPont Fund which can be used for general educational purposes.

3. That the State be asked to contribute **$30,000** for this purpose. A request that the State provide **$30,000**, which is approximately one-third of the total cost, seemed to us to be reasonable and appealing.

We unanimously recommend the tentative adoption of Proposed Scale No. 4 to begin with the session of 1929-30, and suggest that this proposal be taken to the Governor for his approval before final action is taken by the Board.

This February 1st, 1929.

***

This Proposed Scale No. 2 is the immediate, or first year's, step toward the gradual attainment, over a six year period, of the full Proposed Scale No. 1, - this attainment to be accomplished by means of an automatic **$300** increase each year for full professors, **$200** increase each year for associate professors, and **$100** increase each year for assistant professors, and in addition such increases as would be due under the schedule of normal advancement due to longer service in rank, until in the sixth year the Proposed Scale No. 1 would become effective.

In connection with the foregoing report the following motion, duly seconded, was adopted:

RESOLVED, that the Board approve of the salary increase recommended in the foregoing report as set forth in scale No. 4.

The special committee of the faculty appointed some time ago to recommend a policy with reference to distribution of the scholarship and fellowship fund arising under the Dupont bequest reported the result of its efforts up to the present time and outlined to the Board a tentative arrangement and stated that it would require further study to perfect the plan. The Board approved of the plan in general, subject to such modifications as may hereafter be adopted.

The meeting then adjourned.
