The Board met pursuant to adjournment on yesterday.

Present, the Rector and the same members as on yesterday and in addition, Col. Campbell.

The Rector laid before the Board a letter from Prof. Charles S. Venable expressing his thanks for the kind manner in which the Board expressed their confidence in him as the Chief Executive Officer of the University and asking for reasons stated in the letter to be permitted to decline the office- which letter was ordered to be filed.

The Finance Committee submitted its report, which being considered was adopted as follows:

Resolved-

1. That in view of the continued embarrassment of the finances of the University and the difficulties arising out of this fact- it is deemed best to avoid the adoption of any general rules of action in relation to salaries, at the present session of the Board.

2. That without intending to establish any precedent for future action, the Board with a view to provide for the present emergency deem it expedient to fix the salaries of the Professors for the ensuing year as follows: viz-

Ordered

1. That until the further order of the Board, the following be the stated salaries paid to the respective Professors, viz-

2. That each professor be paid the full amount of fees of tuition paid on account of his chair.

3. That if in any school or chair the aggregate emoluments from salary and fees be less than $2000 there shall be paid to the professors, from the general fund, for instruction of state students, and other non paying students such a sum as shall make his aggregate pecuniary emoluments up to the sum of $2000.

4. That if the aggregate number of paying students shall decline below the number of the present session (1872-3) then in each school or chair affected by such decline, to an extent greater than if such decline were uniform in all the schools or chairs, there shall be paid to the professors thereof out of the general fund for instruction to state students and other non-paying students, such a sum as will make his emoluments equal to what they would be, if such decline were uniform in all the schools or chairs.

5. No professor shall under any circumstances whatever, receive less than the sum of $1000 a year. And if by reason of any general disaster, such as the dispersion of the students early in any session by the breaking out of an epidemic, or other extraordinary misfortune to the University, the foregoing scheme of compensation is rendered inequitable, the Board reserves to itself the authority to make such special provision in such case as to it may seem just and right, and will be consistent with the general laws.

On motion the further consideration of the Report of the Finance Committee was postponed until tomorrow.

The Board then proceeded to consider the letter of Prof. Venable noted as filed, in a previous part of today's proceedings. It was thereupon

Resolved That the Board of Visitors recognize the sufficiency of the reasons given by Professor Venable for declining the office of Chairman of the Faculty.

The Board desires to express upon its records its earnest appreciation of the zeal, ability and success with which Professor Venable has administered the office.

On motion the Board adjourned to meet tomorrow at 10 A.M.
