The Bursar presented the following matter, in connection with the will of Robert Burns Waddy, which was approved:

Under the will of Robert Burns Waddy, of Fayette County, Kentucky, which was probated June 16, 1921, his widow, Mrs. Fannie Herr Waddy is given a life estate in certain real estate designated as No. 356, West Main Street, Lexington, Kentucky, and upon the death of said widow, said will directs that said property be sold and the proceeds distributed among certain beneficiaries named in the will, The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia to receive the sum of Five Thousand Dollars ($5000.00) to create a scholarship to be known as the "Robert Burns Waddy Scholarship".

We are advised by Mr. Clinton M. Harbison of Lexington, Kentucky, Attorney for Mrs. Waddy, that great difficulty has been experienced in the rental of this property so as to produce an income for the widow. The said Mrs. Waddy has therefore filed her bill in equity in the Circuit Court of Fayette County, Kentucky, making all parties in interest defendants thereto, and asking that said property may be sold, the proceeds invested in United States bonds, the income from which will be paid to her during her life and the principal to be distributed in accordance with the terms of the will upon her death.

Mr. Harbison requests that an answer be filed by the University of Virginia, concurring in the prayer of said bill.

A formal answer was presented to the meeting, in which the University states that it is willing for said property to be sold and the proceeds invested and applied as above set out. A copy of said answer was ordered spread upon the minutes of this meeting, and it was

RESOLVED, that the Rector is hereby requested to execute said answer in the name and on behalf of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia.

The Buildings Committee of the Board reported the following expenditures on New Dormitories and Academic Building:

In connection with the location of the proposed College of Liberal Arts, for the education of women, the President presented the following statement of the matter for consideration:

1. The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia have given careful consideration to the suggestions now before the Commission authorized by the General Assembly of 1928 that there be established by the State a College of Liberal Arts, for the education of women. The Rector and Visitors are heartily in favor of the establishment of such a college, and the University desires, as it has always desired, to cooperate, and to serve in the wisest way the purposes of such a college, and the educational interests of the women of the Commonwealth.

2. The Rector and Visitors do not believe that there is wisdom or justice in the purpose to establish general co-education in the University, at least between young men and young women of undergraduate rank, and very profoundly believe that the chiefest function of the University, in so far as women are concerned, is to take the finest possible care of their higher education in the higher courses in the graduate field, and in the professional fields. We are now engaged in doing this successfully. We believe that any effort to place upon the University the obligation to build within its walls another and a separate College for women, would be most unwise, especially for the women, and would result in crippling for a long period the growth of the University as a great University, carrying forward work on the University levels. Their further thought is that the state can most practically and enduringly accomplish the establishment of a College of Liberal Arts for Women by converting some one of the Institutions now established and in operation, and least necessary for the technical advantages of training public school teachers, into such a college, under the direction and control of the Rector and Visitors and President and Faculty of the University of Virginia. The University would take pride in helping to inaugurate, define, and guide such an Institution.

3. The Rector and Visitors beg to suggest that grave consideration be given by the Commission to whether or not it might be financially desirable and educationally wise to consider the incorporation into the State's activities of some College of Liberal Arts for Women, of established excellence and authority, which, under University control, could serve satisfactorily the Liberal Arts needs of the women of Virginia.

4. It is the deliberate opinion of the Rector and Visitors that a College of Liberal Arts for Women be not established in the University, or so near the University that the individuality of the University as a non-coeducational institution may be endangered. They beg, finally, to express their belief that a College of Liberal Arts for Women, created under one or the other of the above suggestions, would realize for women in ever increasing usefulness and power, the advantages of a liberal education.

5. Theoretically, it might be reasonably claimed that the ideal system would be the College of Liberal Arts for Women, affiliated with the State University for Men, but independently managed, with an independent faculty and physical equipment, - allowing for some interchange between the two faculties, - situated such a number of miles distant as would insure proper independence, both for the College for Women and for the University, but with free access to the resources of the University to graduates of such a Women's College in graduate work, professional work, and the higher work of given subjects.

6. Practically, however, it is very evident that such a program, requiring the expenditure of several millions of dollars, would involve the peril of giving it all up and dumping the whole idea on the University for men, as an undergraduate task and duty. Motives of economy and expediency have unquestionably brought coeducation to State Universities throughout America, rather than profound reflection upon the educational principles lying at the root of the whole matter.

Following a full discussion of the foregoing paper it was disposed of, as follows:

On motion of Mr. Scott, paragraphs 5 and 6 were eliminated.

On motion, duly made and seconded, to adopt the paper, as amended, was carried by a vote of six to two, viz: Ayes; Buchanan, Hull, McIntire, Rinehart, Scott and the Rector. Noes; Carson and Mrs. Munford.

Judge Carson and Mrs. Munford requested the privilege of filing a paper setting forth their reasons for voting in the negative, which request was granted. Their reasons are set forth in the following:

Since I do not concur with the majority of my fellow members on the Board in the adoption of the pending resolution dealing with proposals looking to the establishment of a College of Liberal Arts for Women, it appears to be incumbent on me to set out, as briefly as may be, my own views on a matter of such vital import to the welfare of both the University and the State.

I am convinced that a College of Liberal Arts for Women should be established by the State as an integral part of the State University, under the direction and control of the Rector and Visitors and the President and Faculty of the University to a like extent and under like conditions to the direction and control now exercised by these officers of the University over the Undergraduate College for Men.

But whatever may be the merits of the arguments for or against the introduction of the co-educational system elsewhere, I am also convinced that there are strong and compelling reasons, peculiar to the University of Virginia, based upon her traditions and history and upon the intense and well nigh universal opposition of the great body of her alumni to the introduction of that system at their alma mater, at least between young men and young women of undergraduate rank, which demand the establishment of such a College of Liberal Arts for Women as a co-ordinate institution, separate and apart from the College for Men.

The College of Liberal Arts for Women in Virginia should, therefore, have a separate physical equipment, a separate Dean and, in part at least, a separate faculty (all of whom, however, should be members of the faculty of the University) by whom it should be managed and disciplined as a separate entity. And to insure a proper degree of independence, both for the College for Women and the University, it should not be located on or in the immediate vicinity of the present University grounds:though it should not be so far distant as to deprive the College for Women of the cultural advantages of an intimate and close association with the University, or to prevent the convenient interchange of faculties and the use, under suitable regulations, of the library, the hospital, and other resources and equipment of the University.

The requirements as to entrance, class work, courses of study, examinations, and academic degrees should be maintained on a par with those established in the College for Men, and the scholastic and intellectual standards set in the College for Women should be such that its graduates will be entitled to recognition on equal terms with the graduates from the College for Men in the Post Graduate and Professional Courses at the University. The degrees in the College for Women should be awarded and conferred by the University of Virginia on like terms and conditions to those prescribed in the College for Men.

The arguments which have been advanced in favor of the establishment of the proposed College of Liberal Arts for Women at one of the State Normal Schools or at one of the Women's Colleges now operating in the state do not appeal to me. They seem to rest largely if not altogether upon grounds of supposed economies in the original outlay for grounds, buildings, and physical equipment.

But if it is proposed to give the young women of the state anything like equal opportunities to those the State now furnishes to the young men in the undergraduate department of the University of Virginia, the saving in first cost by the establishment of a women's college at any of these institutions would be far more than counterbalanced, in the long run, by the increased appropriations necessary to build up and maintain the college as a separate institution deprived of the many and manifest advantages and benefits and continuing economies in operation which would be secured by its original establishment and maintenance as a co-ordinate college of the University.

If the State is unwilling or unable at this time to appropriate the amount necessary to erect the buildings and to furnish suitable physical equipment for a co-ordinate college such as that outlined above, I should be inclined to urge the postponement of the whole undertaking until such time as the increasing resources of the State will be sufficient to justify the expenditure.

I understand that there are two or more women's colleges now in the state doing excellent work in the field of higher education, within the limits of their restricted endowments and resources. The competition of a cheap state-supported college for women, conducted on grounds and buildings not originally designed for the purpose, under the direction of a cheap or underpaid administrative staff and faculty, could hardly fail to prove detrimental to the welfare of these institutions. And until and unless the State is prepared to establish a State College of Liberal Arts for Women worthy of the name, the field may well be left clear for the institutions now operating without State aid.

I do not believe that the aspirations of the women of Virginia will ever be satisfied with anything less than a state-supported College for Women of the first rank, comparable in standing and dignity with the state-supported Undergraduate College for Men at the University. Soon or late any makeshift or compromise substitute will be cast aside. And such makeshift or compromise experiment with a separate State College for Women having proved a failure, there are sound reasons for anticipating the possibility, and perhaps the probability, that the University will then be confronted with an irresistible demand for undergraduate co-education within its own walls.

In so far, therefore, as the opposition to the establishment of a co-ordinate college as an integral part of the University of Virginia, at or near the University, is based on fears that it may prove to be the opening wedge for the introduction of the undergraduate co-educational system at the University, it seems to me that in thus taking counsel of their fears, the proponents of what I have ventured to call makeshift or compromise measures are courting the very danger they dread.

Oxford, England (and the Women's colleges within ten minutes walk of the University), Harvard (Radcliffe) Columbia (Barnard) and other great Universities have blazed the way, and have shown us how mutatis mutandis the State and the University of Virginia can together respond to the just demands of the women of the State for equal opportunities under the educational system maintained by the State.
