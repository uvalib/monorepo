The Rector stated that the meeting was called for the particular purpose of considering a matter that had been discussed by Governor Darden with several members of the Board while at the Capitol on a recent visit there on other matters pertaining to the University, with respect to the advisability of discontinuing fraternity houses at the University, and read a letter that he had recently had from him and his reply thereto. Following a general discussion of the question, the following motion, offered by Lewis C. Williams, was adopted.

**RESOLVED**, That the letter from the Governor or Virginia be referred to a committee to be composed of three members of this Board appointed by the Rector, of which Mr. Stettinius shall be chairman, to study and report upon the desirability and discipline of fraternity houses.

The Rector appointed on the above committee:

The question of use of motor vehicles by students was considered and, upon motion, the following resolution was adopted:

**RESOLVED**, That no first-year students in the college, engineering or education departments shall, while the University is in session, maintain or operate a motor vehicle in the University, the City of Charlottesville or the County of Albemarle without the consent of the Dean of the University.

The following, presented by the President, was, on motion, adopted:

**RESOLVED**, by the Board of Visitors of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the President be and he is hereby authorized and directed to execute said Memorandum of Agreement, or Contract, between the United States of America and the University of Virginia in an amount not to exceed $4,500, to be paid by the United States of America for research in the Department of Physics under Dr. L.

Carruthers, Secretary of this Board, be and he is hereby authorized and directed to attest the signature, affix the seal, and certify that this Resolution was passed by authority of the Governing Board of the University, and is within the scope of its corporate powers.

**RESOLVED**, by the Board of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the President be and he is hereby authorized and directed to execute Memorandum of Agreement for extension of Contract No. OEMar-398 between the United States of America and the University of Virginia, in the amount of $50,000.00 for an additional six months work in the Department of Physics under direction of Dr. Jesse W. Beams, and

**RESOLVED**, FURTHER, that E. I. Carruthers, Secretary of this Board, be and he is hereby authorized and directed to attest the signature, affix the seal, and certify that this Resolution was passed by authority of the Governing Board of the University, and is within the scope of its corporate powers.

The President stated to the Board that in order to comply with the provisions of Section 57(a) of the Pennsylvania Fiduciaries Act, it is necessary for the University to appoint an Attorney-in-Fact in the City of Philadelphia upon whom process may be served, the necessity for this appointment arising in the settlement of the Estate of Samuel Phillips Mitchell, deceased, as a condition precedent to the payment by the Executors of said Estate to the University of the sum of $63,889.06 which passes to the University under the Will of said Samuel Phillips Mitchell, deceased.

The President recommended the appointment of the C T Corporation System, a Delaware subsidiary of the Corporation Trust Company as Attorney-in-Fact for this purpose, advising the Board that the charge of this Corporation for the services in question will be $15.00 per annum. After a discussion of the conditions surrounding this situation, it was, unanimously,

**RESOLVED** that the C T Corporation System be and is hereby appointed Attorney-in-Fact for The Rector and Visitors of the University, for it and in its name, place and stead to receive all notices and service of process in connection with the Estate of Samuel Phillips Mitchell, deceased, or growing out of the appointment of The Rector and Visitors of the University as Trustees under the Will of said decedent, giving and granting unto our said Attorney-in-Fact authority to act as fully and completely in the premises as The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia might do if personally present, and ratifying and confirming whatsoever said Attorney-in-Fact may lawfully do for said The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia in the premises. And J. L. Newcomb, President of this Corporation, is hereby authorized and empowered to execute a Power of Attorney in the name and on behalf of this Corporation granting the above powers to said C T Corporation System, and E. I. Carruthers, Secretary of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, is hereby authorized to affix, and duly attest the corporation seal thereto.

The President then presented to the meeting a form of bond payable to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, in the sum of $127,778.12, conditioned for the faithful execution by the University of Virginia of the uses and trusts declared by the Will of said Samuel Phillips Mitchell, deceased, stating that he was advised that the execution and delivery of this bond was also necessary as a condition precedent to delivery by the Executors of the funds above referred to. It was, thereupon, unanimously

**RESOLVED** that J. L. Newcomb, President of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, be and is hereby authorized to execute said bond in the name and on behalf of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, and E. I. Carruthers, Secretary of this Corporation, is hereby authorized and instructed to affix the corporate seal of the University to said bond and attest the same, and to deliver the same.

The President explained to the Board that the Civil Aeronautics Authority will undertake aviation training, both ground and flying, for enlisted men in the Army and Navy, and to carry out this purpose it was their desire to make contracts with various educational institutions operating airfields and giving ground training.

It was, thereupon,

**RESOLVED**, by the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the President be, and he is hereby, authorized and directed to enter into a contract with the Civil Aeronautics Authority for the conduct of this work at the University of Virginia.

The President stated to the Board that Mr. W. L. Gooch, of West Point, Virginia, who had a loan from Dr. Walter M. Seward during his lifetime, secured on a property at Hopewell, Virginia, had recently paid off the same, and had appealed to the University for a deduction of $142.50 representing the commissions which he had paid to dispose of the property in order to discharge the debt. The Board was sympathetic in understanding the situation, but they felt that they were without legal authority to remit any part of the principal and interest justly due on the debt.

A communication from the Federal Government to the President with respect to the establishment here of a school to train men for work in the Adjutant General's division was referred to the President with power to act.

The meeting then adjourned.
