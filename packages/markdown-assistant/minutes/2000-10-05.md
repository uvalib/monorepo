The Rector asked for approval of the Minutes of the Board meetings of June 16 and 17, July 14 and 15, and October 2; on motion, approval was given.

The Rector informed the Board of the annual requirement of the Atlantic Coast Conference that he certify that the Board understands that "responsibility for the administration of the athletics program has been delegated to" the President; that the President "has the mandate and support of the Board to operate a program of integrity in full compliance with NCAA, ACC and all other relevant rules and regulations;" and the President, "in consultation with the Faculty Representative and the Director of Athletics, determines how the institutional vote shall be cast on issues of athletic policy presented to the NCAA and the ACC." He advised the Board that he was signing the certification that day.

After discussion, the dates of the June 2001, meeting of the Board were changed from June 8th and 9th to June 15th and 16th.

The Rector asked the President to give his customary report. For the first item of his report, the President deferred to Mr. Sandridge, the Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Mr. Sandridge announced that the University's bond rating by Moody's has just been raised to AAA.

The President resumed his report with comments on recent national rankings of the University. He noted that for the first time since the State budget cuts of the early '90's, the University stands among the top twenty institutions in the country in the U.S. News and World Report ratings.

After reporting on the searches in progress (Chancellor of The University of Virginia's College at Wise, Vice President and Provost, Dean of the School of Law, etc.), the President reported on gifts made to the University between May 1, 2000, and July 31, 2000. Gifts and grants for the fiscal year which ended June 30, 2000, amounted to $195.3 million, an increase of $63.1 million over the previous fiscal year. He mentioned a number of individual gifts of interest.

The meeting of the full Board was recessed at 10:35 a.m., for a meeting of the Finance Committee.

WHEREAS, the 2000 Act may be repealed but the Project, as defined below, continues as an authorized project for bond financing through subsequent legislation (the 2000 Act and any such subsequent legislation, the "Act"); and\
WHEREAS, pursuant to the Act, the Treasury Board of the Commonwealth of Virginia (the "Treasury Board") is authorized, by and with the consent of the Governor, to sell and issue bonds or bond anticipation notes of the Commonwealth of Virginia for the purpose of providing funds, with other available funds, for paying the cost of acquiring, constructing, renovating, enlarging, improving and equipping certain revenue-producing capital projects at certain institutions of higher learning of the Commonwealth and for paying issuance costs, reserve funds and other financing expenses (the "Financing Expenses"), all in accordance with the provisions of Section 9(c) of Article X of the Constitution of Virginia; and\
WHEREAS, such revenue-producing capital projects include the Monroe Lane Student Residence Hall, Capital Outlay Project Number 16385 (the "Project") for the University of Virginia (the "Institution"); and\
WHEREAS, the Treasury Board is proposing to sell and issue bonds or bond anticipation notes pursuant to the Act for such revenue-producing capital projects, in one or more series;

RESOLVED that:

Section 1. The Board of Visitors of the Institution (the "Board") requests the Treasury Board to sell and issue bonds or bond anticipation notes ("BAN's") in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $4,800,000 to finance all or a portion of the costs of the Project plus Financing Expenses (individually, the "Project Bonds" or "Project Notes," collectively, the "Project Borrowing"). The Project Borrowing will be identified by amount by the State Treasurer upon issuance of any bonds or BAN's.

Section 2. The Board (a) covenants to fix, revise, charge and collect a housing fee and other rates, fees and charges, for or in connection with the use, occupation and services of the Project and (b) pledges such rates, fees and charges remaining after payment of (i) the expenses of operating the Project and (ii) the expenses related to all other activities funded by the housing fee ("Net Revenues") to the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Project Borrowing. The Board further covenants that it will fix, revise, charge and collect such rates, fees and charges in such amounts so that Net Revenues will at all times be sufficient to pay, when due, the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Project Borrowing and on any other obligations secured by Net Revenues (such payments collectively the "Required Payments"). The Project Borrowing shall be secured on a parity with such other obligations so secured by Net Revenues (other than any obligations secured by a prior right in Net Revenues). Any Net Revenues pledged herein in excess of the Required Payments may be used by the Institution for any other lawful purpose.

Section 3. It is hereby found, determined and declared that, based upon responsible engineering and economic estimates and advice of appropriate officials of the Institution, as shown on the Financial Feasibility Study, the anticipated Net Revenues pledged herein will be sufficient to pay the Required Payments so long as the aggregate amount of net debt service on the Project Borrowing actually payable in any bond year does not exceed the amounts assumed in the Financial Feasibility Study.

Section 4. The Board covenants that the Institution will furnish the Treasury Board its general purpose financial statements, within 30 days of their issuance and receipt, audited by a firm of certified public accountants or the Auditor of Public Accounts which shall include a schedule of revenues and expenditures for auxiliary enterprise systems. If Net Revenues are insufficient to pay Required Payments during such period, the Institution shall provide evidence of a plan to generate Net Revenues sufficient to make Required Payments in the future.

Section 5. The Board covenants that so long as any of the Project Notes are outstanding, the Institution will pay to the State Treasurer, not less than 30 days before each interest payment date, an amount estimated by the State Treasurer to be due and payable on such date as interest on the Project Notes. The Board covenants that so long as any of the Project Bonds are outstanding, the Institution will pay to the State Treasurer, not less than 30 days before each interest or principal payment date, the amount certified by the State Treasurer to be due and payable on such date as principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Project Bonds.

Section 6. The Board hereby approves and authorizes its Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer (officer) to execute and deliver on behalf of the Institution the Payment Agreement, to be completed with such changes as the officer of the Institution executing such Payment Agreement determines to be appropriate and in the best interest of the Institution.

Section 7. The Board covenants that the Institution will pay from time to time its proportionate share of all expenses incurred in connection with the sale and issuance of any series of bonds that includes Project Bonds or Project Notes and all expenses thereafter incurred in connection with the Bonds, including without limitation the expense of calculating any rebate to the United States of the earnings derived from the investment of gross proceeds of the Bonds, all as certified by the State Treasurer to the Institution.

Section 8. The Board covenants that the Institution will not take or omit to take any action the taking or omission of which will cause the Bonds to be "arbitrage bonds" within the meaning of Section 148 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, including regulations issued pursuant thereto (the "Code"), or otherwise cause interest on the Bonds to be includable in the gross income of the owners thereof for federal income tax purposes under existing laws. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Institution will pay from time to time its proportional share of any rebate to the United States of the earnings derived from the investment of the gross proceeds of the Bonds.

Section 9. The Board covenants that the Institution will proceed with due diligence to undertake and complete the Project and that the Institution will spend all of the available proceeds derived from the sale of the Project Borrowing for costs associated with the Project and appropriated for the Project by the General Assembly.

Section 10. The Board covenants that the Institution will not permit the proceeds of the Project Borrowing to be used in any manner that would result in (a) 5 percent or more of such proceeds being used in a trade or business carried on by any person other than a governmental unit, as provided in Section 141(b) of the Code, (b) 5 percent or more of such proceeds being used with respect to any output facility within the meaning of Section 141(b)(4) of the Code, or (c) 5 percent or more of such proceeds being used directly or indirectly to make or finance loans to any persons other than a governmental unit, as provided in Section 141(c) of the Code. The Institution need not comply with such covenants if the Institution obtains the written approval of the State Treasurer and an opinion of nationally recognized bond counsel acceptable to the Treasury Board that such covenants need not be complied with to prevent the interest on the Bonds from being includable in the gross income of the owners thereof for federal income tax purposes.

Section 11. The Board covenants that for so long as any of the Bonds are outstanding the Institution will not enter into any operating lease, management contract or similar agreement with any person or entity, other than a state or local governmental unit, for all or any portion of the Project without first obtaining the written approval of the State Treasurer and an opinion of nationally recognized bond counsel acceptable to the Treasury Board that entering into such agreement will not cause the interest on the Bonds to be included in the gross income of the owners thereof for federal income tax purposes.

Section 12. The Board covenants that for so long as any of the Bonds are outstanding, the Institution will not sell or dispose of any or any part of the Project without first obtaining the written approval of the State Treasurer and an opinion of nationally recognized bond counsel acceptable to the Treasury Board that such sale or disposition will not cause interest on the Bonds to be included in the gross income of the owners thereof for federal income tax purposes.

Section 13. The officers of the Institution are authorized and directed to execute and deliver all certificates and instruments and to take all such further action as may be considered necessary or desirable in connection with the sale and issuance of the Bonds.

## ATTACHMENT PERMANENT UNIVERSITY IMPLEMENTING PROCEDURES FOR MEDICAL CENTER PROCUREMENTS

A. Statement of Purpose and Authority\
B. Policy and Goals\
C. Methods of Contractor Selection\
D. Virginia Code Provisions Applicable to Procurements\
E. Contract Administration\
F. Remedies

1. Causes for Debarment
2. Ineligibility or Disqualification of Manufacturer
3. Debarment Period

These implementing procedures are the permanent procedures authorized and required by the Board of Visitors' June 14, 1996, resolution governing the exercise of procurement autonomy by the University on behalf of the Medical Center for Medical Center procurements. The Medical Center department authorized to undertake these procurements is Materiel Support Services. These procedures implement the Board requirements and those of Chapters 933 and 995 of the 1996 Virginia Acts of Assembly. These procedures shall be effective for all University procurements on behalf of the Medical Center thirty (30) days after the date transmitted to the President and the Board. These procedures are to be implemented by the Director, through Medical Center Purchasing, a division of Materiel Support Services, and they shall apply to the purchase of all goods and services, except construction and architectural and engineering services, by the University on behalf of the Medical Center.

In connection with Medical Center procurements and the processes leading to award of contracts, the Medical Center shall adhere to the following principles and guidelines:

These principles and guidelines shall be adhered to and incorporated into the procurement process as outlined in the following procedures.

All contracts with nongovernmental contractors for the purchase of goods or services shall be awarded by one of the following methods. In all instances, competition should be sought to the maximum practical degree, but no contract award will be reversed based upon the method of contractor selection used. Written records of all procurements shall be maintained. Vendors may be prequalified for particular types of contracts at the discretion of Medical Center Purchasing.

The following Virginia Code sections continue to apply to Medical Center procurements:

Where a procurement is undertaken for a brand name good, and substitution of an equal product is not authorized, the brand name designation shall be supported by a written determination that the named brand is necessary, or that sufficient intra-brand competition exists to make competition likely in the procurement.

Discrimination in procurements based upon race, religion, color, sex or national origin is prohibited. The Medical Center shall (a) ensure a non-discriminatory procurement process, and (b) prohibit employment discrimination by all vendors, firms, and contractors who provide goods and services to the Medical Center. These provisions shall be outlined in all formal procurement documents, including RFP's, IFB's, contracts and purchase orders. The Medical Center shall actively seek to involve minority business enterprises ("MBE") in its procurement processes. The Director, Materiel Support Services, shall coordinate these activities with the Director of Minority Procurement Programs for the University.

Medical Center Purchasing shall administer Medical Center contracts, including:

Contracts must include provisions requiring contractors to pay promptly all subcontractors upon receipt of payments from the University. Contracts may include provisions for retainage, where appropriate, and where the retention provisions are described in the solicitation. Contracts also may be modified, extended or enlarged by agreement between Medical Center Purchasing and the contractor where such modification, extension or enlargement is in the best interest of the University and the Medical Center.

The Medical Center shall pay invoices and interest on past-due invoices in accordance with good business practice and the applicable provisions of the Code of Virginia as outlined below. The payment due date for all Medical Center invoices shall be the later of: (a) thirty (30) days from the date of receipt of goods and/or services (providing no defect or impropriety is detected in the invoice or goods and/or services received), (b) the invoice due date, or (c) the due date established by contract. Payment may be made earlier than the payment due date as deemed appropriate by the Medical Center. The Medical Center shall pay interest on properly-presented invoices outstanding more than fourteen (14) days beyond the payment due date at a rate no higher than the lowest prime rate charged by any commercial bank as published in The Wall Street Journal. Payment of Medical Center invoices shall be made in compliance with the set-off procedures of the Virginia Debt Collection Act, Section 2.1-726 et seq. of the Code of Virginia. The Medical Center shall submit an annual report to the Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer which summarizes the total interest paid in conjunction with past due invoices for each fiscal year.

Formal processes for (a) submission of protests and appeals by vendors, firms, and contractors, and (b) debarment of vendors, firms and contractors by the University on behalf of the Medical Center in conjunction with Medical Center procurements are hereby established. The President of the University shall (1) designate an individual to whom protests shall be directed, and (2) appoint a Medical Center Procurement Appeals Board to whom appeals shall be directed for review and subsequent action. The Medical Center Procurement Appeals Board (the "Board") shall be comprised of five individuals with procurement and purchasing experience, one of whom shall be appointed chairperson. The initial Board shall include two members appointed for a term of one year, and three members, including the chair, who shall be appointed for terms of two years. All subsequent appointments shall be for terms of two years. The Board shall sit in panels of three members as appointed by the chair to consider appeals. The Board shall adopt written procedures governing its process, which shall provide for a hearing if requested by the vendor, and which shall require a written decision of the Board including findings of fact for all appeals. The University shall provide such staff as is necessary for the Board to complete its work.

Protests may challenge determinations of vendor, firm, or contractor non-responsibility or ineligibility, or award of contracts, provided that such protests and appeals are filed in writing and received by the Director, Materiel Support Services, within ten (10) calendar days of such actions by the Medical Center. Where the protest is dependent upon the provision of information to the vendor by the University, the ten (10) day period shall be tolled upon the vendor's request for such information and shall resume upon the requested information being made available to the vendor. Any protest shall state with specificity the basis of the challenge. Remedies shall be limited to reversal of the action challenged on the basis that it is arbitrary, capricious, not in accordance with law, or not in accordance with the terms and conditions of the solicitation documents.

Any appeal of the denial of a protest must be filed in writing with the Medical Center Procurement Appeals Board, in care of the Chief Contracting Officer of the University, and received by the Board within ten (10) calendar days of the denial of the protest. Remedies shall be limited to reversal of the action challenged on the basis that it is arbitrary, capricious, not in accordance with law, or not in accordance with the terms and conditions of the solicitation documents.

The University, on behalf of the Medical Center, may debar for a specified period or take corrective measures with any vendor, firm, or contractor, for one or more reasons. The causes for debarment, scope and term of debarment, and application of debarment provisions to other parties such as manufacturers or suppliers shall be those set forth below:

Debarment is action taken by the institution to exclude individuals or vendors from contracting with the institution for particular types of goods or nonprofessional services for specified periods of time. Debarment does not relieve the vendor of responsibility for existing obligations.

The purpose of debarment is to protect the institution from risks associated with awarding contracts to persons or vendors having exhibited an inability or unwillingness to fulfill contractual requirements, and to protect the institution's interests and the integrity of the procurement process by preventing individuals or vendors which have displayed improper conduct from participating in the institution's business for specific periods of time.

The debarring official can debar an individual or vendor without judicial determination for any of these reasons:

If the debarring official finds that the cause for debarment reflects on the vendor's traits or tendencies only with regard to certain goods or services, the debarment may apply only to such goods or services. Otherwise the debarment applies to all goods and services within the purview of the debarring institution.

Should any manufacturer commit any of the acts described under causes for debarment, bids offering material, equipment, or supplies manufactured by that vendor may be rejected even though the bid is submitted by a vendor in good standing.

Debarment is for a period of one year, except that debarment for reasons k., l., m., and n. may be for up to three years. Debarment commences upon notification of debarment, or if later, upon expiration of any existing debarments.

The debarring official may lift or suspend at any time the debarment if it is in the best interest of the institution. A debarred individual or vendor can apply for reinstatement at any time in writing to the debarring official citing actions taken to remedy the reason for debarment or to prevent recurrence of the situation that caused the debarment action. Examples of actions the debarring official may take into consideration include, but are not limited to:

Medical Center Purchasing shall document any instances which result in the above actions being taken, and any person debarred shall be notified in writing. Any contractor debarred may protest the action, and may appeal the denial of a debarment protest, under the same deadlines and procedures established for other protests and appeals.

Leases of real property shall be undertaken in conformity with procedures prescribed in the Higher Education Capital Outlay Manual, Appendix V.
