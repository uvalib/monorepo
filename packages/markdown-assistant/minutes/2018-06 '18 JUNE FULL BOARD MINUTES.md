**Comments by the Rector**

The Rector pointed out the many accomplishments and successes we have experienced over the last year. He thanked the faculty, staff, and Board for their efforts to deal with challenges and take advantage of the opportunities. He mentioned John Macfarlane and the dramatic difference he has made in the way the University

approaches issues, particularly the relationship between the University and the College at Wise. He said Mr. Macfarlane is a role model for all Board members to follow and he thanked him for all his hard work.

Rector Conner spoke briefly about community engagement. He said that there are a number of ways we need to improve our relationship with Charlottesville and not specifically just in terms of wages. He said there are those who believe that affordable housing is critical and there are those who believe the food system needs to be restructured in such a way that we can help the local economy and provide food for those who are hungry. He said we are doing many things in the health system that we can model. He said workforce development is a focus of the President-elect and he has already started conversations with local community leaders.

Mr. Conner spoke briefly about the presidential transition. He thanked President Sullivan and President-elect Ryan for their work so far. He said it is a time of uneasiness, especially given the fact that we are also looking at a transition of not just the president but also other senior positions. He said we will get through this time of transition and with great success.

Mr. Conner reminded the Board about the Retreat on August 3 and 4 in Northern Virginia. He explained that there would be a governance piece and how the Board can be more effective in the work as it relates to the work with the new president. Dick Chait will speak on this topic. There will be a strategic planning session with the President-elect – not a deep dive but a process approach-- and a discussion on where the academic division is heading in Northern Virginia, most of which will be focused on Darden. Finally, there will be a piece on Inova, and what it means for UVA to be in Northern Virginia as a health system.

Mr. Conner commended Chief Operating Officer Pat Hogan and spoke about the personal relationship he has with many people. He then turned to President Sullivan and said she has positioned the University for its 3rd century. Her herculean efforts, dedication, and resiliency make her a highly effective president. She has experienced a lot of resistance and has dealt with all of it with dignity. He said we would always have a deep and profound sense of gratitude for all that she has done and for the legacy that she leaves behind. He asked her to go to Texas and have a great time but then come back to the UVA community as a professor.

Tammy Murphy read the following commending resolution for President Sullivan, which was approved by unanimous voice vote.

**Report by the President**

The following report is reprinted verbatim:

After eight years as president and dozens of board meetings, this is my final report to the Board of Visitors. So let me begin by saying a heartfelt thank you for the board’s hard work and support over the years.

We have experienced euphoric high points, such as last October’s launch of the Bicentennial Celebration. And we have experienced challenging low points, such as the attack on our Grounds last August by protesters espousing white supremacy, anti-Semitism, and other messages of hate.

We have come together in a spirit of joy to celebrate the high moments, and we have come together in a spirit of determination and resolve to surmount the low moments. Through both the highs and the lows, we have remained true to our values, and that is one of the main reasons that the University of Virginia remains strong.

I want to leave the board with a question: Can UVa continue to be both public and excellent in the future?

I believe the answer to that question is: “Yes.”

UVa certainly can remain both public and excellent in the years ahead, but it will require diligence on the part of this board and on the part of UVa leaders at every level.

Diligence is required because there are so many short- and long-term threats to public higher education.

Examples include the misplaced blame for problems in higher education and the resulting push for more regulation. Consider the rise in student indebtedness. This particular problem stems mainly from private for-profit schools that saddle students with high debt while giving them a mediocre education, or worse. UVa, I remind you, caps student debt, and the one-third of our students who graduate with debt have lower average debt than students across the nation and the state. And yet public higher education is often the target of criticism, with proposals for broad-brush regulations that paradoxically result in more costs.

We have a duty to the commonwealth of Virginia to take seriously UVa’s mission as a public university. But our duty to the commonwealth is best carried out when we seek excellence.

Some critics imply that being public and being excellent are mutually exclusive. You must choose to be either one or the other, they say; you cannot be both.

UVa has a history of solving that “either/or” problem with creative solutions. Back in the early 1990s, when UVa faced a series of significant cuts in state budget support, university leaders faced a question: “Considering these new financial realities, should UVa accept mediocrity?”

Strong leaders such as former President John Casteen, former Chief Operating Officer Leonard Sandridge, members of the Board of Visitors at that time, and others said: “No.” They refused to accept mediocrity as an option for UVa. Instead, they led a charge, supported by the private philanthropy of UVa’s generous alumni, that propelled UVa into the upper ranks of great American universities.

Those leaders answered the question of mediocrity with an emphatic “no” back then. But the question never goes away. With the many challenges facing public higher education, we must say “no” to mediocrity — we must make the choice to be excellent — day after day, year after year.

In recent years, we have said “no” to mediocrity and “yes” to excellence in numerous ways: with the strategies, goals, and priorities that we articulated in our strategic plan, the Cornerstone Plan; with the commitment to hiring a great faculty for UVa’s third century; with a dramatic rise in philanthropy, as we set records for total new commitments this year.

We said “no” to mediocrity in our research enterprise, and our externally sponsored research awards have grown more than 30 percent since fiscal year 2013.

We said “no” to mediocrity in our global programs, and we now have record numbers of students involved in study-abroad, J-term, internships, research, and service overseas, and we have many new international research partnerships, such as our partnership with Germany’s Max Planck Society.

We said “no” to mediocrity in our Jeffersonian buildings and Grounds, and now we have a restored Rotunda that serves as a vital center of life for our students. More than a quarter-million visitors have passed through the Rotunda since its reopening. 

This board said “no” to mediocrity when it launched the Strategic Investment Fund two years ago, and now we have the Bicentennial Professors and Bicentennial Scholars; we have enhanced programs in neuroscience and individualized medicine for diabetes; we have the Democracy Initiative, the LinkLab for cyber-physical systems, and other centers of excellence.

We said “no” to mediocrity in our health system, and now we have the No. 1 hospital in Virginia. We said “no” to mediocrity, once again, when we launched a new research and education partnership with Inova Health System in Northern Virginia. 

UVa’s College at Wise has said “no” to mediocrity time after time, and Chancellor Donna Price Henry and her team have led a resurgence on the Wise campus.

In every corner of the University of Virginia, we have said “no” to mediocrity and “yes” to excellence, and the results are on display everywhere you look at UVa.

To aspire to be both public and excellent in today’s challenging environment for public higher education seems to represent a paradox, because the demands seem to be in conflict with one another — irreconcilable, unresolvable.

The Danish physicist Niels Bohr won the Nobel Prize in 1922 for his study of the structure of atoms and his investigation of quantum theory. Bohr famously said, “How wonderful that we have met with a paradox. Now we have some hope of making progress.”

Faced with an apparent paradox, UVa has made great progress in recent years. In the days ahead, President-Elect Jim Ryan and the members of this board will carry on the daily necessity of saying “no” to mediocrity and “yes” to excellence for UVa.

As they prepare for the hard work ahead, I wish them the very best.

**Comments by the Student Representative to the Board**

Brendan Nigro began with an introduction of himself: he is a fourth year undergraduate student from Rhode Island majoring in History and Statistics. He has been involved in many things these past three years including serving as a Resident Advisor and as chair of the University Guide Service.

His goals for this year are to represent a wide array of student perspectives to the Board and do necessary outreach to ensure that takes place, and to facilitate meaningful interactions between the Board and students. He will provide the Board with written updates on student life and use his time in meetings to focus on a more granular level.

Mr. Nigro’s topic for this meeting was student summer plans. He said 35% have internship or job-related employment, 11% were still searching at the end of April, and 18% are taking classes. About half of the rising fourth years are doing internships. This information was gathered from the UVA Career Center Summer Plans Survey which had about 8,400 responses – a good response rate. He said the UVA Career Center has done a great job in recent years providing counseling and resources to students, particularly with their expansion to 1515 on the Corner.

He said there are some additional things students want from the Career Center including space in their schedule to take a course (for credit) in career preparation, particularly for first or second years, and internship opportunities for all students including low-income, which may mean financial assistance from the University or other sources.

Mr. Nigro thanked President Sullivan on behalf of students, for being a champion of many student issues including advising and affordability. He said a personal thank you for her work in creating the President's Commissions on Slavery and the University and the University in the Age of Segregation, which are both very important for an honest and impactful representation of the University's history.

**Remarks by the Faculty Senate Chair**

Peter Brunjes was unable to attend the meeting. He asked Ms. Riley to read a letter to the Board. His written report is as follows:

I apologize for not being able to attend today’s meeting but at this very moment I am lecturing to a summer session class entitled: “Survey of the Neural Basis of Behavior”, also known as “PSYC 2200”. Yes, it’s a course on how the brain works, and it is indeed offered by the Psychology department. That’s a good thing! 

Psychology is the scientific study of behavior, and we will never truly understand behavior until we know how it is generated by the brain.  Looking back, I must _really_ like the class, as I’ve taught it over 50 times and over 10,000 students have endured my lectures. All the while I’ve maintained an active research lab. I’ve spent my adult life studying the development of the brain, and I can’t think of any topic more interesting and important than figuring out how something so complex forms. During early life our brains don’t just “mature”, they are sculpted by experience as we can perceive and learn about the world. 

I truly love what I do and feel enormously lucky to be a college professor. I am so glad to be a member of such a distinguished department: we are ranked in the top 50 in the world and, according to “Google Citation”, Psychology has 6 of UVA’s 12 most highly cited faculty!

I’m looking forward to my year as Chair of the Faculty Senate. UVa has many extremely intelligent, thoughtful, creative, motivated and influential professors. The Senate provides the only University-wide forum integrating them all, and as such it is a rich resource for viewing what we are doing well and what we can do better. Of course our first job will be to maintain our obligations overseeing academic and personnel issues across the Schools.  We will also work hard to welcome and assist the broad new leadership team coming to UVA. Our last Chair, Alf Weaver, started a new tradition for the Senate by identifying important topics that need to be brought to the attention of faculty as whole in public venues.  We need to continue to sponsor this outreach on many different topics. I look forward to being with you all next time around!

**Extension of Faculty Appointment to the Board for 2018-2019**

Rector Conner explained that because the University is going through a time of transition it is important that Ms. Riley remain for an additional year. She has been critical to all of the recruitment efforts for the Provost and for the Chief Operating Officer, and it is difficult to make a difference when only serving one year.

On motion, the Board adopted the following resolution:

**EXTENSION OF FACULTY APPOINTMENT TO THE BOARD FOR 2018-2019**

RESOLVED, Margaret F. Riley’s term as the non-voting faculty representative to the Board of Visitors is extended for one year, commencing July 1, 2018 and ending June 30, 2019.

WHEREAS, Mr. Camp represented Virginia in a goodwill agri-business tour of Russia during the Cold War; and

Harris, Roscoe Roberts, Farnaz Thompson, Teresa A. Sullivan, Thomas C. Katsouleas, Patrick D. Hogan, Debra Rinker, Caroline Saint, Patricia M. Lampkin, Emily Babb, and Gina Smith, participated in parts of the closed session.

“I move that the Board of Visitors go into closed session to:

(i) consult with legal counsel and receive legal advice about specific matters, namely, (1) legal issues associated with the events of August 11, 2017 and their aftermath; (2) policies and practices regarding child protection; and (3) potential and actual litigation.

UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA INTERNAL AUDIT CHARTER

**Purpose:**

Internal Auditing is an independent, objective assurance and consulting activity designed to add value and improve an organization’s operations. It helps an organization accomplish its objectives by bringing a systematic, disciplined approach to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of risk management, control, and governance processes. The UVA Office of Audit and Compliance assists UVA’s Board of Visitors and University management in the discharge of their oversight, management, and operating responsibilities by providing independent assurance and consulting services to the University community. Our services add value by improving the control, risk management and governance processes to help the University achieve its business objectives.

**Internal Auditing Policy:**

It is the policy of the of the University to establish and support the Office of Audit and Compliance to assist the University in accomplishing its objectives by bringing a systematic and disciplined approach to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of the University’s governance , risk management, and internal controls. The internal audit activity’s responsibilities are defined by the Audit, Compliance, and Risk Committee (ACR Committee) of the Board of Visitors (Board) as part of its oversight role.

**Authority:**

The internal auditor, with strict accountability for confidentiality and safeguarding records and information, is authorized to have full, free, and unrestricted access to any and all of the University’s records, physical properties, and personnel pertinent to carrying out an engagement.

All employees are requested to assist the Audit Department in fulfilling its roles and responsibilities. The internal audit activity will also have free and unrestricted access to the ACR Committee and its chairman.

**Organization:**

The Chief Audit Executive will report functionally to the ACR Committee chairman, and administratively to the President of the University.

The ACR Committee will:

*   Approve the Audit Department charter.
*   Approve the risk based audit plan.
*   Approve the internal audit budget and resource plan.
*   Receive communications from the Chief Audit Executive on the Audit Department’s performance relative to its plan and other matters.
*   Approve decisions regarding the performance evaluation, appointment, or removal of the Chief Audit Executive
*   Approve the remuneration of the Chief Audit Executive
*   Make appropriate inquiries of management and the Chief Audit Executive to determine whether there is inappropriate scope or resource limitations.

The Chief Audit Executive will communicate and interact directly with the ACR Committee, including in executive sessions and between ACR Committee meetings as appropriate.

**Professional Standards**

UVA’s Office of Audit and Compliance will govern itself by adherence to The Institute of Internal Auditors’ Mandatory Guidance, which includes the Core Principles for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing, the Code of Ethics, the International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing, and the Definition of Internal Auditing.

The Office of Audit and Compliance will adhere to the University’s relevant policies and procedures as well as the _Generally Accepted Governmental Auditing Standards_ of the Government Accountability Office.

**Core Principles for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing:**

The Office of Audit and Compliance will continuously strive to be effective by operating in a manner consistent with the IIA’s Core Principles:

*   Demonstrates integrity.
*   Demonstrates competence and due professional care.
*   Is objective and free from undue influence (independent).
*   Aligns with the strategies, objectives, and risks of the organization.
*   Is appropriately positioned and adequately resourced.
*   Demonstrates quality and continuous improvement.
*   Communicates effectively.
*   Provides risk-based assurance.

*   Promotes organizational improvement.

**Independence and Objectivity:**

The internal audit activity will remain free from interference by any element in the University, including matters of audit selection, scope, procedures, frequency, timing, or report content to permit maintenance of a necessary independent and objective function. The Chief Audit Executive must disclose such interference to the ACR Committee and discuss the implications.

Internal auditors will have no direct operational responsibility or authority over any of the activities audited. Accordingly, they will not implement internal controls, develop procedures, install systems, prepare records, or engage in any other activity that may impair internal auditors’ independence or judgment. Internal auditors may provide assurance services for areas previously consulted, provided the consulting services did not impair objectivity.

Internal auditors will exhibit the highest level of professional objectivity in gathering, evaluating, and communicating information about the activity or process being examined. Internal auditors will make a balanced assessment of all the relevant circumstances and not be unduly influenced by their own interests or by others in forming judgments.

The Chief Audit Executive will annually evaluate reporting lines and responsibilities and confirm to the ACR Committee the organizational independence of the Office of Audit and Compliance.

**Responsibility:**

The scope of internal auditing encompasses, but is not limited to, the examination and evaluation of the adequacy and effectiveness of the University’s governance, risk management, and internal controls as well as the quality of performance in carrying out assigned responsibilities to achieve the University’s stated goals and objectives. This includes:

*   Evaluating the design, implementation, and effectiveness of the organization’s ethics-related objectives, programs, and activities.
*   Evaluating risk exposure relating to achievement of the University’s strategic objectives.
*   Assessing whether the information technology governance of the organization supports the organization’s strategies and objectives.
*   Evaluating the reliability and integrity of information and the means used to identify, measure, classify, and report such information.

o In order to enable this responsibility, the Office of Audit and Compliance will participate in the planning, development, implementation, and modification of major computer- based and manual systems to ensure that:

*   1.  adequate controls are incorporated into the system;
    2.  thorough system testing is performed at appropriate stages;
    3.  system documentation is complete and accurate; and
    4.  the resultant system is a complete and accurate implementation of the system specifications.
*   Evaluating the systems established to ensure compliance with those policies, plans, procedures, laws, and regulations which could have a significant impact on the University.
*   Evaluating the means of safeguarding assets and, as appropriate, verifying the existence of such assets.
*   Evaluating the effectiveness and efficiency of resource utilization.
*   Evaluating operations or programs to ascertain whether results are consistent with established objectives and goals and whether the operations or programs are being carried out as planned.
*   Assessing and making appropriate recommendations for improving the governance process in its accomplishment of the following objectives:
*   Promoting appropriate ethics and values within the organization
*   Ensuring effective organizational performance management and accountability
*   Communicating risk and control information to appropriate areas of the organization
*   Coordinating the activities of and communicating information among the board, external and internal auditors, and management.
*   Monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of the organization’s risk management processes.
*   Performing consulting services related to governance, risk management, and control.
*   Reporting significant risk exposures and control issues, including fraud risks, governance issues, and other matters needed or requested by the ACR Committee or management.
*   Evaluating specific operations at the request of the ACR Committee or management, as appropriate.
*   Reporting periodically on the purpose, authority, and responsibility of the Office of Audit and Compliance and performance relative to its plan.

**Internal Audit Plan**:

At least annually, the Chief Audit Executive will submit to senior management and the ACR an internal audit plan for review and approval. The internal audit plan will consist of a work schedule as well as budget and resource requirements for the next year. The Chief Audit Executive will communicate the impact of resource limitations and significant interim changes to senior management and the Board.

The internal audit plan will be developed based on a prioritization of the audit universe using a risk-based methodology, including input of senior management, the ACR, and Board.

The Chief Audit Executive will review and adjust the plan, as necessary, in response to changes in the organization’s business, risks, operations, programs, systems, and controls. Any significant deviation from the approved internal audit plan will be communicated to senior management and the ACR through periodic activity reports.

**Audit Department Services:**

The Chief Audit Executive is empowered to conduct assurance services, special audit projects, reviews, or investigations at the request of the Board, ACR Committee, President, General Counsel, EVP Provost, EVP Chief Operating Officer, EVP Health Affairs, or their designee, to assist management in meeting its objectives, promoting economy and efficiency in the administration of, or preventing and detecting fraud and abuse in its programs and operations. The Office of Audit and Compliance may also provide consulting services, beyond assurance services, to assist management in meeting its objectives. Examples may include facilitation, process design, training, and advisory services.

**Coordination with External Auditing Agencies:**

The Chief Audit Executive, with the goal of avoiding duplication of work, will coordinate the office’s audit efforts with those of the Commonwealth of Virginia’s Auditor of Public Accounts, or other external auditing agencies as applicable, by participating in the planning and definition of the scope of proposed audits so the work of all auditing groups is complementary and their combined efforts provide comprehensive, cost-effective audit coverage for the University.

**Reporting and Monitoring:**

A written report will be prepared and issued by the Chief Audit Executive or designee following the conclusion of each internal audit engagement and will be distributed as appropriate. Internal audit results will be available for review by the ACR and Board of Visitors.

The internal audit report will include management’s response and corrective action taken or to be taken in regard to the specific findings and recommendations. Management's response to audit findings and recommendations should include a timetable for anticipated completion of action to be taken and an explanation for any corrective action that will not be implemented.

The Office of Audit and Compliance will be responsible for appropriate follow-up on its engagement findings and recommendations. All significant findings will remain in an open issues file until cleared. The ACR will receive periodic reporting from the Chief Audit Executive on the status of management’s action plan implementation.

The Chief Audit Executive will periodically report to senior management and the ACR on the internal audit activity’s purpose, authority, and responsibility, as well as performance relative to its plan. Reporting will also include significant risk exposures and control issues, including fraud risks, governance issues, and other matters needed or requested by senior management, ACR, or the Board.

**Quality Assurance and Improvement Program:**

The Chief Audit Executive must develop and maintain a quality assurance and improvement program that covers all aspects of the internal audit activity. The program must include both internal and external assessments to evaluate the internal audit activity’s conformance with the Standards and an evaluation of whether internal auditors abide by the Code of Ethics.

External assessments must be conducted at least once every five years by a qualified independent assessor or assessment team from outside the organization.

The Chief Audit Executive must discuss with the ACR Committee:

*   The form and frequency of external assessment;
*   The qualifications and independence of the external assessor or assessment team, including any potential conflict of interest.

The program will also assess the efficiency and effectiveness of the internal audit activity and identify opportunities for improvement.

The Chief Audit Executive must communicate results of the quality assurance and improvement program to senior management and the ACR Committee.

Purpose:
--------

The University of Virginia's compliance function supports the University’s fundamental commitment to the highest standards of ethics, integrity, and lawful conduct by promoting adherence to all applicable federal, state, and local laws, regulations, as well as standards and internal policies and protocols.

Institutional compliance promotes greater coordination of and consistency among individual University compliance programs, covering a wide variety of requirements related to academics, athletics, human resources, research, health care, information technology, and numerous administrative functions. The University established a compliance program to prevent, detect, and respond appropriately to potential violations of law and to foster a corporate culture that promotes integrity and ethical behaviors in all matters relating to compliance.

Authority:
----------

The Assistant Vice President for Compliance, with strict accountability for confidentiality and safeguarding of records and information, is authorized to have full, free, and unrestricted access to any and all of the University’s records, physical properties, and personnel pertinent to carrying out compliance investigations and to review and monitor compliance issues. All employees are requested to assist the compliance function in fulfilling its roles and responsibilities.

Organization:
-------------

The Assistant Vice President for Compliance oversees institutional compliance activities and programs to confirm they are reasonably designed, implemented, communicated, and enforced. To facilitate effective oversight, the Assistant Vice President for Compliance coordinates and chairs the Compliance Network, a University-wide network of functional compliance officers.

The Assistant Vice President for Compliance reports to the Chief Audit Executive . The Chief Audit Executive reports functionally to the ACR Committee chairman, and administratively to the President of the University.

The Audit, Compliance, and Risk (ACR) Committee will:

*   Approve the Compliance Charter and periodically reassess it for continued relevance.
*   Receive communications from the Assistant Vice President for Compliance regarding compliance strategies, plans, and other relevant matters.
*   Make appropriate inquiries of management and the Assistant Vice President for Compliance to determine whether all compliance efforts have the necessary resources and scope.
*   Support leadership for the compliance program by promoting and supporting a University-wide culture of ethical and lawful conduct.

The Assistant Vice President for Compliance will communicate and interact directly with the Chair of the ACR Committee, including in executive sessions and between committee meetings as appropriate to ensure direct access to the board.

Professional Standards
----------------------

The compliance function’s objective is to establish and promote standards that meet the U.S. Federal Sentencing Guidelines' criteria for an effective compliance program.

1.  Compliance standards and procedures to prevent and detect criminal activity;
2.  Oversight by high-level personnel, with periodic reporting to the board from individuals with operational responsibility;
3.  Due care in delegating substantial discretionary authority;
4.  Effective communication and training to all levels of employees;
5.  Systems for monitoring, auditing and reporting suspected wrong-doing without fear of reprisal and for periodically evaluating the effectiveness of the compliance and ethics programs;
6.  Consistent enforcement of compliance standards including disciplinary mechanisms and appropriate incentives to perform in accordance with the compliance and ethics program; and
7.  Reasonable steps to respond to and prevent further similar offenses upon detection of a violation.

In addition, the Medical Center’s compliance program also follows the program elements defined in the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of the Inspector General’s “Compliance Program Guidance for Hospitals”.

Responsibilities:
-----------------

Members of the University community having responsibility for a specific area of compliance must ensure the following:

*   Oversight of compliance in their specific functional areas;
*   Adherence to the University’s compliance policies;
*   Implementation of corrective action as necessary, arising from compliance reviews and/or investigations.

The role of the Assistant Vice President for Compliance is to remain well-informed on the content and operation of the University’s compliance and ethics program in order to exercise reasonable oversight of the effectiveness of the program, including:

1.  _Standards of Conduct/Policies and Procedures:_ confirming that the University implements policies, procedures, training programs, and internal control systems that are reasonably capable of reducing misconduct and that comply with relevant regulatory requirements.
2.  _Compliance Roles and Responsibilities_: establishing clear roles and responsibilities across the University.
3.  _Compliance Oversight:_ exercising reasonable oversight over compliance activities by requesting and receiving updates from compliance officers.
4.  _Reporting and Investigative Mechanisms_: confirming that the University maintains an effective mechanism for stakeholders to report or seek guidance regarding potential or actual wrongdoing.
5.  _Correction and Prevention_: working with the University’s senior leadership to promote and enforce compliance through appropriate incentives and disciplinary measures.
6.  _Culture of Integrity and Compliance_: promoting the University’s culture of integrity and compliance, through communication of compliance standards and policies.

Interaction with Audit and Enterprise Risk Management:

The Assistant Vice President for Compliance will work closely with colleagues in the Office of Audit and Compliance to assess and prioritize which compliance areas present the greatest risk and need for attention, based on regulatory environment and complexity, overlap with University strategic plans, and consequences of non-compliance. Managers with responsibility for specific areas of compliance will evaluate their individual compliance efforts against a list of criteria necessary to have an effective compliance program.

The Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program is designed to identify and mitigate key institutional risks. For example, one type of risk to be considered is legal and regulatory compliance risk. The regular review of compliance requirements may highlight an emerging institutional risk. Conversely, the identification of key institutional risks may guide the work of the compliance function and initiate a mitigation strategy that the University may use to address a given risk.
