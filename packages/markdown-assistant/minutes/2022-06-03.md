**Leadership Discussion**

Following some introductory comments, President Ryan said the discussion would focus on one piece of good news about which the Board may not be aware, one challenge that the University is facing, and one topic on which he would like feedback. He said the challenging topic was the rising construction costs, and this was reviewed in the Buildings and Grounds Committee on Thursday. He said construction costs will continue to be a challenge.

**Something Great: Public Service Pathways**

Mr. Ryan said the Public Service Pathways initiative is part of the 2030 Strategic Plan. There are many public service offerings for students and have been for many years; this initiative is focused on curating and coordinating available offerings with the goal of making them more visible and accessible to students. Louis Nelson, Professor of Architectural History and Vice Provost for Academic Outreach, presented.

Mr. Nelson explained the essentials of the program, which is to be open, optional for all undergraduate students, and broadly defined, and which would curate the available curricular and co-curricular experiences. The mission is to foster a “public service mindset”, directing students’ time and talents toward community and personal well-being. The program will have five public service domains: public health, global sustainability, justice, public interest technology, and education. This work will be coordinated with students’ major curricula. Six competencies include activities that will build students’ “muscles” in the competency. There are many different ways to do this, including internships and classes. Mr. Nelson is working with Student Affairs and others, including the Karsh Institute, Athletics, Madison House, and the Alumni Association. An advisory board will assist with determining what will work and what will not work, and content experts will be consulted.

Mr. Nelson showed two videos on the Public Serve pathways initiative and answered questions from the Board.

**Something for BOV Input: Check-in on BOV Communications/Advice for Getting New BOV Members Up to Speed**

Mr. Ryan introduced his third topic and asked Board members to think about what they know now that they wished they had known when they started on the Board. Ms. Harris gave a brief overview of the components of orienting new members, and members made the following comments:

*   The Board is expected to engage in governance and not management—should be made clear to members
*   Assigning mentors to new members would help the new members understand the work of the Board
*   All members should get the Health System Board orientation
*   Important that all members read the Board Manual
*   Orientation on finance including the budget and sources and uses is important
*   Dashboards are helpful—need very high-level information because otherwise it is overwhelming
*   A session on crisis management would be helpful to members
*   More contact with students and faculty would provide a better understanding of the University
*   Consider making a video of outgoing members

**Remarks/Reports**

**Remarks by the Rector**

Mr. Clement thanked University leadership and the excellent faculty and staff for successfully steering the University through the pandemic; for the exceptional work by the finance team to navigate financially uncertain waters and to implement the finance strategic transformation; for hires of several deans and vice presidents, including the new deans of the schools of nursing, medicine, and education, and the vice president and chief human resources officer; for comprehensive cancer center designation, and other achievements of UVA Health including the full acquisition of three community hospitals; the affordable housing initiative; safety enhancements in and around Grounds; and for fundraising that will allow the university to realize our aspirations reflected in the 2030 Strategic Plan. Donors are providing need-based and merit scholarships for students at UVA and UVA Wise as well as professorships, research funds in important areas such as Alzheimer’s, diabetes, infectious disease, and cancer, and the resources to construct new buildings and renovate existing ones to house first-rate programs in democracy, data science, athletics, contemplative sciences, chemistry, orthopedics, the arts, and so much more. He also mentioned the great preliminary work on enhancing student advising and research and said he looks forward to seeing these efforts come to fruition.

He congratulated student athletes for another good year, particularly men’s tennis who won their fifth NCAA championship just a week previously, and women’s swimming and diving, who also were national champions for the second time in a row. Olympic medalist Kate Douglass and her fellow medalists Alex Walsh and Emma Weyant, are on the US World Championship team that will compete in Budapest later in the month, coached by UVA’s Todd Desorbo.

He reminded Visitors that the Retreat is scheduled for August 21 – 22.

**Remarks by the Student Representative**

Ms. Roberts said she was honored to be elected to the position of student representative, the first from the School of Architecture.

She recognized the work of the outgoing members and expressed sadness at not having the opportunity to work with them in the coming year, and she thanked her predecessor, Sarita Mehta, who is a “tough act to follow.”

She recognized the success of student athletes who gained national titles.

She acknowledged the Monacan people who are the traditional stewards of the land on which the University sits and thanked them for fostering sustainable practices and preservation of the natural environment, which she said the University hoped to build upon in the University’s third century. And she paid respect to the many named and unnamed African American people who were enslaved by and labored for the University from its construction until after the Civil War and are memorialized at the Memorial to Enslaved Laborers.

Ms. Roberts spoke about her goal of fostering student interest in the work of the Board of Visitors. She spoke about Thomas Jefferson’s aim to graduate civically engaged life-long learners that brings with it a responsibility of the Board of Visitors to be active in encouraging the student body to understand the governance of their academic home, virtually and in person. She recognized Rotunda ambassador and student Terrell Pittman, who was sitting behind her in the meeting.

Ms. Roberts said two themes are emerging in her conversations with students. The first is a seemingly widespread weakening of the sense of belonging among the student body. Both the events of August 11th and 12th, 2017, and the pandemic have created challenges in the sense of connection to UVA, as well a the “hyper-partisan” political climate nationally. She gave a couple of examples, including former vice president Pence’s visit to the University sponsored by the UVA Chapter of the Young Americans for Freedom. Politically conservative students express their inclination to self-censor most acutely in classroom discussions and social settings, which breeds the sense of not belonging.

She said the topic of "diversity of thought" at its core is not about diversity or representation at all, but about belonging, inclusion. When students say that they believe that their political perspectives are not valued, they are saying their voices do not matter and that if not heard, they cannot belong. The concerns are expressed by graduate students as well as undergraduates, who feel the pressures of juggling life and often not having the financial resources to participate in many activities.

She said the students who signed up for the poorly rolled out Connect2Grounds program pilot, which was aimed at creating a home on Grounds for 2nd year and transfer students, felt a decreased sense of belonging as incoming transfers and continuing second-year undergraduates. The lack of financial resources is an issue for many students, including cultural organizations who do not have the resources to engage in activities to increase a sense of belonging among students with similar backgrounds. And the students in the College at Wise deferred enrollment program indicate they are not sufficiently supported as they transition to UVA. She said she found more of a sense of belonging in the School of Architecture than she did when she was in the College of Arts & Sciences.

Ms. Roberts said she had seen the work that small groups of students, faculty, and administrators were doing toward improving a sense of belonging and holding space for conversations such as those on difference championed by President Ryan and Provost Baucom. She also spoke about watching the students in the Meriwether Lewis Institute for Citizen Leadership tackle the issue of belonging as it relates to the continued orientation experience for first and second years.

**Remarks by the Faculty Senate Chair**

Dr. Kirk used her time to recap the major actions of the Faculty Senate this year, and to share some areas she thought are opportunities for improvement.

She said that although the past year was not fully “normal,” it was much more normal than the last two years. She spoke about the activities of the various Faculty Senate committees after explaining the mission of the Senate, which is 1) to enhance the communication between the president and the faculty; and 2) to serve in an advisory capacity to the administration. Several committees were back in full force this year after a lull, including the Academic Affairs Committee and the Grievance Committee. She said some years are busier than others for the Grievance Committee, and this was one of the less busy years for reviewing faculty grievances.

The Senate tackled two big issues this year: 1) perceived threats to academic freedom around the country, which resulted in the Resolution on the Support of Academic Freedom, posted on the Senate’s webpage. This resolution built on the foundation laid by the Committee on Free Expression and Free Inquiry, but explicitly stated the Senate’s support to professors who teach students content which has recently become quite politically charged; and 2) the appointment of the current provost, which led the Senate to ask President Ryan to examine the faculty’s role in such appointments. Senators are appreciative of President’s Ryan decision to solicit a recommendation from the Faculty Senate chair for a faculty member to serve on the search committees of high-level appointments such as the provost and deans going forward.

Dr. Kirk’s final point was that there could be more demonstration of the value the faculty bring to the University. She used as an example the creation of the Statement on Free Expression and Free Inquiry last year. The faculty’s expertise on the First Amendment, and their ability to craft such an eloquent statement, remains a highlight of her term. That same depth and breadth of expertise exists in every school and in issues that are critical to the University and the country: criminal justice, religion, social media, and the education and mentoring of those who will go on to teach others. The faculty want to help sort out the toughest problems.

Dr. Kirk introduced her successor, Professor Patricia “Tish” Jennings, who officially assumed the chair’s position on June 1. Her research involves the stress on teachers in the classroom and how it impacts the classroom.
