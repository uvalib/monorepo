**Report by the Student BOV Member**

Hillary Hurd said that she wanted to get members of the Board together with students in an informal setting, to discuss issues important to students. She said she was working on a series of “Jeffersonian” dinners in Pavilions, with a couple of Board members and a small group of students attending each dinner. She said these would be held in early February.

**Report by the President**

The comments by the President are reproduced verbatim:

**Madame Rector, Members of the Board of Visitors:**

**The life of a university, in some respects, is like the life of a human being. In the long march of years, in the hundreds of decisions we make and actions we take from day to day, it’s not always immediately clear to us which decisions and actions will end up having a significant effect on the course of our lives. Often it’s only in retrospect that the important events in our lives begin to appear truly important. Often it’s only when we look back over time that we’re able to say, “That was a big step. That changed my life.”**

**But then, occasionally, we experience events that are so obviously important that, even as they are occurring, we immediately recognize them for what they are: turning points. The college you decide to attend; the career you decide to pursue; the person you decide to marry — we know these are life-altering decisions, even as we are making them.**

**Over the years of a university’s existence, in the daily ebb and flow of activity, it’s not always easy to tell which decisions or events will have significant long-term effects. But occasionally, universities experience the same type of unmistakably transformational moments that we sometimes experience in our personal lives.**

**The University of Virginia is entering such a moment now. UVa is beginning one of the most profound transformations in its history — an institutional transformation, but also a human transformation. Our faculty has reached a generational turning point, because many of our top faculty members who came to UVa 30 or 40 years ago and enjoyed illustrious careers here will be retiring soon. Over the next 5 - 7 years, we will be recruiting and hiring large numbers of faculty to replace retiring faculty and to keep pace with our plans for modest enrollment growth. We need to attract the very best faculty from across the country and around the world; we need to retain the excellent faculty we already have; we need to offer them competitive compensation; and we need to assure that they have outstanding facilities for teaching and research.**

**This is not the first transformational moment for UVa. The University has experienced other major inflection points in its history: when Thomas Jefferson and his colleagues gathered at Rockfish Gap to draft a plan to transform this University from conception to reality, for example, and when de-segregation and co-education transformed an all-male, all-white school into the diverse global university of today. And now the massive re-making of our faculty is another inflection point, and also an opportunity to ensure future greatness.**

**Paying competitive salaries to all University employees is our goal. But our faculty are farthest behind in their compensation rates. Today I am asking the Board to adopt a goal to address this issue. In the Finance Committee meeting, Colette Sheehy will present more detail concerning a multi-year plan for competitive compensation for UVa faculty. Using our AAU peers as the metric, the overall goal of the plan is to raise our average faculty salaries into the top 20 of the AAU universities by 2016-17. UVa is currently ranked #26 overall in the AAU and #6 among public AAU institutions.**

**Some of our schools currently pay average salaries that are above some of our AAU peers, while some of our schools’ salaries are lower than the peers. So each school will need to develop a compensation plan that meets its specific needs. The compensation plans will be discussed annually in budget meetings with the Provost and the Chief Operating Officer. This will be a very high priority, because our missions of teaching, research, and clinical care depend so critically on the faculty.**

**We believe it will take $65 million, added to the faculty payroll, to meet our goal. This does not mean adding $65 million to the budget, because some of this can be done through reallocation. This is recurring money, because payroll must be met every year. In addition, we will need approximately $110 million in one-time funding for start-up packages. The schools, primarily the College and Engineering, have budgeted funds to cover about 60% of these costs so we can continue hiring, but we need to find new sources of start-up funding to be able to sustain faculty recruitment in these key areas over the next 5 -7 years. These costs do not include estimates of start-up needs in the School of Medicine, but those costs will be significant too.**

**Many partners will need to come to the table to make this happen. Supplementing faculty salaries through endowments and raises must now become the highest priority for the Board of Visitors, for the foundations, and for donors. Several of the foundations are already excited about this prospect, but they have asked me if this priority has Board support.**

**As a result of this investment, we expect certain outcomes. We will retain our best faculty, energize our current faculty by recognizing their hard work, and provide the means to hire new faculty at competitive rates as retirements occur. This investment will also enhance our ability to strengthen STEM fields by providing competitive start-up money. At the same time, the Provost will be leading a review of our hiring and evaluation practices, so that we can adopt best practices in hiring and nurturing new faculty in every part of the University.**

**The people we hire and the choices we make in the next few years will be the defining factors for this University in the decades ahead. At the same time that we are beginning this protracted hiring process, we are launching a strategic planning effort that will create a blueprint for the University’s next decade and beyond. Strategic planning will help us set priorities, and that’s important because we cannot do everything we would like to do; we will have to make choices.**

**In the meeting of the Special Committee on Strategic Planning immediately after this Preliminary Session, you will hear from Milton Adams about the progress to date in our planning effort. The working groups that are involved in this effort will focus on a series of topics and questions that are fundamental to the University’s future.**

**For example: What is the value of residential education, and how can we demonstrate the value of UVa’s distinctive brand of undergraduate education?**

**What should our students be learning now, and how can we measure how well they are learning?**

**What technologies should we be using in our teaching, and how can they improve our face-to-face instruction? What technology resources do we need at UVa to support innovation in teaching and research?**

**What does it mean to be a public university in the 21st century? What should our commitments be, now and in the future, as a university that is both great and public?**

**How can we identify and align the shared interests of our individual schools and faculty members so they can effectively work together to distinguish the University?**

**How can we streamline the University’s operations, and how can we generate greater resources through private support?**

**These questions are critical. Finding the right answers will be transformational. We will work closely with Board’s Special Committee on Strategic Planning as we seek out those answers.**

**In the Board’s committee meetings, you hear and discuss a great amount of extremely detailed information and data. This level of detail is necessary to properly inform your decision-making. But the granular focus might sometimes make it difficult to see the broader significance of the matters under discussion.**

**This time, however, there is no mistaking the significance of the moment, as the University begins a transformational period, near the beginning of its third century. I am grateful for your strong commitment to stewardship as the work begins.**

**Recent Recognitions**

**Before I deliver the Gifts and Grants report, I would like to draw your attention to a few achievements within our University community. All of these achievements were announced quite recently, so you may not have heard about them yet.**

**This week Design Intelligence released its 2013 rankings for “America’s Best Architecture and Design Schools,” and both of the graduate programs in our School of Architecture made significant moves in the rankings. The graduate program in Architecture moved from #11 to #7, and the graduate program in Landscape Architecture moved from #7 to #5. We congratulate Dean Tanzer and her colleagues.**

**Also this week, we learned that our Men’s Golf Team and Women’s Golf Team are receiving 2012 NCAA Public Recognition Awards. This honor is bestowed on teams with an NCAA Division I Academic Progress Rate in the top 10% of all squads in their respective sports. We congratulate the golf coaches and players on this achievement.**

**Two members of the Board of Visitors have recently received significant honors. Last month, John Nau was inducted into the Texas Business Hall of Fame, and John’s company, Silver Eagle Distributors, was named 2012 Wholesaler of the Year by the trade magazine Beverage Industry. Bobbie Kilberg is president and CEO of the Northern Virginia Technology Center, and NVTC was just selected by VCU’s L. Douglas Wilder School of Government and Public Affairs to receive its 2012 Excellence in Virginia Government Public Information Award. This award honors the achievements of Virginians from the public and private sectors who make a significant positive impact on Virginia’s citizens and communities. Congratulations to John and Bobbie.**

**And in University news, we have received a $3 million grant from the National Science Foundation’s ADVANCE Institutional Transformation program. The purpose of the program, created about 10 years ago, is to increase the representation and advancement of women in the “STEM” fields. This grant will help us create environments that encourage the best and brightest women to enter and remain in these critically important fields. Congratulations to Vice Provost for Faculty Recruitment and Retention Gertrude Fraser and her colleagues who prepared the grant.**

**Medical Center Operating Board Report – Friday, November 9, 2012**

**At 10:00 a.m. the full Board reconvened. Dr. Miller reported on the Medical Center Operating Board meeting held in the morning the previous day, November 8, 2012. He said the Medical Center Operating Board held the UVA Transitional Care Hospital (TCH) meeting first. They heard a summary of the fiscal year 2012 accomplishments for the TCH, including full long term acute care designation by the federal government and full accreditation by the Joint Commission. The TCH had a positive bottom line for the first quarter of fiscal year 2013. A quality report was given in Executive Session, and the TCH board approved the TCH credentialing and privileging actions.**

**Dr. Miller said the Medical Center Operating Board public session meeting included reports from the Medical Center Chief Nursing Officer on the state of nursing, including the Magnet designation effort; a report from the Dean of the School of Nursing on creating the 21st century nurse; an annual report on Continuum Home Health, which provides both home health services and home infusion in an 11 county area; and an update on the first quarter financial performance of the Medical Center, which had an operating margin of 6.1 percent and is better that the budget projection.**

**He said that Chief Executive Officer R. Edward Howell reported on a number of awards the Medical Center has recently received, including being named by Becker's Hospital Review as one of the 100 Hospitals with great women's health programs, and a "Hospital of Choice" award for customer service from the American Alliance of Healthcare Providers. In addition, the Medical Center has adopted the UVA Women's Basketball program by the creation of the "Health System Hoos", with the goal of enhancing a sense of unity with the University as well as boosting staff morale.**

**Dr. Miller said that Dean DeKosky provided the School of Medicine report, which included information on the preparation for accreditation of medical education that will occur in the fall of 2014, and the establishment of the Virginia Center for Translational and Regulatory Sciences, a multi­disciplinary effort to focus on research and teaching in the regulatory process and the pipeline from research to submission to the FDA. Dr. Miller mentioned the four Clinical Department Chairs who attended the meeting: Dr. Mark Shaffrey of Neurosurgery; Dr. Karen Johnston of Neurology; Dr. Jeff Ferguson, Obstetrics and Gynecology; and Dr. Paul Levine, Chair of Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery and the President of the faculty practice plan.**

**In addition to the Medical Center credentialing actions, the Medical Center Operating Board approved the acquisition of land and improvements currently under construction on Spring Creek Parkway in Louisa County (Zion Crossroads) at a price not to exceed $18 million for the purpose of primary care and specialty clinics and an imaging center. This project supports the Health System strategic plan, and was also approved by the Finance Committee. Occupancy is expected during the first half of 2013.**

**In Executive Session, the Medical Center Operating Board received an update on the strategic plan, with a focus on the Neurosciences Center of Excellence, a report from the Quality Subcommittee, and assumptions related to the long range financial plan.**

**Buildings and Grounds Committee Report – Friday, November 9, 2012**

**At 10:30 a.m., Mr. Diamonstein reported on the Buildings and Grounds Committee meeting held on November 7, 2012 in the Forum Room of the Miller Center. He said that prior to the meeting he took a tour of grounds to see projects currently in construction.**

**Mr. Diamonstein said that the consent agenda was approved by the committee. There were two architect/engineer selection items: John G. Waite Associates will be engaged to perform the design work for the renovation of the Rotunda; and Affiliated Engineers, Inc. will perform the design work for the Newcomb Road Chiller Plant.**

**The second item on the agenda was the approval of namings. The Committee approved and recommended for consideration by the Board of Visitors names for two sports facilities: the McArthur Squash Center at the Boar's Head Sports Club, named in memory of Jaffray Woodriff’s maternal grandfather, Douglas Glover McArthur; and the Stubblefield Perimeter Loop, which recognizes long time donor and loyal supporter of the University's track and field program, Fred H. Stubblefield, Jr. The Perimeter Loop is part of the new track and field facility and provides a separate training/running path around the outside of the competition track that will be available to student athletes and to the Charlottesville running community.**

**Mr. Diamonstein said Don Sundgren, the Chief Facilities Officer, continued the committee’s look at the University's infrastructure with a review of energy and utilities infrastructure. He shared the four main goals of 1) cost effectiveness, 2) reliability, 3) sustainability, and 4) financial and operational risk mitigation. Don's report set the context for the two concept, site, and design guideline actions taken by the committee.**

**The committee approved concept, site, and design guidelines for the Newcomb Road Chiller Plant which will consolidate chillers from Alderman Library, Clemons Library, and Newcomb Hall into a separate structure that will in turn free up valuable programming space in those buildings.**

**The second concept, site, and design guidelines approved was for the North Grounds Mechanical Plant, located behind the Law School, which includes two boilers, two chillers, and associated auxiliary equipment. The equipment has reached the end of its useful life and needs to be replaced and the new plant will also provide capacity for growth in the precinct.**

**Mr. Diamonstein said that Ms. Sheehy gave a report on the chimney repair project in the Lawn and Range rooms, which was completed on schedule and within budget. Students will be trained in lighting fires and fireplaces will be working on the Lawn once more.**

**Mr. Diamonstein said David Neuman, Architect for the University, reported on the status of three programming alternatives at the Rotunda: the first is a plan to open the south doors to the Lawn, which could occur by the end of the calendar year; second, the administration is working with several academic units to develop a Dome Room Lecture Series; and third, he said there is a need to improve and update the visitor's interpretive area in the lower east oval room.**

**Finally, Mr. Neuman briefly reviewed with the committee the latest program of grounds improvement projects, which include the improvements at the Emmet/Ivy intersection, new sidewalks and crosswalks, and a barrier-free entrance to the Board of Visitors Office.**

**Statement of the Rector and Board Directive**

**Following voting on the action items, the Rector said the Board was issuing the following directive to the administration:**

**The University has recently launched a strategic planning process that includes addressing the University’s critical needs and optimizing the important opportunities available to the University.  The Board recognizes that the administration and the President have already begun a careful process of developing the FY 2013/2014 budget that will begin the focus and financial planning for certain of the key tenets to be encompassed by the strategic plan including the critical need to restore faculty salaries to a level competitive with the top AAU institutions.  Accordingly, the Board hereby directs President Sullivan and her administration to develop such a comprehensive, financial, operating, and capital plan that details the estimated incremental costs of top strategic priorities including salaries, recruiting, retention, development, financial aid, etc. and the proposed sources of funds to meet those costs for the four-year period ending June 30, 2017.  This initial plan should be presented to the Board for discussion at the February 2013 meeting.**   

**After reading the directive, the Rector moved on to a different subject. She observed that the words in the room and throughout the days of meetings had been chock full of words everyone had been hearing for many months now. These words are _honor, trust, accountability, communication, engagement, commitment, governance._ She said everyone was very familiar with them. She said that the context, the tone, and the use of those words had changed -- relatively dramatically. She noted George Cohen’s big, beaming smile and the hug she received from Gweneth West. She observed that it was heartwarming and quite remarkable how far all have come in just a few short months. She said she hoped that this new energy, this new commitment, this new collaboration would continue to grow.**

**The Rector said she attributed this progress to the love all share for the University. She said the tension apparent in the summer had melted away and shared love was being put into real action.**

**The Rector said she had observed over the last three days that the meetings had been full of discussion and decision on very substantive matters. The President and her administration are rigorously addressing many of the vexing questions that face the University and all of higher education. They are diligently and smartly working to position the University for a future that protects and enhances the University’s high level of quality in teaching, research, and patient care. As President Sullivan so perfectly articulated the day before, the University is beginning one of the most profound transformations in its history — an institutional transformation and a human transformation. She said the administrative team is proactively leading this transformation – they, working with the Board of Visitors, are actively creating the next era of excellence at the University of Virginia.**

**The Rector observed that in the past three days the Board has heard more details about the President’s launch of an inclusive and participatory strategic planning process for the academic division to develop goals, strategies, and resource plans intended to guide the University’s future and to sustain and elevate the exceptional quality of its teaching and research activities. This planning process is intended to be complete by the beginning of the 2013-2014 academic year, and is now gaining important momentum.**

**She said the Board heard about the complex implementation of a targeted strategic plan for the University of Virginia Medical Center which includes important goals for advancement of clinical programs, clinical research and innovation, patient satisfaction, and the quality of care.**

**The Rector continued to recite initiatives put forth by the administration: President Sullivan’s development of an ambitious plan to enhance competitive compensation of all employees and address the challenges of recruiting and retaining the next generation of eminent scholars, and the President’s plans to reorganize communications and development functions in order to align external relations and communications resources to effectively articulate the University’s brand and to promote the growth of philanthropy and legislative support to their highest potential.**

**The Rector said the Board heard of President Sullivan’s intentions to finish the Campaign for the 21st Century by the spring of 2013 and of her team’s development of suggested priorities for the next campaign, including the important work of restoring and preserving the Rotunda and the Academical Village.**

**The Rector spoke about a dinner the night before with faculty members who are playing an active role in enhancing academic quality by using more technology in their teaching. This is a result of President Sullivan’s directing a comprehensive evaluation of the use of technology in academic delivery and her recent encouragement this summer of experimentation in new methods of such delivery both within and outside of the residential student community. She said she believes President Sullivan is actively positioning the University to lead in this arena as the future of technology in higher education unfolds in the coming years.**

**The Rector mentioned the University’s need-based financial aid program, AccessUVa. She said it is one of the nation’s best, and the Board is committed to determining how it can be sustained in the most effective way that benefits students and the University the most.**

**The Rector said the Board had also heard about the strength of the University’s endowment, about growth and new leadership at the College at Wise, and about the University’s plans to move forward with a new internal financial model that will help the University efficiently align resources with the articulated priorities in the future.**

**She said the Board has taken the first steps in holding themselves to a higher level of accountability in governance by shoring up governance policies, especially those concerning the Board’s responsibilities regarding the president. Very importantly, the Board approved a policy that requires a meeting of the full board to discuss contemplated changes to a president’s employment. She said they have shown their commitment to improving the structure of the Board’s work so that voices from every part of the University community are engaged and included. The Rector said the Board now includes faculty consultants on all of its standing committees, and President Sullivan is adding or dedicating top-notch talent to strategic planning, communications, and financial management. These positive collaborations will better serve students and will open more doors for alumni engagement. They help ensure the University meets its commitment to the Governor to hold the line on tuition costs while ensuring more talented youngsters in the Commonwealth earn a college degree.**

**She said the Board wished to show appreciation to President Sullivan for taking on these tough issues and to reinforce the commitment the Board made on June 26th to her future work at the University. She recognized that all of these initiatives, and others, will take time to advance and accomplish. There are no silver bullets, especially when trying to be transformational in a large, complex, and decentralized organization. She thought that day marked a transformational moment – in the course of a few short months a tremendous amount has been accomplished.**

**The Rector asked the Vice Rector to give his remarks about this partnership and to put forward a motion for the Board’s consideration that reflects the Board’s ongoing commitment to working together with the University leadership.**

**Statement of Vice Rector**

**Mr. Martin thanked Ms. Dragas, and said her comments are very much appreciated. He said he thinks very highly of the members of this Board of Visitors. Every person has a deep love for the University and a deep commitment to doing what is right and what is best so that many generations of students will have the same opportunities that so many Board members had in large part because of their experiences at the University.**

**Mr. Martin said he thinks very highly of the entire University community including the excellent faculty, incredibly bright students, and talented staff. He said it takes every part of this community to make the University one of the nation’s best universities.**

**Mr. Martin addressed the Rector and the Board members:**

**At this time, Madam Rector, it is my great pleasure to offer a motion that expresses this Board’s continuing commitment to President Sullivan and her leadership team.**

**I strongly believe that we have a great president in Terry Sullivan. She has clearly done an excellent job of leading our University and engaging faculty, students, parents, and alumni. Our University community has confidence in her and has trust in her.**

**This Board shares that confidence and trust. And so it is my honor and privilege as Vice Rector to make a motion for the University of Virginia’s Board of Visitors to extend the length of President Sullivan’s employment contract from a period of five years to a period of six years, effective immediately.**

**Mr. Diamonstein added his thoughts to those expressed by the Rector and Vice Rector. Mr. Nau said the measures for the strategic and financial plan are important, and he thanked the Rector for her leadership. Mr. Craig thanked President Sullivan for the leadership she has shown. Dr. Long said he thought that Thomas Jefferson would say, “This is the way we do things at the University of Virginia.”**

**The Board voted unanimously to approve the motion.**

**Statement of President**

**Following the vote, President Sullivan said a few words of appreciation for the extension and for the vote of confidence that it represents. She said the extension will allow the Board and the administration to take a longer view as they continue working together to plan the University’s future, identify priorities, and marshal resources to achieve goals.**

**She agreed that it was a critical time; they are just now beginning a period of strategic planning that will create a blueprint for the University in the next decade and beyond. She said they have assembled a steering committee and seven working groups to lead the planning.**

**She said through this process, we will be asking ourselves questions that are fundamental to the University’s mission now and in the years ahead — questions about the distinctive value of residential education, innovation in the classroom, what it means to be a public university in the 21st century, and how we can identify and align the shared interests of our schools so they can effectively work together to distinguish the University.**

**She said the Board’s Special Committee on Strategic Planning is providing valuable guidance for this effort.**

**She thanked the Rector, the Vice Rector, and all of the Board members for their support, and said she looked forward to working with them and with all of the University’s stakeholders to build a strong future for the University.**

**On motion, the meeting of the Board of Visitors was adjourned at 4:00 p.m.**

**Respectfully submitted,**

The Chief Audit Executive will seek input on the department’s activities from the Board of Visitors, the President, and the Executive Vice Presidents. The Chief Audit Executive will have unrestricted access to the President and the Board of Visitors. The Chief Audit Executive is responsible for the direction of the audit function and for seeing that the results of examinations

and actions taken are communicated to appropriate levels of University management and, as appropriate, the President and the Board of Visitors.

The Chief Audit Executive will draft an annual audit plan and will solicit input on this plan from the Board of Visitors, the President, the Executive Vice Presidents and other senior management of the institution. The plan will be submitted to the Board of Visitors for approval.

Nothing herein shall be construed as preventing the Chief Audit Executive from consulting with the President and the Executive Vice Presidents on activities of the department, its findings, or significant issues. Nor shall the President and the Executive Vice Presidents be prevented from consulting with the Chief Audit Executive as may be necessary to the execution of their duties.

**The Audit Department will give full consideration to scheduling special audit requests made by any department or activity. All requests should be in writing to the Chief Audit Executive and state the purpose and scope of the audit.**

Independence
============

**The Audit Department will be organizationally and functionally independent from all University operations and will have no responsibility for the departments and activities being audited while being responsive to their needs and requirements. Because the Audit Department must be independent in carrying out its responsibility to monitor and evaluate control procedures instituted by management, the extent of audit work to be performed with respect to those procedures is limited to the assessment of such procedures.**

**The Audit Department normally performs tests of underlying records and documentary support for transactions. Accordingly, objectivity would be lost if the Audit Department routinely participated in accumulating data or reconstructing records.**

Authorities and Limitations
===========================

**The Audit Department personnel will have complete, free and unrestricted access to all University departments, activities, records, properties and personnel, and is not to be restricted in their activities. Where appropriate, special arrangements will be made for the examination of confidential information.**

Systems Planning and Development
================================

**The Audit Department will participate in the planning, development, implementation, and modification of major computer-based and manual systems to ensure that:**

1.  **adequate controls are incorporated in the system;**
2.  **thorough system testing is performed at appropriate stages;**
3.  **system documentation is complete and accurate; and**
4.  **the resultant system is a complete and accurate implementation of the system specifications.**

**The Audit Department will conduct post-installation evaluations of major information technology systems to ensure that these systems meet their intended purpose and objectives. The department also will review computer operations supporting such systems to ensure that generally accepted standards for systems integrity and security, as well as system-specific controls, are being observed.**

**Security Investigations**

**The Audit, Risk Management and University Police Departments are to be notified if assets have been lost through defalcation or other security breaches. The Audit Department will perform sufficient tests and investigations to identify the weaknesses in procedures, which permitted the defalcation to occur. However, the investigation of the specific event with the objective of recovery and/or prosecution is the responsibility of the University Police Department, with the decision to prosecute being the responsibility of the appropriate Commonwealth’s Attorney.**

Coordination with External Auditing Agencies
============================================

**The Chief Audit Executive will coordinate the department’s audit efforts with those of the University’s independent public accountants or other external auditing agencies by participating in the planning and definition of the scope of proposed audits so the work of all auditing groups is complementary and their combined efforts provide comprehensive, cost-effective audit coverage for the University. Duplication of work will be avoided as much as possible.**

Reporting
=========

**Prior to the completion of a formal report, an exit conference will be conducted with the department or activity head. The conference will be a review of all findings, conclusions, and recommendations. A formal report will be issued at the conclusion of every audit, which will present a concise, clear and factual review of the conditions found, together with recommendations for improvement. A formal written response shall be issued to the Chief Audit Executive, or the Audit Director issuing the report_,_ within 30 days addressing each finding, recommendation, and exception included in the audit report. This response will include the department’s or activity’s plan for implementing the recommendations or a presentation of significant disagreement with the findings and/or recommendations.**

**A follow-up review of significant audit recommendations will be made by the Audit Department to establish that agreed-to recommendations have been adopted. A memorandum will be issued on the follow-up review to the President, the Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, and the Executive Vice President and Provost as appropriate.**

Distribution of Reports
=======================

**Audit reports will be issued to the Executive Vice President or Vice President, most directly responsible for the department or activity involved. In addition, copies of all such reports will be distributed to the President, the Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, and the senior fiscal administrator having a functional interest in the subject matter.**

**All audit reports will be available for review by the Board of Visitors.**

**A summary of significant audit findings will be prepared for each Board meeting and submitted to the Board of Visitors, the President, and the Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, and the Executive Vice President and Provost as appropriate.**
