**REVISION OF STANDARD #1 OF THE STUDENT STANDARDS OF CONDUCT**

**WHEREAS, the University adopted the “University of Virginia Policy and Procedures for Student Sexual Misconduct Complaints” (the “former Policy”) in July of 2011; and**

**WHEREAS, the University adopted a new policy, entitled “Interim Policy on Sexual and Gender-Based Harassment and Other Forms of Interpersonal Violence" (the "new Policy"), on March 30, 2015; and**

**WHEREAS, the new Policy will be finalized on or before July 1, 2015, in order to comply with state law changes that become effective on that date; and**

**WHEREAS, the former Policy prohibited a broad range of behaviors defined as “Sexual Misconduct”; and**

**WHEREAS, the new Policy prohibits a similar broad range of behaviors defined as “Prohibited Conduct”; and**

**WHEREAS, the new Policy supersedes the former Policy with respect to all reports of “Prohibited Conduct” occurring on or after the effective date of the new Policy; and**

**WHEREAS, Standard 1 currently uses the term "Sexual Misconduct" and references the former Policy; and**

**WHEREAS, Standard 1 should now use the term “Prohibited Conduct” and reference the new Policy;**

**RESOLVED, the Board of Visitors affirms the revision of Standard 1 to read in its entirety as follows:**

**Physical assault of any person on University-owned or leased property, at any University sanctioned function, at the permanent or temporary local residence of a University student, faculty member, employee, visitor, or in the City of Charlottesville or Albemarle County, or Prohibited Conduct, as defined in the University of Virginia Policy on Sexual and Gender-Based Harassment and Other Forms of Interpersonal Violence.**

**Revision to Policy on Faculty Role in University Governance**

**Mr. Martin explained that this revision is needed to incorporate the addition of a non-voting advisory faculty representative to the Board that was approved at the March meeting.**

**On motion, the Board adopted the following resolution revising the Policy on Faculty Role in University Governance:**

**REVISION TO POLICY ON FACULTY ROLE IN UNIVERSITY GOVERNANCE**

**On May 21, 2013, the Board of Visitors passed a Resolution on Faculty Role in University Governance, which outlines specific areas of responsibility and authority of faculty in academic and governance matters.  This resolution, which holds the status of policy (BOV-006), is published in the University’s policy directory and the _Faculty Handbook_.**

**On March 25, 2015, the Board of Visitors passed a resolution providing for the appointment of a non-voting advisory faculty representative to the Board.  With the passage of this resolution, the Board policy (BOV-006) requires updating to reflect the addition of the non-voting faculty member to the Board of Visitors.**

**POLICY ON FACULTY ROLE IN UNIVERSITY GOVERNANCE**

**WHEREAS, the Board of Visitors values the input of University faculty members in its formulation of policy, and accordingly appoints a non-voting advisory faculty representative to the Board, invites faculty members to serve as representatives to Board committees; and**

**WHEREAS, the Board wishes to formally recognize the important responsibilities faculty members have in shaping and implementing the University’s curriculum; and**

**WHEREAS, the Board also values the role of faculty in reviewing administrative policies that guide students, faculty, and staff of the University;**

**RESOLVED, the Board adopts the following statement regarding Faculty Role in University Governance:**

**Authority for the governance of the University is vested by statute in the Board of Visitors by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Virginia. The Board’s responsibilities, specified by state statute, include but are not restricted to the appointment of the University president; appointment, promotion, and granting of tenure; removal of members of the faculty; the prescription of faculty responsibilities; the setting of faculty salaries; the determination of student tuition, fees, other charges; and the government and discipline of students. The Board prescribes the duties of the President, and the President has supreme administrative direction of the University, subject to the authority of the Board. The Board has delegated certain authority and responsibilities to the President and the Chief Academic Officer, who have delegated certain of these responsibilities to the faculty.**

**University faculty has played an important role in assisting the Board in fulfilling its responsibility from the University’s founding to the present day. Through the work of the Faculty Senate, a representative body consisting of members elected from each of the schools, faculty recommend approval of the establishment of new degree programs and major modifications to existing degree programs. Faculties also approve the conferral of all degrees and oversee the development of curricula in their respective schools and departments. Each spring, the Board of Visitors appoints a non-voting advisory faculty representative to serve on the Board. In addition, faculties serve as non-voting consulting members on committees of the Board of Visitors, as well as on standing administrative committees of the University, including the University Policy Review Committee, which reviews administrative policies. The Senate also provides the Executive Vice- President and Provost with advice and counsel on other academic matters. Through all of these mechanisms, faculty members share their expertise and insights on academic matters with the Provost, the President, and members of the Board of Visitors.**

**RESOLVED FURTHER, the President is directed to publish or distribute to the Faculty and the University community the above statement regarding Faculty Role in University Governance.**

**Remarks by the Rector**

**The Rector noted that this would be his last meeting as Rector, and it had been a pleasure to serve the University and the Board of Visitors. He thanked the Board members for their service and wished the new rector all the best and congratulated the new elected vice rector, Mr. Conner.**

**Mr. Martin noted that there would be five new Board members. While there would be formal recognition of the retiring Board members at the September meeting, he took a moment to recognize their contributions. He said Ed Miller is highly regarded in his field and helped recruit Dr. Shannon. Allison DiNardo is “superwoman”, chairing two committees--an active and engaged chair of the Student Affairs and Athletics and the Diversity and Inclusion committees. She also made a substantial time commitment to the Sexual Assault Ad Hoc Committee. He said John Nau is a “true Marine”: he is always there to help, and he is a trusted adviser on many matters. Steve Long served as co-chair of Educational Policy and MCOB, and has been actively engaged in many areas of the University particularly with the Health System, faculty, and students.**

**He also thanked John Simon for his exemplary service to the University and to the Board, and wished him all the best as President of Lehigh. Mr. Simon leaves huge footprints in the sand.**

**Dr. Britt said he hoped the tributes in September would be less of a roast and more serious than last year.**

**Ms. DiNardo said she was thankful for Mr. Martin’s steady hand and thoughtfulness. Mr. Martin was given a round of applause.**

**Mr. Martin ended his remarks with a brief summary of the previous day’s Executive Committee meeting. The Committee reviewed and forwarded for approval in the Final Session a Manual change that added provisions for the removal of Board members. This provision is required by law.**

**\- - - - - - - - -**

**Comments by the Student Member**

**Mr. Martin said the Board was fortunate to have had Meg Gould as the student member for the year. Ms. Gould will be leaving to teach math in Botswana. On behalf of the Board, the Rector wished Ms. Gould a safe trip to Botswana and an enjoyable and rewarding experience.**

**At the Rector’s invitation, Ms. Gould made a few comments. Ms. Gould expressed her thanks for having had the privilege, opportunity, and experience of serving on the Board. While she is still reflecting on her experience, the main lessons deal with patience, resilience, the importance of overlap of ideas and relationships, and the value of the collaboration that happens when students, faculty, administration, Board members, and community representatives are in the same room. Ms. Gould concluded by thanking the Board members for the time, energy, and patience that they had shown in answering her questions and giving her advice.**

**Mr. Judge, the Student Board Member, provided comments:**

**Thank you, Rector Martin. I want to start by thanking Meg for everything she has done as Student Member of the Board. Before seeing Meg work first hand, I had a general sense of appreciation for her contributions to the University. Now, after having had the chance to see just how much she does on a daily basis and how much she cares about each issue, I have nothing but the utmost admiration and gratitude. I want to thank you for being a great Student Member and mentor to me over the last couple months.**

**Since March, I have spent a lot of time listening to the perspectives of students, administrators, faculty, and fellow Board Members. I’ve referred to this as my learning phase and I plan to continue it. However, I am finally ready to speak and offer my first observations. In doing so I have three objectives: I want to discuss advancements being made by students, explain my perspective on the role of the student member, and then provide a few areas of the University worth focusing on.**

**At the end of this year, students made a number of advancements for the University community. These will need follow-up and implementation throughout the next year. In April, the Black Student Alliance published the report, “Towards a Better University.” With the support of thirty other organizations, the report recommends policies that range from academic issues like the departmentalization of the Carter G. Woodson Institute to cultural needs like increasing the number of black students and black faculty. Another advancement was a student-based initiative to develop a multicultural center, which is still in the development stages. Additionally, Student Council helped form committees to provide student perspectives on tuition and fees. This will expand our idea of student self-governance through increased input. And just yesterday two students presented in front of the Advancement and Communications Committee after participating in a University-wide process. These initiatives will require significant follow-through from students and support from Board members and administrators in order to advance the University as intended.**

**This leads me to an explanation of the role I envision for the Student Member position. In order for me to be effective it is important that the Board knows where I’m coming from. I will always be a student first and a member second, but will synthesize the two roles by engaging more students. The truth is I will never be able to represent students as well as they can represent themselves. With this in mind, I hope to connect more students with members on issues pertaining to Board, whether in a formal capacity, like yesterday, or through informal discussions. The four advancements I just discussed are perfect examples of initiatives I’d like to help connect. I will be doing my job well if I can serve as an informative resource for both Board members and students, and I truly hope each of you hold me to that.**

**Finally, I would like to offer two areas for increased focus within the University community. UVA is already an incredible institution, but these areas are essential for student improvement.**

**The first of these is Collaborative Education. While Rector of the Catholic University of Ireland, John Henry Cardinal Newman wrote “The Idea of a University.” In this he states, “it is more correct, as well as more usual, to speak of a university as a place of education than of instruction…” His point is that it’s wrong to separate the knowledge gained in the classroom, from that earned outside. In order for students to achieve this ideal of knowledge, they must have greater access to research projects in the sciences and humanities. They need the flexibility to explore subjects across different schools, similar to the system at Cornell, and they need the ability to help cultivate class subjects like offered at Bryn Mawr College and currently being explored by our own Teaching Resource Center. There has been improvement in many of these areas, but there is plenty of room for growth. Take for example Nursing students who would like greater access to Spanish classes, but often are unable to enroll because they are in a different school. As we enter the generational turnover of faculty, finding professors who are excited by these objectives is crucial.**

**The second area of focus is the expansion of student engagement. I attended a leadership conference about a week ago with forty student leaders from all across the University. The general consensus of the group was that the biggest issue on Grounds is an internal culture of elitism. Many students feel the greatest limitation on their educational experience is the exclusivity expressed by student organizations and academic programs. This issue can’t be solved overnight and will always exist to some extent, but it can be improved in the short-term if groups like the Board are willing to disseminate their opportunities of engagement and interaction with students. There have already been great steps towards accomplishing this, such as the move to create a student-governance system in the School of Continuing and Professional Studies and the creation of the Meriwether Lewis Institute. Many of you have also devoted your time to meeting with a diversity of student groups and I hope to serve as a conduit for this in the year to come. But the point remains that when receiving student input the Board can do best by intentionally seeking out voices that are otherwise unheard.**

**I’d like to end by saying: great things truly are happening at this University and I am sure they will continue under the leadership of the Board. I am excited to work with all of you on these and many other issues over the course of this year and hope that you use me as a resource and hold me accountable to the highest of standards. Thank you.**

**Comments by the Faculty Senate Chair**

**Mr. Martin recognized Joe Garofalo, former chair of the Faculty Senate, and introduced Dr. Nina Solenski, who provided an overview of the Faculty Senate for the 2014-2015 Academic Year. There were 82 faculty senators representing the College, Architecture, Batten, Commerce, Curry, Darden, Law, Medicine, Nursing, and Engineering. The Senate had nine committees: Academic Affairs; Collaboration, Communication & Engagement; Faculty Grievance; Faculty Recruitment, Retention, Retirement & Welfare; Finance; Nominating; Planning; Policy; and Research, Teaching & Scholarship. Faculty participation included service on University Wide Committees, such as the President’s Ad Hoc Group on UVA Climate and Culture, the Faculty Salary Study Task Force, the Non Tenure Track Task Force, Board of Visitors Committees, and the Dean/Provost Search Committees. Faculty Senate initiatives included the Task Force on Race, and collaboration with the General Faculty Council. Ms. Solenski concluded by thanking Mr. Garofalo for his service, and J. Patrick Walsh as the Senate’s Editorial Administrative Assistant. She also thanked the Board of Visitors for the salary increase this year, and the addition of a non-voting faculty representative to the Board.**

**Comments by the President**

**President Sullivan’s comments are reported verbatim:**

**During the meetings of the Board of Visitors since last fall, mostly for reasons beyond our control, we have heard a lot of bad news. This morning, I want to share an assortment of good news about our University.**

**Our faculty members continue to distinguish themselves nationally and globally. Researchers at our School of Medicine recently made a game-changing discovery when they determined that the human brain is directly connected to the body’s immune system by vessels; for many years, scientists thought that no such vessels existed. Medical textbooks will have to be re-written because of this discovery, and it will have significant effects on the study and treatment of diseases including autism, Alzheimer’s disease, and multiple sclerosis.**

**The General Assembly recently awarded $1 million to researchers at the Center for Advanced Study of Teaching and Learning, or CASTL, in our Curry School of Education. With this support, the researchers will expand readiness-assessment programs to help kindergartners across the Commonwealth be better prepared to start school.**

**Although most of our students have gone home, UVa still buzzes with activity during the summer. More than 4,600 students participate in summer study on Grounds each year, and another 1,200 pursue studies overseas.**

**The summer session gives our students the chance to fulfill degree requirements; work on courses toward a double major; and create flexibility in their schedules so they have time for internships or study-abroad during the regular school year. The summer courses are also available to students from other universities, rising high school juniors and seniors, and life-long learners who come here from across the U.S. and around the world. Several of the University’s auxiliary units — this includes Dining, the Bookstore, and Conference Services — serve (and also benefit from) the summer session.**

**Next month, we will welcome our second class of students to the Master of Science in Data Science degree program offered through the Data Science Institute. The first class of 44 students graduated in May, and this summer we will enroll 52 students from a pool of about 400 applicants.**

**Twenty-five fellows in the Meriwether Lewis Institute for Citizen Leadership are on Grounds this summer. They are taking part in a six-week program covering a broad range of leadership topics. They will meet with UVa faculty and staff and with prominent alumni, and they will also meet with our deans to discuss school-specific challenges.**

**You will have the opportunity to meet the Lewis Fellows today at lunch. Also joining us for lunch will be the winners of the Leonard Sandridge Outstanding Contribution Awards for 2015. This is our highest award for staff, and employees are nominated for their “can-do” spirit and their dedication to UVa — qualities that have defined Leonard’s many years of service to UVa.**

**Not all of the University’s summertime activity happens here on the Grounds. This summer, we have 60 students involved in internships in 13 foreign countries through our new Global Internships Program.**

**Fourteen of our alumni and graduate students will venture to various corners of the world this fall on Fulbright Scholarships; this is a record-breaking number of Fulbrights for UVa. These scholars will conduct cancer research in Switzerland and study nano-science in Denmark, among other research projects, and they will teach English in Taiwan, Sri Lanka, Brazil, Vietnam, Germany, Poland, Peru, Colombia, and South Africa.**

**These are just a few examples of the achievements of our students, faculty, and staff.**

**In athletics, the UVa baseball team will compete in the College World Series for the fourth time beginning this weekend, after sweeping Maryland in last weekend’s Super Regional.**

**In other sports news, our women’s golf team won its first ACC Championship in program history this year. Women’s rowing won its 6th consecutive ACC Championship, and the team’s Varsity Four were national champions.**

**Women’s swimming won its 8th consecutive ACC Championship. Men’s tennis won its 9th consecutive ACC Championship, and its 2nd NCAA Championship in program history.**

**Women’s tennis won its 2nd consecutive ACC Championship. Wrestling won its 5th ACC Championship. Men’s Basketball won the ACC Regular Season Championship, and Men’s Soccer won its 7th national championship in program history.**

**Tennis player Ryan Shane was the National Men’s Singles Champion. Swimmer Leah Smith was the national champion in two freestyle races (500 yards and 1650 yards). And women’s soccer player Morgan Brian was the repeat winner of the Hermann Trophy, which is awarded each year to the top male and female college soccer player in the nation. And, Morgan is playing for the U.S. women’s soccer team in this summer’s 2015 World Cup.**

**We had very successful Reunions this spring. For the 50th Reunion in May and for Reunions Weekend last weekend, more than 2,700 alumni came back to the Grounds, and the total number of alumni, family, and guests exceeded 4,500.**

**Reunion giving this year totaled $27,358,925; this is an increase of 39 percent over the last Reunions in 2010 for the participating classes. And all ten of our Reunion classes reached their “stretch” dollar goals.**

**At the end of a challenging year for UVa, we should remind ourselves that this University remains a model of excellence in higher education. And our students, faculty, staff, and alumni remain committed to the work that makes our University great.**

**I want to commend the Board of Visitors for what was an exceptionally strong year in which a great deal was accomplished including a long term financial plan that looked at every lever except tuition and took steps with all of those levers as well as raising tuition appropriately to fund financial aid. You cooperated closely with the administration in many areas, and approved a nonvoting faculty member. Dr. Miller was instrumental in creating an executive vice president for health affairs, and a strong supporter of the safety program. Allison DiNardo was a tireless member, meeting with student and faculty groups and the ad hoc group and was on the other end of multiple phone conversations. John Nau was important in reformulating the marketing and branding plan, changing the way we do communications, and instrumental in the hiring of Dave Martel. Steve Long is the “Energizer Bunny” who has worked tirelessly in everything he has done, including Educational Policy and the MCOB. George Martin has been a magnificent leader with trials we could not have foreseen, and he has accomplished most of his ambitious goals.**

**Following her remarks, President Sullivan gave the Gifts and Grants report.**

**Summary of Fiscal Year-To-Date through April 30, 2015**
