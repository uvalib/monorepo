Dr. Britt opened the meeting. After brief comments, he gave the floor to Dr. Shannon.

Reports from the Executive Vice President for Health Affairs

Dr. Shannon spoke about the need to create a respectful organizational culture. In his position, he has two critical responsibilities: to make sure the organization executes its short term strategies with demonstrable results, and to set the long term direction. Given the changing health care environment, the Health System has to be reinvented. Dr. Shannon’s initial focus was on performance with an emphasis on patient safety. The goal was to ensure that no one was hurt while receiving treatment. Although more work is needed, the Medical Center has become one of the safest hospitals in the country.

A cultural transformation is needed to reach the next level of performance. How team members feel impacts their work. Disengaged team members are not likely to perform at a high level. The Health System, therefore, must address the physical, emotional, and psychological well-being of its team members. It must develop a culture of respect. The values are in place, but behavior does not always reflect these values. The goal is to get to the point where every employee can say yes to the following questions: I am treated with dignity and respect regardless of position; I am given the tools needed to contribute; and I am recognized for what I do. To embrace this transformation, staff must see that the entire organization supports it. Approximately 60% of the workforce is fully engaged in the pursuit of this goal. The goal for the next five years is to increase the level of engagement to include the remaining 40%.

The transformation has been and will continue to be difficult for physicians. The practice of medicine has shifted dramatically in the last 20 years. More than half of the physicians were trained prior to 2000 when health care pivoted from a doctor centric discipline to a patient focus. It was a change from individualism to a team care approach. Early efforts to achieve this goal will include a series of frequent communications and meetings with the staff.

Dr. Shannon ended his presentation with a review of the operational goals for FY 2019. The Health System is on track to complete them by the end of the fiscal year.

Health System Consolidated Finance Report from the Finance Working Group

Mr. Lischke reviewed the fiscal year performance as of September 30. The balance sheet remained strong with assets totaling $4.8 billion. Operating income was $2.7 million, which was below the $6.5 million budget, but compared favorably to last year. The reduced operating income was driven by a case mix index (CMI) of 2.07 instead of the 2.10 target and a shortfall in the operations of the Transitional Care Hospital and Home Health Care. These units, which have volume and staffing challenges, have plans in place to improve their operations and are expected to recover. Operating cash flow was $35 million. Operating margin is 0.4% versus the budgeted 1%. The School of Medicine is in line with its budget and the prior year. The University Physicians Group is strong to budget and the prior year.

Adjusted discharges were favorable to budget and to the prior year. Surgeries did well. Inpatient and outpatient numbers were above last year, but below budget. The School of Medicine saw a year-over- year growth in research expenditures.

The second quarter is off to a good start. October set records for volumes and cash collections. The monthly operating income was $10 million, which resulted in the operating income for the year being favorable to budget by $5 million. The CMI target of 2.10 was met. November volumes appear to be in line with budget. The Health System is on track to meet budget by the end of the second quarter.

Health System Inclusion and Wellness

Dr. Shannon offered introductory comments on the Health System’s efforts to build a culture of diversity and inclusion. While it performs reasonably well in terms of headcount, the idea of everyone being equally capable of succeeding has not been hardwired in the way individuals are mentored. The Health System’s search for a Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer has been placed on hold. An offer was made and accepted, but the individual backed out for personal reasons. Given that the University’s search for a Vice President and Chief Officer for Diversity and Equity was underway, the Health System decided to assess its next steps after this individual was in place.

Before giving the floor to Ms. Sutton-Wallace, Dr. Shannon said the Health System’s workforce must reflect the composition of the community it serves in order to create a community of trust. Ms. Sutton-Wallace said demographics in the United States were shifting. As of 2016, the minority was the majority in kindergarten classes. She said data shows that high performing organizations are racially and gender diverse. While the diversity of the Health System’s staff reflects that of the Thomas Jefferson Health District, the diversity of the management team does not. To improve diversity and inclusion, the Health System is pursing five areas of focus: Enterprise Education; Policy and Procedural Changes; Vendor/Supply Diversity; Recruitment/Retention/Succession Planning; and Patient Outcomes/Health Care Disparities.

Ms. Sutton-Wallace said that during the debrief of operations related to the events of August 11 and 12, 2017, the Medical Center received comments about discrimination and micro-aggressions. To respond, the Medical Center hosted a leadership summit on February 7, 2018 to initiate a dialogue. She showed a video “Declaration of Interdependence.” She said physicians struggle with patient rights versus caregiver rights. She then gave the floor to Dr. Wilkes.

Dr. Wilkes said the high level of student diversity was one of the elements that attracted him to the School of Medicine. This level of diversity, 23% - 24% African American or Latino, does not occur at the national level and is in the top 15% - 16% of all U.S. medical schools. Diversity among residents, fellows, and faculty, however, was much lower. In response, a climate assessment was conducted in 2016. Its findings included the need to value diversity as a strategic imperative at all levels, to seek community engagement, to support students when dealing with racial or gender issues, to build infrastructure for an office of diversity, and to provide tools for chairs and program directors. The efforts undertaken since 2016 have been effective. Each department now has a diversity plan and a dashboard where progress can be monitored. The number of under-represented minority (URM) faculty, residents, and fellows has increased. While the percentage of URM faculty still lags the national average, 4.5% versus 6.2%, the percentages of URM residents and fellows now exceed the national average.

Dr. Chhabra said his department’s diversity and inclusion efforts have been challenged by the events of August 2017. His program has the most competitive residency program in the country; this year there were 875 applicants for five residency spots. Thirty URM candidates were accepted for interviews, but only five accepted. He called the applicants who declined to find out why and was told it was the August events. His department also lost two faculty recruits for the same reason.

The rector asked about the reason for the high diversity among medical students. Dr. Wilkes said it was due to Dr. Canterbury, who created a more holistic admissions process focusing on more than just test scores. This approach increased diversity while not impacting quality. When asked about impacts of the events of August 2017, Dr. Wilkes said there was a decline of over 10% last year with the biggest decline in out-of-state applicants, but there was not a decline in URM applicants. During the application process, the School discussed the August events up front. This proactive approach appears to have been effective.

Mr. Crutchfield said the University wrestled with the problem of attracting URM faculty when he was on the Board of Visitors from 1997 to 2005. From a recent conversation, it appears the small size of Charlottesville’s community of minority professionals is a drawback. He suggested the University use groups of diverse individuals to invite URM candidates to dinners in their homes to show the diversity of the Charlottesville community.

Dr. Lukacs said URM students do not always feel welcomed by patients. Dr. Wilkes used this comment as a segue for a film clip titled “Addressing bigotry and prejudice when it is exhibited by a patient.” This was one of eight videos produced to address diversity. They are based on actual experiences and are used to help educators deal with awkward situations and to teach patients how to respond differently. A number of schools have expressed interest in them.

Dr. Kirk reviewed the tactics used in 2018 to improve diversity in the Graduate Medical Education program. The School, with its history of strong residency programs, had developed an attitude of “we are really good and you should come here.” Starting in 2016, it became more proactive. The events of August 2017 led to a number of tactics. These included Diversity Days coinciding with residency and fellowship interviews, visits to historically black colleges to recruit their medical students, and support of the House Staff Council for Diversity and Inclusion. The School is also focused on resident wellness. Dr. Kirk said the residency period is the most physically and emotionally challenging time a doctor faces. The burnout rate during this period is 70%.

Ms. Fontaine said the morale among UVA physicians is at an all-time low. Dr. Britt said he will talk to the leadership about morale and will have an update at the next meeting.

Health System Development Report

Ms. Rendleman reviewed the results for FY 2018, goals for FY 2019, and the plans for the University’s _Honor the Future_ capital campaign. FY 2018 was the best year the Health System has had since it started counting towards the campaign. A total of $67.7 million was raised, which was 9% over the $62 million goal. This included $17.6 million in investigator-initiated philanthropic grants. The goal for FY 2019 is $100 million. As of November 22, $31.7 million has been raised.

The Health System has raised $337.5 million of its $1 billion share of the University’s capital campaign, which ends in 2025. To be successful, the Health System must focus on leadership gifts in excess of $1 million, pursue new prospects, and leverage resources and volunteer networks. Initial areas of focus will be on biomedical research, medical education and faculty support, nursing education and faculty support, and patient care initiatives. The Health System will use a “Care and Cure” messaging theme in support of its three missions: putting the patient first; cures within reach; and transforming nursing and medical education.

School of Medicine Report

Dr. Wilkes reported on research. Recent increases in research funding should move the School up in the new rankings, which will be released in January. He highlighted Dr. Jose Oberholzer’s article in Nature Biomedical Engineering and Mr. Jonathan Kipnis’s receipt of the National Institute of Health Director’s Pioneer Award, which is the NIH’s most prestigious award. He said the Cancer Center should receive a comprehensive status designation in three years. The School is expecting a notice of a NIH Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) around the first of the year. This will be a joint collaboration with Virginia Tech, Carilion Clinic, and Inova, and will be focused on utilizing data science for health research on large populations.
