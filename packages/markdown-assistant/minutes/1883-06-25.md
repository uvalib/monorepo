They take great pleasure in reporting to the Board their high appreciation of the manner in which all things seem to be done, and the general conduct of the Librarian, officially and personally.

Resolved, That a Proficiency is hereby authorized to be conferred in Logic and one also in Philosophy, these being two distinct classes in the School of Moral Philosophy.

To the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia.

The Committee on conduct of Schools report:

1. Each Professor furnished a full annual Report showing number of students in his class, attendance, lectures, examinations and the results thereof, and we congratulate the Faculty and the Visitors on the manifest for the session just ended. The sanitary condition, the demeanor, the proper habits, and the elevated status of attainment are unexcelled by any former session.

2. Mr:Holmes, Professor of History, Literature and Rhetoric reports that the classes in his department are more intelligent and better prepared than heretofore in consequence of the withdrawal of nearly half the usual number to the study of English in the recently established School of Professor Garnett. He desires a special Lecture Room for the suspension of his Maps and Chronological Tables. He needs many additions to the Library for the recent innovations and expansions of Political Economy and Science of Society.

Professor Schele de Vere, of the School of Modern Languages, reports that matters in his department are prospering and improving. He occupies his Lecture Room on official business from 4 to 7 hours daily, and thinks that room should be specially dedicated to his School; and that a separate room should be given to Prof. Garnett, to whom as the Head of the School of English, no room has been specially assigned.

Professor Dunnington, of the School of Analytical and Agricultural Chemistry reports considerable improvement in the state of preparation on the part of students for the work of his several classes as compared with previous sessions.

Professor Peters, of the School of Latin, reports favorably.

Professor Cabell reports some improvement in the condition of the preparation of Students for the work of his class.

Professor Smith.

Professor Page, of the School of Zoology and Botany, reports an increase of interest in the subjects taught in his classes, but complains of the conflict of Lectures.

Professor Fontaine, of the School of Natural History and Geology, reports faithful attendance and study in his classes.

Professor J.S. Davis, of the School of Anatomy, has nothing special to report.

Professor Thornton, of the School of Applied Mathematics, reports on the part of students.

Professor Venable, of the School of Mathematics, reports fully as to the matters pertaining to his school, and requests a leave of absence, made necessary by the state of his health; and if proper provisions are made to supply his performance of duties in his absence, this committee recommends that leave be granted Prof: Venable to absent himself from his professorship in this University for the period of one year.

This Committee feels especial interest in the Report of Professor Garnett, of the Chair of English, which was established one year ago under the Auspices of this Board as mainly now constituted. That Report shows that the design of the School is fully appreciated, and will grow to be an indispensable factor in the usefulness of the University. He needs additional books which are not particularized.

3. Previous Committees on the Conduct of Schools have reported in favor of the establishment of a School of English.

This Committee recommended the establishment of the same - and it has been established - and the results have demonstrated the wisdom of the recommendation.

4. We believe that no appropriations are necessary in order to carry out the recommendations of this Report, beyond the usual Library recommendations.

Resolved, That hereafter the Report, which has heretofore been made by the Faculty of the average attendance and standing of Students, be dispensed with.

### Tuesday, June 26, 1883

### Committee on Grounds and Buildings

Your Committee on Grounds and Buildings have the honor to report that they have made a partial inspection of the same, and find their condition such that it would take many thousand dollars to put them in thorough repair, and as the financial condition of the Institution at this particular juncture does not justify such expenditure, your committee only recommend doing such things as seem absolutely indispensable and requiring immediate attention, which they will herein-after enumerate with probable cost. They would recommend that from the fact that in the opinion of your committee there will in the near future have to be a large amount expended in repairs, which amount can only be determined by a close and careful inspection by the Committee with the assistance of an expert; and that the Legislature will be applied to for pecuniary assistance for this and other objects, that they be allowed to make such inspection and report what improvements and repairs are necessary and the amount of money that will be needed in order to make them at the meeting of the Visitors to be held on the 11" of September next.

Your Committee report in respect of the applications of Mess: Dunnington and Garnett in regard to Prof Mallet's residence that it is inexpedient to take any action at this meeting.

As to repairs that should be done immediately your Committee report:

1. That the roof of the Rotunda is in bad condition, and recommend that it be repaired and painted with Iron paint - probable cost $100.

2. That the Brooks Museum leaks, can be repaired at probable cost of $30.

3. That the Arch north of Annex is in very bad condition, and should be repaired immediately - probable cost $100.

4. That $50 be expended in repairing and improving Henry Martin's house.

5. That Mrs: Treiber be allowed to paper or kalsomine her dining room; the cost not to exceed that paid by Mrs Garth for the papering of her dining room.

6. That no action be taken with reference to Prof Schele de Vere's kitchen until the September meeting.

Your Committee would further say that it will take the usual sum for annual repairs, and would in addition recommend that the Proctor be directed to have such blinds put on the windows of the house occupied by Mr Garrison as will make it private. W. Roane Ruffin, Cr:

Resolved, That the action of the Faculty, May 12, 1883, in regard to the School of Athens, and the promised Gessner Harrison Scholarship is hereby approved.

In accordance with the recommendations made by the Faculty in their Annual Report the Committee on Finance submits the following for adoption:

Resolved 1. That hereafter a student be charged for each Certificate of Proficiency $2.50, and for each Diploma of Graduation $5.

2. That for a Diploma conveying a title in the Medical or in the Law Department $15 be charged.

3. That no charge be made for Diplomas conveying Academical titles, nor for Diplomas conveying titles in the Departments of engineering and Agriculture: provided, all Certificates of Proficiency and Diplomas of Graduation prerequisite to said Diplomas shall have been paid for.

4. That students entering the Medical or Law Department be required to deposit $15, each, all other Students $10, each, for Diplomas: provided, any portion, or all, of his deposit unconsumed by Charge for Diplomas be credited to the student in final settlement.

5. That no student be informed of his success in an examination for a Certificate or Diploma until it has been ascertained that his deposits are sufficient to meet his dues for the same.

6. That all existing enactments, in so far as inconsistent with these presents, be and are hereby repealed.

The apparatus in the Department of Chemistry is sufficient and in good order.

It is recommended that such of Prof Mallet's chemical materials be bought as is suggested by Mr Dunnington.

The Faculty Report recommends the usual annual appropriation for the purchase and repair of apparatus Etc. in the Schools of Chemistry, Natural Philosophy and Astronomy.
