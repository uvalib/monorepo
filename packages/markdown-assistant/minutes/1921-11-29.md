Minutes of the previous meeting, which had been copied and sent to each member, were approved.

The President announced the attendance of 1673 students for the session to date. He also announced the following gifts and was requested to prepare a proper resolution concerning same.

* Letter from Thomas Jefferson to Dr. Thomas Cooper, then President of the University of South Carolina, from Mrs. J. T. Guenette, of Chandler, Okla., whose first husband, James Jackson Hanna, was grandson of Dr. Cooper to whom letter is addressed.
* Framed picture, showing the Harbors of Norfolk, Portsmouth and Newport News, in 1950, from Captain W. R. Boutwell, of the Virginia-Pilot Association of Norfolk, Va.
* Portrait (in charcoal) of Dr. Basil L. Gildersleeve, from Mr. Frederic S. Wight, of Chatha, Mass., a student at the University of Virginia.
* Textbooks used by Lieut. Francis Worth Payne, of Charleston, West Virginia, while a student of the Law School, from which he graduated in June 1916. Lieut. Payne was killed in action in France, July 20, 1918.
* Pensylvania Statutes Complete to 1920...1 vol., from Mr. William Curtis Bok, Merion Station, Pa., to the Law Library.
* Dr. J. H. Neff made application on behalf of the Thomas Jefferson Eating Club for a site on the grounds of the University for the purpose of erecting a Chapter House. After a full discussion of the matter the following was adopted:

**RESOLVED**, That the Rector and Visitors of the University approve of the purpose of the Thomas Jefferson Eating Club to build an exact copy of the Temple of Eleusis, in Indiana Limestone, and leases on the usual terms to this Society for that purpose the use of the necessary land, situated in the triangle between the site of the Chapel and residence of Physical Director Lannigan.

The Architectural Commission in charge of the location and erection of the New Gymnasium submitted the following report:

In response to your invitation the undersigned members of the Architectural Commission met at the University to consider sites and recommend a site for the Gymnasium.

In our judgment the problem consists of providing a location which will allow of the necessary space for all the outdoor and indoor activities which are required by the present conception of physical education and also permit of future enlargement to accommodate a greatly increased number of students. The primary consideration of any site must therefore be that it shall afford level space immediately adjacent to the gymnasium building for ball grounds, tennis courts, hand ball courts, running tracks, gymnastic drills for classes of possibly 500 to 1000 men, without interfering with intercollegiate athletics. Another consideration is that the site shall be as near as possible the center of student life, both of class-room and dormitory, so that the gymnasium can be utilized at all hours with the least loss of time, for remedial physical class work, recreational exercises and sports. Since the building will be the largest and most imposing at the University, with the exception of the Rotunda, it is important that it be given a beautiful setting and its architectural qualities thereby enhanced.

With these considerations in mind and after a personal inspection of all the available sites, we recommend that the gymnasium be located west of the present ice pond on the plateau between it and the public road; that the gymnasium face east toward the crossing of Rugby and Ivy Roads; that the marshy ground to the south of the ice pond be filled in to provide level space for outdoor athletic activities; and that the entire level valley between Ivy Road and the Railroad track west of Carr's Hill be reserved and utilized as needed for outdoor athletics and be connected with Lambeth Field through the existing culvert under the railroad track.

We further recommend that the end of the valley south of the ice pond be utilized for future dormitory groups, where, on account of the western slope of the land, three and four story buildings can be erected without conflicting with the two story buildings of the Lawn group.

This comprehensive development, far more than that of any other which has been considered, will take care of the future needs of the University for dormitories, athletic life, and student recreational activities. The dormitories, golf course, gymnasium skating, tennis courts and outdoor athletics will form a connected group with Lambeth Field that can never be crowded out by other needs of the University, and in this way the mistake which has been made by so many colleges of not providing adequate space for future development avoided.

While we have not allowed ourselves to be influenced too strongly by the desire for beauty of architectural setting, we think that a very important advantage of the site recommended is the great potential charm of the surroundings. The building would be seen from the upper level of the Ivy Road and from the west side of the old grounds, outlined against a background of mountains, with a small lake in front of its main facade, giving a charming reflection and an approach of unusual beauty.

We reached our choice after having rejected the other sites for the following reasons:

* The Y. M. C. A. site - Much too small as it gives no adequate space for the outdoor activities of class work and games which equal in importance the indoor activities of a gymnasium, and is surrounded by grounds which cannot be controlled by the University; badly pocketed by the sloping east and west banks so that the treatment of any building will be handicapped.
* Site between Kappa Sigma fraternity house and railroad - smaller than the above site and in addition slopes steeply to the west and so situated that any building on it cannot be seen from a distance.
* Athletic Casino - no opportunity for outdoor athletics except on Lambeth Field, which is already utilized to the limit with its regular team activities. This site is also farther from the center of student life.
* Site between Ivy Road and railroad west of Carr's Hill - it is proposed to incorporate this space into the scheme of athletic development. If the gymnasium were located on this site it would be hidden by Carr's Hill and be further away from student life.

At first glance it might appear that the site suggested is remote and difficult of access, but this is far from the fact for the distance from the Rotunda to the proposed site is 1200 feet, from the crossing of Rugby and Ivy Roads, 900 feet, and from Monroe Hill, 1000 feet.

The following supplementary report of the Architectural Commission was also submitted:

The Architectural Commission has considered and studied at length all phases of the gymnasium problem and now submits these plans which, in our unanimous professional judgment, are the most economical solution which meets all the obligatory requirements. We submit an approximate estimate of cost prepared by Mr. W. P. Thurston, the Richmond contractor, in the sum of $259,000.00. On this basis we recommend that the Board authorize the preparation of working drawings and specifications on which bids for the work may be secured.

Pursuant to the foregoing report, the following resolutions were adopted:

**RESOLVED**, That the Rector and Visitors approve of the site and plans for the proposed gymnasium recommended by the report of the Committee of the Visitors upon the advice of the Architectural Commission appointed to advise upon site and prepare plans for the gymnasium.

**RESOLVED**, further, That, in lieu of the usual architect's fees for the gymnasium, the sum of $9,500 be and is hereby appropriated for compensation and expenses of the Architectural Commission and of the University Architect's office.

**RESOLVED**, further, That the Rector and Visitors approve of the resolution passed by the Alumni Board of Trustees of the University of Virginia Endowment Fund, at their meeting on October 24, 1921, that the Board of Alumni Trustees, recognizing the generous subscription of $146,000 by the students of the University to the Centennial Endowment Fund, and further recognizing the urgent need at the University of a new gymnasium, towards the cost of the construction of which the subscription of the students was made, hereby declares that in its judgment the first capital outlay to be made from the proceeds of the Fund should be for the construction of the Gymnasium.

Professor Charles Hancock, Engineer in charge of the construction of the New Heating Plant, submitted the following report:

According to general plans and specifications of the central heating system, prepared by myself and adopted by the engineering faculty, construction will go forward, as funds become available, in three sections. The first section, to be installed for $60,000 now available, comprises:

1. Permanent mains from the power house to East Range. These mains are of sufficient capacity to serve all buildings west of the Hospital and Chemical laboratory with an allowance of 100% for future development.
2. Complete heating equipment of East Range, East Lawn and the Rotunda.
3. The necessary changes and additions to the new power plant to provide for the added load.

This section is now being installed by Messrs. Almirall & Company of New York, and, if weather conditions continue favorable, should be in operation by January first.

The second section comprises:

1. Extension of permanent mains to Peabody Hall.
2. Complete heating equipment of West Lawn, West Range, the commons, old medical hall and the Peabody group.
3. Substantial enlargement of the new power house, erection of a permanent chimney, installation of a large boiler and additional water heaters.

The estimated cost of this section is **$96,500.**

The third section comprises:

1. Abandonment of the old power plant and transfer of all apparatus fit for use to the new plant.
2. Extension of permanent mains from East Range to Brook's museum, the nurses' home, Physical and Mechanical laboratories, Cabell Hall and the old infirmary.
3. Complete heating equipment of the buildings just mentioned.
4. Connection to the new system of the present Dawson's Row - Minor Hall lines.

The estimated cost of this section is **$88,500.**

Contract for the first section was let to Messrs. Almirall & Company, without competitive bids, for the following reasons:

1. Their estimates and mine of the work which could be done for **$60,000** were almost identical, though made entirely independently.
2. Preparation of detailed working drawings and exact specifications for competitive bidding would have delayed letting contract until January 1st., and postponed completion of the work until after the present heating season. The old plant is greatly overloaded and relief of the same by connecting East Lawn and the Rotunda to the new plant is imperative.
3. Much old material in the present installation may be used in the new construction. The value of this material could not be estimated in advance, and ignorance of its value would have presented a serious handicap to competitive bidding and grave probability of disagreement at final settlement.
4. Messrs. Almirall & Company made us a most liberal proposition on a percentage basis. Competitive bids for all materials are submitted to us and orders are given only upon our authorization. As far as practicable materials are bought through local concerns. Local labor, as far as available, is employed. We get the benefit of all cash discounts. We pay all freight and express charges, thus saving the war tax. All bills for material and labor are checked and approved by us before payment. Their books are constantly open to our inspection, and I have now in my files copies of all vouchers approved for payment. Their charge for the work is 15% of the net cost.
5. It was my conviction, shared unanimously by the engineering faculty, that by selecting contractors of national reputation with long experience and abundant resources for pushing the work, better work would be done and we would get more for our money than could be gotten by letting the contract to less skillful contractors. The conduct of the work thus far has justified this conviction, and I believe, with data now in my possession I can demonstrate that our course was wise.

I shall be glad to go into details more thoroughly or answer any questions that may occur to you and which are not covered by this statement.

We estimate this work will cost the additional sum of SEVEN THOUSAND AND FIFTY-THREE DOLLARS

**$7053.**

including full allowance for the omissions mentioned.

This manner of performing and charging for this work to be in accordance with our proposal dated September 29, 1921 and similar in all respects to the work now being done and covered in specification except that the limit cost will be increased to SIXTY-SEVEN THOUSAND AND FIFTY-THREE DOLLARS

**$67053.**

### ATTENTION Mr. Chas. Hancock

In accordance with your request, we have estimated the cost of extending the 28′ × 44′ concrete conduit and 12′ mains from manhole # 4 at the East Range to Manhole # 5 at the East Lawn, the installation of a 5′ supply main from manhole # 5 to Prof. Lewis' House and the omission of the temporary 5′ supply and 5′ return from the East Range to the East Lawn.

The performance of this work at the present time will mean a saving of approximately **$3200** in the ultimate cost of the work.

On October 10th, 1921 the Common Council of the City of Charlottesville appointed a committee composed of J. R. Morris, Chairman; W. M. Forrest; City Mgr., Walter Washabaugh and J. P. Greaver to make thorough investigation of the water situation in Charlottesville, and to get up plans and specifications for filter and aeration plant.

This Committee realizing the importance of a thorough investigation of the water question employed the firm of Williamson, Carroll & Saunders of Charlottesville to make necessary surveys, secure samples of water from Maury Creek, present reservoir and Moorman River, to have bacteriological and chemical analyses of same made in order to determine type of filter required to treat our present water supply, and also to take care of proposed Moorman River water supply whenever that project is carried out; and to get up plans and specifications for filter plant. As a further precaution we employed Mr. George W. Fuller of the firm of Fuller & McClintock of New York as consulting engineer, after careful investigation of his ability and reputation as an authority on water questions.

Upon the completion of preliminary surveys by our engineers, and after getting report from the chemists who made the analysis of the samples of water, Mr. Fuller came down and went over the entire situation with Williamson, Carroll, & Saunders, together with Mr. Richard Messer, Chief Engr., State Board of Health, and two members of our committee. After giving the entire situation careful study, Mr. Fuller set out his recommendations as to type, size and location of filter in a letter to my committee, copy of which I am herewith enclosing you.

Upon receipt of Mr. Fuller's letter, I had copy of same made and sent it to Mr. Messer, writing him at the same time, requesting that he go over Mr. Fuller's recommendations carefully and if he felt they would take care of the water situation in Charlottesville to write me to that effect, but if not to advise me what changes he would recommend. I am enclosing copy of my letter to Mr. Messer, also copy of his reply to same.

I did this so as to get approval of the State Board of Health, and I am sending you the enclosed correspondence in order that you may be entirely familiar with all proceedings up to this time.

You will note that Mr. Fuller recommends that the filter plant be located on Observatory Mountain, reasons for same being set forth in his letter of Nov. 11, 1921.

The type of plant recommended by Mr. Fuller will require 3 1/2 acres of land for its construction, and in addition will require right of way for pipe line as shown on map which I am enclosing you.

We understand that the University is contemplating putting up a water tower with necessary pumping facilities in order to get increased pressure in the University area, and that **$15,000.00** has been included in the next budget to cover cost of this improvement.

If the filter plant is built as outlined above, it will make unnecessary your proposed water improvement, as it will give you an adequate supply of pure water by gravity with ample pressure at the highest point on the University grounds, thereby doing away with your proposed pumping plant, which at the very best would be an expensive proposition, and would call for continual outlay for operation and maintenance. Therefore in view of the situation as outlined in this letter, we respectfully request that the city of Charlottesville be given the necessary land, right of way for pipe line and roadways for construction and maintenance of this plant, such privilege to be covered by long term lease with privilege of renewal, and in addition that the **$15,000.00** mentioned above be applied to the cost of construction of filter plant.

In order to prevent repetition of the water situation which existed in Charlottesville during the past summer, the city bodies are very anxious to get filter plant construction started as soon as possible, so it can be completed in the early spring.

I understand that the Board of Visitors of the University will meet on the 29th of November; therefore, urgently request that you lay this matter before them at this meeting and ask them to act on it, advising me at your earliest convenience of their decision. I am confident that you will realize that this matter is one of vital importance both to the University of Va. and to the City of Charlottesville, and sincerely trust that you will approve of the entire plan as outlined and will use your influence to get favorable action from the Board of Visitors.

Mr. Washabaugh, Mr. Williamson and myself went over this entire matter with Dr. Lambeth this morning, and it was his suggestion that I write this letter, which I feel confident will receive his endorsement.

If you or the members of the Board of Visitors would like to have either Mr. Williamson, Mr. Washabaugh or myself appear before you in person to go into this matter more fully we will be glad for you to call on us at any time.
