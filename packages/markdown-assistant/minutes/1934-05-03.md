Mr. Perkins, as Attorney for the University, presented the following preamble and resolution which, upon being moved and seconded, was unanimously adopted:

As sole legatee under the will of Walter M. Seward, deceased, The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia is the owner of certain Manhattan Railway Company Consolidated Mortgage 4% Gold Bonds, aggregating $2,000.00 face value, and due April 1st, 1990, registered in the name of Walter M. Seward.

These bonds were deposited with Central Hanover Bank & Trust Company, 70 Broadway, New York City, and a Certificate of Deposit for said bonds issued in the name of said Walter M. Seward, October 5th, 1932.

In the settlement of the Estate of said Walter M. Seward it is necessary, not only that the bonds be transferred into the name of the University, but that a new Certificate of Deposit be issued in the University's name. Under the plan of deposit said bonds were in negotiable form, and in order that this may be continued it is now proposed that a bond power be executed under which said Manhattan Railway Company bonds may be transferred by the holder thereof if necessary. A proper form of bond power was presented to the meeting, and it was, thereupon, unanimously.

**RESOLVED** that J. L. Newcomb, President of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia be, and is hereby, requested to execute this bond power whereby the bonds aforesaid shall be negotiable in the hands of said Central Hanover Bank and Trust Company, depository under the original agreement of deposit with said Walter M. Seward.

Mr. Perkins, as Attorney for the University, presented the following preamble and resolution which, upon being moved and seconded, was unanimously adopted:

WHEREAS, in the construction of State Highway Route No. 29 northward from Ivy Road, it was proposed to cross the athletic fields lying North and South of the railroad tracks; and

WHEREAS, this would greatly damage LeFevre Field; and whereas in order to get the State Highway Department to run said Route No. 29 further West so that it would not cut into the athletic fields, the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, under date of March 24, 1933, passed the following resolution:

"Mr. Newcomb stated that the State Highway Department in continuing Highway 29, Northward from Ivy Road, desired to connect up same on a direct line with the road West of the Memorial Gymnasium and that in order to do so, it would be necessary to remove the filling station on the North side of said Ivy Road and that the present owner had agreed to remove said filling station provided the University grant him sufficient land on the East side of the proposed Route, abutting on the Ivy Road on which to relocate said filling station;

"It was therefore RESOLVED by the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that they concur in the recommendation of the State Highway Department that a strip of the University's land 30 feet wide on Route No. 39, and running out to nothing at the intersection of the property dedicated for an outlet to the Ivy Road Cottage Company's property, being conveyed by the Legislature of Virginia to Miss Carrie Davis for the use of a filling station. The purpose of this is to enable the State Highway Department to continue Route 29 North on a straight line with its present location just West of the Memorial Gymnasium".

WHEREAS, State Highway Department failed to get the Legislature of Virginia at their last session to pass an act allowing the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia to convey the fee simple title to the property above described; and

WHEREAS, the Legislature will not meet again for two years; and whereas the whole project of Route No. 29 is being held up on account of a right of way from Route No. 39 on the Ivy Road to the C. & O. Railway tracks; and

WHEREAS, the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia are still desirous of having said Route No. 29 located West of their property so that it will not injure their athletic field;

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia do lease to Caroline Preston Davis for the consideration of One Dollar, for a term of ninety-nine (99) years, a tract or parcel of land situated on the Ivy Road at the Western point of the University of Virginia's land on the North side of the Ivy Road 48 feet in width on Route No. 39, and running out to nothing at a point which is the extension of Miss Caroline Preston Davis' rear, or Northern boundary, in an Easterly direction and thirty feet from her Eastern line to the Eastern edge of the intersection of the property supposed to have been dedicated for an outlet to the Ivy Terrace Cottage Company's property, and to concur in a recommendation of the State Highway Department to the Legislature of Virginia, when it meets in 1936, that said parcel of land be conveyed to Miss Caroline Preston Davis in fee simple, and that the Rector is hereby authorized and directed on behalf of the University of Virginia to enter into a contract with Caroline Preston Davis for a ninety-nine (99) year lease for said tract of land, which contract shall have been first approved by the Attorney for the University carrying out and putting into effect the provisions set out above.

Lentz, Superintendent of the University Hospital, for a loan of $11,000 to be secured on first mortgage on the McIntire residence property, situated on Rugby Road, payable $1,000 per year beginning with the sixth year of the loan, with privilege of anticipating any or all of the bonds at any interest period, with interest @ 6% per annum, payable semi-annually, was granted.

Request from Professor A. F. Macconochie for an extension of the time on two of his bonds of $500 each, falling due in June, 1934, in order that he use the money in the building of a garage and servants' quarters at his home at Farmington; said extension to be for one year from date, with the remaining bonds evidencing this loan being extended a like period from their respective maturities, was granted. (This is in lieu of his former request for a loan of $2,000 to be used for the said purpose.)

The following resolution from Governor Pollard, as set forth in his letter of January 10, 1934, in regard to the proposed Private Patient Pavilion at the Hospital, was unanimously adopted:

1. That no request will be made for an appropriation from the State of Virginia for the payment of any expenses incurred in equipping or maintaining the said project, or in providing the funds required for liquidating the indebtedness incurred for the erection or equipment thereof.

2. That such additional fees or charges shall be assessed against the persons or agencies which may be served by the proposed project when completed as may be found necessary to provide sufficient funds for the equipment and maintenance of said project, and for the liquidation of the indebtedness incurred for the erection and equipment thereof, should the income available for this purpose be found inadequate therefor.

3. That all fees, charges and other revenues derived from the operation of the project in excess of annual interest and sinking fund or bond redemption requirements will, upon receipt thereof, be paid into the State Treasury, to the credit of the University of Virginia, for expenditure for the aforesaid purposes.

That all fees, charges and other revenues derived from the project and allocated to the payment of interest and sinking fund or bond redemption requirements thereon, shall, provided the said Federal Emergency Administration of Public Works agrees thereto, be paid into the State Treasury, to the credit of the University of Virginia, for expenditure for the aforesaid purposes.

A letter from Mr. Paul Goodloe McIntire, a former member of the Board, was read by President Newcomb, expressing his gratification at being privileged to serve the University in the capacity of Visitor, and expressing his regret at being forced to decline the offer of Governor Peery to re-appoint him on the Board. President Newcomb was requested to reply to the letter on behalf of the Board.

The President stated that he had been appealed to by the College Topics Board to have a subscription fee made a part of the University's charges against all students. The matter was referred to a Special Committee consisting of Rinehart, L. C. Williams and President Newcomb.

The Special Committee appointed at the last meeting of the Board to prepare suitable resolutions touching the death of Cyrus Harding Walker, presented the following, which was adopted:

Cyrus Harding Walker died at his home at Heathsville, Virginia, on February 23rd, 1934, after serving as a member of the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia for more than sixteen years, during eight years of which long period he was Rector of the University.

He was appointed in 1917 by Governor Westmoreland Davis to fill the vacancy occasioned by the death of Dr. Frank W. Lewis, for the term ending February 28th, 1918 and attended his first meeting on November 27th, 1917.

He was re-appointed February 28th, 1918 for a term of four years ending January 28th, 1922.

He was re-appointed February 28th, 1922 by Governor E. Lee Trinkle for a term of four years ending January 28th, 1926 and was elected Rector of the University on April 6th, 1922.

He was re-appointed February 28th, 1926 by Governor Harry F. Byrd for a term of four years ending February 28th, 1930 and was re-elected Rector of the University on April 27th, 1926.

He was re-appointed February 28th, 1930 by Governor John Garland Pollard for a term of four years ending February 28th, 1934 and would have again been elected Rector had he not declined re-election at the meeting of the Board held on April 3rd, 1930.

At the said meeting on April 3rd, 1930 no less a pen than that of President Alderman himself gave dignified and sincere expression to the affection and regard in which Mr. Walker was held by the Board of Visitors. At that time the committee, composed of Dr. Alderman, Lewis C. Williams and Senator B. F. Buchanan, said this:

"The Rector and Visitors recall that Mr. Walker, an alumnus of the University of Virginia of the year 1882, has been, for thirteen years, a member of the Board of Visitors, and it is a satisfaction to them to know that they will continue to have in their counsels the benefit of his ripe wisdom and wide knowledge of University affairs. It is their special wish to place on their official records a permanent acknowledgment of their obligation to Cyrus Harding Walker for his efficient services as Rector, his unfailing courtesy, his sense of justice, his highminded and unselfish devotion to the interest of the University and his far-seeing vision of the duty and destiny of his Alma Mater".

Mr. Walker was permitted to serve this University nearly four years more after he had been paid this tribute that he richly deserved when he retired as Rector. He was permitted to survive to contribute "his ripe wisdom and wide knowledge of University affairs" to the important decision reached in the election of the present President of the University. He had the happiness to participate in that election and expressed upon that occasion his confidence that the University would continue unabated her fruitful service to Virginia and the nation.

Mr. Walker was a conservative. He had studied and understood the principles upon which the United States of America have progressed to power and prosperity. He believed in these principles not as a shield to protect the privileges of any particular class, but as a sword wherewith to preserve the equal rights of all American citizens. He was a conservative and yet he was a Jeffersonian: he believed in popular rights, but he believed even more in the Constitution that protected all rights. In a word he was an "old fasioned Democrat".

He was educated in private schools under a private tutor before he came to this University and here he not only broadened and ripened his mental powers, but imbibed the spirit and traditions of this place with an affectionate appreciation of all that was fine in them.

Thus prepared and equipped he went forth to a life of usefulness. Not the least of his public services were those he contributed to this University. He was also a member of the General Assembly of Virginia and gave sound and wise counsel in the deliberations of the Convention that framed the Constitution of Virginia of 1902.

Loyal to the lawyer's finest code his interests were broader than his profession. In his immediate community the confidence of his neighbors in his character and capacity called him to leadership again and again. A wise counsellor he did not confine his helpfulness to those who were his immediate clients, but gave freely of his experience, his study, his knowledge and his chastened sanity to the many who asked his advice.

In the best sense of the word Mr. Walker was a "good" man. Deeply religious and profoundly a Christian, he was broadminded in his tolerance of others who differed from him. A man of well developed and firmly held convictions he yet agreed with Thomas Jefferson that the freedom of the mind of every man should be protected. He believed in a popular education that trained men to be trusted, and in a democracy that gave opportunity to all such men to be fairly heard.

On his personal side Mr. Walker cultivated and radiated a genial charm. He possessed a benevolent countenance and the light of kindliness shown in his eyes as he talked with friends in whose sincerity and integrity he confided.

His spirit was gentle; his heart was pure and he lived a full life of good service and died with honor.

In consideration whereof, Be it Resolved that this memorial be spread upon the minutes of this Board, that a copy be sent to Mr. Walker's family and that a copy be published in the newspapers of his home section.
