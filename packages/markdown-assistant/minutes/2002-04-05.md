## TENTATIVE MINUTES SUBJECT TO THE APPROVAL FO THE BOARD OF VISITORS April 5-6, 2002

The Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia met, in Open Session, at 8:30 a.m., Friday, April 5, 2002, in the Board Room of the Rotunda; John P. Ackerly, III, Rector, presided. Thomas J. Bliley, Jr., Charles M. Caravati, Jr., M.D., William G. Crutchfield, Jr., Thomas F. Farrell, II, Charles L. Glazer, Mrs. Elsie Goodwyn Holland, Gordon F. Rainey, Jr., Timothy B. Robertson, Terence P. Ross, Thomas A. Saunders, III, Ms. Elizabeth A. Twohy, Benjamin P.A. Warthen, Joseph E. Wolfe, and Ms. Sasha Lee Wilson were present.

Herbert Timothy Lovelace, Jr., Student Member-elect, also was present.

Present as well were John T. Casteen, III, Leonard W. Sandridge, Alexander G. Gilliam, Jr., Paul J. Forch, Gene D. Block, Ms. Colette Sheehy, Robert D. Sweeney, Ms. Yoke San L. Reynolds, Robert E. Reynolds, M.D., Ms. Patricia M. Lampkin, R. Ariel Gomez, M.D., R. Edward Howell, William W. Harmon, Steven H. Kaplan, and Ms. Jeanne Flippo Bailes.

The Rector, after opening the meeting, called on the President —; as prescribed in the Manual of the Board of Visitors —; to make a nomination for Secretary to the Board, the Secretary's current four year term having expired. The President nominated Mr. Gilliam for re-election to another four year term. The President's motion was seconded and Mr. Gilliam was re-elected.

## RE-ELECTION OF THE SECRETARY TO THE BOARD OF VISITORS

RESOLVED that Mr. Alexander G. Gilliam, Jr., be re-elected as Secretary to the Board of Visitors, for a term of four years, effective March 1, 2002.

The Rector asked the Secretary to read a resolution commending Ms. Sasha L. Wilson, the current Student Member, whose term is to expire at the end of the meeting. The following resolution was moved, seconded and adopted by the Board.

## RESOLUTION OF COMMENDATION FOR SASHA LEE WILSON

WHEREAS, Sasha Lee Wilson, a resident of Albemarle County, was elected the Student Member of the Board of Visitors in 2001 and took office in April of that year; and

WHEREAS, Ms. Wilson, a leader among her peers, has distinguished herself in the classroom and on the playing field and will take a joint B.A./M.T. in May; and

WHEREAS, Ms. Wilson has distinguished herself as well as the Student Member; and

WHEREAS, Ms. Wilson's term on the Board of Visitors will end at the close of the Board meeting on April 6th;

RESOLVED that the Board of Visitors thanks Sasha Lee Wilson for her service and devotion to the Board and to the University, congratulates her on her forthcoming marriage in May, and wishes her well as she embarks on her teaching career.

The Rector next entertained a resolution to add an item to the Docket, as required in Section 2.37 of the Manual of the Board of Visitors. The item, the approval of a memorial plaque, is to be considered by the Buildings and Grounds Committee. (Consideration of the resolution permitted by this resolution was withdrawn at the request of the Chair of the Buildings and Grounds Committee —; see the Minutes of the meeting of the Buildings and Grounds Committee held on April 5, 2002.)

The Rector introduced Mr. Herbert Timothy Lovelace, Jr., of Roanoke, the Student Member-elect, whose term began at the conclusion of the Board meeting.

The President then gave his customary report. Much of it was given over to an account of the State's budgetary problems and their effect on the University. The President reported, too, on the 2020 initiatives and how they are being affected by the budgetary shortfalls, even though the 2020 initiatives assume "mixed funding," which is to say a mixture of public and private support.

Mr. Ross suggested that the Board have periodic, regularly scheduled, discussions of the 2020 initiatives.

Finally, the President announced a $52.6 million bequest, the second largest gift ever made to the University. The bequest was made by the late Ward Buchanan, Law '14, who died in 1942. It comes from a trust that was set up to benefit the University after the last of a list of heirs died. The bequest will create an unrestricted endowment fund for the Medical Center and initially will produce $2.5 million a year, though the amount is expected to increase as the endowment's assets increase.

The Board recessed at 9:10 a.m. for Committee meetings.

The Board resumed in Open Session at 1:30 p.m., meeting as the full Board. All Members present in the morning were present with the addition of Mr. Goodwin and Mr. Robertson.

After adopting the following motions, the Board went into Executive Session at 1:35 p.m.

That the Finance Committee of the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia go into Executive Session to discuss the investment of funds in the University of Virginia Real Estate Foundation for costs related to the Blue Ridge Hospital property, where discussion in an open session could adversely affect the financial interest and the negotiating strategy of the University, as provided for in Section 2.2-3711 (A) (3) and (6) of the Code of Virginia.

That the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia go into Executive Session to discuss preparations and plans to protect public safety as it relates to terrorist activity, as provided for in Section 2.2-3711 (A) (20) of the Code of Virginia.

Executive Order Number One (2002)

By virtue of the authority vested in me as Governor, I hereby declare that it is the firm and unwavering policy of the Commonwealth of Virginia to assure equal opportunity in all facets of state government.

This policy specifically prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, sex, color, national origin, religion, age, or political affiliation, or against otherwise qualified persons with disabilities.

State appointing authorities and other management principals are hereby directed to take affirmative measures, as determined by the Director of the Department of Human Resource Management, to emphasize the recruitment of qualified minorities, women, disabled persons, and older Virginians to serve at all levels of state government. This directive does not permit or require the lowering of bona fide job requirements, performance standards, or qualifications to give preference to any state employee or applicant for state employment.

Allegations of violations of this policy shall be brought to the attention of the Office of Equal Employment Services of the Department of Human Resource Management. No state appointing authority, other management principals, or supervisors shall take retaliatory actions against persons making such allegations.

Any state employee found in violation of this policy shall be subject to appropriate disciplinary action.

The Secretary of Administration is directed to review annually state procurement, employment, and other relevant policies for compliance with the non-discrimination mandate contained herein, and shall report to the Governor his findings together with such recommendations as he deems appropriate. The Director of the Department of Human Resource Management shall assist in this review.

This Executive Order supersedes and rescinds Executive Order Number Two (98), Equal Opportunity, issued by Governor James S. Gilmore, III, on January 17, 1998.
