## ADMINISTRATIVE/PROFESSIONAL FACULTY COMPENSATION AND PERSONNEL ADMINISTRATION PLAN January 1, 1989

In June of 1986 Governor Baliles formed the Decentralization Steering Committee to oversee a Higher Education Decentralization Study. The study was in response to a request from the college and university presidents to identify administrative functions where authority and responsibility could be appropriately delegated to the institutions. The Steering Committee established several task forces and charged them with making recommendations.

The Personnel Decentralization Task Force observed that definitions found in the Governor's Consolidated Salary Authorization Plan specified by job title the types of positions which may be designated as teaching, research and administrative. The institutions' Boards of Visitors have full authority to appoint faculty, however, there are restrictions on their appointments of individuals to administrative and professional positions. The Task Force recommended that the Governor's Consolidated Salary Authorization be amended to provide for two distinct categories of faculty. These changes would permit each institution latitude to designate the number and types of positions which can be assigned administrative/professional status.

The conflict between colleges and universities and the Commonwealth's Department of Personnel and Training is partially attributable to state governments view of these positions. The traditional view is that these positions should be directly and literally associated with academic or student personnel activities. This places a more narrow definition on them than is either realistic or necessary. In reality, virtually all administrative and professional personnel work in an academic environment. They constitute a unique and separate employment market in which the institution must compete. They are all associated either directly or indirectly with an academic enterprise.

The Task Force's recommendation was to create a new category of positions entitled "Administrative and Professional Faculty". The definitions and qualification criteria are listed below:

* Administrative faculty require the performance of work directly related to the management of the educational and general activities of the institution, department or subdivision thereof. Incumbents in these positions exercise discretion and independent judgment and generally direct the work of others.

* Professional faculty require advanced learning and experience acquired by prolonged formal instruction and/or specialized work experience. This category is normally limited to librarians, counselors, coaches, lawyers, physicians, dentists, veterinarians and other professional positions serving education, research, athletic, medical, student affairs, and development functions or activities.

* A position description will be required for each current and proposed Administrative/Professional faculty position. The position description should include an organization chart indicating the position's level in relationship to the President as well as subordinate positions and job titles. The position descriptions will be maintained in the Department of Personnel Administration.

* A written performance evaluation will be required at least annually of an individual holding an Administrative/Professional position. A copy of the performance evaluation will be provided to the individual and a copy should be maintained in the individual's personnel folder. The respective vice presidents are responsible for ensuring these evaluations are processed in a timely manner.

* Salary increases will be awarded to Administrative/Professional faculty based upon the objective analysis of the performance of each individual as reflected on the written performance evaluation.

* Job titles shall be consistent and descriptive of the job duties for each Administrative/Professional faculty position.

* Compensation Guidelines for Administrative/Professional faculty will be determined by comparing compensation paid for similar positions at peer institutions. On an annual basis compensation data will be collected from the College and University Personnel Associations Administrative Compensation Survey on institutions that are members of the American Association of University's (AAU) and other appropriate comparators. Other special studies may be conducted as necessary.

* The University will adhere to the requirement in the Consolidated Salary Authorization which limits the salary average for 11/12 month Administrative and Professional faculty to an amount which does not exceed the salary average for 9/10 month teaching and Research faculty by more than 35%.

* The administrative responsibility for the Administrative/Professional Personnel Administration and Compensation Plan is assigned to the Assistant Vice President for Personnel Administration.

The name of this Council is "The Advisory Council of Clinch Valley College."

The Advisory Council of Clinch Valley College is composed of 17 persons: twelve to be appointed by the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia upon recommendation of the President of the University; two members of the Board of Visitors appointed by the Rector; the President of the Clinch Valley College Alumni Association or its designee; and the Rector and the President of the University who shall serve as ex-officio members. At least eight members shall be residents of the Commonwealth of Virginia and at least four shall be alumni of Clinch Valley College. Members of the faculty or other current employees of Clinch Valley College shall not be eligible for membership on the Council.

The Advisory Council may, by majority vote, select non-voting advisors it deems necessary for effective conduct of its work. The President of the Student Government Association, the Chairman of the Faculty, and a staff representative shall normally be advisors. The Chancellor shall serve as an advisor to the Council. Advisors shall have seat and voice, but not vote, in the meetings and may be excluded from executive sessions.

Members shall be appointed to serve terms of four years and shall be eligible for two successive four-year appointments. Terms shall be staggered to provide continuity, three members being appointed each year by the Board of Visitors. Of those serving at the time of the adoption of these bylaws, three shall be selected by a random drawing for a one-year term, three for a two-year term, three for a three-year term and three for a four-year term. The Board of Visitors may make appointments of fewer than four-year terms to fill unexpired vacancies.

Terms shall be defined to be the fiscal year of the college, July 1 - June 30.

The purpose of the Advisory Council of Clinch Valley College is to promote the sound development of the institution in accordance with the functions which have been prescribed for it. The Advisory Council of Clinch Valley College serves in an advisory capacity to the Board of Visitors on matters pertaining to Clinch Valley College and also serves as advisor to the Chancellor of Clinch Valley College and to the President of the University of Virginia concerning the management and development of Clinch Valley College. In addition to these general responsibilities, the Advisory Council is responsible for the appropriate accomplishment of tasks as assigned by the Board of Visitors.

At the last regular meeting of each year, the Advisory Council shall elect a Chairman and a Vice Chairman. The Chairman shall call all meetings of the Council and shall be the presiding officer. The chairman shall have such powers and duties as may be assigned to him from time to time by the Board of Visitors. It shall be the responsibility of the Chairman to inform the Board of Visitors on all matters concerning the activities of the Council. The Vice-Chairman shall serve in the absence of the Chairman.

Annually, the Advisory Council, upon recommendation of the Chancellor of Clinch Valley College, shall elect a secretary. The secretary shall attend all meetings and record minutes of all proceedings. The secretary shall have those duties or responsibilities which are usual to the duties of a secretary and shall assist the Advisory Council in the discharge of its duties. The secretary, under the immediate direction of the Chancellor of Clinch Valley College, shall perform such other duties as may be assigned by the Chairman of the Council. The Office of the Chancellor of Clinch Valley College shall provide clerical and other similar services for the Secretary and shall provide for such expenses as the Secretary may incur in performance of duties.

At the last regular meeting of each year, the Advisory Council shall elect two of its voting members to serve with the Chairman and the Vice-Chairman as the Executive Committee. The Executive Committee shall meet upon the call of the Chairman and in the interim between meetings of the Council be vested with the powers and duties of the full Advisory Council. All such actions taken by the Executive Committee in the interim between meetings of the Advisory Council shall be reported to the full Advisory Council at the next annual or regular meeting and shall, if confirmation is required, be confirmed and approved by the Advisory Council at that time.

The Advisory Council may establish and charge such committees as may be necessary, proper, or convenient to carry out its responsibilities.

Meetings shall be of three kinds: the annual meeting, regular meetings, and special meetings.

The Advisory Council shall hold one annual meeting in each fiscal year on the campus of Clinch Valley College at a time to be determined by the Executive Committee. At the annual meeting the Advisory Council shall receive a report from the Chancellor of Clinch Valley College on the state of the college and review and decide on such other matters as may come before it.

There shall be such regular meetings as the Advisory Council may determine. The Executive Committee shall determine the time, date, and place of such meetings.

Special meetings may be called by the Chairman or upon the request of five voting members.

A quorum for the conduct of business shall consist of five voting members.

Notice of the annual meeting and all regular meetings of the Advisory Council shall be given at least ten days in advance of the meeting. Notice of all special meetings shall be given at least five days in advance of such special meeting unless waived in writing by each member of the Advisory Council. Notice of meetings shall be provided by mail at the direction of the Chairman by the Secretary.

Changes in these by-laws may be recommended to the Board of Visitors by a vote of a majority of the members in attendance at an annual or regular meeting.

(Approved by the Advisory Council, October 21, 1988.)

### ATTACHMENT C = Changes in TIAA Life Insurance & Disability Programs and Accidental Death and Dismemberment Program

## TIAA DISABILITY PROGRAM

### INCLUSION OF SUMMER INCOME IN DETERMINING BASE SALARY FOR TIAA DISABILITY

### TIAA LIFE INSURANCE FOR RETIREES

### ELIGIBILITY FOR RETIREE TIAA LIFE INSURANCE

### ACCIDENTAL DEATH AND DISMEMBERMENT PROGRAM

The University offers its faculty a long term disability plan that provides, in the event of disability, salary continuation of 60% of an individual's salary up to a maximum of $3,000 per month. The Faculty Benefits Committee recommends that the percentage of salary be increased from 60% to 66-2/3% and the monthly cap be raised from $3,000 to $6,000. This program enhancement will be more reflective of the salary structure at the University and will ensure income continuation at a reasonable level for disabled faculty. The increased premium cost is approximately $.30 per $100 of benefits which is an increase of $4,200 per month of additional premium. We concur with the Committee's proposal and recommend the changes become effective January 1, 1989.

The Faculty Benefits Committee further proposes that 9-month faculty should be insured for summer income that is paid through the University payroll system exclusive of overload payments. Payroll statistics indicate that approximately 57% of the 9-month faculty earn summer income. They proposed that the median salary of the last three summers serve as the formula for determining summer income. Summer salaries are not included in determining base salary at this time since the costs associated with modifying the TIAA retirement formulas to comply with the requirements of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 are as yet undetermined.

The University currently provides faculty retirees a $2,000 death benefit under the TIAA Life Insurance Program. Survey data and discussions with the University's benefit consultants indicate that conventional burial expenses exceed $2,000. The Faculty Benefits Committee proposes an increase to $8,000.

There are approximately 150 retirees with TIAA Life Insurance and the $8,000 death benefit level would increase our premium cost approximately $2,150 per month. Over the years, our claims experience has been very good, which has resulted in reduced premium rates. The proposed $8,000 death benefit, however, is "sum certain" and will be reflected in our future claims experience and, in turn, will impact our premiums.

Because the costs associated with modifying the TIAA retirement formulas, as mentioned earlier, are not yet finalized, it is proposed that the death benefit be increased to $5,000 rather than the proposed $8,000. This change would increase our premiums by $1,000 per month. This change should become effective April 1, 1989.

Historically, faculty retirees have been eligible for the death benefit provision of the TIAA life insurance program if they were age 65 and had at least ten years of service.

The Faculty Benefits Committee believes this eligibility criteria is overly restrictive and punitive toward faculty younger than age 65 but with several years of service, i.e., age 63 and 25 years of service. We concur with their conclusion, and we support their proposal to establish eligibility to be "at least age 55 and five or more years of service if the sum of the age and service is 70 or greater." We recommend this become effective April 1, 1989.

For several years the University has offered faculty an option to participate in an Accidental Death and Dismemberment Plan. The insurance is available in increments of $5,000 from a minimum of $25,000 to a maximum of $200,000. The University contributes a portion of the premium costs ($1,000 per month) for the approximately 780 participants.

The Faculty Benefits Committee recommends that the program be continued because of its popularity but that the University's contribution be discontinued. We concur with the Committee's proposal and recommend that the University's contribution be discontinued effective April 1, 1989.
