The Rector having called the Board to order at 10:30 o'clock, the newly appointed member, (to fill vacancy caused by resignation of Dr. W. M. Randolph), Mr. George R. B. Michie, appeared, and being duly qualified, was accordingly recognized as a member of this Board.

### Report of Committee on Entrance Building

At a meeting of the Committee on Entrance Building at 8:00 P.M., May 9th, 1913, there were present Messrs. Lambeth, Michie, Newcomb, Smith, Forrest. The following was moved by Mr. Newcomb, seconded and carried:

Resolved that it be the sense of this Committee that the contract for the construction of the Entrance Building for the University be and is herewith awarded to Vandegrift and Fitch, the lowest competitive bidders, subject to the approval by the Rector and Visitors of the University of our resolution asking for $5,000.00 increased loan.

The following was presented by Mr. Forrest and moved and seconded by Mr. Smith and Mr. Michie, and adopted for presentation at next meeting of the Board, together with the preceding resolution for their information:

To the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia.

Your Committee on Improvements at the University entrance beg to report that in harmony with your instructions they secured bids on completed plans and specifications for the building approved by you at your meeting February 10, 1913.

The lowest bid, even after making all such changes in the plans as can reduce the cost without injuring the building in appearance, structure or rent-yielding power, shows that the building alone, with the architect's fees, will cost nearly $20,000.00. Your provision for the building being only $15,000.00, it has impossible to sign the contract and proceed with the work.

We therefore ask that you provide a further sum of $5,000.00 making a total of $25,000. for the building and outside improvements, interest upon which at the rate of six per cent per year shall be deducted by the Bursar from the gross revenues of the building paid into his hands. In our judgement the rents will easily care for this annual charge of $1,500.00 and leave a handsome surplus. We also believe it would be a mistake to reduce the size of the building, and that if reduced it would not carry an interest charge of $1,200.00 as safely as the proposed building will carry, $1,500.00.

### The following letter to the President from Prof. Albert H. Tuttle, was presented by Dean Page:

As you are already aware, I have recently sent to the Trustees of the Carnegie Foundation a formal application for retirement, feeling that after forty years of full professional work and twenty-five years of active service at this University, the time has come when it is wise for me to take advantage of the provisions of the Foundation.

This application still awaits the action of the Board of Trustees at their forthcoming meeting, at which time I hope and expect that it will meet with their approval. Pending their action, however, I feel it my duty to advise the Rector and Visitors of the step that I have taken, and of my wish, subject to this contingency, to retire from active service on September 15th next. I therefore request that these facts be laid before them.

I should like also to ask of the Rector and Visitors of the University that, in case of my retirement at the time indicated, I be permitted for the present to occupy the house I am now living in on the same terms as heretofore, viz., a rental at $25.00 a month. Hoping for favorable action on their part, I remain.

### Resolved:

(1) That contingent upon his being admitted to the benefits of the "Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching," at the next meeting of the Executive Committee of said Foundation, the resignation of Professor Albert Henry Tuttle as Miller Professor of Biology and Agriculture in the University of Virginia, be accepted to take effect September 15, 1913.

(2) Resolved, secondly, that in case of Professor Tuttle's retirement at the time indicated, he shall be permitted for the present to occupy the house he is now living in, on the same terms as heretofore, namely, a rental of $25.00 per month.

(3) Resolved: That Mr. R. E. Beard, who withdrew from the University, November 21, 1913, in order to accept a position as teacher in Norfolk Academy, be and he is hereby relieved from the payment of all fees for the second and third terms of this session, as a student in the University.

(4) Resolved: That the appreciative thanks of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia be extended to Mrs. Martha Jefferson T. Burke for the gift of the Bible formerly in the possession of George Wythe, and by him given to Thomas Jefferson; and also for the gift of the two copies of the New Testament from which Thomas Jefferson clipped the portions used by him in preparing his compilation known as "The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth."

(5) Resolved: That the Rector and Visitors of the University accept with thanks a membership for the University of Virginia in the "Monticello Graveyard Association," and hereby elect the President of the University as such member.

(6) Resolved: That the Rector and Visitors agree to contribute annually to said graveyard association, such sum as shall be agreed upon by the officers of said association, and the said President of the University.

The Peoples National Bank, through its cashier, Mr. W. W. Waddell, made application to this Board for a part of the University bank account, whereupon the following was adopted:

(7) Resolved: That the deposits of this University be divided approximately equally between the Jefferson National Bank and the Peoples National Bank, upon the same terms and conditions as those now in force with the present University depository.

(8) Resolved: That a residence be erected for the use of the Dean of the University at a cost not to exceed $10,000.00, upon some suitable location upon the University Grounds, that amount of the funds of the University now invested in low rate of interest bearing securities, or funds now uninvested to be invested in said residence. The details of said erection to be left to the Grounds and Building Committee, and the Finance Committee of this Board is directed to provide the necessary funds.

Whereas, it was necessary to reduce the size of certain rooms in the Dawson's Row dormitories, in order to provide a closet for each house, one room in each of the following houses being reduced thereby; viz:, A, B, C, E, & F; and

Whereas, these changes were made without the knowledge of certain of the boys now occupying said rooms, said boys having signed up for these rooms without knowledge of the proposed changes, therefore be it

(9) Resolved, That the Bursar is authorized to refund to each such boy the sum of $5.00 for the session of 1912-1913; but the rental of said rooms for subsequent sessions shall be the same as for other rooms in said buildings.

(10) Resolved: That Miss Julia Tutwiler's request to be allowed to have a plaster cast made of the bust of her father in the University Library, be granted, subject to the condition that the cast is made by a person approved by the artist Valentine, and that all due precautions be taken not to injure the bust.

Whereas, it has been stated to this Board that there stands on the books of the University a debit balance against the late Jas. B. Green, in the amount of $415.77, and

Whereas, it has come to the knowledge of this Board that said Jas. B. Green died, leaving no estate, therefore be it

(11) Resolved: That the said sum be charged off the books to Surplus Account, and the Bursar is hereby authorized to make the necessary entries.

(12) Resolved: That Mrs. Clara T. Green be granted the privilege of renting the cottage now occupied by her, for another year, from July 1, 1913 to July 1, 1914 at the same rental.

(13) Resolved: That the request of Mr. I. K. Moran for reimbursement to amount of $71.50, on account of installation of certain permanent fixtures in the house occupied by him, be and is hereby granted.

(14) Resolved: That a sum not to exceed $50.00 be and is hereby appropriated to reimburse Dr. J. M. Page for expenses incurred by him in attendance upon a convention of the Phi Beta Kappa in New York City.

Mr. Craddock, Chairman of the Finance Committee, brought to the attention of the Board the several requests from fraternities for loans in order to erect Chapter Houses on the property of the University, and stated that at a meeting of the Committee recently held in Richmond, it was decided that no more loans for this purpose could be made at this time, and offered the following, being adopted:

(15) Resolved: That the condition of the funds will not justify further loans for fraternity houses for the present, and that the applicants be informed of this resolution.

Dr. Page brought to the attention of the Board the fact that certain of the students, occupying University dormitories, who had received their rooms at a reduced price by reason of boarding at the "Commons," had failed to attend the "Commons" for the whole time. Messrs. Aiken and Jett representing those students who had left the "Commons" appeared before the Board asking that the said students be released from any further obligation to the University for that portion of the room rent due on account of not so boarding, their contention being based on poor quality of food. Prof. Lile, who had been requested by the Dean to give his opinion in the matter, sent to the Board an opinion in the matter, setting forth that the said students were liable for the balance of the room rent. After a general discussion of the matter the following resolution was unanimously adopted:

(16) Resolved: That no deduction be made from the rent of rooms occupied by members of the "Commons" who left during the session.

### The following report of the Building Committee was presented:

I. We recommend that the sites on Carr's Hill for fraternity houses, be at present restricted to four, and that the northernmost site be located on a line passing through the centre of the president's residence and the centre of the president's stable, and at least as far distant from the president's house as is the location of the "Delta Tau Delta" house.

II. We further recommend that no trees be cut without permission of a Committee appointed to accurately locate these sites.

III. That the earth from the excavations for these fraternity buildings be deposited in the new road under the direction of the Superintendent of Grounds.

Prof. Newcomb who is planning the plants for the sewage purification, as directed by the State Board of Health, indicates that we will have to acquire land to furnish a sufficient fall to carry off the effluent from the filter beds.

It is therefore recommended that the Board appoint a Committee to secure options on property that seems to be required, or take condemnation proceedings, if necessary.

### At the annual meeting of the Board of Visitors, called for the consideration of the Financial Budget for 1913-1914.

Present: The Rector, Visitors Craddock, Flood, Norton, White, Irvine, Drewry, Michie, Oliver, State Superintendent Stearnes, and Acting President, Dean James M. Page.

The Rector having called the Board to order at 10:30 o'clock, the newly appointed member, (to fill vacancy caused by resignation of Dr. W. M. Randolph), Mr. George R. B. Michie, appeared, and being duly qualified, was accordingly recognized as a member of this Board.

### Report of Committee on Entrance Building

At a meeting of the Committee on Entrance Building at 8:00 P.M., May 9th, 1913, there were present Messrs. Lambeth, Michie, Newcomb, Smith, Forrest. The following was moved by Mr. Newcomb, seconded and carried:

Resolved that it be the sense of this Committee that the contract for the construction of the Entrance Building for the University be and is herewith awarded to Vandegrift and Fitch, the lowest competitive bidders, subject to the approval by the Rector and Visitors of the University of our resolution asking for $5,000.00 increased loan.

The following was presented by Mr. Forrest and moved and seconded by Mr. Smith and Mr. Michie, and adopted for presentation at next meeting of the Board, together with the preceding resolution for their information:

To the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia.

Your Committee on Improvements at the University entrance beg to report that in harmony with your instructions they secured bids on completed plans and specifications for the building approved by you at your meeting February 10, 1913.

The lowest bid, even after making all such changes in the plans as can reduce the cost without injuring the building in appearance, structure or rent-yielding power, shows that the building alone, with the architect's fees, will cost nearly $20,000.00. Your provision for the building being only $15,000.00, it has impossible to sign the contract and proceed with the work.

We therefore ask that you provide a further sum of $5,000.00 making a total of $25,000. for the building and outside improvements, interest upon which at the rate of six per cent per year shall be deducted by the Bursar from the gross revenues of the building paid into his hands. In our judgement the rents will easily care for this annual charge of $1,500.00 and leave a handsome surplus. We also believe it would be a mistake to reduce the size of the building, and that if reduced it would not carry an interest charge of $1,200.00 as safely as the proposed building will carry, $1,500.00.
