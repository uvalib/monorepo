**On motion, the Board adopted the following resolution:**

**THE WHITE BURKETT MILLER CENTER OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS GOVERNING COUNCIL APPOINTMENTS**

**WHEREAS, the White Burkett Miller Center of Public Affairs (the Miller Center) is a unit of the University and its Governing Council has certain responsibilities concerning the Center; and**

**WHEREAS, since the Miller Center's founding in 1975, its Governing Council has operated under Bylaws approved by the Board of Visitors, which stipulate that the Board of Visitors will elect members of the Governing Council on nomination by the Council; and**

**WHEREAS, the Governing Council has nominated by unanimous vote the following four individuals for election to the Council:**

**Terrence D. Daniels, Partner with Quad-C Management, Inc., a private equity firm based in Charlottesville, Virginia,** **since its formation in November 1989. Prior to founding Quad-C, he served as a Vice Chairman and Director of W.R. Grace & Co. Mr. Daniels also served as Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Western Publishing, and as Senior Vice President for corporate development of Mattel. He holds a B.A. degree from the University of Virginia and an M.B.A. from the Colgate Darden School, University of Virginia.**

**Judith Richards Hope, Distinguished Visitor from Practice and Professor of Law at Georgetown University Law Center.

**RESOLVED, the Board of Visitors elects Terrence D. Daniels, Judith Richards Hope, Daniel P. Jordan, and Jeffrey C. Walker to the Governing Council of the White Burkett Miller Center of Public Affairs for a term of three years, with the possibility of re-election to a second three-year term.**

**Comments by the Rector**

**The Rector reminded Board Members that the Association of Governing Boards annual meeting on trusteeship is the first week in April. Board Members interested in attending should contact Susan Harris.**

**The Rector mentioned a celebration for Leonard Sandridge scheduled for April 4 at the John Paul Jones Arena, and the inauguration on April 15. He said Board Members should try to attend the inauguration ceremony and the Board dinner the evening before. The President reminded the Board that there is a reception for Dr. Garson on April 29.**

**The Rector asked Board Members to attend the alumni panel discussion set for the following day at 3:45 p.m. in the Dome Room.**

**President’s Report**

**The Rector asked the President to report.**

**Higher Education Commission and Top Jobs Legislation**

**The President reminded Board Members that in advance of the meeting they received a report on productivity measures, sent by the Rector and Vice Rector. She said the report uses detailed data analysis to review the University’s productivity performance as compared to peers. Productivity is relevant to the Top Jobs legislation under consideration in the General Assembly because increasing the productivity of Virginia’s colleges and universities is one of the underlying purposes of the Governor’s Commission on Higher Education and the legislation.**

**The President said last summer Governor McDonnell appointed a Commission on Higher Education and charged it with finding ways to generate more degrees for Virginians — specifically, to generate an additional 100,000 undergraduate degrees over the next 15 years. She said the University has close connections to the Commission: former Rector Tom Farrell is chairman, and former Rector Heywood Fralin and current Rector Dubby Wynne are members.**

**Earlier in the winter, the Commission produced a set of recommendations that became the foundation for the Governor’s Top Jobs legislation. The recommendations include boosting the number of graduates with degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (the so-called STEM disciplines) and creating new options for expedited degree attainment, among other priorities. The Governor included $50M for higher education in the budget bill to support the Top Jobs legislation.**

**The President noted that the Commission’s recommendations align well with priorities identified by the Virginia Business Higher Education Council’s Grow By Degrees campaign, which has broad bipartisan support. She said the University is pursuing several initiatives that align with the Commission’s recommendations and the priorities in the Top Jobs legislation. They include:**

*   **increasing enrollment of students in the STEM fields;**
*   **offering programs for accelerated bachelor’s degree completion in three years, with an option for a master’s degree in a fourth year (3+1);**
*   **increasing use of facilities year-round, especially during summer and January terms;**
*   **boosting enrollment of adult students in Richmond, Southside, and Southwest Virginia; and**
*   **increasing investments in technology-enhanced education to help us reach greater numbers of students beyond Charlottesville.** 

**She said the state budget is not final yet. The session adjourns on Saturday, February 26, and the Governor then has 30 days to amend, approve, or veto bills enacted during the session. The reconvened session is scheduled for April 6. Therefore, the legislation is a work-in-progress. The University is fortunate that the Governor and the General Assembly are committed to investing in higher education this year.**

**The President said the Top Jobs legislation proposes creation of a Higher Education Advisory Committee to develop performance criteria for incentives, base funding policies, economic opportunity metrics for degree programs, and other policies. The Senate has proposed that the Advisory Committee include 10 members: 5 from administration and money committees, and 5 presidents (2 from doctoral institutions, 2 from comprehensive institutions, and 1 from the community colleges).**

**One of the fundamental goals of the Commission and the Top Jobs legislation is to make Virginia’s colleges and universities more efficient and productive. The President said we should acknowledge that the University is already a national model of efficiency, and asked the Board to consider some of the metrics: for over 20 years, _U.S. News and World Report_ has ranked the University among the top 25 institutions in the country. In each of these 20 years, the University also has been the most efficient among the top 25 public and private institutions as measured by what it costs to produce a graduate.**

**Consistently ranking high in _Kiplinger’s Personal Finance_ magazine’s “**[**100 Best Values in Public Colleges**](http://www.kiplinger.com/money/collegevalues)**,” this year the University ranked number 3 in the nation for the fifth time in six years.  For three years running, the _Princeton Review_ has named the University the number 1 best value among public colleges and universities. Also, in October 2010, the American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research examined the question, “Is College Worth the Investment?” The study analyzed the return on investment (ROI) from a college degree by school selectivity. The University had an ROI of 14% — a level not exceeded by any other public or private institution at any selectivity level.** 

**The President said while we work to find new and better ways to teach students and operate the University, we know that we are starting from a solid foundation of proven performance. Strong fiscal leadership in recent decades has enabled the University to achieve this level of efficiency. At the same time, as noted in the productivity report, we want to remain focused on continuous improvement.**

**The President asked the Rector for his comments. The Rector said it sounds as though we are tooting our own horn, and we are. Very few people know the metrics on cost and value. The state is getting a great deal out of the University, however, higher education has not done a good job in making its case. We are fortunate that the Governor and the legislature are both dedicated to enhancing higher education, and we have the building blocks to be partners rather than adversaries. The Rector mentioned an article from Wisconsin suggesting the Top Jobs legislation superseded restructuring, which it does not do. He said the Advisory Committee’s work will be important. He pointed out that there is nothing in the legislation about tuition caps or in-state/out-of-state ratios. If the state wants excellence, they must understand what it takes to maintain a flagship institution, which the University is for Virginia.**

**Mr. Fralin commented that the Governor feels he has gone overboard to fund higher education, and in exchange he expects institutions to reform and make innovations to make higher education more accessible.**

**In answer to a question, the Rector said there were no rules about tuition increases, but there should be no surprises for the Governor and the General Assembly.**

**The President said it is important to remember that the University is getting less in appropriations than last year because the stimulus money is gone. The Governor’s $50 million will be distributed and it is not known how much the University will receive, however, there is no scenario that will give the University the funding it received last year.**

**The Rector added that we would not allow the faculty/student ratio to change as a result of increased enrollment. Mr. Sandridge said we hoped to improve the ratio.**

**General Assembly Updates – Retirement Programs and the Rotunda**

**The President provided brief updates on two critical issues that are in play in the General Assembly: retirement funding for employees, and the Rotunda.**

**The Governor’s budget included actions that would have cut the compensation package for employees by: 1) requiring those who participate in the Virginia Retirement System (VRS) to contribute a 5% employee share of contributions for their defined-benefit programs; and, 2) reducing the employer contribution for those who participate in optional-retirement plans (ORP) from 10.4% to 8.5%. This was the Governor’s proposal to help shore up the VRS, which is under-funded by $17.6 billion.**

**She said she is concerned about any action that would amount to salary cuts for employees who have had no base salary increases for three years. The ability to offer competitive compensation is critical to retaining and recruiting outstanding faculty and staff.**

**She said the good news is that both the House and the Senate want to amend the Governor’s recommendation, although they have suggested two different ways to do so. The House reversed the Governor’s proposal and made no changes to the ORP plan, and made the change in VRS funding-neutral for the employee by offsetting the 5% contribution with a 5% salary increase. The Senate reversed the Governor’s proposal and made no changes to either the VRS or ORP plans.**

**The President said the University would like to help the state with this problem. She convened two faculty groups to discuss issues related to retirement funding and to brainstorm ideas for solutions, including how the state might switch from a defined-benefit retirement plan to a defined-contribution plan. The goal is to develop constructive advice for solutions for the Governor and the General Assembly.**

**The second topic was Rotunda repairs. The University proposed a budget amendment for funds to support the needed repairs. This is a five-year project with a total cost of $50.6 million. The University asked for $26.8 million from the General Fund, with the remainder to be covered with private gifts. The 2011-12 General Fund request was $2.59 million, which will be used for the roof repair. Both the House and Senate included the Rotunda in the capital plan. The Senate budget proposes to allocate the full amount requested.**

**Mr. Diamonstein spoke about legislation to create an Inspector General position. The legislation has been amended to allow the University to maintain its internal audit function, however, the legislation does allow the Inspector General to investigate all aspects of management of state agencies including the University. He said this broad power could be inviting difficulties outside of the legitimate areas of fraud and waste. The Inspector General will have the power of subpoena. The Rector said there is an assumption of good will, but there is the opportunity for mischief because there are no standards for reviewing any and all records of the University.**

**Gifts and Grants Report**

**Current Fiscal Year through January 31, 2011**

**The President said philanthropic giving to the University of Virginia and its related foundations is $139,708,398.10 for the fiscal year through January 31, 2011. This is an increase of $6,325,995.01, or 4.74% above the results of the previous fiscal year.**

**Gifts to the College and Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, McIntire School of Commerce, Curry School of Education, Center for Politics, Darden School, Law School, and Historic Preservation saw significant increases over last year.**
