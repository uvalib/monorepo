Mr. Perkins then stated to the Board that under the will of William Alexander, of New York City, a bequest had been made to the University of Virginia of a one-sixth interest in remainder of the whole residue of Mr. Alexander's estate, after the death of the daughter of the testator, Mrs. Francis Alexander Wellman.

Mr. Alexander's will was recently admitted to probate in the Surrogate's Court of the County of New York, and in the settlement of the estate we have been advised that Miss Miriam Sachs, a former Secretary of Mr. Alexander had made a claim against the estate of **$58,677.35**, based upon an alleged agreement which she claimed Mr. Alexander had made with her in the year 1927 to make adequate provisions so that her income of approximately **$4,200.00** per year would be maintained during her life, the figure of **$58,677.35** being arrived at upon the basis of Miss Sachs' expectancy.

We have been further advised by Messrs. Alexander & Keenen, representing the Executors of Mr. Alexander's estate, that an agreement has been reached with Miss Sachs whereby she will accept the sum of **$6,500.00** in full compromise of all claims she may have against Mr. Alexander's estate and the compromise agreement has been presented to us for execution by the University. We are advised that Hampden-Sydney College, one of the other residuary legatees under Mr. Alexander's will, has already executed this same form of consent to settlement and the Endowment Fund of the Century Association, the third devisee, has assured the Attorneys that it will also consent thereto. The form of consent which we are requested to sign is presented herewith, and it is suggested that a copy of this form be filed with the minutes of this meeting. This consent reads as follows:

(Here Mr. Perkins read the consent.)

It was, thereupon,

RESOLVED that Mr. Fred. W. Scott, the Rector, be and is hereby requested and authorized to sign this form of consent in the name and on behalf of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, and E. I. Carruthers, Secretary of this Board, is hereby authorized to affix the corporate seal thereto and attest the same.

Mr. Perkins presented to the Board a proposed agreement between the University and The Hopkins Society of Sigma Nu Fraternity, Inc., by which the method of payments by said Fraternity upon its present indebtedness of **$29,900.00** to the University is placed upon an installment basis of **$211.32** to be paid on the first days of each month of the college session, beginning October 1, 1938, and continuing through June 1, 1968, interest upon the obligation of the Fraternity being reduced from **6%** to **5%**, and the Grand Chapter of Sigma Nu Fraternity, holder of a third lien of **$12,000.00** upon the property of said Fraternity, acknowledging notice of the change in method of payment, and approving same, pursuant to resolution adopted by the Board of Trustees of said Grand Chapter on December 15, 1938.

The new agreement was then read to the Board by Mr. Perkins, and, after some discussion thereof, the following resolution was adopted-

RESOLVED, that Mr. Frederic W. Scott, Rector of the University, be and he is hereby authorized to execute and acknowledge said agreement in the name and on behalf of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, and Mr. E. I. Carruthers, Secretary of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, is hereby authorized to affix the corporate seal thereto and attest the same, and the Attorney for the University is hereby requested to deliver one copy of the agreement in executed form to Mr. Bernard P. Chamberlain, Attorney for The Hopkins Society of Sigma Nu Fraternity, and to see that such copy is properly recorded in the Clerk's Office or the Circuit Court of Albemarle County.

Mr. Perkins made the following report with reference to the Whitmell T. Taliaferro Estate-

The Board will recall that among other assets which came into your hands under the will of Whitmell T. Taliaferro, deceased, was a bond of Alfred D. Cooper for **$8,000.00**, secured by mortgage constituting a first lien on the premises known as **328 Ridgewood Avenue, Glen Ridge, New Jersey**. You will also recall that from time to time reports have been made showing that Mr. Cooper has been unable to meet his interest payments on this mortgage and payments of insurance premiums and necessary maintenance charges upon the premises.

By an agreement into, under date of October 18, 1938, between said Alfred D. Cooper and Mrs. Edna W. Cooper and the University, these parties agreed to convey this property to the University in extinguishment of the mortgage debt, and to lease the property from the University for the rental of **$100** per month from the date of said contract to the 31st day of May, 1939, The University to have the right, at any time, to sell the premises and deliver possession upon giving the said Cooper and wife thirty days written notice of such sale, the University to retain all amounts derived from such sale up to the full amount of the total indebtedness of Mr. Cooper as of the date of sale, including all costs and expenses of sale, and said Cooper to receive any amounts derived from such sale over and above the sums due the University.

The total debt as of January 1, 1939, amounts to **$11,400.15**. It is deemed advisable to place this property in the hands of real estate agents for sale and the best advice we have been able to obtain would seem to indicate that a price of **$12,000.00** for said property will be a fair price. Messrs. Pitney, Hardin & Skinner, our attorneys in Newark, wish us to fix a price at which we will be willing to sell the property and at which we will authorize them to list the property for sale with real estate agents who may be able to dispose of it. After a full discussion the following resolution was adopted-

RESOLVED that the Attorney for the University be and he is hereby authorized to advise Messrs. Pitney, Hardin & Skinner, Attorneys, of Newark, New Jersey, that the University is willing to sell the premises, **328 Ridgewood Avenue, Glen Ridge, New Jersey**, for the sum of **$12,000.00**, upon such terms as may be hereafter agreed upon by our Finance Committee. And if sale is made at said price, the Rector is hereby authorized to execute and acknowledge, in the name and on behalf of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, a deed conveying said property to the purchaser Mr. E. I. Carruthers, the Secretary, is authorized to affix and attest the corporate seal to such deed.

And be it further RESOLVED that the Finance Committee of this Board be and is hereby given full authority to act in the matter of this sale, and in the opinion of the said Committee, it is advisable to sell said property for some amount less than **$12,000.00**, said Committee is hereby authorized to negotiate and conclude such sale.

Mr. Perkins presented to the meeting a contract of lease of the "Brown Farm", in Dinwiddie County, for the year ending December 31st, 1939, to Charlie Jones, the tenant who has occupied the place for a number of years, and the following resolution was adopted-

RESOLVED that the President be and is hereby authorized and requested to execute and deliver this lease, and that a copy thereof be filed with the minutes of this meeting.

At meeting of the Board of Visitors held on the 28th day January, 1938, the President explained the situation with reference to certain trusts heretofore created by Mr. Paul Goodloe McIntire, under which his daughter, Miss Charlotte V. McIntire, is to receive certain income during her lifetime, and at her death this income is to pass to the University for the purpose of creating certain scholarships, as defined in the Trust Agreement. The President further stated that at his request Mr. McIntire had consented that the remainder under said trusts might be used by the University for its general purposes and not be confined to use for scholarships. A resolution was thereupon adopted by this Board authorizing the Attorney for the University with the consent and approval of Mr. McIntire to prepare and file in the Circuit Court of Albemarle County such petition as might be necessary to obtain the consent of the Court to the change in application of the remainder under said trusts, Dr. J. L. Newcomb, President, being authorized by said resolution to execute and file an answer to said petition in the name and on behalf of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia. Mr. Perkins, as Attorney for the University, reported that pursuant to this resolution, proper petition was prepared and filed in the Circuit Court of Albemarle County, on behalf of Mr. McIntire; that answer was prepared, executed, and filed by Dr. Newcomb as President of the University; and that by decree of said Court, entered October 18, 1938, the University is authorized to use the funds which are ultimately to be paid to it under these trusts for such purposes as its constituted authorities may desire, instead of being restricted to scholarships, fellowships and loan funds, as set out in the original trust indentures.

Application of Zeta Psi Fraternity for reduction of interest rate on its loan from the University from **6%** to **5%** was referred to the Finance Committee for report together with report on all other loans to fraternities.

The President stated that he had received request from the Alpha Chapter of Chi Phi for deferral of its **$500** installment on loan, due October 18, 1938, for one year. Same was granted.

The President read to the Board a letter received from Mr. R. Gray Williams, Chairman of the Committee, in re: cost of necessary lumber, etc., needed for repairs to the buildings and fences and, also a letter from Frank E. Hartman, Sup't. of Buildings and Grounds, who, at his direction, had visited the property and made an estimate of cost of the required lumber and fencing, and necessary labor for repairs, a total of **$858.40**. During a general discussion of the matter, the question arose as to the advisability of the University selling its interest in the property. The question was disposed of in the following resolution adopted:

RESOLVED, that the special committee on Miller Property, appointed at the November meeting of the Board, to consider repairs to the buildings, be authorized to secure an appraisal of the said property and report. Mr. Rinehart was added to the Committee.

On motion the following resolution was adopted:

RESOLVED, that Frank E. Hartman, Sup't buildings and Grounds, be authorized and directed to open bids on equipment for Rotunda Restoration, PWA Project Va. 1312-F, and to ask PWA for approval of award of contracts to the lowest bidders, provided the sum does not exceed **$2,000**, and

RESOLVED, further, that J. L. Newcomb, President, be and he is hereby authorized and directed to sign the contracts for the said equipment in the name of and on behalf of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia.
