### Section 3.

The proceeds derived from the sale of said bonds shall be used for the construction of a building for the Department of Engineering, (hereinafter sometimes called the "project") as a part of the Institution's building system and for other and incidental purposes, all as more specifically mentioned and described in resolutions heretofore adopted, and particularly in a certain Loan Agreement authorized by resolution adopted February 17, 1934, and dated as of March 9th, 1934, between the Institution and the United States of America. It is hereby determined that interest on said bonds during the period of such construction and the cost of issuance of the bonds shall be deemed a part of the cost of such construction for the financing of which said bonds are authorized. It is also hereby determined that the construction and erection of such project is a purpose for which bonds may lawfully be issued under the provisions of the Act hereinabove referred to.

### Section 4.

Said bonds shall be limited obligations of the Institution payable only from the revenues and receipts derived directly or indirectly from the project after providing first for the reasonable expenses of the operation and maintenance thereof, and, subject to the terms and provisions hereinafter in this resolution expressed, such revenues and receipts after making such provisions are hereby exclusively pledged as security for the payment of the principal of and interest on such bonds and other obligations hereinafter provided.

### Section 5.

The Institution shall operate and maintain the project and charge and collect for or in connection with the use, occupation and/or services of such project, or any services rendered therein, such fees, rents and charges as the Institution shall deem proper, so that the project shall always have sufficient revenues and receipts, determined as provided in sub-division (e) of section 6 of the Act referred to in section 1 hereof, to provide for the payment of reasonable expenses of operation and maintenance of the project, in addition to the discharge in due course of any liabilities and debts of the Institution incurred in connection with the project, and to do all such other acts and things in connection with such operation and maintenance and the charging and collection of such fees, rents and charges, as may be necessary, proper or convenient to carry out the provisions of this resolution.

The fees, rents and charges collected by the Institution as aforesaid, after deducting reasonable expenses for operation and maintenance, including but not limiting the generality of the foregoing, charges for heating, lighting, power, janitor service, water, telephone, repairs and insurance, (but not including salaries of the executive staff and teaching staff), shall be set aside in the sinking fund described in section 6 hereof, to the extent provided in said section.

### Section 6.

The Institution shall set aside as collected and deposit the revenues and receipts of the project after providing first for the payment of the amounts required by section 5 hereof for reasonable expenses of operation and maintenance, in a "Bond and Interest Sinking Fund Account" (herein referred to as the "sinking fund"), to the extent only hereinafter in this section provided. So long as any of the bonds authorized by this resolution shall remain outstanding, the moneys in the sinking fund shall be pledged to and used solely for the purpose of paying the interest on and principal of such bonds. During each of the fiscal years ending 1935 to 1946, both inclusive, there shall be set aside and paid into such sinking fund out of the revenues and receipts of the project, an amount equal to one hundred twenty per centum (120%) of the amount of interest payable on the bonds outstanding and one hundred twenty per centum (120%) of the aggregate principal amount of the bonds maturing in each such year. The amount by which such payments into the sinking fund exceed the aggregate amount of interest and (principal) payable in such years shall be held in the sinking fund as a reserve for contingencies and used only in accordance with the provisions of this resolution. During each of the fiscal years ending 1947 to 1964, both inclusive, the amount so set apart and paid into the sinking fund shall be equal to one hundred per centum (100%) of the amount of interest payable on the bonds outstanding and one hundred per centum (100%) of the aggregate principal amount of bonds maturing in each such year; provided, however, that no further payments need be made into said sinking fund when the amount of money held in said sinking fund (including the reserve for contingencies) equals the amount of the interest and principal that will be payable at the time of the maturity of all of the bonds then outstanding. If in any fiscal year the Institution shall fail to pay into the sinking fund the full amount hereinabove stipulated, then an amount equal to the amount of such deficiency shall be set apart and paid into the sinking fund from the first available revenues or receipts of the following fiscal year or years. If the Institution shall fail to make such payment into the sinking fund as aforesaid during any fiscal year, any funds then held in the sinking fund as a reserve for contingencies, as above provided, shall be used for the payment of any portion of the interest on and principal of the bonds becoming due in such fiscal year, on which bonds there would otherwise be a default but the amount by which such reserve is so reduced by such payment shall be replaced from the first available revenues and receipts of the following fiscal year or years in excess of the required payment for the then current fiscal year. All moneys held in the sinking fund as a reserve for contingencies shall either be deposited in a bank or banks which are members of the Federal Reserve System in a special account or accounts to be continuously secured by a pledge to the Institution of direct obligations of the United States of America having an aggregate market value, exclusive of accrued interest, at all times at least equal to the balance on deposit in each such account; or such moneys shall be paid into the treasury of the Commonwealth of Virginia to the account of the Institution and as a special fund for the use of the Institution, or, such moneys shall be invested in such direct obligations of the United States of America; provided, however, that the Institution shall make suitable provisions for the sale of such obligations when it shall prove necessary to draw upon said sinking fund or the reserve therein.

### Section 7.

The Institution shall keep complete and accurate accounts of all sums of money received and disbursed in connection with the erection, operation and maintenance of the project, including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, a complete and accurate record of all amounts charged as fees, rents and charges in connection with the operation of such project and all sums disbursed for the payment of the interest on and principal of the bonds. The Institution shall also prepare and submit a complete operating and income statement of the project in reasonable detail, within sixty days after the close of each fiscal year to the Governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia, and to the United States of America, and, upon written request, to any purchaser or holder of any of the bonds Such operating and income statement shall be certified by independent auditors, if demand for an independent audit shall be made.

### Section 8.

So long as any of the bonds shall remain outstanding, the Institution will maintain insurance on the project for the benefit of the holders thereof of a kind and in an amount which usually would be carried by private corporations operating a similar project. The proceeds of any insurance, other than for loss of use and occupancy, shall be used only for (a) replacements or repairs, or (b) payments into the sinking fund. During the period of loss of use and occupancy, the proceeds of any use and occupancy insurance shall be paid into the sinking fund and applied according to the provisions relating thereto.

### Section 9.

So long as any of the bonds shall remain outstanding the Institution shall not issue any additional bonds of any other authorized issue or other evidences of indebtedness payable from the revenues and receipts of said project, unless the lien and security of such additional bonds or evidences of indebtedness on the revenues and receipts of such project, are made junior and subordinate in all respects to the lien and security of the bonds described herein.

### Section 10.

The holders of the bonds are (and shall be) entitled to all the benefits of and subject to the provisions of section 7 of the Act referred to in section 1 of this resolution, and any Trustee appointed by the holders of the bonds pursuant to said section 7 of said Act shall have the powers provided by sub-division (e) of said section 7 of said Act.

### Section 11.
