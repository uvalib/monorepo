William Lamb

Rector pro-tem.

Present: Wyatt M. Elliott, Rector, and Messrs Ruggles, Bell, Hansbrough, Ruffin and Barbee.

Whereas, it appears from Section 3, Faculty Report, November 15, 1883, that pending the vacancy (so far) in the professorship of Chemistry, Prof Dunnington has, in addition to the duties of his own department of Analytical Chemistry, been delivering lectures with great acceptability to the students; and whereas, some time will elapse before Dr John W.

Resolved, That the recommendation contained in section 5, Faculty Report, November 15, 1883, as to Practical Astronomy be adopted; and that a prescribed course in Practical Astronomy, to be agreed upon in a conference of the Professors interested, be considered as the equivalent of the graduate course in either Mathematics or Natural Philosophy for graduates in these schools, who are offering for a Doctorate.

Whereas, it appears from section Six, Faculty Report, November 15, 1883, that one of the three Miller Scholarships, authorized by law to be offered annually on competitive examination, namely, what is called the Post-Graduate Scholarship, was not granted at the close of the last session on account of the failure of the candidate to obtain the required standard, and that the money belonging to this scholarship ($333.1/3) remains in the treasury unused: Therefore,

Resolved, for the reasons assigned in said section, that the Faculty be authorized to grant a Miller Scholarship for the present session to N. W. Davis, the student who obtained the mark of 924 in the recent examinations for what are called the two annual scholarships.

On motion of G. W. Hansbrough.

2. That every student lodging elsewhere deposit in advance $15 as an indemnity for rent; and that at the close of the session the amount due for unoccupied dormitories be estimated and divided equally among the students lodging elsewhere as a charge to each - the remainder, if any, of his deposit being credited in final settlement: provided, said charge for indemnity in no case exceed $15.

3. That existing enactments, insofar as inconsistent with these presents, be and are hereby repealed.

Resolved, That the report of the committee, appointed to prepare a memorial to the General Assembly of Virginia praying that there be enacted a statute providing for the assumption by the State of the existing debt of the University, be received and approved; and that the memorial accompanying the report be adopted, and signed by each member of the Board. That a committee of three be appointed by the Rector (in addition to the Rector himself) for the purpose of presenting the memorial to the Assembly and of pressing the enactment of such statute before any committee thereof to which it may be referred.

### Memorial.

To the General Assembly of Virginia:

The Memorial of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia respectfully represents: That your memorialists find that the important Institution, with the care of which they are charged, is seriously hindered in its general usefulness by the oppressive debt under which it labors; and which may be classed under three heads, all evidenced by the bonds of the University, namely:

The Act of Assembly of February 26, 1875, appropriating $30,000 per annum for the support of the University requires that "out of the said appropriation of $30,000 all necessary repairs, and the interest on the existing debt shall first be paid, and a sinking fund of $1,000 per annum shall be established and placed under the control of the Board of Visitors to be annually applied to the liquidation of the principal." Under this Act the then existing debt has been reduced from about $87,000 as it was at that date to the above-stated sum of $74,500, but it has been necessary since that time to borrow $15,000, namely:

The subtraction from the yearly income of the University of the sum required to pay the interest on the then existing debt (i.e. #87,000) and to provide the $1,000 of Sinking Fund amounting in the aggregate for the last financial year to about $7,000 (to say nothing of the interest on the debt of $15,000 contracted in 1883) makes it needful, in order to maintain the Institution in even tolerable efficiency, to levy upon the students very burdensome taxes in the shape of heavy matriculation fees, rents, etc., which impair the popularity of the University, and diminish the attendance upon its schools.

Your memorialists submit that under these circumstances, the well-being of the University requires that the State should assume the debt of the Institution, and so relieve its revenues of the disastrous charge now resting upon them, and they humbly pray that your honorable body will so enact. It is needless to remind any member of the General Assembly that the Institution was not established for the pecuniary profit, but for the intellectual and moral development of the people and the glory of the State, and can only be maintained in its appropriate and intended efficiency and distinction by reasonable expenditures of the public treasure; and the intelligent and patriotic statesman can scarcely doubt the political wisdom of such reasonable expenditures as may be essential to preserve the University's standing in the foremost rank of institution of its class and in a condition consonant with the traditions and destinies of Virginia.

The affectionate interest with which, for so many years, the General Assembly and the people of the State have cherished the University - the splendid and peculiar monument to the patriotic forethought of Thomas Jefferson encourages your memorialists to believe that it is only needful to prove that the interposition asked for is really necessary in order to insure a favorable hearing from the Assembly and to invoke the warm approval and sympathy of the people.

To that end attention is asked to the statement of receipts and disbursements which accompanies the annual report of this Board. It will be apparent thence that the expenditures have been regulated by a rigid economy, and that they cannot be further contracted without detriment to the public service. If the prayer of your memorialists be granted they think that the University may be made, at materially less cost to its pupils in several particulars, more worthy of its fame, of the memory of its illustrious founder, and the honor and influence of the Commonwealth, whose judicious liberality has reared it to be one of the foremost seats of higher education in all the land.

Your memorialists submit, further, that inasmuch as in several of the States from which the University has hitherto derived a liberal support, State Institutions have now been erected where no tuition fees, and merely nominal charges of any kind except for board, are exacted, it is more expedient than ever, not to say indispensable, to reduce all charges at the University, especially of the incidental kind, such as for matriculation etc. to the lowest figure possible.

In conclusion, - whilst your memorialists make no question that the existing debt was contracted in the best interests of the Institution, and in view of what was considered a reasonable hope and expectation that a large portion of it would be paid from other resources,- still, in view of the failure to receive these collateral funds, and because it is manifestly inexpedient that Literary Institutions should be hampered by pecuniary embarrassments, Your Memorialists are decidedly of the opinion that, by express enactment, the University should be inhibited in the future from creating any debt, or debts, which in the aggregate shall exceed $10,000 to $15,000 without previous sanction of the General Assembly.

And your memorialists will ever pray, etc.

Endorsed:

"On motion, it was unanimously Resolved that the memorial of the Board of Visitors as presented to the Miller Board meets its entire approbation, and demands its heartiest co-operation and union in the prayer of said memorial.

Committee of the Miller Board on the Memorial.

"Messrs Barbour, Jones and Mr Slaughter, President, were on motion appointed a committee to unite with a similar committee of the Board of Visitors to present a memorial to the General Assembly in regard to the University debt, Mr. Slaughter being Chairman of the Committee.

A Copy, Teste: R.T.W. Duke jr, Asst: Secy:"

Resolved, unanimously, by the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, That the thanks of this Board are due and they are hereby cordially tendered to Prof Ira Remsen, of the John Hopkins University, to Prof C. Loring Jackson, of Harvard University, to Dr H.J. Bowditch, of Boston, to Genl: Francis A. Walker, of Massachusetts Institute of Technology, to Prof T.M. Drown, of Easton, Pa., and to Prof A.W. Hoffman, of Berlin, Prussia, and to Dr E. Frankland, of London, England, for the extraordinary degree of interest they have displayed and their generous services in assisting our Committee in the matter of selecting suitable candidates for the Chair of Chemistry in this University, recently made vacant by the resignation of Dr John W. Mallet, but now happily filled again by the election of that distinguished professor.
