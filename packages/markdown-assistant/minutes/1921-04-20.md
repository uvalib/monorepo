A called meeting of the Rector and Visitors was held on this date at 8 o'clock P. M., at which were present the Rector, John Stewart Bryan, and Visitors E. L. Greever, Harris Hart, Goodrich Hatton, Walter T. Oliver, Alex. F. Robertson and C. Harding Walker, and President Alderman.

The minutes of the previous meeting, copies of which had been mailed to each member for verification, were approved.

The President announced the following gifts:

$50,000 from the General Education Board to be used for salary increases from 1921-24.

John Bassett Moore Library of International Law, from Hon. John Bassett Moore.

$600.00 a year from State Board of Health to Venereal Clinic at Hospital.

$246.50 from the Education Club to the Department of Education.

Bronze tablet, in memory of his brother, the late Professor Harry Heck, from Mr. George C. Heck, of New York City, to the Heck Memorial Library.

Portrait of President Woodrow Wilson (by Duncan Smith) from the Norfolk and Portsmouth Alumni Association.

Portrait of Mr. John B. Cobb (by Eugene Speicher) for the Cobb Chemical Laboratory.

Portrait of Professor F. P. Dunnington (by Leon A. Makielski) from his former students.

Four books from Mr. Graham Harris, of Greenwood, Va., to the General Library.

Catalogue of Cruikshank and Dickens from W. A. Clark, Jr., to the General Library.

"The Lafayette Flying Corps", Vol. I and II, to the General Library, from Mr. A. Courtney Campbell.

In reference to the gift of Hon. John Bassett Moore, the following resolution was adopted:

RESOLVED, That the thanks of the Rector and Visitors be extended to John Bassett Moore by President Alderman for his very splendid and valuable gift to the University of Virginia.

The following letter was received from Mr. John Bassett Moore in reference to his gift:

On the approach of the Centennial Celebration, and on the Founder's birthday, I desire to enter upon the execution of a long-cherished design to present to my Alma Mater a library of international law. I would begin the collection this year, and would from time to time add to it, making a final contribution, including probably a part of my own library, under my will or such indications as my family would carry out.

To this gift the principal condition I attach is that the collection shall form a part of the Law Library and shall be kept intact. Although the volumes included in it would not all be what are commonly called law-books, yet they would all have some special relation to what I have found the needs of the student, the teacher, and the practitioner of international law actually to be. Moreover, having always been accustomed to look upon the body of rules governing the intercourse of nations as a branch of law, I wish in every way to emphasize the legal nature of the subject, and particularly to impress on those who would understand the system, and above all on those who would essay to expound it, the fundamental requisite of a thorough and comprehensive education in law, private as well as public.

I should also be glad if the collection might be distinctively preserved as the John Bassett Moore Library of International Law. This request is mainly prompted by the hope that the example, with which the collection thus named would be associated, of a life largely spent in the study, the exposition and the administration of international law, might quicken in others an interest in the subject and in the public service.

Believe me to be, as always,

On behalf of the Board, Dr. Alderman wrote Mr. Moore as follows:

It was my honor and pleasure to make known to the Rector and Visitors of the University, at their meeting on April 20, 1921, your letter setting forth your gift - the John Bassett Moore Library of International Law - to the University of Virginia. I was directed by the Board to express to you their gratitude and appreciation of this splendid service to the University. The Board is largely composed of members of the legal profession, and you may imagine their pleasure and satisfaction at the thought of such new strength will be added to that side of our University life. I was also instructed to say that your letter will be spread upon the minutes and that all of the conditions will be faithfully adhered to.

Assuring you of the appreciation of the whole University, I have the honor to remain,

The following budget for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1921 was presented by the President and adopted:

\[the "Budget" follows on Page 40]

$5,500 of this sum came out of laboratory fees, 1920-21.

In connection with certain expenditures listed in the Hospital budget, the President was asked to ascertain from the Superintendent the necessity for the following items: $1033 for a carpenter, $1500 for repairs, and $1000 for material.

The following resolution relative to automatic increases in the salaries of full professors was adopted:

RESOLVED, That the regulation adopted by the Board May 8, 1914, concerning automatic increases in professors' salaries after six and twelve years respectively of satisfactory service, be and is hereby rescinded.

At the request of the President, the following resolution was adopted, changing the title of adjunct professor to assistant professor.

WHEREAS it is desired to standardize the professorial title in the colleges of the State receiving State aid, therefore be it

RESOLVED, That the title of adjunct professor in the University be changed to assistant professor.

The following promotion was made in the faculty:

Instructor S. J. Makielski was promoted to Assistant Professor of Art and Architecture.

The following special appropriations were made:

$1800 for chairs for the amphitheatre.

$204.50 for furniture for the women's rest room.

A sum to purchase 24 fire extinguishers of the Keystone type.

The matters in the death of L. L. Newman were discussed. Mr. W. Allan Perkins, attorney for the University, was present and went over with the Board certain questions in connection therewith. The matter was disposed of in the following resolution:

RESOLVED, That the L. L. Newman matter be referred to the Executive Committee with power to act, and that the said committee will meet at the call of the Rector.

In the matter of the McKim insurance question, the following action was had:

In the matter of the letter of the American Security and Trust Company, Trustee under the Will of the late Dr. Randolph H. McKim, under date of December 16th, 1920, requesting the release by the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, of its right to certain funds which will ultimately pass to it under Dr. McKim's will, Dr. Alderman recalled to the Board its action taken at the meeting held on February 14th, 1921, at which time the following resolution was adopted:

"RESOLVED, That in the opinion of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, they have no right to make such release, however much they may desire so to do."

Dr. Alderman further stated that since this action of the Board had been communicated to the Trustee under Dr. McKim's Will, he had received a letter from Mrs. McKim, and that in view of the explanation of the situation contained in the letter and certain facts with reference to Dr. McKim's wishes therein set out by Mrs. McKim, and which were not mentioned by the Trust Co. in its communication, he felt that the whole question should be reconsidered.

Mrs. McKim's letter was thereupon read to the Board by Mr.
