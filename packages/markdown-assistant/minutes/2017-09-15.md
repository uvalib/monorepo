Lampkin, W. Thomas Leback, Mark M. Luellen, David W. Martel, Debra D. Rinker, Roscoe C. Roberts, and Colette Sheehy.

Rector Conner began by thanking everyone for coming to the meeting and for all the hard work that goes into pulling together the Board meetings and materials. In particular, he thanked Bryanna Miller for her work; the many meetings and interviews that she held prior to the Board meetings. He also thanked Vice Rector Murray for his work in helping to organize the free concert for Charlottesville.

The Rector spoke briefly about the Health System Board meeting and the Vivian Pinn ceremony that took place on Wednesday afternoon. He said Vivian Pinn is truly a remarkable person who has had an amazing impact on healthcare, particularly healthcare for women. She is a graduate of UVA; she enrolled in 1967. She was the only African American in her class. She recalled her first day, looking around and not seeing anyone who looked like her. She contemplated leaving and telling her father she could not do this when two white males walked up to her and asked if she would like to be their lab partner. That started her on a path of tremendous success in healthcare. The Rector said her life demonstrates “productive progress.” She persevered, she had great success, and she came back to the University as one of its great supporters.

Rector Conner said he and President Sullivan had written statements they intended to read. He then read a statement that he said reflected his personal views and not those of the Board. The statement is reprinted here verbatim:

Previously, this University condemned the vile view of humanity that invaded Charlottesville and these Grounds on Aug. 11. It is easy to condemn the contemporary version of the abhorrent behavior for which history has sacrificed millions of lives to eradicate. The harder part is to ask, and to answer for ourselves, “How did it come to pass in the symbolic center of our University? And how are we to respond not just to its occurrence, but to its origin?

As to the first question, let me be clear. The torch-lit march down our Lawn intending to intimidate was deeply unacceptable. And we will not allow its recurrence. In good faith, members of this board and others, independent of the events of that Friday night, have reviewed our response that evening and, as we have shared with the University community, there are areas where our response could have been better.

A significant factor implicating nearly all of the tactical decisions made is the mental framework with which we approached that assemblage. We have long been a University that has welcomed and promoted the free exchange of ideas, regardless of their repugnancy, as a basic tenet of a free society. And we have policed numerous demonstrations, marches and forums with that mindset and, perhaps naively, with trust that that mindset was shared by those demonstrating.

But this march was different, and the country and other communities and universities took note. What we witnessed was far more than a march protected by the First Amendment, but rather one that weaponized the First Amendment with the intent to intimidate and terrorize our community and our values. Across the nation, universities are dealing with the role of the First Amendment on campus. As a result of recent events, we have lost our innocence and are in a different place today. We were not sufficiently nimble in adjusting to this reality on Aug. 11, but we have taken stock of the judgments made then and the policies guiding our response that night.

Let me also be clear with respect to another issue regarding safety. We as a University have as our highest priority the safety of all in our community. I heard it in the voice of our president when she called at midnight that Friday evening to share with me what had transpired. I learned it from our dean of students, Allen Groves, as he recounted his experience surrounded by the terrorists at the Jefferson statue, protecting and standing with our students and others who in turn were courageously protecting our values. I saw it in the tired faces of the first responders and our staff on that Sunday afternoon at our emergency management center as they coordinated our response efforts. And we all are aware of the remarkable effort made by our medical professionals to care for the injured. So while there is deserved criticism, there is also deserved respect and appreciation for the dedication and courage of the many in our community who make creating a safe environment their life’s purpose.

To the second question of how we respond not just to the occurrence of abhorrent behavior, but to its origin: What has become known, as both a lament and a call to arms, as “Charlottesville” lays bare once again the intractable challenges that our society faces with respect to racial reconciliation, social justice and economic opportunity. Will we listen this time? Will we dialogue civilly with one another to achieve progress? Will we act? I would hope that we follow the admonition offered recently in the Wall Street Journal by James Baker and Andrew Young:

“The country faces a stark choice. Its citizens can continue screaming at each other, sometimes over largely symbolic issues. Or they can again do what the citizens of this country have done best in the past – work together on the real problems that confront everyone.”

At this University, we choose to work together. And you will hear from our president and the chair of the Deans’ Working Group as to how we will proceed in bringing new urgency to our previously defined mission for our third century.

There are some who believe that the history of this University is a barrier to achieving real change. That the legacy of Thomas Jefferson is one of racism and not equality. It is impossible to reconcile Jefferson’s words with his deeds. That the author of the religious freedom statute in Virginia and the fundamental aspiration of our democracy that “all men are created equal” could also enslave his fellow human beings rightfully leads to cynicism and rejection of his moral standing. Thomas Jefferson, like many, was flawed in many of his personal affairs. He embodied the flaws of the origin of this country. Reflect on the Constitution, principally crafted by James Madison, which denied any participation in the political process to women and valued the life of an African-American at 3/5’s of the value of others. And yet, it was ratified by all 13 original states before the Bill of Rights and 17 other subsequent amendments were enacted to begin to address the sins of this revolutionary experiment in democracy.

The genius of Jefferson and Madison and the other founders is that they began a journey for future generations to determine the concept of equality without restricting its scope, and created a government wary of the flaws of humanity that allowed for a dynamic process to address the original deficiencies. And they did so in a political process that created a nation with a revolutionary governance system that is monumental in its achievement. We will not turn our back on this history, but we are keenly aware of its shortcomings and have learned and will continue to learn as we move forward.

As Alexis de Tocqueville, the 19th\-century French diplomat, wrote in “Democracy in America,” the “greatness of America lies not in it being more enlightened than any other nation, but rather in her ability to repair her faults.”

We embrace the entirety of our history – all of the good and, yes, all of the ill. Our history as a university is inextricably woven into the history of this country. No other university has had three former presidents lay its cornerstone, two of whom were the intellectual inspiration and principal authors of contemporary democratic principles. Our history is bound up with that of this nation’s founding, the Civil War, and the system of Jim Crow that followed. It is equally bound up with the great transformations of the mid-20th century that renewed the nation’s democratic promise and opened up its universities through the GI Bill, desegregation, and co-education. We reflect, for better and for worse, the great accomplishments and the great failures of this nation.

Despite the nation’s progress, fundamental faults remain. If we really want to improve the history of our past, we must improve the history of our future by continuing to acknowledge and repair our faults and bending the arc of history to provide real justice and equality for all. In the eloquent words of Maya Angelou, “\[H\]istory, despite its wrenching pain, cannot be unlived, but if faced with courage, need not be lived again.”

A critical first component of repairing our faults is ensuring the completeness of our history. What President Sullivan has been leading over her tenure through the President’s Commission on Slavery and the University is an effort to do just that – to recognize the contributions of those who previously were not recognized, and to honor in our community the contributions of those such as Gibbons, Martin, Foster, Willis and the enslaved laborers. In doing so, we enrich ourselves and create a more united community that reflects all of its participants. Similarly, we will address those symbols on our Grounds that undermine our community in a manner that is holistic, thoughtful and inclusive and calls upon the expertise of thought leaders in the relevant disciplines.

The hate demonstrated on Aug. 11 and 12 awakened the country to the continuing issues of our time. Let us not squander the energy that now exists. As Elie Wiesel once stated, “\[T\]he opposite of love is not hate, it’s indifference.” We cannot afford an approach of indifference. Otherwise, future generations will judge us as we judge prior generations.

So I ask each person in this community – each student, each faculty member, each staff member, each administrator and each member of this board: How will you improve the history of our future?

\_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_

President Sullivan’s statement (reprinted verbatim) is as follows:

I want to begin by thanking the Rector for his words, and I want to echo one of his comments:

Safety is our top priority, as a University and as a community, and it’s my top priority as president. The torch-lit march on our Lawn on August 11 was something darker and more depraved, disguised as a protest march; it was an attack — an attack on our values; an attack on our University; and ultimately an attack on our people.

The work before us now is to learn from what happened and to defend our values, our University, and our people from any such future attacks.

Let me be clear:  At the University of Virginia, we denounce white supremacy, anti-Semitism, and every other form of bias and hate that the August 11 marchers brought to our Grounds, no matter which group espouses them.

Those beliefs belong in the “ash heap of history.” Diversity and inclusion make us a stronger nation and a stronger University.

Today we speak as a unified and diverse community to denounce those who would seek to divide us, but we know that words alone are not enough. We are committed to taking the measures necessary to prevent any similar attack from happening here again.

This week, the Working Group chaired by Law Dean Risa Goluboff issued its report assessing the events of August 11, with suggestions for how the University could have improved its response. You will hear from Risa tomorrow.

The report acknowledges the things we did right, such as increasing the number of UVA police on duty on the night of August 11 and working with our state and local partners to coordinate resources. It does not mention, but I wish to acknowledge, the mobilization of our hospital and Health System to handle a mass-casualty incident on the next day.

The report also makes several recommendations. During this board meeting, we are asking you for action on several related issues. They include:

*   our “open burn and open flame” policy;
*   the classification of the Academical Village as a facility, to allow for increased regulation of weapons and explosives;
*   consideration of how we memorialize our history;
*   support for the concert scheduled for Sept. 24 at Scott Stadium;
*   a new scholarship program for underrepresented students in Engineering;
*   and plans to memorialize Heather Heyer, the woman who was killed when a car crashed into a crowd of people who had gathered to oppose the “Unite the Right” rally.

Parenthetically, I also want to note that yesterday, we celebrated the naming of Pinn Hall for a distinguished African-American alumna and physician.

Prior to the Working Group’s report, we had already taken immediate steps to make UVA safer. These have included:

*   Expanding police coverage across Grounds;
*   Extending the Ambassadors program to provide on-Grounds coverage, including the Lawn and residential areas;
*   Hiring Margolis Healy & Associates to conduct a comprehensive review of our safety and security infrastructure, policies and tools;
*   Hiring MSA Security to provide a security-risk assessment for large events such as athletic events, the concert for Charlottesville and the Bicentennial Launch Weekend; and
*   Conducting three separate “hot-washes” of the events of August 11 to evaluate our performance.

We will be taking more steps in the days ahead to create a safer, and more equitable and inclusive University community.

As we continue working toward greater diversity and inclusion, we must also continue to uphold the principles of the First Amendment, as the rector mentioned. We must continue to foster free speech, open discourse and the clash of ideas. Any restriction on free expression is incompatible with the values of higher education and our University’s commitment to the freedom of the human mind.

These two commitments — to free speech, and to inclusion —sometimes come into conflict with each other, but we cannot sacrifice one to preserve the other. We must uphold both, because both are essential to the excellence we seek.

What we absolutely cannot do, however, is allow the practice of free expression to cross the line into intimidation and violence and all-out attack on UVA and its people, as it did on August 11. We must and will take all necessary steps to prevent that escalation. 

For decades, peaceful protests and demonstrations have played out on college and university campuses across the country. As bastions of free speech, universities have been natural gathering points for such expressions of the First Amendment. Those generally peaceful protests are the type of event that universities have prepared for. 

August 11 marked a new day for UVA, and for universities across the country, and this new day will require a shift in our mental framework. In our policies and planning, we need to prepare for situations in which demonstrations spill over into intimidation and intentional violence. Our policies need to help us prevent such spill-over, and our planning needs to prepare us to act when such spill-over threatens to happen.

We will protect the Constitutional principles of free speech, because free expression is a core value of higher education. But we will vigorously protect our people, our University and our values when they are threatened by attack.

Last Friday, at the request of Congressman Bobby Scott, I spoke before the minority members of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce in Washington. The committee held a forum on “Affirmative Action, Inclusion and Racial Climate on America’s Campuses” — an issue that’s central to our discussion this morning.

I spoke about our efforts to build inclusion at UVA, including the work of the President’s Commission on Slavery and the University. I’m pleased that the commission has accomplished so much in a relatively short time. We have:

*   Established a nationwide consortium named “Universities Studying Slavery,” which includes 25 institutions that are working together on research and commemoration.
*   Created the Cornerstone Summer Institute, a camp for high school students who are interested in learning about slavery and its legacies at UVA and in the region.
*   As part of the Bicentennial commemoration, we will present a symposium titled “Universities, Slavery, Public Memory & the Built Landscape,” which follows another symposium we held here last year titled “Universities Confronting the Legacy of Slavery.”  
*   Thanks to board approval at your last meeting, we are moving forward with plans for the new Memorial for Enslaved Workers at UVA.
*   We named Gibbons House and Skipwith Hall.

While the Commission on Slavery continues its work, we need to address other troublesome aspects of UVA’s history. For example, we know that in 1921 President Alderman received a pledge of $1,000 from the KKK. We have a newspaper account in which he acknowledged the pledge, but no evidence that the pledge was ever paid. The KKK began to wither as an organization by mid-decade, so it’s possible that they never fulfilled that pledge.

But we’re going to acknowledge the pledge, and we’re going do so in a way that would be as disagreeable as possible for any remnants of the KKK who may be watching.

That $1,000 pledge, if inflated to today’s dollars, would be worth about $12,400. With that number in mind, I have allocated $12,500 from private sources to the “Charlottesville Patient Support Fund,” which is managed by the UVA Health Foundation, to pay medical expenses for people who were injured during the violence in August. Any leftover funds will support care for other members of our community.

In other words, we are allocating that century-old pledge from white supremacists to heal the wounds inflicted by the dying vestiges of white supremacy that struck Charlottesville last month. I hope any remaining members of the KKK will appreciate the irony.

We will continue to see issues arise on our Grounds. On Tuesday night, some community members and students held a protest at the Thomas Jefferson statue by the Rotunda, and several protestors covered the Jefferson statue in a black shroud. Although I recognize the rights of those protesters to express their opinions, I strongly disagree with their act of covering the Jefferson statue.

The history of the Jefferson statue helps to explain why I disagree with the shrouding. The statue was designed by a Jewish sculptor named Moses Ezekiel. Ezekiel was born in 1844 in Richmond and faced anti-Semitism through much of his life. He built into the sculpture a tribute to Jefferson’s contribution to religious freedom. The names of deities — God, Jehovah, Allah and others — are carved into a tablet held by a figure on the statue that symbolizes religious freedom.

Ezekiel explained that he carved the deity names to show that “under our government, they … are all God and have … equal right and protection of our just laws as Americans.”

This reminds us that, in spite of our founder’s faults, he made monumental contributions to religious freedom and other kinds of freedom, and we risk losing sight of those contributions if we shroud him in darkness because of his shortcomings.

This part of the Jefferson statue story holds special relevance because the white supremacists who marched on the statue on August 11 shouted anti-Semitic slurs, and because unknown others put up anti-Muslim signs on our Grounds on the day of the statue shrouding.

Thomas Jefferson was imperfect, but he also contributed to the religious and other freedoms that we uphold against those who would seek to divide us.

The events of the last several weeks have put UVA and Charlottesville in the national spotlight — once again. This attention is not coincidental. What happens at UVA matters because UVA matters. Because of our unique history among American universities; because of our elevated position among the best universities in the country; because of the excellence of our teaching, research, and scholarship — for all these reasons, all eyes are upon us, watching what happens here and how we respond.

Our obligation now is to use this moment of focus and attention to provide leadership, once again. And working together, that’s what we will do.”

**Strategic Investment Fund Annual Report, Friday, September 15, 2017**

Following lunch, the Board of Visitors reconvened in open session at 1:30 p.m. in the Board Room of the Rotunda. Frank M. Conner III, Rector, presided.

Present were James B. Murray Jr., Robert M. Blue, Mark T. Bowles, Whittington W. Clement, Elizabeth M. Cranwell, Thomas A. DePasquale, Barbara J. Fried, John A. Griffin, Robert D. Hardie, Maurice A. Jones, Babur B. Lateef, M.D., John G. Macfarlane III, James V. Reyes, Jeffrey C. Walker, Bryanna F. Miller, and Margaret F. Riley.

Absent was L.D. Britt, M.D.

Also present were Teresa A. Sullivan, Patrick D. Hogan, Thomas C. Katsouleas, Richard P. Shannon, M.D., Melody S. Bianchetto, Susan G. Harris, Patricia M. Lampkin, W. Thomas Leback, Mark M. Luellen, Roscoe C. Roberts, Colette Sheehy, and Farnaz F. Thompson.

President Sullivan spoke about a matching program for Bicentennial professorships similar to the one for scholarships. She said this will help in recruiting faculty.

Mr. Hogan reviewed the first year of performance of the Strategic Investment Fund (SIF). He referred to the annual report provided to every member of the Board. He gave an overview of the material in the annual report, which includes summaries of each grant.

Dr. Shannon gave an update on the type 1 diabetes research project. The project will be genotyping all children in Virginia in partnership with the National Institutes of Health. The first cohort has been collected. They have also established consultative services to practices in this area. He showed a video of a child with type 1 diabetes who has benefited from participating in the continuous glucose monitoring/artificial pancreas trials. The artificial pancreas monitors glucose levels and automatically adjusts to keep the patient from having extreme highs and lows.

Professor John Lach spoke about the cyber physical systems project in the Engineering School. Smart energy and smart phones are part of this industry. Cyber physical systems sit at the intersection of these emerging applications. They are using these technologies with dementia patients to monitor agitation, which will provide caregivers with more tools to address agitation triggers. The Link Lab is the physical space, which will be comprised of 17 faculty from five different departments in a very open environment to stimulate transdisciplinary conversations. They are in the process of building the lab, and it should be open by January. He spoke about PsiKick, a faculty spin-off that designs very low power circuits, which will have a huge impact on the environment.

Professor John Lach said students are critical to the research, and push many ideas forward. The cluster hires and other recent initiatives are about the University reinventing itself to move forward in these areas, with the intention of having a significant impact on society. He said there is a real sense that with the SIF, UVA can compete with the top institutions in the nation.

Following the Strategic Investment Fund presentation, the Board continued its meeting, sitting as the full Board.

Presenters were Eric M. Baumgartner, Risa L. Goluboff, Michael Phillips, Maggie Stein, and Alfred Weaver.

The Rector welcomed the recently appointed members of the Board and called on Mr. Murray to lead the Pledge of Allegiance.

**Minutes of the June 8-9, 2017 Meeting of the Board of Visitors and the August 4-5, 2017 BOV Retreat**

On motion, the Minutes of the Board meetings held on June 8-9, 2017 and August 4-5, 2017 were approved.

**Remarks by the Rector and the President**

The President said the march on August 11 at the University was not something that was well signaled to the University police. One of the police officers was injured, who is now off the force for several weeks because he was seeking to make an arrest at the event.

Ms. Sullivan described the events of August 12 as “horrific”, and mentioned the killing of Heather Heyer by a car driven into a crowd of pedestrians. She said several donors have stepped forward to pledge funds for a scholarship in Ms. Heyer’s name; the amount is sufficient to qualify for one-to-one matching from the Bicentennial Scholars Fund.

She described actions taken in response to the events of August 11 and 12. The police and others who work in Emergency Operations have had three “hot washes” to talk about what happened, and she asked Dean of the School of Law Risa Goluboff to chair a working group (the Deans Working Group) which is comprised of deans and others, including Craig Littlepage, Athletics Director; Bryanna Miller, student representative to the Board of Visitors; and Alf Weaver, chair of the Faculty Senate. Even before the working group was established, the University had already decided to revise the existing open flame policy, and it was changed this week by the University Policy Committee. President Sullivan said the University seeks to raise the policy to a state regulation, which has the force of state law. It takes at least a month after the resolution is approved by the Board of Visitors to achieve state regulation status because it must be posted publicly for a month for public comment.

The second resolution is Recognition of the University Academical Village as a Facility. The buildings are already considered a facility, but what is not included is the enclosed lawn between them. By recognizing it as a facility, it is then entitled to certain protections.

Upon motion, the following resolutions were approved:

**INTENT TO ADOPT UNIVERSITY REGULATION ON OPEN BURN AND OPEN FLAME OPERATIONS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA**

WHEREAS, the University strives to protect life and property by reducing the risks posed to University buildings, property, and occupants from the use and operation of an open burn and open flame; and

WHEREAS, no person should kindle or maintain or authorize to be kindled or maintained any Open Burning unless it is: (1) approved by the Office of Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) or the University of Virginia Medical Center Fire Protection Inspector’s Office, as appropriate; and (2) conducted in accordance with the Virginia Statewide Fire Prevention Code, Statewide burning laws, and applicable local City and County codes and regulations; and

WHEREAS, no person should use an Open Flame or Open Flame Device unless it is: (1) approved by EHS or the UVA Medical Center Fire Protection Inspector’s Office as appropriate; (2) conducted in accordance with applicable University or Medical Center procedures; and (3) conducted in accordance with the Virginia Statewide Fire Prevention Code; and

WHEREAS, no person should use an Open Flame or Open Flame Device in any place where flammable, combustible, or explosive material is utilized or stored; and

WHEREAS, no Open Burn or Open Flame Device should be used or operated in any University Facility or on University Property unless operated and managed in accordance with appropriate policies and safety protocols; and

WHEREAS, the University first approved University Policy SEC-032: Open Burn and Open Flame Operations at the University of Virginia on January 18, 2013, and adopted revisions to the University Policy on September 13, 2017, prohibiting these activities and providing a process for seeking permission to conduct such activities in appropriate circumstances;

RESOLVED, the Board of Visitors directs and authorizes the Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer to take such necessary action to prepare the University Policy SEC-032: Open Burn and Open Flame Operations at the University of Virginia for approval as a University Regulation, for publication in the Virginia Register, and for later publication in the Virginia Administrative Code.

**RECOGNITION OF ACADEMICAL VILLAGE AS UNIVERSITY FACILITY**

WHEREAS, the Academical Village – defined as that property bounded by the Rotunda to the north, Hospital Drive to the east, McCormick Road to the west, and, for purposes of this Resolution, as including the South Lawn/Homer Flat to the south (thereby including the Rotunda, Lawn and Range rooms, hotels, gardens and pavilions) makes up Thomas Jefferson’s original plan for the University, envisioned as a school with students and professors living together in a holistic learning environment; and

WHEREAS, as the physical and spiritual core of this institution, the Academical Village remains integral to the University’s mission as it prepares to enter its third century; and

WHEREAS, befitting its importance to the Commonwealth, the nation, and the world, the Academical Village has been recognized in the Virginia State Register of Historic Places and National Register of Historic Places and has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage site; and

WHEREAS, the University has long been a thoughtful and careful steward of the Academical Village; and

WHEREAS, University Policy SEC-030 and University Regulations (8 Virginia Administrative Code 85-20) prohibit the possession, storage, or use of any weapon, firework or other explosive, or any lethal combustible chemical or combination of chemicals, by the general public or visitors, except by a law-enforcement officer, on university property in academic, administrative, athletic, entertainment, or student residence buildings, child care or dining facilities, or the University Medical Center, or while attending sporting, entertainment, or educational activities;

RESOLVED, in recognition of the Academical Village’s critical importance and consistent with its multi-purpose residential, academic, and administrative use, the Board of Visitors declares its intent that the Academical Village be recognized formally as a University facility encompassing a controlled outdoor area, subject to University policy and regulation; and

RESOLVED FURTHER, the Board directs and authorizes the Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer to propose appropriate policies and regulations including the Academical Village as a University facility within the scope of the University’s policies and regulations.

President Sullivan asked Dean Goluboff to speak about the Deans Working Group efforts.

Dean Goluboff said the Deans Working Group is important for her to undertake now because Charlottesville is her home and the University has been her intellectual and professional community for the past 15 years; she has a personal stake in the endeavor.

Dean Goluboff pointed out that her life’s work is as a civil rights historian and legal scholar, and from that vantage point, she hoped that when the story of the long march of civil rights is told, the white supremacist, neo-Nazi, and Klan violence and intimidation in Charlottesville will be seen as a late and ultimately futile reaction to the successes of the freedom struggles of the last 50 years. Those successes are far from complete. August 11-12 was a violent and disturbing reminder that progress is all too often accompanied by reaction.

She was struck at a Law School panel referencing the white supremacists and Neo-Nazis as “unpopular minorities,” because in the 1950s and 1960s, civil rights activists were the unpopular minorities and the white supremacists the majority. She is gratified to think that has flipped, and even a politically fractured Congress can unanimously denounce white supremacy. Massive change can happen, but it does not always happen for the better, so that is why the nation has to respond to this threat.

She and many others have felt a cascade of emotions over the last month including heartbreak, revulsion, sadness, grief, fear, anger, and vulnerability, but most of all, resolve to make the world, our city, our University a more just, equal, and inclusive place.

The Working Group’s mission is to assist the University community in both recovering from and responding to the threatening and violent white supremacists who invaded the Grounds and Charlottesville this summer. The group has taken that charge seriously, meeting weekly for the past four weeks, with frequent emails. They have also been reaching out to members of the University community, meeting one-on-one as well as in larger groups, with the faculty senate, diversity officers, student groups, and there is more dialogue to come.

Their charge has three parts:

1.  Respond to the events and ensure the future safety and security of our community, as well as the implications of those events;
2.  Examine and continue to improve the culture, climate, and environment; and
3.  Work on long-term development of, and investments in, the research and teaching mission in areas related to the events of the summer.

Dean Goluboff expanded on the three parts of the charge. With regard to charge number one, a No Trespass Order has been issued to one marcher and the University Police Department is investigating others.

She reviewed three main foci in changing University policy:

1.  Designating the lawn a Facility;
2.  Police enforcement of the open flame policy and elevating that policy to a regulation; and
3.  Considering time, place, and manner policies that would simultaneously protect robust nonviolent free speech on Grounds and better equip law enforcement officers with the tools they need to respond to violence and intimidation. She has asked First Amendment experts on the Law School faculty to offer some constitutional policy options.

The second part of the charge is longer term and vitally important: to lead by example of introspection and self-examination about the University’s climate, culture, and environment. As much as it is a university’s place to challenge students, faculty, and staff intellectually, we want to nourish them personally. Toward that end, the Deans Working Group took its first two steps toward recommitting themselves to that aspiration by authorizing a pan-university climate survey to identify how the University can be an ever more welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and equitable community, including encouraging recruiting and retaining the very best and diverse students, faculty, and staff; and authorizing the creation of an advisory committee on how the University understands and commemorates its past, to supplement work of the President’s Commission on Slavery and another university committee that has been convened on naming.

She remarked that the University faculty have expertise to draw on as we think about our history, including historians and architects - those who spend their scholarly lives thinking about memory, narrative, and space. We will look to them for principles that will provide a path to best remember and recognize the University’s history while fostering contemporary values and future aspirations and celebrating our highest ideals. 

The third part of the Working Group’s mission is identifying how the University can emerge from the events of August 11-12 a better university. We do that by exploring the issues that surround those events: race, religion, ethnicity and nationality, gender and sexuality, pluralism and tolerance, politics and civic engagement, social justice and economic opportunity, and speech and violence. We have to ask new questions, and three new questions come to the fore:

1.  How should we think about this rise in violent, armed, brazen white supremacy? How does it fit into larger historical, demographic, economic, and political trends? Where will it lead us?
2.  How should we think about the relationship between the First Amendment and the Second Amendment? What should be the relationship between bearing arms and speaking? How do we as a diverse community in so many ways have true dialogue across our differences?
3.  How do we escape the recent, completely false dichotomy between freedom of speech on the one hand and freedom from offense on the other? The University of Virginia is better situated than any other institution to begin to answer that question. We can and should be a model of dialogue across difference and free speech within a community of respect and empathy.

The University Press is planning to publish essays from expert faculty reflecting on the events and their implications, and the Provost’s Office is providing a $100,000 flash fund for programs and events to continue the conversation for the near future. Schools are already responding through Strategic Investment Fund proposals.

Finally, she identified two existing initiatives that the Board can invest in immediately to enable important work already underway: the Carter G. Woodson Institute for African-American and African Studies and the Democracy Initiative, which is an overall project on the history, philosophy, and principles of democracy and exploring a variety of fundamental challenges to democratic societies around the world. She said these are only first steps and many more would be coming.

Mr. Conner thanked Dean Goluboff and remarked on the difficulty of one internal group assessing the actions of another. He asked that a proposal for increased funding for the Carter Woodson Institute be developed before the Board’s meeting in December and he said he supports the Democracy Initiative, but we should take into account other initiatives to avoid duplicating effort.

Mr. Conner then reviewed the history of two tablets on the Rotunda memorializing those students and alumni who died in service to the Confederacy. The tablets were installed following approval by the Board of Visitors in 1903, authorizing their placement in a suitable location on Grounds, but not specifying the Rotunda. He said the tablets represent an incomplete recordation of the history of the University involvement in the Civil War because there were students, alumni, and faculty who fought for the Union. He proposed that we should be thinking about how we wish to position the University for its third century. The University needs great leadership, financial resources, and the talent of faculty and students, and he asked if the tablets further this goal because they are offensive to some in our community. Great ideas are necessary, and along with great ideas we need moral authority. The tablets are a powerful symbol that is anathema to acquiring the moral authority that says we take the action to back up our words. Some have told him not to take down the tablets, but the University can determine the tablets are not in a suitable location, take them down, and at the same time memorialize the call to duty along with everyone else who was impacted by the Civil War.

Following extensive discussion among members of the Board, the following resolution was approved unanimously:

**RESOLUTION WITH RESPECT TO CIVIL WAR TABLETS**

WHEREAS, the Rotunda’s façade has bronze tablets commemorating those students and alumni who fought and died in the service of the United States in World War I, World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and in the Iraq War; and

WHEREAS, the earliest of those tablets commemorates the students and alumni who died in service to the Confederacy during the Civil War. These tablets were erected following a meeting of the Board of Visitors on November 10, 1903, where, upon the recommendation of the Faculty, the Board of Visitors authorized the Ladies’ Confederate Association to erect “at some suitable place at the University, to be approved by the Chairman of the Faculty, Chairman of the Executive Committee & the Proctor, a bronze tablet bearing the names of the Alumni and Students of this Institution who died in the service of the Confederacy”; and

WHEREAS, the location chosen for erecting two tablets honoring the deceased Confederate soldiers was either side of the door of the Rotunda facing the Lawn, where they are now located; and

WHEREAS, in recent years the University has undertaken a substantial effort to expand the known history of the University and to recognize all persons including enslaved workers who helped build and maintain the University; and

WHEREAS, the University’s Nau Center on Civil War History is conducting research on those affiliated with the University who fought on behalf of the United States in the Civil War, and they have catalogued the names of more than fifty University students and alumni, and one faculty member, who served in the Union Army or Navy during the Civil War and who are not recognized in any way on Grounds; and

WHEREAS, the tablets on the Rotunda do not recognize or reflect the complete history of the University related to the Civil War;

RESOLVED, consistent with the original resolution authorizing the tablets honoring the deceased Confederate soldiers to be erected “at some suitable place at the University”, the Board of Visitors finds that the Rotunda is no longer a suitable place for the tablets in their current form; and

RESOLVED FURTHER, the Board supports relocating the current Civil War tablets to a more suitable location at the University where they may be preserved as artifacts of the era in which they were erected, and utilized to provide context to the history of the University; and

RESOLVED FURTHER, the Board encourages the Deans Working Group, led by Dean Goluboff, to consider the appropriateness of memorializing all who participated in the Civil War in a tablet on the Rotunda or in other ways that tell the University’s history more fully.

\_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_

Mr. Macfarlane said Dr. Shannon gave the first gift to the Memorial for Enslaved Laborers, and he thanked him for the gift.

**President’s Report**

The President gave an overview of the Bicentennial Launch Weekend, which is scheduled for October 5 to 7, 2017. She said this is going to be a big weekend in Charlottesville, but the Bicentennial Celebration will extend far beyond the Grounds. Festivities will take place in UVA Clubs in cities across the country and around the world. Clubs as nearby as Richmond and Washington D.C., and as far away as India and Shanghai, are planning bicentennial celebrations in October and November.

The Launch Weekend is just the beginning of the programming for the Bicentennial Commemoration. Later in October, the University will host a symposium titled Universities, Slavery, Public Memory, & the Built Landscape. The symposium will consider the history, preservation, and memorialization of sites of enslavement, and highlight the work of universities that have begun to grapple with their own histories, including UVA. In November, the University will host the Women’s Global Leadership Forum, bringing together 200 women from the University and around the world to discuss the role of women in 21st century democracy. The forum will focus on topics such as education and health; economic access and innovation; and equality and political empowerment.

President Sullivan said she was very grateful to the members of the Bicentennial Commission, chaired by Tom Farrell and Dr. Bobby Battle, as well as the Commission’s steering committee. A great deal of hard work has gone into planning this celebration, and she believes everyone will be impressed with the results next month.

She said the Bicentennial reminds us that the University has thrived for 200 years largely because of its commitment to student learning and an excellent student experience. With that in mind, the President gave each Visitor a UVA Dining gift card that will allow them to eat with students in the dining halls.

**Comments by the Student Representative to the Board**

Ms. Bryanna Miller provided a “laundry list” of student activities on Grounds, and a preview of items she will bring to the Board in December, which include a substance abuse and alcohol awareness initiative, a student dining advisory committee in partnership with Aramark, and developing a connection with the students at the College at Wise through exchanges of students, faculty, and staff. The fourth initiative is to get more involved in the admissions process. She said she was grateful that the Board passed a resolution to remove the tablets memorializing Confederate soldiers—the Board has shown a great deal of moral courage. Students came together in the vigil after the events of August 11 and 12, and there have been other events and actions to process those events, culminating in the upcoming concert in Scott Stadium. She said in the future she will be asking the Board to consider some context around the Jefferson statue in front of the Rotunda—not to take it down, but to educate people about Mr. Jefferson’s life and views.

**Comments by the Faculty Senate Chair**

Mr. Alf Weaver spoke about the impact of the events of August 11 and 12 on faculty. A Senate meeting included President Sullivan and Dean Goluboff as well as a number of senators talking about next steps. He reviewed the work of each of the Senate committees.

In response to a discussion in June about a dearth of computer science classes, he explained that his department continues to make strides toward the goal of providing computer science classes to all who want to take them. He said by adding new lectures and new lab courses, the wait list was cleared for this fall, with 809 students enrolled in these courses.

**Comments by the Staff Senate Co-Chairs**

Mr. Michael Phillips, current co-chair of the Staff Senate, and Ms. Maggie Stein, one of the past co-chairs, gave some background information on what the Staff Senate does for the University. The Staff Senate was formed in 2014 by merging three separate employee councils and consists of 80 members, elected by colleagues in 24 major budgeting units, and represent over 5,000 staff members. Their mission is threefold: 1) to serve as a representative voice for staff in matters relating to the University; 2) to support staff members in the realization of their full potential at the University; and 3) to advance University excellence through their efforts.

They reinforced to the Board that staff assist the Board and the administration in implementing the mission and values of the University. They offered to serve on any committees in which the Board needs staff input. They invited the Board members to attend any of their staff meetings or any executive committee meetings.

**ADDITION TO THE MANUAL OF THE BOARD OF VISITORS ON APPOINTING A NONVOTING FACULTY REPRESENTATIVE AND AMENDMENT TO PROVISION ON APPOINTING A NONVOTING STUDENT REPRESENTATIVE**

WHEREAS, currently, there is a provision in the _Manual of the Board of Visitors_ (the _Manual_) for electing a student representative to the Board, and there has been a student representative for many years; and

WHEREAS, in 2015 the Board added a faculty representative to the Board; however, the Board did not add a section to the _Manual_ similar to the one on the student representative; and

WHEREAS, appointing nonvoting student and faculty representatives to the Board is authorized by state law (Code of Virginia § 23.1-1300); and

WHEREAS, the section of the _Manual_ on appointing a nonvoting student representative requires some minor language changes to conform to the requirements of the authorizing provision of the Code of Virginia;

RESOLVED, the Board of Visitors amends the _Manual of the Board of Visitors_ to add a new section on appointing a nonvoting faculty representative as follows:

SECTION 2.22 FACULTY NONVOTING MEMBER — In addition to those members appointed by the Governor and referred to in Section 2.2, the Board of Visitors at its late spring meeting may appoint a nonvoting, advisory faculty representative to the Board of Visitors for a term of one year commencing July 1.  Such representative shall be chosen from individuals elected by the faculty or by the faculty senate. The faculty member may attend and participate in a nonvoting capacity in all deliberations and meetings, in Open and Closed Session, of the standing and special committees of the Board as well as meetings of the Board of Visitors itself unless the Board has deemed it appropriate to exclude the faculty member from discussions of faculty grievances, faculty or staff disciplinary matters or salaries, or any other matter.

RESOLVED FURTHER, the Board of Visitors amends and replaces in its entirety Section 2.21 of the _Manual of the Board of Visitors_ on appointing a nonvoting student representative to the Board of Visitors as follows:

SECTION 2.21 STUDENT NONVOTING MEMBER — In addition to those members appointed by the Governor and referred to in Section 2.2, the Board of Visitors at the ﬁrst regular meeting of the second semester of the academic session each year shall appoint for a term of one year, on recommendation of the Executive Committee, a full-time student at the University of Virginia as a nonvoting, advisory representative to the Board of Visitors.  The student member may attend and participate in a nonvoting capacity in all deliberations and meetings, in Open and Closed Session, of the standing and special committees of the Board as well as meetings of the Board of Visitors itself unless the Board has deemed it appropriate to exclude the student member from discussions of faculty grievances, faculty or staff disciplinary matters or salaries, or any other matter.

\_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_

**NCAA Orientation**

Mr. Eric Baumgartner educated the Visitors on NCAA rules. Visitors are boosters and must avoid any activity that could violate the athlete recruiting rules. He said boosters may not provide extra benefits to student athletes, i.e. benefits provided to student athletes or their family members that are not provided to the general public. The bottom line is, “ask before you act.”

**ACC Certification**

The Rector read the annual ACC certification statement that designates the chief executive officer of the University as the individual responsible for the athletic program at the University.

On motion, the Board approved the following commending resolutions:

UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA

ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT CHARTER

1.  Mission

The purpose of the University of Virginia's Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) program is to strengthen the University’s ability to achieve its mission and strategic objectives. This is done by effectively managing key risks and seizing opportunities related to the achievement of our strategic objectives. In this context, risk encompasses both negative events (“downside risk”) and opportunities (“upside risk”). An effective ERM program helps the University effectively deploy its resources in pursuit of its objectives.

1.  Scope

The scope of the program includes ERM activities at the Academic Division, Health System, and College at Wise. The ERM function will work closely with the Audit and Compliance functions. Efficiencies are gained through collaboration among the three functions, including:

*   Linking work across enterprise risk, audit, and compliance functions
*   Sharing available resources and knowledge
*   Aligning planning and operational efforts

This collaboration is accomplished while recognizing the distinct roles played by each party. Treasury is responsible for leading ERM within the organization. Compliance is responsible for monitoring and promoting adherence to laws and regulations. Internal Audit is responsible, in part, for examining and evaluating the adequacy and effectiveness of the University’s governance, risk management, and internal controls.

1.  Objectives

In support of the ERM program’s purpose, the objectives of the program include:

*   Creating a framework to effectively identify, assess, and manage risk
*   Ensuring appropriate ownership and accountability of risks
*   Promoting communication and collaboration among risk management activities
*   Providing senior leaders with key information to make risk-informed decisions and to effectively allocate resources
*   Incorporating risk in strategic decision making

1.  Roles and Organization

The President of the University is the owner of the ERM program. Responsibility for administering the program is delegated to the University’s Treasurer. ERM is effected by the University’s Board and leadership and is a collaborative effort at various levels of the organization, including:

Risk Management Networks

Risk Management Networks (“RMN’s”) exist for both the Academic Division and the Health System. Membership consists of higher-level individuals who can (1) provide perspective on industry trends, and (2) have a deep understanding of University operations. Their role is to help identify emerging risks and cascade ERM initiatives into the University’s departments.

Risk Management Council

The Risk Management Council (“RMC”) is comprised of representatives from the major functional areas of the University, including the Health System. The RMC’s objectives are to provide guidance and expertise in helping steer the efforts of the ERM program.  

University Executive Leadership

The RMC will review key risks and mitigation strategies with the University’s executive leadership. Executive leadership will help set the University’s risk appetite, contribute to the assessment of risks, and provide guidance on how to report key risks to the ACR.

The Board of Visitors’ Audit, Compliance, and Risk (“ACR”) Committee

The ACR Committee will:

*   Approve the Enterprise Risk Management Charter
*   Understand the University’s ERM philosophy and approach
*   Provide feedback to improve the effectiveness of the ERM program
*   Review the institution’s risk governance framework including the risk assessment and mitigation strategies.
*   Make appropriate inquiries of management and the Treasurer to determine whether all ERM efforts have the necessary resources and direction to be as effective as possible.

The Treasurer will communicate and interact directly with the Chair of the ACR committee, including in executive sessions and between ACR committee meetings as appropriate.

1.  Charter Review

The ERM Charter should be annually reviewed and, if necessary, updated to determine if the charter continues to reflect the institution’s risk management priorities.

**UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA ATHLETICS COMPLIANCE CHARTER**

The University of Virginia (the “University”) Athletics Compliance Office is designed to ensure that the intercollegiate athletics program is operated within the rules and regulations of the University, the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), and the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). Compliance with these rules and regulations is the shared responsibility of everyone associated with the University. In order for institutional control to be maintained, the NCAA Committee on Infractions developed principles with the idea of assisting institutions to better understand the efforts and attitudes needed in order to create an atmosphere of compliance and institutional control.

As stipulated by NCAA Bylaw 6.1.1 and requirement for participation within the ACC as indicated in Article XI, Section XI-2 of the ACC Bylaws, the ultimate authority and accountability for the University athletics program rests with the University President. The President is appointed by the University Board of Visitors, and through the Board’s delegation of authority the President has ultimate responsibility for the Athletics Department. To share in the responsibilities of NCAA and ACC oversight, the University President delegates day-to-day administration of the University Athletics Department to the Director of Athletics, who in-turn shares that responsibility with the Athletics Compliance Office. In fulfilling the obligation to exercise institutional control, the Athletics Compliance Office has a direct reporting line to the Director of Athletics and to the University President. The University Athletics Compliance Program will interface with student-athletes, coaches, athletic staff members, other University personnel, as well as the University’s alumni and friends. The Athletics Compliance Office will assist coaches and staff by developing and maintaining a compliance program that will educate, monitor, interpret, and report rules violations, if they occur.

As mentioned above, Compliance is a shared responsibility within the University. To ensure the University maintains institutional control and full compliance with applicable rules, departments outside of the Athletics Department have responsibility for certain NCAA, ACC, and University compliance functions, as outlined below:

Faculty Athletics Representative (FAR): The FAR serves as a liaison for the President between the University Faculty and the Athletics Department; reviews student-athlete grade distribution at the end of each academic term; reviews and approves student-athlete grade changes; serves as the ACC’s voting representative for institutional positioning on NCAA/ACC legislation, and may serve the same role for the NCAA’s voting representative if need be as directed by the President; and assists in review of potential academic misconduct/impermissible academic assistance allegations/violations.

Admissions: The Office of Undergraduate Admission has ultimate responsibility to determine which prospective student-athletes are admitted to the University. The Athletics Department will have designated liaisons who may speak with Admission regarding a prospective student-athlete’s admission.

University Registrar (UREG): The University Registrar is the certifying officer for all student-athlete academic eligibility, including initial, continuing, and transfer eligibility certification; full-time enrollment; and NCAA Academic Performance Review cohort review.

Student Financial Services (SFS): The SFS office is the certifying officer for student-athlete financial aid; responsible for squad list production/completion; outside award certification; and athletic aid renewal/non-renewal notifications.

Athletic Academic Affairs: The Athletic Academic Affairs office collaboratively works with UREG and the Athletics Compliance Office to monitor student-athlete eligibility; and communicates with faculty and staff regarding student-athletes’ academic requirements for NCAA academic purposes since only academic advisors within the University departments can add student-athletes to courses.

Institutional Assessment and Studies: The Office of Institutional Assessment and Studies is responsible for tracking and reporting graduation rate and Graduation Success Rate cohort review.

Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer and Assistant Vice President for Institutional Compliance: During quarterly meetings with the Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, the Assistant Vice President for Institutional Compliance, and the University President’s Chief of Staff, the Athletics Compliance Office reviews any compliance concerns, reporting requirements, potential violations, and the results of any external compliance reviews. In addition, the Athletics Compliance Office meets bimonthly with the University’s Compliance Network to share compliance-related concerns, trends, and best-practices.

**Purpose:** Pursuant to Chapters 699 and 704 of the 2017 Acts of Assembly, the following updated process is provided to the University’s Board of Visitors for approval. Any subsequent changes to these procedures will be submitted to the Department of General Services (DGS) for review and comment, and to the Board of Visitors for approval.

**Procedure:** In accordance with Chapters 699 and 704 of the 2017 Acts of Assembly, and subject to Subchapter 3 of the Restructuring Act and the associated Management Agreement between the Commonwealth of Virginia and the University of Virginia, the University shall have and shall exercise all authority relating to the procurement of construction. Documentation adopted by the University and approved by the Board of Visitors identifies procurement procedures for capital construction.

The University of Virginia Associate Vice President and Chief Facilities Officer (AVP & CFO) shall approve construction delivery methods, and any exceptions, in writing on a project specific basis.

A written recommendation for the construction delivery method will be provided to the AVP & CFO through the Director of Facilities Planning & Construction (FP&C) in consultation with the University management team comprised of the University Project Manager, the FP&C Division Director, and the Construction Services and Contract Administration Director. FP&C completes a risk analysis for each project, and if competitive sealed bidding is not selected, the written recommendation will justify why sealed bidding is not practicable and/or fiscally advantageous to the University. Written documentation will be in a Determination and Findings (D&F) format.

**Risk Analysis:** The following critical components will be considered in recommending the appropriate construction delivery method for each project:

*   Risk management and overall benefit to the University
*   Technical complexity and building use
*   Required experience with specialty systems or equipment/prequalification
*   Schedule, schedule challenges, schedule efficiencies, and critical completion dates
*   Coordination of phased or fast-track construction to expedite overall project completion

The moneys in each Fund shall be held in trust and applied as provided herein and in the Released Series Resolution and, pending such application, shall be pledged to, and subject to a lien and charge in favor, of the Bondholders of the Related Bonds and for the further security of such Bondholders until paid out or transferred as provided herein and in the Released Series Resolution.

**Moneys Held in Trust**. All moneys from the funds of the University or that the University shall have received from any other source and set aside or deposited with any Paying Agent for the purpose of paying any of the Bonds hereby secured, either at the maturity thereof or upon call for redemption, shall be held in trust for the Bondholders of the Related Bonds. Any moneys which shall be so set aside or deposited and which shall remain unclaimed by the Bondholders of the Related Bonds for the period of five (5) years after the date on which the Related Bonds shall have become due and payable shall be disposed of by the University and the Paying Agent in accordance with The Uniform Disposition of Unclaimed Property Act, Chapter 11.1, Title 55, Code of Virginia of 1950, as amended (the "Unclaimed Property Act").

**Additional Indebtedness and Encumbrances**. Except as otherwise provided in this Section, nothing in this Program Resolution shall be construed as prohibiting or limiting in any way the right of the University to incur other Credit Obligations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, the University may only incur the following types of Credit Obligations in the event the conditions set forth below are met in each instance:

Limitation on Parity Credit Obligations. The University may incur, assume, guarantee or otherwise become liable on any Parity Credit Obligation, but only if, prior to the incurrence of each such Parity Credit Obligation, an Authorized Officer certifies in writing that (1) taking into account the incurrence of such proposed Parity Credit Obligation (i) the University will have sufficient funds to meet all of its financial obligations, including its obligations to pay principal of and interest on all Credit Obligations, for all Fiscal Years to and including the second full Fiscal Year after the later of (A) the issuance of such Parity Credit Obligation and (B) the completion of any facility financed with the proceeds of such Parity Credit Obligation, and (ii) such Authorized Officer has no reason to believe that the University will not have sufficient funds to pay all amounts due under all indebtedness of the University during the term of such proposed Parity Credit Obligation, and (2) to the best of his or her knowledge, the University is not in default in the performance and observance of any of the provisions of this Program Resolution. Any such Parity Credit Obligation shall be secured by a pledge of Pledged Revenues on a parity with the pledge of Pledged Revenues herein, unless expressly subordinated to the pledge hereof.

Limitation on Section 9(c) Credit Obligations. The University may incur, assume, guarantee or otherwise become liable on any Credit Obligation pursuant to the provisions of Article X, Section 9(c) of the Constitution of Virginia, as such section may be amended from time to time, and may pledge and apply such portion of the Pledged Revenues as may be necessary to provide for the payment of any such Credit Obligation, the funding of reasonable reserves therefor, or the payment of operating and other reasonable expenses of the facilities financed in whole or in part with the proceeds of such Credit Obligation or facilities reasonably related to such facilities, and such pledge shall be senior and superior in all respects to the pledge of Pledged Revenues securing the Bonds and any other Parity Credit Obligations, but only if, prior to the incurrence of each such Credit Obligation, an Authorized Officer of the University certifies in writing that (1) taking into account the incurrence of such proposed Credit Obligation (i) the University will have sufficient funds to meet all of its financial obligations, including its obligations to pay principal of and interest on all Credit Obligations, for all Fiscal Years to and including the second full Fiscal Year after the later of (A) the issuance of such proposed Credit Obligation and (B) the completion of any facility financed with the proceeds of such proposed Credit Obligation, and (ii) such Authorized Officer has no reason to believe that the University will not have sufficient funds to pay all amounts due under all indebtedness of the University during the term of such proposed Credit Obligation, (2) to the best of his or her knowledge, the University is not in default in the performance and observance of any of the provisions of this Program Resolution, and (3) in connection with the issuance of such proposed Credit Obligation, the University has received an opinion of Bond Counsel to the effect that such proposed Credit Obligation has been validly issued under Article X, Section 9(c) of the Constitution of Virginia.

Limitation on Other Credit Obligations, Including Section 9(d) Credit Obligations. The University may incur, assume, guarantee or otherwise become liable on any Credit Obligation not described elsewhere in this Section 6.2, including any Credit Obligation incurred pursuant to the provisions of Article X, Section 9(d) of the Constitution of Virginia, as such section may be amended from time to time, and may pledge and apply such portion of the Pledged Revenues as may be necessary for the payment of any such Credit Obligation, the funding of reasonable reserves therefor, or the payment of operating and other reasonable expenses of the facilities financed in whole or in part with the proceeds of such Credit Obligation or facilities reasonably related to such facilities and such pledge shall be senior and superior in all respects to the pledge of Pledged Revenues securing the Bonds and any other Parity Credit Obligations, but only if, prior to the incurrence of each such Credit Obligation, an Authorized Officer of the University certifies in writing that (1) taking into account the incurrence of such proposed Credit Obligation (i) the University will have sufficient funds to meet all of its financial obligations, including its obligations to pay principal of and interest on all Credit Obligations, for all Fiscal Years to and including the second full Fiscal Year after the later of (A) the issuance of such proposed Credit Obligation and (B) the completion of any facility financed with the proceeds of such proposed Credit Obligation, and (ii) such Authorized Officer has no reason to believe that the University will not have sufficient funds to pay all amounts due under all indebtedness of the University during the term of such proposed Credit Obligation, (2) to the best of his or her knowledge, the University is not in default in the performance and observance of any of the provisions of this Program Resolution, and (3) the University has received an opinion of Bond Counsel to the effect that such proposed Credit Obligation has been validly issued under the relevant provisions of the Constitution of Virginia.

Limitation on Issuance of Indebtedness on a Parity with Qualifying Senior Obligations. Except for Credit Obligations issued pursuant to subsections (b) or (c) above or to refund any Qualifying Senior Obligation as described in subsection (e) below, no additional bonds or other obligations may be issued or incurred by the University on a parity with any Qualifying Senior Obligation.

Limitation on Additional Encumbrances. The University shall not encumber the Pledged Revenues in any manner (except as permitted in connection with Credit Obligations issued pursuant to subsections (a), (b) or (c) above or to refund any Qualifying Senior Obligation as described below), unless any such encumbrance is made junior and subordinate in all respects to the liens, pledges, covenants and agreements of this Program Resolution. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, however, the University may issue bonds to refund any Qualifying Senior Obligation and to secure such refunding bonds with the same source of revenues securing the Qualifying Senior Obligation being refunded. Upon the defeasance of the refunded Qualifying Senior Obligation pursuant to any such refunding, the refunding bonds will be considered Qualifying Senior Obligations for all purposes.

**Disposition of Assets**. The University may convey, sell or otherwise dispose of any property of the University as long as (1) such conveyance, sale or encumbrance is in the ordinary course of business, or (2) an Authorized Officer certifies in writing that, taking into account the conveyance, sale or other disposition of such property (i) the University will have sufficient funds to meet all of its financial obligations, including its obligations to pay principal of and interest on all Credit Obligations for all Fiscal Years to and including the second full Fiscal Year after such conveyance, sale or other disposition and (ii) such Authorized Officer has no reason to believe that the University will not have sufficient funds to pay all amounts due under all indebtedness of the University then outstanding.

**Insurance**. The University covenants that it will at all times carry or cause to be carried insurance policies with a responsible insurance company or companies, qualified to assume the risks thereof, or that it will maintain an adequate program of self-insurance, in either case sufficient to provide the University with insurance in such amount and covering such risks as the University shall deem to be reasonable and desirable.

**Further Instruments and Actions**. The University covenants that it will, from time to time, execute and deliver such further instruments and take such further action as may be required to carry out the purposes of this Program Resolution.

**Accurate Records and Accounts**. The University covenants that it will keep accurate records and accounts of all items of cost and of all expenditures relating to Pledged Revenues collected and the application of such Pledged Revenues.

EVENTS OF DEFAULT AND REMEDIES**

**Events of Default**. Each of the following events is hereby declared to be an "Event of Default" under this Program Resolution:

due and punctual payment of the principal, purchase price, or redemption premium, if any, of any of the Bonds is not made when the same become due and payable, either at maturity or by proceedings for purchase or redemption or otherwise;

due and punctual payment of any interest on any of the Bonds is not made when the same becomes due and payable;

the University, for any reason, is rendered incapable of fulfilling its obligations hereunder or under any Series Resolution or other Supplemental Resolution;

an order or decree is entered, with the consent or acquiescence of the University, appointing a receiver or receivers of the University or any part thereof or of the revenues thereof, or if such order or decree, having been entered without the consent or acquiescence of the University, is not vacated or discharged or stayed on appeal within sixty (60) days after the entry thereof;

any proceeding is instituted, with the consent or acquiescence of the University, for the purpose of effecting a composition between the University and its creditors or for the purpose of adjusting the claims of such creditors pursuant to any federal or state statute now or hereafter enacted; or

the University defaults in the due and punctual performance of any other of the covenants, conditions, agreements and provisions contained in the Bonds, in this Program Resolution or in any Series Resolution or other Supplemental Resolution on the part of the University to be performed, and such default continues for thirty (30) days after written notice specifying such default and requiring same to be remedied is given to the Board by any Bondholder, provided that if such default is such that it can be corrected but cannot be corrected within such thirty (30) day period, it shall not constitute an Event of Default if corrective action is instituted by the University within such period and is diligently pursued until the default is corrected.

**Remedies**. (a) Upon the happening and continuance of an Event of Default, hereunder, the Bondholders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Bonds then outstanding, by instrument or instruments filed with the University and proved or acknowledged in the same manner as a deed to be recorded, may appoint a trustee to represent the Bondholders of the Bonds for the purposes herein, which trustee may be the State Treasurer and shall be the same trustee so appointed with respect to all other outstanding Parity Credit Obligations. Such trustee may, and upon written request of the Bondholders of not less than 25% aggregate in principal amount of the Bonds then outstanding shall, in its own name:

by mandamus or other suit, action or proceeding at law or in equity enforce all rights of the Bondholders of the Bonds, including the right to require the University and its Board to collect fees, rents, charges or other revenues adequate to carry out an agreement as to, or pledge of, such revenues, and to require the University and Board to carry out any other agreements with the Bondholders of the Bonds and to perform it and their duties under the Act;

bring suit upon the Bonds;

by action or suit in equity, require the University to account as if it were the trustee of an express trust for the Bondholders of the Bonds; or

by action or suit in equity, enjoin any acts or things which may be unlawful or in violation of the rights of the Bondholders of the Bonds.

Any such trustee, whether or not all such Bonds have been declared due and payable, shall be entitled as of right to the appointment of a receiver who may enter and take possession of any property of the University any of the revenues from which are pledged for the security of the Bonds and operate and maintain the same and collect and receive all fees, rents, charges and other revenues thereafter arising therefrom in the same manner as the University itself might do and shall deposit all such moneys in a separate account and apply the same in such manner as the court appointing such receiver shall direct. In any suit, action or proceeding by the trustee the fees, counsel fees and expenses of the trustee and of the receiver, if any, shall constitute taxable costs and disbursements and all costs and disbursements allowed by the court shall be a first charge on any fees, rents, charges and other revenues of the University pledged for the security of the Bonds.

Such trustee shall, in addition to the foregoing, have and possess all of the powers necessary or appropriate for the exercise of any functions specifically set forth herein or incident to the general representation of the Bondholders of the Bonds in the enforcement and protection of their rights.

To the extent permitted by law, upon the happening and continuance of any Event of Default, then and in every such case any Bondholder may proceed, subject to the provisions of Section 7.5, to protect and enforce the rights of the Bondholders by a suit, action or special proceeding in equity or at law, either for the specific performance of any covenant or agreement contained herein or in aid or execution of any power herein granted or for the enforcement of any proper legal or equitable remedy as such Bondholder shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce such rights.

**Pro Rata Application of Funds**. Anything in this Program Resolution to the contrary notwithstanding, except as otherwise provided in Section 7.2(a), if at any time the moneys available in the Debt Service Funds shall not be sufficient to pay the interest on or the principal of the Bonds as the same shall become due and payable, such moneys, together with any moneys then available or thereafter becoming available for such purpose, whether through the exercise of the remedies provided for in this Article or otherwise, shall be applied as follows:

If the principal of all the Bonds shall not have become due and payable, all such moneys shall be applied first to the payment of any fees and expenses of the Custodian, Paying Agent and Registrar and thereafter shall be applied:

first: to the payment to the persons entitled thereto of all installments of interest then due and payable in the order in which such installments became due and payable and, if the amount available shall not be sufficient to pay in full any particular installment, then to the payment, ratably, according to the amounts due on such installment, to the persons entitled thereto, without any discrimination or preference except as to any difference in the respective rates of interest specified in the Bonds; and

second: to the payment to the persons entitled thereto of the unpaid principal of any of the Bonds which shall have become due and payable (other than Bonds called for redemption for the payment of which moneys are held pursuant to the provisions of this Program Resolution), in the order of their due dates, with interest on the principal amount of such Bonds at the respective rates specified therein from the respective dates upon which such Bonds became due and payable, and, if the amount available shall not be sufficient to pay in full the principal of the Bonds due and payable on any particular date, together with such interest, then to the payment first of such interest, ratably, according to the amount of such interest due on such date, and then to the payment of such principal, ratably, according to the amount of such principal due on such date, to the persons entitled thereto without any discrimination or preference.

If the principal of all the Bonds shall have become due and payable, all such moneys shall be applied to the payment of the principal and interest then due and unpaid on the Bonds, without preference or priority of principal over interest or interest over principal, or of any installment of interest over any other installment of interest, or of any Bond over any other Bond, ratably, according to the amounts due, respectively, for principal and interest, to the persons entitled thereto, without any discrimination or preference.

Whenever moneys are to be applied by the trustee pursuant to the provisions of this Section, such moneys shall be applied by the trustee at such times, and from time to time, as the trustee in his or her sole discretion shall determine, having due regard to the amount of such moneys available for application and the likelihood of additional moneys becoming available for such application in the future; the deposit of such moneys with any Paying Agent, or otherwise setting aside such moneys, in trust for the proper purpose shall constitute proper application by the trustee; and the trustee shall incur no liability whatsoever to the Board, to any Bondholder or to any other person for any delay in applying any such moneys, so long as the trustee acts with reasonable diligence, having due regard to the circumstances, and ultimately applies the same in accordance with such provisions of this Program Resolution as may be applicable at the time of application by the trustee. Whenever the trustee shall exercise such discretion in applying such moneys, he or she shall fix the date (which shall be an Interest Payment Date unless the trustee shall deem another date more suitable) upon which such application is to be made and upon such date interest on the amounts of principal to be paid on such date shall cease to accrue. The trustee shall give such notice (or shall cause the Paying Agent to give such notice) as he or she may deem appropriate of the fixing of any such date and shall not be required to make payment to the Bondholder of any Bond until such Bond shall be surrendered to the trustee or any Paying Agent for appropriate endorsement, or for cancellation if fully paid.

Notwithstanding anything in this Program Resolution to the contrary, this Section 7.3 shall be interpreted so that the term "Bonds" shall include the Bonds and any other Parity Credit Obligations. In each resolution authorizing the issuance of any other Parity Credit Obligation, the University agrees to provide for the trustee or paying agent thereunder to be the same entity as under this Program Resolution, and further agrees to include provisions substantially identical to those contained in this Section 7.3.

**Effect of Discontinuance of Proceedings**. In case any proceeding taken by any Bondholder on account of any Event of Default shall have been discontinued or abandoned for any reason, then and in every such case the University and the Bondholders shall be restored to their former positions and rights hereunder, respectively, and all rights and remedies of the Bondholders shall continue as though no such proceeding had been taken.

**Proceedings for Equal Benefit of All Bondholders**. No Bondholder shall have any right in any manner whatever to affect, disturb or prejudice the security of this Program Resolution or any Series Resolution or to enforce any right hereunder or thereunder except in the manner herein provided, and all proceedings at law or in equity shall be instituted, had and maintained for the equal benefit of all Bondholders.

**No Remedy Exclusive**. No remedy herein conferred on the Bondholders is intended to be exclusive of any other remedy or remedies, and each and every remedy conferred shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to every other remedy given hereunder and under the Act or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute.

**No Delay or Omission Construed to Be a Waiver**. No delay or omission of any Bondholder to exercise any right or power accruing upon any Event of Default occurring and continuing as aforesaid shall impair any such right or power or shall be construed to be a waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence therein; and every power and remedy given by this Article to the Bondholders may be exercised from time to time and as often as may be deemed expedient.

**EXECUTION OF INSTRUMENTS BY BONDHOLDERS AND  
PROOF OF OWNERSHIP OF THE BondS**

**Execution of Instruments; Proof of Ownership**. Any request, direction, consent or other instrument in writing required or permitted by this Program Resolution or any Series Resolution to be signed or executed by Bondholders may be in any number of concurrent instruments of similar tenor and may be signed or executed by such Bondholders or their attorneys or legal representatives. Proof of the execution of any such instrument and of the ownership of the Bonds shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Program Resolution or any Series Resolution and shall be conclusive in favor of the University and the Paying Agent with regard to any action taken by them under such instrument if made in the following manner:

The fact and date of the execution by any person of any such instrument may be proved by the verification of any officer in any jurisdiction who, by the laws thereof, has power to take affidavits within such jurisdiction, to the effect that such instrument was subscribed and sworn to before him or her, or by an affidavit of a witness to such execution. Where such execution is by an officer of a corporation or association or a member of a partnership on behalf of such corporation, association or partnership such verification or affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of his or her authority.

The fact of the holding of the Bonds hereunder by any Bondholder and the amount and the numbers of such Bonds and the date of its holding the same shall be proved by the registration books kept under the provisions of Section 2.7.

**  
  
SUPPLEMENTAL RESOLUTIONS**

**Supplemental Resolutions**. The University may, from time to time and at any time, without the consent of any Bondholders of the Bonds, adopt such resolutions supplemental to this Program Resolution or any Supplemental Resolutions as shall not be inconsistent with the terms and provisions hereof or thereof (which Supplemental Resolutions shall thereafter form a part hereof), as follows:

The Paying Agent undertakes to perform only such duties as are expressly set forth herein and in each Series Resolution. The duties and responsibilities of the Paying Agent hereunder shall be determined solely by the express provisions of this Program Resolution and in each Series Resolution, and no further duties or responsibilities shall be implied. The Paying Agent shall not have any liability under, nor duty to inquire into the terms and provisions of, any agreement or instructions, other than as outlined in this Program Resolution and in each Series Resolution. The Paying Agent may consult with counsel and may rely conclusively and shall be protected in acting or refraining from acting upon any written notice, opinion, electronically transmitted communication, instruction or request furnished to it hereunder and believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties. The Paying Agent shall be under no duty to inquire into or investigate the validity, accuracy or content of any such document. The Paying Agent shall have no duty to solicit any payments that may be due it hereunder. The Paying Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted by it in good faith unless a court of competent jurisdiction determines that any loss to the University was the result of the Paying Agent's negligent or willful misconduct. The Paying Agent shall not incur any liability for following the instructions herein contained or expressly provided for, or written instructions given by the University. In the administration of its duties under this Program Resolution, the Paying Agent may execute any of its powers and perform its duties hereunder directly or through agents or attorneys and may consult with counsel, accountants and other skilled persons to be selected and retained by it. The Paying Agent shall not be liable for anything done, suffered or omitted in good faith by it in accordance with the advice or opinion of any such counsel, accountants or other skilled persons. The Paying Agent may resign and be discharged of its duties and obligations hereunder and under each Series Resolution by giving notice in writing of such resignation specifying a date when such resignation shall take effect. Any corporation or association into which the Paying Agent in its individual capacity may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation or association resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Paying Agent in its individual capacity shall be a party, or any corporation or association to which all or substantially all the corporate trust business of the Paying Agent in its individual capacity may be sold or otherwise transferred, shall be the Paying Agent hereunder without further act. The University covenants and agrees to pay the Paying Agent its fees and expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees, costs and expenses) as agreed upon by the University and the Paying Agent. Furthermore, the University shall pay the Paying Agent for any extraordinary services or expenses performed or incurred by the Paying Agent in connection with its duties under this Program Resolution provided the University consents in writing prior to the performance of such services or the incurring of such expenses.

The Paying Agent shall not be responsible or liable for any failure or delay in the performance of its obligation under this Program Resolution arising out of or caused, directly or indirectly, by circumstances beyond its reasonable control, including, without limitation, acts of God, earthquakes, fire, flood, hurricanes or other storms; wars, terrorism, similar military disturbances; sabotage; epidemic, riots, interruptions; loss or malfunctions of utilities, computer (hardware or software) or communications services; accidents; labor disputes; acts of civil or military authority or governmental action; it being understood that the Paying Agent shall use commercially reasonable efforts which are consistent with accepted practices in the banking industry to resume performance as soon as reasonably practicable under the circumstances.

The Paying Agent shall have the right to accept and act upon instructions, including funds transfer instructions ("Instructions") given pursuant to this Program Resolution and delivered using Electronic Means; provided, however, that the University shall provide to the Paying Agent an incumbency certificate listing Authorized Officers and containing specimen signatures of such Authorized Officers, which incumbency certificate shall be amended by the University whenever a person is to be added or deleted from the listing. If the University elects to give the Paying Agent Instructions using Electronic Means and the Paying Agent in its discretion elects to act upon such Instructions, the Paying Agent's understanding of such Instructions shall be deemed controlling. The University understands and agrees that the Paying Agent cannot determine the identity of the actual sender of such Instructions and that the Paying Agent shall conclusively presume that directions that purport to have been sent by an Authorized Officer listed on the incumbency certificate provided to the Paying Agent have been sent by such Authorized Officer. The University shall be responsible for ensuring that only Authorized Officers transmit such Instructions to the Paying Agent and that the University and all respective Authorized Officers are solely responsible to safeguard the use and confidentiality of applicable user and authorization codes, passwords and/or authentication keys upon receipt by the University. The Paying Agent shall not be liable for any losses, costs or expenses arising directly or indirectly from the Paying Agent's reliance upon and compliance with such Instructions notwithstanding such directions conflict or are inconsistent with a subsequent written instruction. The University agrees: (i) to assume all risks arising out of the use of Electronic Means to submit Instructions to the Paying Agent, including without limitation the risk of the Paying Agent acting on unauthorized Instructions, and the risk of interception and misuse by third parties; (ii) that it is fully informed of the protections and risks associated with the various methods of transmitting Instructions to the Paying Agent and that there may be more secure methods of transmitting Instructions than the method(s) selected by the University; (iii) that the security procedures (if any) to be followed in connection with its transmission of Instructions provide to it a commercially reasonable degree of protection in light of its particular needs and circumstances; and (iv) to notify the Paying Agent immediately upon learning of any compromise or unauthorized use of the security procedures.

By Chapter 10, Title 23.1 of the Code of Virginia of 1950, as amended (the "Act"), the University entered into a management agreement with the Commonwealth which was enacted as Chapter 3 of Chapter 933 of the 2006 Virginia Acts of Assembly, as amended, pursuant to which the University is classified as a public institution of higher education and the University is empowered with the authority to undertake and implement the acquisition of any interest in land, including improvements on the acquired land at the time of acquisition, new construction, improvements or renovations and to borrow money and make, issue and sell bonds of the University for such purposes, including the refinancing of any such facilities.

On \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, 2017, the Board adopted its Master Bond Resolution (Multi-Year Capital Program) (as supplemented and amended from time to time, the "Program Resolution"), under which the University is authorized to issue one or more Series of Bonds (as defined in the Program Resolution).

Pursuant to the Authorizing Resolution, the Board also determined to finance and refinance up to $\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ of the costs of the Projects through the issuance of a Series of Bonds.

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE BOARD:

**Form of the Series 2017C Bonds**. The Series 2017C Bonds shall be substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit A, with such appropriate variations, omissions and insertions as permitted or required by this Series Resolution.

**Terms and Conditions for Issuance and Delivery of the Series 2017C Bonds**. The Series 2017C Bonds authorized by this Series Resolution shall be executed in the form and manner hereinabove set forth and shall be deposited with the Registrar for delivery to the Underwriters pursuant to the Bond Purchase Agreement, but before the Series 2017C Bonds shall be delivered by the Registrar, there shall be filed with the Registrar the following:

the items required under Section 4.2 of the Program Resolution;

a copy, certified by the Secretary of the Board, of this Series Resolution;

an opinion of Bond Counsel (upon which the Registrar can rely) stating that the Series 2017C Bonds have been duly authorized, executed and delivered in accordance with the Act and this Resolution, that the Series 2017C Bonds and this Series Resolution constitute valid and binding limited obligations of the University, payable solely from the Pledged Revenues and other property pledged therefor under this Resolution.

When the documents mentioned above in this Section shall have been filed with the Registrar and when the Series 2017C Bonds shall have been executed as required by this Series Resolution, the Registrar shall authenticate and deliver such Bonds to or upon the order of the Underwriters pursuant to the Bond Purchase Agreement, but only upon payment to the Custodian of the purchase price of such Bonds. The Registrar shall be entitled to rely upon such Bond Purchase Agreement as to the names of the purchasers and the amount of such purchase price.

The proceeds of such Bonds shall be deposited by the Custodian as described in Section 4.1.

**Book Entry Provisions**. The provisions of this Section 2.5 shall apply to the Series 2017C Bonds so long as all of the Series 2017C Bonds shall be maintained in book-entry form with a Securities Depository, any other provisions of this Series Resolution to the contrary notwithstanding.

The principal or redemption price of and interest on the Series 2017C Bonds shall be payable to the Securities Depository, or registered assigns, as the registered owner of the Series 2017C Bonds, in same day funds on each date on which the principal of, and premium, if any, or interest on the Series 2017C Bonds is due as set forth in this Series Resolution and in the Series 2017C Bonds. Such payments shall be made to the offices of the Securities Depository specified by the Securities Depository to the University and Paying Agent in writing. Without notice to or the consent of the beneficial owners of the Series 2017C Bonds, the University and the Securities Depository may agree in writing to make payments of principal and interest in a manner different from that set out herein. If such different manner of payment is agreed upon, the University shall give the Paying Agent written notice thereof, and the Paying Agent shall make payments as if set forth herein. Neither the University nor the Paying Agent shall have any obligation with respect to the transfer or crediting of the appropriate principal, premium, if any, and interest payments to participants of the Securities Depository or the beneficial owners of the Series 2017C Bonds or their nominees.

The Paying Agent at the written direction of the University may replace any Securities Depository as the depository for the Series 2017C Bonds with another qualified securities depository or discontinue the maintenance of the Series 2017C Bonds in book-entry form at any time if the University determines to do so. Notice of any determination above shall be given to such Securities Depository at least 30 days prior to any such discontinuation (or such fewer number of days as shall be acceptable to such Securities Depository). The University may undertake to locate a qualified replacement Securities Depository and/or may discontinue the book-entry system of evidencing ownership of the Series 2017C Bonds.

If the University discontinues the maintenance of the Series 2017C Bonds in book-entry form, the University will issue replacement Series 2017C Bonds directly to the participants in the former Securities Depository or, to the extent requested by any such participant, to the beneficial owners of the Series 2017C Bonds as further described in this Section. At the written direction of the University, the Paying Agent shall notify participants and the beneficial owners of the Series 2017C Bonds, by mailing an appropriate notice to the Securities Depository, or by other means deemed appropriate by either the Securities Depository or the Paying Agent, that the University will issue replacement Series 2017C Bonds directly to the participants shown on the records of the Securities Depository or, to the extent requested by any participant, to beneficial owners of the Series 2017C Bonds shown on the records of such participant, as of a date set forth in such notice, which shall be a date at least 10 days after receipt of such notice by the Securities Depository (or such fewer number of days as shall be acceptable to the Securities Depository).

In the event that replacement Series 2017C Bonds are to be issued to participants in the Securities Depository or to beneficial owners of the Series 2017C Bonds, the University shall promptly have prepared replacement Series 2017C Bonds registered in the names of the participants as shown on the records of the former Securities Depository or, to the extent requested by any participant, in the names of the beneficial owners of Series 2017C Bonds shown on the records of such participant, as of the date set forth in the notice delivered in accordance with the immediately preceding paragraph. Replacement Series 2017C Bonds issued to participants in the Securities Depository or to beneficial owners shall be in fully registered form substantially in the form of Exhibit A. The form set forth in Exhibit A may be modified to include any variations, omissions or insertions that are necessary or desirable in the delivery of replacement certificates in printed form. In delivering replacement certificates, the Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely, without independent investigation, on the records of the former Securities Depository as to its participants and the records of the participants acting on behalf of the beneficial owners. The Series 2017C Bonds will thereafter be registrable and exchangeable as set forth in Sections 2.6 and 2.7 of the Program Resolution.

So long as there is a Securities Depository for the Series 2017C Bonds, (1) such Securities Depository shall be the registered owner of the Series 2017C Bonds, (2) transfers of ownership and exchanges shall be effected on the records of the Securities Depository and its participants pursuant to rules and procedures established by such Securities Depository and its participants, and (3) references in this Series Resolution to Bondholders, Holders or registered owners of the Series 2017C Bonds shall mean the Securities Depository and shall not mean the beneficial owners of the Series 2017C Bonds.

If the University replaces any Securities Depository as the depository for the Series 2017C Bonds with another qualified Securities Depository, replacement Series 2017C Bonds issued to such replacement Securities Depository shall have the same terms, form and content as the Series 2017C Bonds initially registered in the name of the predecessor Securities Depository or its nominee except for the name of the registered owner.

Each Securities Depository and the participants thereof and the beneficial owners of the Series 2017C Bonds, by their acceptance of the Series 2017C Bonds, agree that the University and the Paying Agent shall have no liability or responsibility with respect to (1) the accuracy of any records maintained by such Securities Depository or any Securities Depository participant; (2) the payment by such Securities Depository to any Securities Depository participant or by any Securities Depository participant to any beneficial owner of any amount due in respect of the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on the Series 2017C Bonds; (3) the delivery or timeliness of delivery by such Securities Depository to any Securities Depository participant or by any Securities Depository participant to any beneficial owner of any notice which is given to Bondholders; (4) the selection of the beneficial owners to receive payment in the event of any partial redemption of the Series 2017C Bonds; or (5) any consent given or other action taken by such Securities Depository or any nominee of such Securities Depository, as Bondholder.

**Series Resolution**. This Series Resolution is adopted as a Supplemental Resolution pursuant to Section 4.2 and Section 9.1(b) of the Program Resolution.

The Series 2017C Bonds are hereby found, determined and declared to constitute "Bonds" within the meaning of the Program Resolution. The Series 2017C Bonds are entitled to the benefits, security and protection of the Program Resolution, equally and proportionally with any other Bonds issued under the Program Resolution, shall be payable from the Pledged revenues on a parity with all other Bonds, without priority or distinction by reason of Series, number, date, date of sale, date of issuance, Mode or otherwise.

**  
  
REDEMPTION OF THE SERIES 2017C BONDS**

**Redemption of the Series 2017C Bonds**. The Series 2017C Bonds shall not be subject to prior redemption except as provided in this Article III.

The Series 2017C Bonds are subject to redemption, at the option of the University, in whole or in part on any date, at a redemption price equal to the greater of:

100% of the principal amount of the Series 2017C Bonds to be redeemed; or

the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to the maturity date of the Series 2017C Bonds to be redeemed, not including any portion of those payments of interest accrued and unpaid as of the date on which the Series 2017C Bonds are to be redeemed, discounted to the date on which the Series 2017C Bonds are to be redeemed on a semi-annual basis, assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months, at the Treasury Rate, plus \_\_\_\_ basis points;

plus, in each case, accrued interest on the Series 2017C Bonds to be redeemed to the redemption date.

_Reserved._ – Mandatory Redemption.

\[The Series 2017C Bonds shall also be subject to redemption in whole or in part on any date, at the option of the University, from the proceeds of casualty insurance or condemnation awards, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed, without premium, plus accrued interest to the redemption date, if all or any part of the Project financed with the Series 2017C Bonds is damaged or destroyed or taken through the exercise of the power of eminent domain and the President, Chief Operating Officer or Chief Financial Officer has delivered a certificate to the Custodian to the effect that the University has determined not to use such proceeds to replace or rebuild the damaged, destroyed or taken property. In the event of a redemption in part pursuant to this paragraph, the University shall redeem the Series 2017C Bonds from each maturity then outstanding, to the extent practicable, in the proportion that the principal amount of the Series 2017C Bonds of such maturity bears to the total principal amount of the Series 2017C Bonds then outstanding.\] **_– TO BE DISCUSSED_**

If the Series 2017C Bonds are registered in book-entry only form and so long as a Securities Depository is the sole registered owner of the Series 2017C Bonds, if less than all of the Series 2017C Bonds of a maturity are called for prior redemption, the particular Series 2017C Bonds or portions thereof to be redeemed shall be selected on a pro-rata pass-through distribution of principal basis in accordance with the procedures of the Securities Depository; provided that, so long as the Series 2017C Bonds are held in book-entry form, the selection for redemption of such Series 2017C Bonds shall be made in accordance with the operational arrangements of the Securities Depository then in effect. If the Securities Depository's operational arrangements do not allow for the redemption of the Series 2017C Bonds on a pro rata pass-through distribution of principal basis as discussed above, then the Series 2017C Bonds will be selected for redemption, in accordance with the procedures of the Securities Depository, by lot. If a Securities Depository is no longer the sole registered owner of the Series 2017C Bonds, if less than all of the Series 2017C Bonds are called for redemption, the Paying Agent will select the Series 2017C Bonds to be redeemed on a pro rata basis.

**Notice of Redemption**. Whenever the Series 2017C Bonds are to be redeemed under the provisions of this Series Resolution, the Paying Agent shall, not less than thirty (30) nor more than sixty (60) days prior to the redemption date, mail notice of redemption to all registered owners of all Series 2017C Bonds to be redeemed at their registered addresses. The Paying Agent shall also mail a copy of any such notice of redemption to any Rating Agency. Any such notice of redemption shall identify the Series 2017C Bonds to be redeemed, shall specify the redemption date and the redemption price, and shall state that on the redemption date the Series 2017C Bonds called for redemption will be payable at the Designated Office of the Paying Agent and that from that date interest will cease to accrue. The Paying Agent may use "CUSIP" numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Bondholders, provided that any such notice shall state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Series 2017C Bonds or as contained in any such notice.

If at the time of mailing of notice of any optional redemption the University shall not have caused to be deposited with the Paying Agent money sufficient to redeem all the Series 2017C Bonds called for redemption, such notice may state that it is conditional in that it is subject to the deposit of such moneys with the Paying Agent not later than the redemption date, and such notice shall be of no effect unless such moneys are so deposited. Failure by the Paying Agent to give any notice of redemption or any defect in such notice as to any particular Bonds shall not affect the validity of the call for redemption of any Bonds in respect of which no such failure or defect has occurred. Any notice mailed as provided in this Series Resolution shall be conclusively presumed to have been given whether or not actually received by any Holder.

**Effect of Calling for Redemption**. On the date designated for redemption, notice having been mailed in the manner and under the conditions hereinabove provided and moneys for payment of the redemption price being held in separate accounts by the Paying Agent in trust for the Holders of the Series 2017C Bonds to be redeemed, all as provided in this Series Resolution, the Series 2017C Bonds so called for redemption shall become and be due and payable at the redemption price provided for redemption of such Bonds on such date, interest on the Series 2017C Bonds so called for redemption shall cease to accrue, such Bonds shall cease to be entitled to any benefit or security under this Series Resolution and the Holders or registered owners of such Bonds shall have no rights with respect thereto except to receive payment of the redemption price.

**The Series 2017C Bonds Redeemed Not Deemed Outstanding**. The Series 2017C Bonds which have been duly called for redemption under the provisions of this Article, or with respect to which irrevocable instructions to call for redemption have been given by the Board to the Paying Agent in form satisfactory to him or her, and for the payment of the redemption price of which moneys shall be held in separate accounts by the Paying Agent in trust for the Holders of the Series 2017C Bonds to be redeemed, all as provided in this Series Resolution, shall not thereafter be deemed to be outstanding under the provisions of this Series Resolution.

**  
  
CUSTODY AND APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS  
OF THE SERIES 2017C BONDS**

**Custody and Application of Proceeds of the Series 2017C Bonds**. The proceeds of the Series 2017C Bonds (par amount ($\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.00) plus original issue premium ($\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_), less the underwriter's discount ($\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_) shall be applied as follows:

$\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ shall be transferred to Construction Fund to be used to pay a portion of the costs of the Projects; and

$\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ shall be deposited into a special account created with the Custodian for the payment of expenses incident to the issuance of the Series 2017C Bonds.

The moneys in the Debt Service Fund shall be held in trust and applied as herein provided and, pending such application, shall be pledged to, and subject to a lien and charge in favor, of the Holders of the Series 2017C Bonds issued and outstanding under this Series Resolution and for the further security of such Holders until paid out or transferred as herein provided.

**No Risk to Paying Agent Funds**. No provision herein shall require the Paying Agent to expend its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers unless the Paying Agent shall have reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is reasonably assured to it.

The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia (the "University"), an educational institution established by the Commonwealth of Virginia, for value received, hereby promises to pay, solely from the revenues provided therefor, as hereinafter set forth, to the registered owner named above, on the maturity date set forth above (or earlier as hereinafter set forth), upon the presentation and surrender hereof, the principal sum set forth above and to pay, solely from such revenues, interest thereon from the date hereof at the rate per annum set forth above, until payment of said principal sum. Both the principal of and the interest on this Series 2017C Bond are payable in any coin or currency of the United States of America which on the respective dates of payment thereof is legal tender for the payment of public and private debts.

Interest on this Series 2017C Bond shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.

\[Reserved for Change in Mode / Interest Period – TBD\].

The University shall not be obligated to pay the principal of or interest on this Series 2017C Bond except from the Pledged Revenues of the University and other legally available moneys, all as provided in the Series 2017C Resolutions and the Program Resolution. "Pledged Revenues" are all of the revenues now or hereafter lawfully available to the University which are not required by law, by binding contract entered into prior to the adoption of the Series 2017C Resolutions or, in certain circumstances described in the Series 2017C Resolutions, by binding contract entered into subsequent to the date of the Series 2017C Resolutions, to be devoted to some other purpose. This Series 2017C Bond and the interest hereon shall not be deemed to constitute a debt or liability of the Commonwealth of Virginia, legal, moral or otherwise. Neither the Commonwealth of Virginia nor the University shall be obligated to pay the principal of or interest on this Series 2017C Bond or other costs incident hereto except from the sources noted above, and neither the faith and credit nor the taxing power of the Commonwealth of Virginia are pledged to the payment of the principal of or interest on this Series 2017C Bond or other costs incident hereto.

This Series 2017C Bond is one of a duly authorized issue of Bonds of the University aggregating \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ DOLLARS ($\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_) in principal amount, known as "General Revenue Pledge Bonds, Series 2017C" (the "Series 2017C Bonds"), issued pursuant to an authorizing resolution adopted by the Board of Visitors of the University (the "Board") on September \_\_, 2017 (the "Series 2017 Authorizing Resolution") and, a Master Bond Resolution (Multi-Year Capital Program) executed on \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, 2017 (as supplemented and amended, the "Program Resolution"), as supplemented by a Series Resolution executed on \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, 2017 (the "Series 2017 Resolution" and together with the Series 2017 Authorizing Resolution, the "Series 2017C Resolutions"). This Series 2017C Bond is issued and the Program Resolution and the Series 2017C Resolutions were adopted under and pursuant to the Constitution and laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, particularly Chapter 10, Title 23.1, Code of Virginia of 1950, as amended (the "Act") to finance and refinance the costs of certain projects of the University. Reference is hereby made to the Program Resolution and the Series 2017C Resolutions for the provisions, among others, with respect to the custody and application of the proceeds of bonds issued under the Series 2017C Resolutions, the funds charged with and pledged to the payment of the interest on and the principal of the Series 2017C Bonds, the nature and extent of the security, the terms and conditions on which the Series 2017C Bonds are or may be issued, the rights, duties and obligations of the University and the rights of the holders of the Series 2017C Bonds. Capitalized terms not defined herein shall be as defined in the Program Resolution or the Series 2017C Resolutions (as applicable). By the acceptance of this Series 2017C Bond, the Holder hereof assents to all of the provisions of the Program Resolution and the Series 2017C Resolutions.

The Series 2017C Bonds are subject to redemption, at the option of the University, in whole or in part on any date, at a redemption price equal to the greater of:

(i) 100% of the principal amount of the Series 2017C Bonds to be redeemed; or

(ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to the maturity date of the Series 2017C Bonds to be redeemed, not including any portion of those payments of interest accrued and unpaid as of the date on which the Series 2017C Bonds are to be redeemed, discounted to the date on which the Series 2017C Bonds are to be redeemed on a semi-annual basis, assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months, at the Treasury Rate, plus \_\_\_\_ basis points;

(iii) plus, in each case, accrued interest on the Series 2017C Bonds to be redeemed to the redemption date.

\[The Series 2017C Bonds shall also be subject to redemption in whole or in part on any date, at the option of the University, from the proceeds of casualty insurance or condemnation awards, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed, without premium, plus accrued interest to the redemption date, if all or any part of the Project financed with the Series 2017C Bonds is damaged or destroyed or taken through the exercise of the power of eminent domain and the President, Chief Operating Officer or Chief Financial Officer has delivered a certificate to the Custodian to the effect that the University has determined not to use such proceeds to replace or rebuild the damaged, destroyed or taken property. In the event of a redemption in part pursuant to this paragraph, the University shall redeem the Series 2017C Bonds from each maturity then outstanding, to the extent practicable, in the proportion that the principal amount of the Series 2017C Bonds of such maturity bears to the total principal amount of the Series 2017C Bonds then outstanding.\] **_– TO BE DISCUSSED_**

Subject to applicable procedures of the Securities Depository while the Series 2017C Bonds are held in book-entry only form by the Securities Depository, if less than all of the Series 2017C Bonds are to be called for redemption, the Series 2017C Bonds to be redeemed shall be selected by the University in such manner as the University in its discretion may determine.

If the Series 2017C Bonds are registered in book-entry only form and so long as a Securities Depository is the sole registered owner of the Series 2017C Bonds, if less than all of the Series 2017C Bonds of a maturity are called for prior redemption, the particular Series 2017C Bonds or portions thereof to be redeemed shall be selected on a pro-rata pass-through distribution of principal basis in accordance with the procedures of the Securities Depository; provided that, so long as the Series 2017C Bonds are held in book-entry form, the selection for redemption of such Series 2017C Bonds shall be made in accordance with the operational arrangements of the Securities Depository then in effect. If the Securities Depository's operational arrangements do not allow for the redemption of the Series 2017C Bonds on a pro rata pass-through distribution of principal basis as discussed above, then the Series 2017C Bonds will be selected for redemption, in accordance with the procedures of the Securities Depository, by lot. If a Securities Depository is no longer the sole registered owner of the Series 2017C Bonds, if less than all of the Series 2017C Bonds are called for redemption, the Paying Agent will select the Series 2017C Bonds to be redeemed on a pro rata basis.

This Series 2017C Bond is transferable by the registered owner, in person or by its attorney duly authorized in writing, at the Designated Office of the Registrar, upon presentation of a written instrument of transfer and surrender of this Series 2017C Bond to the Registrar for cancellation. Upon the transfer, a new Series 2017C Bond or Bonds of the same aggregate principal amount, maturity date and interest rate will be issued to the transferee. No transfer will be effective unless represented by such surrender and reissue. This Series 2017C Bond may also be exchanged at the Designated Office of the Registrar for a new Series 2017C Bond or Bonds of the same aggregate principal amount, maturity date and interest rate without transfer to a new registered owner. Exchanges and transfers will be without expense to the holder except for applicable taxes or other governmental charges, if any. The Registrar shall not be required to transfer or exchange any Series 2017C Bond selected or called for redemption pursuant to the provisions hereof or from a Record Date through the next succeeding Interest Payment Date. All Bonds delivered in exchange or transfer shall be dated so that neither gain nor loss results from the transfer or exchange.

The University, the Paying Agent and the Registrar may treat the registered owner as the absolute owner of this Series 2017C Bond for all purposes, notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.

Neither the members of the Board nor any person executing this Series 2017C Bond are liable personally hereon or subject to any personal liability or accountability by reason of the issuance hereof.

This Series 2017C Bond will not be valid until the Certificate of Authentication has been signed by the Registrar.

The holder of this Series 2017C Bond shall have no right to enforce the provisions of the Program Resolution or the Series 2017C Resolutions or to institute action to enforce the covenants therein, or to take any action with respect to any Event of Default, or to institute, appear in or defend any suit or other proceeding with respect thereto, except as provided in the Program Resolution or the Series 2017C Resolutions.

All acts, conditions and things required by the Constitution and laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia and by the rules and regulations of the Board to happen, exist and be performed precedent to and in the issuance of this Series 2017C Bond have happened, exist and have been performed as so required.
