**2017-2018 Operating Budget**

Mr. Hogan called on Ms. Bianchetto to present the 2017-2018 Operating Budget for the Academic Division, Medical Center and Transitional Care Hospital, and The University of Virginia’s College at Wise.

On motion, the Board adopted the following resolutions:

**2017-2018 OPERATING BUDGET FOR THE ACADEMIC DIVISION**

RESOLVED, the 2017-2018 $1.7 billion operating budget for the Academic Division is approved as recommended by the President and the Chief Operating Officer.

**2017-2018 PRATT FUND DISTRIBUTION**

RESOLVED, the budget for the expenditure of funds from the Estate of John Lee Pratt is approved to supplement appropriations made by the Commonwealth of Virginia for the School of Medicine and the Departments of Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics, and Physics in the College of Arts and Sciences. Departmental allocations, not to exceed $9,935,064 for 2017-2018, are suggested by the department chairs and recommended by the dean of each school. The disbursement of each allotment will be authorized by the Executive Vice President and Provost. To the extent the annual income from the endowment is not adequate to meet the recommended distribution, the principal of the endowment will be disinvested to provide funds for the approved budgets.

**2017-2018 OPERATING BUDGET FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA MEDICAL CENTER**

RESOLVED, the 2017-2018 operating budget for the University of Virginia Medical Center, inclusive of the Transitional Care Hospital, is approved as recommended by the President, the Chief Operating Officer, and the Medical Center Operating Board.

**2017-2018 OPERATING BUDGET FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA'S COLLEGE AT WISE**

RESOLVED, the 2017-2018 operating budget for The University of Virginia’s College at Wise is approved as recommended by the President and the Chief Operating Officer.

**Strategic Investment Fund Grant Allocations**

President Sullivan reviewed five Strategic Investment Fund proposals with the Board; the Advisory Committee recommended all. The proposals seek to advance the University’s stature in neuroscience, the study of democracy, engineering in medicine, the innovation ecosystem at Wise, and scholarship in nursing.

Bold Research Advancement in Neuroscience (BRAIN) requested $15.71 million over three years to build upon the work of the pan-University Brain Institute. The proposed investment in BRAIN will bring international pre-eminence in three areas of neuroscience disorders: 1) tremor from degenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease; 2) epilepsy; and 3) brain injury, making transformative changes in the way we diagnose and treat these diseases. It will build on these areas allowing the University to be an undisputed world leader in non-invasive approaches to treatment, and in the development and implementation of curative therapies for these diseases.

The Democracy Initiative will create a flexible structure for encouraging interdisciplinary work in the College, integrating research, teaching, and public engagement. Because of its history, the University is uniquely positioned to be the global center for the study of democracy. The request was for $10 million over three years to match philanthropic gifts raised by the College for this initiative.

Engineering in Medicine requests $5 million over five years to provide seed funding for collaborative translational research. It pairs clinicians with engineers to generate solutions to challenges at the engineering-medicine interface and improve health outcomes. One example of a project that could be funded is Neurology iTreat. This iPad-based platform would allow physicians to do remote stroke assessment, saving valuable time enroute to the hospital, a crucial Golden Window within which a patient must be treated to increase chances of successful health outcomes. This would be a collaboration among Emergency Medicine, Neurology, Telemedicine, and Computer Science.

The UVA-Wise Innovation Ecosystems requests $3.5 million over five years to bolster the College’s STEM and entrepreneurship programs. The funding will help increase enrollment and retention in software engineering, computer science, and management of information systems degree programs. These skills are critical to building a more diverse economy in Southwest Virginia. The funding will also help create a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship through initiatives such as entrepreneurship boot camps, cybersecurity boot camps, student internships with local businesses, and an entrepreneurial certificate program.

The School of Nursing requests $2.2 million over three years to increase research in two new specialty graduate programs: Neonatal Nurse Practitioners and Pediatric Nurse Practitioners-Acute Care. This will address a crucial health care need for critically ill children in Virginia, while also improving rankings. Targeted scholarships will be offered for highly competitive students.

In summary, these five projects total $36.4 million over five years. This will bring the total Strategic Investment Fund commitment over six years to $216.4 million.

On motion, the Board adopted the following resolution:

**STRATEGIC INVESTMENT FUND GRANT ALLOCATIONS—JUNE 2017**

WHEREAS, the Board of Visitors created the Strategic Investment Fund on February 19, 2016 to fund investments that support the vision and aspirations of the highest levels of excellence in the University’s academic, research, and healthcare missions; and

WHEREAS, the Faculty Evaluation Committee reviewed and assessed proposals and provided their analysis to the Advisory Committee; and

WHEREAS, the Advisory Committee reviewed and conducted further assessment of these proposals; and

WHEREAS, the Advisory Committee recommends funding for the following proposals that will materially enhance research, research infrastructure, and the academic experience:

**Project Funding Recommended**

Bold Research Advancement in Neuroscience $15,710,000

A&S Democracy Initiative 10,000,000

Engineering in Medicine 5,000,000

UVA-Wise Innovation Ecosystem 3,485,460

SON Transforming Clinical Scholarships 2,244,546

**Total $36,440,006**

RESOLVED, the Board of Visitors authorizes the Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer to use earnings on the Strategic Investment Fund to support the aforementioned projects recommended by the Advisory Committee.

**Authorization of 2017 Shelf Capital Project Financing Program**

Mr. Matteo, the University’s Associate Vice President and Treasurer, provided an overview of the shelf registration program, which would be a further enhancement to the debt portfolio management program. The shelf program would reduce the time to market of a new debt issue, allowing the University more flexibility to move more nimbly when attractive market opportunities arise. This program would require the development of a base offering document, and the University would plan to issue subsequent supplemental documents for each specific debt issue made under the shelf. Any specific debt issue would require advance Board of Visitors approval.

On motion, the Board adopted the following resolution:

**AUTHORIZATION OF 2017 SHELF CAPITAL PROJECT FINANCING PROGRAM**

**Report by the President**

President Sullivan provided a brief report on recent and future events. She mentioned the Bicentennial launch just four months away.

She said students lead the way in distinguishing the University. Two graduating students earned Rhodes Scholarships, and three were selected as Marshall Scholars — this was the first time that three UVA students were selected for Marshall Scholarships in a single year. Twelve students and recent graduates received Fulbright Scholar awards to pursue graduate study and to teach overseas.

This spring, the first cohort of Fellows from the Meriwether Lewis Institute for Citizen Leadership graduated. In their work as Fellows, these students made a lasting mark on the University. President Sullivan provided some examples including developing the structure for the Honor Audit Commission. The 2019 cohort of Meriwether Lewis Fellows is on Grounds during the summer to begin their work in the summer-institute phase of the program.

Multidisciplinary research is a focus this year. Two new pan-University institutes have been created, the Institute of Global Infectious Diseases, and the Resilience Institute, which will become one of the first institutes in the nation to focus on “wicked problems,” ranging from the effect of climate change on coastal erosion to the restoration of dead rivers caused by massive urbanization.

The strategic research partnership with the Max Planck Society’s MAXNET Energy continues to grow, with support from a cluster-hiring initiative.

Many students engaged in research in the past year, including those who participated in the “Double Hoo” program that pairs undergraduates with graduate students to work together on research. This spring, the faculty committee that supports the Double Hoo program selected 20 new projects to receive grants for the 2017-18 academic year, and five more student teams received renewal grants to continue projects from the past year.

Total Advising continues to thrive, including the enhanced Career Center. This past semester, nearly 3,700 students visited with Career Center advisers, up 30% from the spring 2016 semester, and 868 companies recruited on Grounds. More than 700 students participated in a semester-long mentoring program, and an additional 300 participated in “flash mentoring” sessions.

The Office of Global internships arranged more than 90 internships for students in the past year. The internships were located in 38 cities in 27 different countries. This program is equipping students with the global awareness they’ll need to thrive in today’s global economy.

Faculty hiring efforts, including numerous cluster-hire searches, are still underway. All these efforts can be traced to strategies set forth in the Cornerstone Plan. When the Board of Visitors approved the core elements, or “pillars,” of the Cornerstone Plan in November 2013, then-Rector George Martin said that the plan would “challenge us to build on our accomplishments while identifying exciting new frontiers.”

President Sullivan said she was grateful for the Board’s sustained support as the University continues to meet challenges and to push the University toward those new frontiers.

President Sullivan asked for approval of the Gifts and Grants Report, which on motion made and seconded, was approved unanimously by voice vote.

**Comments by the Faculty Senate Chair**

Mr. Alf Weaver is the Chair of the Faculty Senate. His comments are provided below:

Good afternoon. I’m Alfred Weaver, and I speak to you today as both a UVA veteran and a newbie: I’ve been a Professor of Computer Science here for the past 40 years, but my Senate Chair’s job is just 8 days old. I know I have a lot to learn but I assure you that I am eager to do so. I appreciate your invitation to speak to you for the next four hours about the Senate’s plans….

But really, today I just want to brief you on two points:

1.  Senate plans for the 2017-18 academic year

We anticipate having six full Senate meetings this coming academic year as well as monthly meetings of our Executive Council. Topics to consider:

1.  how faculty benefits work, how they get defined, and how they get paid for;
2.  how our institution can help forestall the spread of malware and cyberterrorism, and promote cybersecurity;
3.  “How to Retire”— what are the procedural issues for faculty facing retirement, and can we offer a gentler path that just termination. Engineering is offering a step-down plan that shows promise.
4.  review the impact of the federal government’s increasing number of non-renewals of visas for non-citizen faculty and staff;
5.  contribute to the celebration of our Bicentennial;
6.  assess the prospects for faculty raises; \[I was encouraged by this morning’s budget discussion!\]
7.  discuss UVA Finances as they affect our academic program in an era of reduced state support;
8.  welcome a new UVA President when the time is right;
9.  hold a workshop to teach the faculty how to give a TED talk. At your last meeting, you and I saw Professor Silvia Blemker in action, and she was incredible. I would like more faculty to be able to explain the importance and impact of their research and education projects in a 10-minute setting.
10.  Proposed response to the need for undergraduate access to Computer Science (CS) courses.

Also at your last meeting, you heard your student representative, Phoebe Willis, report that the number one complaint she heard during the 2016-17 academic year was about students’ inability to register for Computer Science classes. In my 30 seconds of introduction during the March meeting I brashly pledged to work with the Board to solve that problem, so today I am reporting on what Computer Science has done.

But before I explain about our proposal, let me just give you some background about CS at UVA. We are a high-growth department. We support three undergraduate majors: the BS in Computer Science, the BS in Computer Engineering, both in the Engineering School, and the BA in Computer Science in the College. In May 2015, our total enrollment of undergraduate majors was 770. One year later it was 930. As of last month, it was 1,081. Transfer students will add another 90. This next academic year we expect to confer 413 undergraduate degrees.

All of our graduates get good jobs. For the 2016 graduating class, the median salary for CS graduates was $89k. 48% of them went to Northern Virginia, 19% to Seattle (home of Microsoft and Amazon), 15% to New York (to work in financial markets), 10% to Silicon Valley to work at Google and other newer start-ups, and 8% stayed in Charlottesville.

We also operate a vibrant graduate program. Over the past three years, graduate enrollment for the master’s and PhD has grown from 91 to 235.

If you count all of our teaching faculty (tenured, tenure-track, non-tenure-track, lecturers, adjuncts, and post-docs), our faculty total 41. We are growing our faculty as fast as we can, but the competitive pressure in the academic job market is tremendous. By the way, I salute the Provost’s plan to move lecturers into the general faculty ranks; this was an important factor in our hiring this past year.

In academic year 2015-2016, CS students collectively generated 20,000 student credit hours. This makes us the fourth largest producer of student credit hours in the University, after commerce, economics and psychology. Our eight lower-division courses alone generated 3600 student credit hours.

So, what are we doing about this overwhelming student demand?

1.  Demand for the major: We enrolled 100 additional majors this past academic year than we did the previous year to respond to the demand for the CS major, even though our faculty hiring did not keep up with our student growth. Last week we expanded class sizes in our introductory courses so that we completely eliminated the wait list. But of course this will not last; engineering alone will bring in about 600 first-years for whom CS classes are required.
2.  Course demand from non-majors: We have proposed a three-phase expansion program. Phase one will enlarge the enrollment in our five introductory courses. This will create a choke-point in our 2000-level courses, so phase two is to remedy that. That in turn will create choke-points in our upper-division courses, so phase three will fix that problem.

In summary, we requested the obvious resources: more faculty, teaching assistants, computer labs, and space. But I think that with those resources we can achieve a goal that your Computer Science department has now adopted: we want to provide computer science education to every UVA undergraduate who wants it.

That’s my report; thank you for your time.

**Comments by the Student Representative to the Board**

Ms. Miller said part of her goal is to bring to the Board a different perspective and a theme for her talks will be to bring a different student to introduce to the Board at each meeting. This will help broaden the Board’s understanding of the different dimensions of the “student experience.” She is a history major with a particular interest in the Cold War. She was raised by a single mother and is a first-generation, low-income college student. When asked how she ended up at the University of Virginia, she tells people about a letter she received from President Sullivan when she was in the 9th grade. She kept the letter in a drawer and reflected on it later when applying to colleges. She is a work-study student, working this summer at Alderman Library. She said the Board’s commitment to AccessUVA and the Bicentennial Scholars fund is sending a great message to first generation students like herself – that the Board cares, the University cares, and one of the strengths mentioned earlier is to welcome all students into the University regardless of income; maintaining a need-blind admission policy is important.

Ms. Miller spoke about student concerns that undergraduate students do not have sufficient opportunities to do research. At the University of Michigan, there is a program that employs 1,200 undergraduate students and pays them to work alongside a faculty member, which might be something we could do at the University.

As the student representative, she will also be working on cultivating different forms of communication. She will continue the Facebook page and the newsletter, but she also entered into a partnership with the Cavalier Daily-- every month she will submit an op-ed based on whatever the Board is working on that month or a summary of what happened at the meeting. The idea is to provide multiple communication channels to be as transparent as possible during her tenure as the student representative.

Ms. Miller encouraged Board members to think of ways to meet as many students as possible and to get to know them personally. She offered to assist in making these connections.

**On-Line Education**

President Sullivan presented on the University’s online programs and led a discussion about the future of online and distance education. She said as she was preparing for the discussion, she received news that AffordableColleges.com ranked UVA’s online Bachelor of Professional Studies in Health Sciences Management program #8 in the nation in its list of “Online Bachelor’s Degrees in Healthcare Administration.” Offered through the School of Continuing and Professional Studies, the online BPHM program prepares students who have technical backgrounds in emergency medical services, health information management, radiography, and other healthcare fields to assume roles in health care management. This new ranking is a testament to the quality and affordability of this program.

Ms. Sullivan showed two videos to illustrate the University’s offerings of massive open online courses (MOOCs) that are available through Coursera. The first featured Darden professor Michael Lenox teaching SWOT analysis. The second one featured history professor Peter Onuf talking about the Rotunda; this serves as the introduction for his six-week MOOC “The Age of Jefferson.”

Ms. Sullivan explained that Darden produced two versions of the SWOT analysis MOOC. The cost for production of the first version that went live in Fall 2012 with just Mr. Lenox was about $5,000. The cost for the second version that went live in Fall 2015 with Mr. Lenox and Darden Professor Jared Harris was approximately $21,000 because of the design of the course. The gross revenue (before refunds and financial aid, but not including bulk sales) was $208,000. (“Bulk sales” are when users buy a bundle of five MOOCs on “Foundations of Business Strategy” for one price with a 10% discount.)  This course first went live in Fall 2012 but was not monetized until spring 2015.  There were over 300,000 visitors to the course before it was monetized. Total visitors are 525,132; the total who completed the course are 8,984. The course was rated a 4.7 out of 5, with 680 ratings and 136 reviews. Five full-time students are now enrolled at Darden who originally took the MOOC.

President Sullivan said Darden’s MOOC content has served as a funnel for (a) additional online courses run through custom and open enrollment Executive Education; (b) the basis for asynchronous and blended courses offered in EMBA program electives; (c) broadened UVA/Darden reach to over 220 countries and territories; and (d) adding over 100,000 people to the free Darden Online Community, through which Darden shares news and thought leadership.

The “Age of Jefferson” MOOC with Peter Onuf cost about $120,000 to produce: $80,000 for filming, and $40,000 for translations to Spanish and Chinese. Gross revenue (before refunds and financial aid) was $6,468. Visitors to the course totaled 121,022; the total number of people who completed the course was 4,111. The course received a rating of 4.6 out of 5 stars, with 180 ratings and 50 reviews. This content was designed to appeal to alumni and to be used as a pre-matriculation study for incoming students. It is used primarily as a tool for marketing and alumni engagement and as a primer for new students.

The President suggested a discussion around four questions:

*   Should we lift age restrictions for our BIS program? (_The BIS program requires a four-year post-HS graduation wait period_)
*   Are there markets we could enter at scale?
*   How could online enrollments potentially affect our in-state/out-of-state balance?
*   A philosophical question: _Who do we want UVA to be_?

There was significant discussion among members of the Board, with no firm conclusions except this is an area for further exploration in the broader context of what students will desire to learn in the future and how they will desire to learn it—what methods of delivery will be most effective.
