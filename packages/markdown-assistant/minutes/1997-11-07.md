## REPORT BY THE PRESIDENT

The President reported on a miscellany of items:

The salary supplement authorized by the Board last fall has meant a 2% increase in faculty salaries; this figure does not include the recent $lm gift from the Alumni Association for faculty salaries.

The first awards to faculty and staff made possible by a gift from Mr. David Harrison of Prince George County were announced recently: there were ten awards of $10,000 each.

The University of Virginia Foundation will request funds from the new state Economic Development Fund to be used for infrastructure at the North Fork Research Park. There have been a number of concerns about alcohol abuse among students, with evidence that there has been a dramatic rise in student "binge" drinking at the University and at other schools.

The Board will hear a report in the Student Affairs and Athletics Committee about a proposed restructuring of the Office of African-American Affairs, though no action will be requested at this time.

Orientation of new students has been the subject of considerable discussion at the University this fall. Social orientation has been successful but academic orientation has been less so and more attention will have to be paid to it. It has been suggested that there be more faculty involvement in first year dormitory life.

There has been a lively discussion this fall about the possibility of delaying fraternity and sorority rush so that it doesn't begin a few weeks after first year students matriculate in the University.

Mr. Goodwin asked what steps might be taken to eliminate once and for all the perennial statistic of faculty salaries at Clinch Valley College being the lowest in Virginia. The President and Mr. Sandridge, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, explained the State's current system of calculating faculty salaries, which is the principal cause of the problem. Efforts to 'rectify this in the forthcoming Session of the General Assembly should resolve the problem in two years.
