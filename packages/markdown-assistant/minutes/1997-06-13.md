### ROTUNDA USE POLICY

While it is very important to regard the Rotunda as an active, working building, the building's special characteristics and historical significance dictate that its usage be carefully considered. There is heavy demand by University groups for the Rotunda facilities. The demand far outstrips the availability of space in the building. Several thousand visitors come to see the Rotunda in a typical month. Admissions officials arrange for prospective students to make their first official contact with the University in the Rotunda. Because of the irreplaceable and fragile nature of the Rotunda interior, it must be used in ways that will not shorten the useful life of the structure. A set of guidelines and regulations for the use of the Rotunda has been in effect since the restoration in 1976. The following represents a revision of these guidelines to become effective immediately:

#### PROCEDURE FOR RESERVING SPACE IN THE ROTUNDA

* Reservations may be made by contacting the Rotunda Administrator. Reservations will be made in accordance with the guidelines set forth in this document, and in accordance with University regulations.

#### GENERAL PRINCIPLES REGARDING USE

* Space in the Rotunda may be reserved for dignified occasions, within the guidelines, by University departments, groups primarily controlled by faculty, staff, or the Alumni Association, Student Council, recognized student groups, or University contracted independent organizations. Assignment of spaces shall be content neutral. Because of the heavy demand, it will be the responsibility of the Rotunda Administrator to make the facilities available to as many requesters as possible, avoiding overuse by any group. The Rotunda will not be used for private parties (e.g. wedding receptions) nor will it be used for events requiring the collection of admission fees. The Rotunda is a smoke-free building.

#### THE DOME ROOM

* The Dome Room is the most fragile of the Rotunda facilities. Of special concern is the heart pine floor, which is fragile and irreplaceable. Special care must be taken in the use of this room. Such events as seated dinners and lectures would be appropriate uses; however, cocktail parties, receptions, and dances are not permitted. Refreshments may be served only at seated meals.

#### USE OF THE NORTH AND SOUTH PORTICOS

* Events that do not conflict with inside users may be held on the North or South Porticos of the Rotunda provided that they are dignified occasions and are in compliance with Lawn Use regulations. Alcoholic beverages may not be serviced on the Porticos while the University is in session. Reservations may be made through the Rotunda Administrator.

#### SECURITY PROVISIONS

* The Dome Room and other Rotunda space may be used before and after the normal hours of operation only if official Rotunda personnel are present. Users will be billed for the cost of these employees on an hourly basis. A modest use fee will also be assessed. The use of candles in the Rotunda is restricted to oilless candles in the Dome Room during catered dinners. Candles are to be placed in holders on dinner tables. Candles are not to be carried when lit. Because of very limited fire escape routes, there is an absolute limit on the capacity of the Dome Room as set by the State Fire Marshal in conjunction with the University Safety Officer. For catered dinners, the maximum occupancy is 105 persons. For lectures, meetings, and similar functions, the maximum capacity is 140 persons.

#### CATERING

* University Dining Services must provide and serve food and beverages for all Rotunda events.

#### SPECIAL EQUIPMENT AND FURNISHINGS REQUIREMENTS

* Furnishings, tables, chairs, and heavy equipment will be moved only by qualified University employees trained to do this without hazard to floors, walls, stairs, and other furnishings. Heavy equipment such as pianos (except for lightweight electronic models and harpsichords) are not to be taken to the Dome Room.

#### RESPONSIBILITY OF USERS

* Users will be required to agree in advance to pay for any damage done to the Rotunda as a consequence of their event. Users will also be responsible to avoid disturbing other users who may be assigned to other rooms in the Rotunda.

#### VISITORS

* During the time the Rotunda is open to the public (usually 9 a.m. until 4:45 p.m.), Dome Room events will not normally be closed to the public. The oval rooms, if reserved, may be used for meetings to which the public is not invited. The public is not invited into the Rotunda after the normal closing hours.

#### STUDENTS WISHING TO STUDY IN THE ROTUNDA

* Students are encouraged to use the alcoves in the Dome Room for study whenever the room is available during normal hours of operation, subject to normal regulation by the Rotunda Administrator.

#### LUNCHEONS

* Except for official University-wide functions, the Dome Room will not be used for luncheons. Luncheons may be scheduled in the Lower West Oval Room.

#### FREQUENCY OF USE (DOME ROOM)

* The Dome Room may be used for dinners no more than three times a week, and on an annual average of no more than ten times each month.

#### ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL

* The columns, curved woodwork, and some of the antique furnishings require rigid humidity control. Even brief deviations from the specified humidity levels cause cracking and in some cases rapid deterioration. The Rotunda is equipped with an elaborate system for maintaining optimum temperature and humidity levels in all seasons. The system requires that all windows be kept tightly closed, and that all doors except the lower level entrance doors be kept closed. The glass doors overlooking the South portico should also be kept closed.

## APPROVAL OF PRELIMINARY DESIGN FOR CONSTRUCTION OF THE HEALTH SCIENCES LIBRARY BASEMENT DEVELOPMENT AND RENOVATION

The following resolution was adopted: RESOLVED that the preliminary design for the Health Sciences Library Basement Development and Renovation as illustrated on drawings titled: 1. Lower Level Floor Plan 2. First Floor Plan 3. Second Floor Plan dated June 13, 1997, and prepared by Ayers/Saint/Gross of Baltimore, Maryland, is approved for further development and construction.

## APPROVAL OF SCHEMATIC DESIGN, CAMPBELL HALL ADDITION

The following resolution was adopted: RESOLVED that the Board of Visitors will continue consideration of the schematic design for the Campbell Hall Addition with an eye toward developing its visual compatibility with the University's Jeffersonian architecture. The Architect for the University will review the progress with the Buildings and Grounds Committee before the Board acts on the proposal to proceed with design development.

Again, the student is entitled, by law, either to the amount calculated by the Federal Refund Schedule or the Institutional Refund Schedule, whichever is greater.

Please note that before a refund is calculated under either method, the University is authorized first to offset it against any other amounts owed to the University.

Application of the Institutional Refund Schedule and the Federal Refund Schedule pertains only to tuition and fees. Room and board refunds are calculated separately, since the student signs a detailed contract for each.

In the event a student withdraws from the University and the student is a first-time student, the student's refund will be calculated according to the Pro Rata Refund Schedule, unless one of the other schedules provides a larger refund.

### Pro Rata Refund Policy:

A student who is attending the University for the first time (undergraduate, graduate or transfer); who is receiving Title IV financial aid; and who withdraws completely from the University will be eligible for a pro rata refund as follows: applicable tuition, fees and room and board charges will be pro-rated on a weekly basis for the first 60 percent of the semester. The Bursar's Office may deduct an administrative fee of $100, or five percent, of the applicable charges, whichever is less, before processing the refund. The actual percentage charged to the student in a given semester is determined by the last recorded date of attendance, as a percentage of the number of academic weeks within the semester. After 60 percent of the semester has passed, no refunds will be granted.

## APPROVAL OF POLICY REVISION: REGULATIONS GOVERNING PAYMENT OF TUITION, FEES AND ROOM RENT ON A DEFERRED PAYMENT PLAN UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA

The following resolution was adopted: WHEREAS, the original Policy on Regulations Governing Payment of Tuition, Fees and Room Rent on a Deferred Payment Plan was approved by the Board of Visitors on October 26, 1973; WHEREAS, the Ad Hoc Committee on Policy Reform has examined the above-mentioned Policy on Regulations Governing Payment of Tuition, Fees and Room Rent on a Deferred Payment Plan for accuracy and applicability and has determined that current practice deviates substantially from the terms outlined in the policy; WHEREAS, on April 12, 1997, the Ad Hoc Committee on Policy Reform referred the policy to the Finance Committee for review and revision; and WHEREAS, the University Treasurer no longer administers a payment delay program; and the University Bursar presently administers a payment delay program restricted to graduate assistants and veterans. RESOLVED that the policy entitled "Regulations Governing Payment of Tuition, Fees, and Room Rent on a Deferred Payment Plan" be rescinded and the attached Graduate Assistant and Veteran Payment Plan be adopted.

### Graduate Assistant and Veteran Payment Plan

Graduate assistants (teaching and research assistants) and veterans are eligible for a special payment arrangement each semester. Eligibility for the program is subject to verification of status by and approval of the appropriate Dean's office in each of the schools.

Eligible graduate assistants and veterans may sign an agreement with the University permitting payment of tuition, fees and room rent charges on the following schedule:

* **Fall semester**: 1/3 of charges for the semester are due on or before Wednesday of the first full week of October, one-third are due on or before Wednesday of the first full week of November, and one-third (final) payment must be made by Wednesday of the first full week of December.

* **Spring semester**: 1/3 of the semester charges are due on or before Wednesday of the first full week of February, one-third are due on or before Wednesday of the first full week of March, and one-third (final) payment must be made by Wednesday of the first full week of April.

The penalty for failing to make a payment by the due date is $10.00 per installment that is overdue. Late payments can result in other actions for past due balances, including a hold on the student's official academic transcript. Actions for late or non-payment of amounts owed the University are outlined in the Graduate and Undergraduate Record.
