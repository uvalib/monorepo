Sundry communications were received & read; and the following resolutions passed.

Resolved, That so much of the Enactments of July 1832 as authorise the Faculty to give notice to any Student or the parent or guardian of any Student that he will not be again suffered to matriculate, shall be, & the same is hereby repealed: And hereafter the Faculty shall have power to refuse re-admission to any former Student of the University, if they shall be satisfied from his former conduct as Student that his readmission will be injurious to the Institution.

The Board has received with much pleasure, the address of a committee of Students, communicating the measures which they have adopted, in concert with the professors, to procure the services of a minister of the Gospel.

Resolved, therefore, that the board approves the measures adopted by the Students & Professors, for procuring the services of a minister of the Gospel; and that while they do not feel warranted in appropriating the public money to his support, the Visitors individually, will cheerfully contribute to that object.

Resolved that hereafter the Chairman of the Faculty for the time being shall have authority to give permission for the tuition of a Sunday School in such room or rooms in any of the public buildings as he may think best adapted to the purpose & least liable to injury from such use, and under such regulations to prevent injury to the benches and walls as he may deem expedient.

Resolved, That the application of Mr. Penci for permission to establish a Gymnasium at the University be referred to the Faculty with authority to grant to him such accommodations in the use of the public grounds & public buildings, as may be deemed expedient by them, not involving any expense to the University or in any manner interfering with the duties of the schools; and being at all times subject to the Control of the Visitors.
