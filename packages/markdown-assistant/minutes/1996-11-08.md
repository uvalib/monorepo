## ANNOUNCEMENT OF NOMINATION OF MR. SEAN N. BRYANT FOR A RHODES SCHOLARSHIP

The Rector announced that Mr. Sean Bryant, Student Member on the Board, is one of eight students from the University to have been nominated for a Rhodes Scholarship. The students will now compete in their home states against students from other schools - in Sean's case, he will go before the Virginia state committee in Richmond in early December. If he receives a nomination from the state committee, he will compete in the regional finals in Atlanta a few days later. If he is successful there, he will be at Oxford next fall.

The Rector said that it is a great honor to have gotten a nomination from the University Rhodes Committee, and that the Board is proud of this recognition of Mr. Bryant's accomplishments.

## REPORT BY THE PRESIDENT

The President told the Board about efforts that are being made to reduce the amount of material sent to Members in connection with Board meetings. On the Agenda itself, action items that concern routine housekeeping matters which do not require extensive explanation or documentation, will be treated as "Consent Agenda" actions and simply will be listed on the Committee Agendas with minimal explanation.

Beginning with the February Board meeting, the President said Members will be sent the Docket as is customary, at least ten days before the meeting. Rather than sending the Committee Agenda books at that point, however, there will be only a one-page summary of each Committee Agenda included with the Docket. The Committee Agenda books will be available to Members on request before the meeting and will in any case be put in the Members' meeting books. The Gifts and Grants Report and the listing of Faculty Personnel actions henceforth will not be sent out with the Docket, but will be included, as usual, in Members' meeting books.

Mr. Jessee suggested that Members be sent the Committee books for the Committees to which they belong. The Secretary said he would poll Members before the next Docket is sent out to ascertain what material each would like to receive.

## MOTIONS FOR EXECUTIVE SESSION
