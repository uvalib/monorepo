### SPECIAL MEETING

The Board met pursuant to their adjourning order of Tuesday the 9th day of September last. present Messrs Wm T. Joynes, J. R. Edmunds, J. B. Baldwin, T. J. Randolph, Wm J. Robertson and J. R. Tucker.

Mr Wm T. Joynes as rector pro tem of the last meeting, called the Board to order, and on his motion, Col Thomas J. Randolph was unanimously elected Rector in place of the late rector Andrew Stevenson. Whereupon Col Randolph returned his acknowledgements;

On motion of Mr Tucker the following preamble and resolutions were adopted.

The Board of Visitors of the University of Va having been informed of the death of the Hon Andrew Stevenson since their last meeting, have unanimously adopted the following Preamble and resolutions as expressive of their feelings at this sad dispensation of Providence.

By his devotion to the interests of the University, the dignity of his bearing as presiding officer of the Board, and the Uniform courtesy of his manners in his intercourse with its members, the late Rector received, as he eminently deserved the esteem and confidence of his associates. After attaining high distinction in the public service of the State and of the Union, with earnest patriotism, he devoted the evening of his days, to the advancement of Virginia's great Institution of Learning, and to the direction of the Counsels of the Board in a manner, appropriate to its extended usefulness and its permanent renown.

It is therefore

1. Resolved That we most sincerely lament the sad event, which deprives the Board of the experience and counsels of the Hon And. Stevenson distinguished as he was, alike by those traits of character, which adorned the public service, graced his private intercourse and made him the valued Rector of this Institution.

2. That the Rector be requested to communicate a copy of the Preamble & Resolutions adopted by the Board to the widow of the Hon And. Stevenson.

3. That the same be spread upon the Records of the Board and be published.

A Committee of the Farmers Assembly consisting of Wm C. Rives, William H. Macfarland and Franklin Minor Esqrs this day appeared before the Board and submitted for the consideration of the Board a deed from Philip St. George Cocke Esqr assigning $20,000 to the Rector and Visitors of the University for the purpose of endowing a School of Agriculture, together with a project for the School proposed to be established the Board proceeded to consider the propriety of accepting the proposed endowment and without considering the details of the project submitted by the Committee, adopted the following resolutions.

1. Resolved That the Board are of opinion that under the law as it now stands they have not the right to accept the munificent endowment proposed by Philip St. G. Cocke, Esqr upon the terms set forth in the deed this day presented to the Board: in this that the reservation in said deed to the Donor during life and to the Farmers Assembly thereafter, of the power to nominate the Professor in the proposed School of Agriculture is inconsistent with the unrestricted right of Appointment and control vested by law in the Board of Visitors & which the Board consider themselves bound to maintain and they are therefore compelled to decline the said endowment.

2. That the Board with a high appreciation of the liberality and public spirit of Mr Cocke and of his selection of the University as the agent for carrying into effect his patriotic purpose, are prepared to cooperate with him to the full extent of their powers in the establishment of a School of Agriculture in the University upon a footing equal in all respects to that of the other Schools in the Institution.

Ordered that a copy of the papers presented to the Board by the said Committee be filed and preserved by the secretary among the papers of the Board.

The Board then adjourned until tomorrow morning at ten oclock.
