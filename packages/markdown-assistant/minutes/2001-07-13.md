The Board then approved two resolutions, one approving the report on athletics made the day before at the joint meeting of the Finance and Student Affairs and Athletics Committees (see Minutes of that meeting, July 13, 2001), and the other accepting the reports of the 2020 Commissions and outlining a course of action on the recommendations made in the reports.

RESOLVED that the "Final Edit" of the Virginia 2020 Commission reports is approved in principle by the Board of Visitors; and

RESOLVED FURTHER that the Board of Visitors directs the Administration to proceed with planning for the implementation of the Virginia 2020 Commission recommendations, subject to the subsequent approval of the Board of Visitors; and

RESOLVED FURTHER that the Board of Visitors directs the President to report to the Board by December, 2001, on his views with respect to prioritization of the Virginia 2020 Commission recommendations, the costs associated therewith, the prospects for financing those costs and ultimately implementing those recommendations; and

RESOLVED FURTHER that the Board of Visitors requests that the President endeavor to present a final report to the Board of Visitors by January, 2002, setting forth his recommendations with respect to prioritization of the Virginia 2020 Commission recommendations, the costs associated therewith, the prospects for financing those costs and ultimately implementing those recommendations which shall be subject to the approval of the Board of Visitors at that time.

## RESOLUTION ON THE REPORT OF THE WORKING GROUP ON ATHLETICS

WHEREAS, the Student Affairs and Athletics Committee and the Finance Committee, meeting in joint session on June 4, 2001, approved a joint work plan to analyze the report of the Task Force on Athletics; and

WHEREAS, the group charged with implementing the work plan presented its findings to a joint meeting of the two Committees on July 13, 2001;

RESOLVED that the Board accepts the preliminary report given by the group, requests the Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer to develop a five year plan which identifies any required investments in the Athletics program and proposes sources of revenue to support those investments consistent with the Board's objectives of academic excellence, athletic excellence, and compliance with NCAA and other regulations;

RESOLVED FURTHER that the Board affirms its position that there be no tiering or elimination of any sport at this time.

(Mr. Greer abstained from voting on this resolution.)

The Board resumed once more in Executive Session at 2:00 p.m., and met in that state until 3:00 p.m., when it adopted the customary resolution certifying that only business exempted from Open discussion by the Virginia Freedom of Information Act had been considered.

Mr. Rector, I move that we vote on and record our certification that, to the best of each Board member's knowledge, only public business matters lawfully exempted from open meeting requirements and which were identified in the motion(s) authorizing the closed session, were heard, discussed or considered in closed session.

Resuming in Open Session, the Board heard a report from Mrs. Holland on the fall meeting for boards of visitors organized by the State Council for Higher Education in Virginia, which will take place on October 24th, in Williamsburg. Mr. Rainey then reported on an effort by the Board of Managers of the Alumni Association to raise money for the Honor Endowment. The Board of Managers has pledged $250,000 to this end and through Mr. Rainey has suggested that the Board of Visitors do the same. Most of the money from the Board of Visitors should come from Endowment funds, he said, but he thought it important that individual Members make personal contributions.

The Retreat was adjourned at 3:10 p.m.
