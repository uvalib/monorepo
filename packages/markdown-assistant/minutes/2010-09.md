The Rector proposed the extension of the Special Committee on Diversity and setting the date of the 2011 Annual Meeting.

On motion, the Board approved the following resolutions:

EXTENSION OF THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON DIVERSITY

WHEREAS, the Manual of the Board of Visitors specifies that Special Committees of the Board be extended each year at the Annual Meeting;

RESOLVED, the Special Committee on Diversity is extended to the Annual meeting of 2011.

SETTING OF THE DATE OF THE 2011 ANNUAL MEETING

OF THE BOARD

RESOLVED, the first meeting of the Board of Visitors in the Fall of 2011 will be designated the 2011 Annual Meeting of the Board.

The Rector deferred the setting of Board meeting dates beyond 2012 until the November meeting. He said the President and the Vice Rector must confer on available dates.

The Rector told the Board that the November meeting events would begin with a dinner at Monticello on Sunday, November 14, with the Board of the Thomas Jefferson Foundation. He said the dinner on November 15, would be the annual joint meeting of the Council of Foundations and the Board. The November Board meeting will end on Tuesday, November 16, at the usual time.

ACC Certification

Each year, the Atlantic Coast Conference requires that the Chairman of the Governing Board of each member institution read to the Board the following statement and attest to it. This is an important statement about institutional control and the role of the Board in Athletics. The Rector attested that the Board understands that the President runs the Athletics Program in accordance with NCAA, ACC, and other applicable rules and regulations. The statement is as follows:

_“AS CHAIRMAN OF THE GOVERNING BOARD AT THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA, I ATTEST THAT: 1. RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE ATHLETICS PROGRAM HAS BEEN DELEGATED TO THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE INSTITUTION; 2. THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER HAS THE MANDATE AND SUPPORT OF THE BOARD TO OPERATE A PROGRAM OF INTEGRITY IN FULL COMPLIANCE WITH NCAA, ACC AND ALL OTHER RELEVANT RULES AND REGULATIONS; AND 3. THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, IN CONSULTATION WITH THE FACULTY ATHLETICS REPRESENTATIVE AND THE DIRECTOR OF ATHLETICS, DETERMINES HOW THE INSTITUTIONAL VOTE SHALL BE CAST ON ISSUES OF ATHLETIC POLICY PRESENTED TO THE NCAA AND ACC.”_

The Rector asked if there were any questions about the certification. He said the President and he would sign the certification.

On motion, the Board adopted the following resolution approving the consideration of addenda to the published Agenda of the meeting:

RESOLUTION TO APPROVE ADDITIONAL ACTION ITEMS

RESOLVED, the Board of Visitors approves the consideration of addenda to the published Agenda.

NCAA Orientation

Mr. Wynne introduced Mr. Steve Flippen, Assistant Athletics Director for Compliance, who explained that Board members are considered “boosters”; they must be very careful to avoid any recruiting activity of student athletes or potential athletes, and they must be aware that any extra benefit provided to a potential student athlete, a former student athlete, or a current student athlete, could constitute an NCAA rules violation. If a Board member finds him or herself in a situation that could be considered recruiting or providing an extra benefit, the Board member should contact the Compliance office before taking any action. He provided a summary of the issues to every Board member.

President’s Report

The President remarked on several matters prior to presenting the Gifts and Grants report.

She said she has provided the Board with two reports on her activities since taking office August 1. She has participated in many meetings and larger events with faculty, alumni, legislators, and others.

Last Wednesday, President Sullivan participated in a philanthropy workshop for deans and development officers. They discussed how they can work together to articulate the University’s priorities and to renew the focus as we push to complete the campaign. She said Mr. Sweeney and his staff are committed to completing the current campaign on-time and on-track, and so is she.

**Last weekend, the first-ever Western United States Alumni Weekend was held to coincide with the football game at the University of Southern California. She said it was a great time together for alumni, parents, and friends on the west coast.**

President Sullivan said that while in California, she also participated in a Campaign Executive Committee meeting on Friday morning, and that evening she spoke at the welcome reception and at a dinner held at the home of Rosa and Robert Sinnott.

She said it has been a busy six weeks, and it’s been a superb crash course on the University, its people, and the people and politics of Virginia. She and her husband have felt a wonderfully warm welcome from everyone in the University community. They are grateful to the members of the Board who have extended such a gracious welcome, and to all the new friends who have welcomed them into the University family.

President Sullivan mentioned the Governor’s Commission on Higher Education Reform, Innovation, and Investment. The Commission’s committee on innovation and cost containment will meet on Grounds on Friday, September 17.

**The first Commission deadline is September 30th for an interim report on findings with state budget implications. November 30th is the deadline for the interim report on findings and recommendations. President Sullivan asked the Rector to comment on his observations of the Commission’s work, which he did.**

**President Sullivan said the Board may notice a new construction project under way in the field near the tennis courts, along University Avenue. She said the University is building two new sand volleyball courts that will be used for conditioning by the women’s indoor volleyball team and also for intramural and club programs with students. Sand volleyball will not be a varsity sport. The courts are being built with private funds.**

**President Sullivan turned to the Gifts and Grants report.**

Temporary Privileges shall be granted in only two (2) circumstances:

(a) When an important patient care need mandates an immediate authorization to practice, an application for temporary privileges will be considered on a case-by­case basis. (This circumstance includes situations in which a Member with specific skills and expertise becomes ill or takes a leave of absence and an individual knowledgeable about the area of practice is needed to provide certain services to a patient or when a patient’s needs require specific, specialized

expertise that no other Member possesses); or

(b) When the Chair of the Credentials Committee has recommended that an Applicant with a complete application with no indication of adverse information about state licensing actions, DEA registrations, current medical, psychiatric or substance abuse impairments that could affect practice, criminal convictions or verdicts/settlements of concern to the Credentials Committee may be granted specific privileges and that recommendation is awaiting review by the full Credentials Committee and the Clinical Staff Executive Committee and approval of the MCOB.

**5.7.2 Application and Review**

(a) Where an important patient care need mandates an immediate authorization to practice as contemplated by 5.7.1 (a), the Chair of the Credentials Committee, with the written concurrence of the Department Chair and the President of the Clinical Staff, may grant Temporary Privileges. Such temporary grant of privileges shall not be made unless the following verifications are present:

(i) Letter from the appropriate Department Chair explaining the important nature of the situation and the benefit to a patient or patients as a result of immediate authorization of the specified task(s);

(ii) Copy of current Virginia license;

1.  Listing of delineated privileges requested with appropriate documentation of competence to perform each of the specified tasks;

(iv) Proof of current liability coverage, showing coverage limits and dates of coverage; and

(v) There exist no state licensing actions, DEA registrations, current medical, psychiatric or substance abuse impairments that could affect practice, criminal convictions or verdicts/settlements of concern to the Credentials Committee.

If the above requirements are not satisfied, Temporary Privileges may not be granted. In addition the Credentials Manual may specify additional verifications required before such Temporary Privileges may be granted.

(b) For all situations arising under 5.7.1 (b), the Chair of the Credentials Committee may grant Temporary Privileges for not more than one hundred twenty (120) days or until such time as the request is officially approved, whichever time is shorter.

(ii) Evidence of a completed query to the National Practitioner Data Bank and an analysis of the evaluation of the results of such query; and

(iii) The Applicant has not been subject to involuntary termination of medical staff membership at another organization, has not been subject to involuntary limitation, reduction, denial or loss of Clinical Privileges and has not relinquished Clinical Privileges at another organization while under investigation by that organization.

The Credentials Manual may specify additional documentation required before such Temporary Privileges may be granted.

**5.7.3 General Conditions**

If granted Temporary Privileges, the Applicant shall act under the supervision of the Department Chair, or his or her designee, to which the Applicant has been assigned, and shall ensure that the Chair, or the Chair’s designee, is kept closely informed as to his or her activities within the Transitional Care Hospital. The Credentials Manual specifies supervisory requirements for the Chair or the Chair’s designee when Temporary Privileges have been granted to an Applicant in the Department.

(a) Temporary Privileges shall automatically terminate at the end of the designated period, unless earlier terminated by the Credentials Committee upon recommendation of the Department Chair, the President or the Chief Executive Officer, or unless affirmatively renewed following the procedure set forth in Section 6.2.

(c) At any time, Temporary Privileges may be terminated by the Clinical Staff Executive Committee. In such cases, the appropriate Department Chair shall assign a Member to assume responsibility for the care of such practitioner’s patient(s). The preferences of the patient shall be considered in the choice of a replacement Member.

(d) A person shall not be entitled to the procedural rights afforded by Article VIII because a request for Temporary Privileges is refused or because all or any portion of Temporary Privileges are terminated or suspended.

**ARTICLE VI  
APPOINTMENT AND REAPPOINTMENT  
**

**6.1 Procedure for Initial Appointment**

When the Dean and a Department Chair have mutually agreed upon a candidate (hereinafter referred to as “Applicant”) for his or her Department, the Dean and the Chair jointly shall forward a copy of the offer letter and a request for appointment and privileges to the Credentials Committee for an initial period not to exceed one (1) year. All required information and documentation shall be submitted in accordance with the Credentials Manual, including the deadlines set forth therein using the application form or other forms required thereby. No application shall be considered until all required information and documentation is completed within the timeframes specified in the [Credentialing Manual](https://www.healthsystem.virginia.edu/intranet/clinicalstaff/doc/Manual_ClinicalStaff_Jan2008.pdf).

The Credentials Committee shall then follow the credentialing procedures set forth in the Credentials Manual including the process related to the information required in an application for initial appointment and the processing of the application. Upon receipt and review of all necessary credentialing documentation, the Credentials Committee shall recommend to the Clinical Staff Executive Committee that such Applicant should either be granted or denied initial privileges in the Transitional Care Hospital. The Clinical Staff Executive Committee shall then review the Credentials Committee’s recommendation and all applicable documentation. If the Credentials Committee and the Clinical Staff Executive Committee are both in favor of granting privileges to the Applicant, the favorable recommendation shall be forwarded to the MCOB for final action.

**6.2 Provisional Appointment Status**

Initial appointments and all initially granted Clinical Privileges for Active and Ph.D. Clinical Pathologist Staff shall be provisional for a period of one year. During this provisional period, the individual’s performance and clinical competence shall be observed and evaluated through FPPE and OPPE by the Chair, Division Chief, or Peer designee of the applicable Department. If at the end of the year the Active or Ph.D. Clinical Pathologist Staff satisfies the requirements to become an active Member as more specifically provided in these Bylaws and the Credentials Manual, the provisional status ceases. If at the end of the year the Active or Ph.D. Clinical Pathologist Staff does not satisfy the requirements to become an active Member as required by these Bylaws and the Credentials Manual, then membership in the Clinical Staff and Clinical Privileges for that individual shall cease. Failure to achieve active status from provisional status shall not give rise to the procedural rights, afforded by Article VIII of these Bylaws.

**6.3 Procedure for Reappointment**

Periodic redetermination of Clinical Privileges for Active and Ph.D. Clinical Staff Members, and the increase or curtailment of same, shall be based upon the reappointment procedures set forth in the Credentials Manual, including deadlines for submission of information and documentation and the forms required thereby. Criteria to be considered at the time of reappointment may include specific information derived from the Department’s direct observation of care provided, information gathered through FPPE and OPPE, review of records of patients treated in this or other medical centers, review of the records of the Departmental Clinical Staff as compared to the records of the particular Member and an appropriate comparison of the performance of the Member with his or her professional colleagues in the Department. If a Member chooses not to seek reappointment or renew privileges, the procedures set forth in Articles VII and VIII shall not apply.

**6.4 Active Status**

An Active or Ph.D. Clinical Pathologist Staff Member may become an active Member with Clinical Privileges upon the satisfactory conclusion of provisional status as provided in these Bylaws and the Credentials Manual, which appointment shall be for no more than two (2) years at a time and as more specifically provided in the Credentials Manual.

**6.5 Changes in Qualification**

If during the course of any period of appointment, the qualifications of the Member change, or the Department learns of Adverse Action taken by an official licensing or certification body or Medicare or Medicaid, then those changes in qualification or Adverse Action must be reported immediately to the Member's Department Chair and the Credentials Committee who will review the information and determine whether the Member's privileges should be revoked, revised, or suspended. The provisions of Section 7.6 or Article VIII may apply.

**6.6 New or Additional Clinical Privileges**

Requests for new or additional Clinical Privileges, including those related to the use of new technology or a new procedure, technique or treatment modality, shall be processed only when the Applicant meets the Transitional Care Hospital approved criteria. In the event there are no approved criteria, the Transitional Care Hospital shall first determine whether it will allow the new or additional Clinical Privilege, and if so the procedure described in the Credentials Manual or Transitional Care Hospital policy for new or additional Clinical Privileges shall be followed. Applications for new or additional Clinical Privileges must be in writing and submitted by the Applicant as well as by the appropriate Department Chair. All applications for new or additional Clinical Privileges shall be submitted on a form prescribed by the Credentials Committee upon which the type of Clinical Privileges desired and, among other things, the Member’s relevant recent training and/or experience are set out, together with any other information required by the Credentials Manual or the Credentials Committee. Such applications shall be processed as provided in the Credentials Manual, including the timeline for processing. The Credentials Committee shall determine the conditions and requirements upon which any new or additional Clinical Privileges shall be granted, including but not limited to, how current competence will be demonstrated and any proctoring or other monitoring requirements, and will recommend the requirements to the Clinical Staff Executive Committee for consideration. In turn CSEC shall make appropriate recommendations regarding new or additional Clinical Privileges to the Medical Center Operating Board for final determination. A decision not to approve a new or additional Clinical Privilege to be performed within the Transitional Care Hospital and/or to be added to the Transitional Care Hospital privilege list shall not be deemed an Adverse Action or a denial of privileges nor entitle any individual to the hearing rights set forth in Article VIII of these Bylaws.

**6.7 Burden of Producing Information**

In connection with all applications for appointment of membership and for Clinical Privileges, the Applicant shall have the burden of producing information for an adequate evaluation of the Applicant’s qualifications and suitability for the Clinical Privileges requested, of resolving any reasonable doubts about these matters, and of satisfying requests for information. This burden may include submission to a medical or psychological examination, at the Applicant’s expense, if deemed appropriate by the Department Chair, the President of the Clinical Staff, the Chair of the Credentials Committee, the Chief Executive Officer of the Transitional Care Hospital, the Dean of the School of Medicine, or the Director of the Physician Wellness Program. The President of the Clinical Staff, the Chair of the Credentials Committee, the Chief Executive Officer of the Transitional Care Hospital, or the Director of the Physician Wellness Program shall select the examining physician, program, and/or site of the examination.

The Applicant or Member has a duty to advise the Credentials Committee, within fifteen (15) days, of any change in information previously submitted by him or her related to his or her credentials. The Applicant’s failure to sustain these duties shall be grounds for denial of the application or termination of a Member’s Clinical Staff membership and a Member or Non-Member’s Clinical Privileges.

**6.8 Acknowledgment of Applicant**

Each Applicant shall sign and specifically acknowledge his or her agreement:

(a) to provide for appropriate continuous care and supervision of his or her patients;

(b) to abide by the Clinical Staff Bylaws, the Transitional Care Hospital Policy Manual, the

Code of Conduct, the Compliance Code of Conduct, the Code of Ethics and all other Transitional Care Hospital policies, procedure, rules, or regulations applicable to the Clinical Staff or to Non-Members;

(c) to comply with procedures for appointment and reappointment to the Clinical Staff as set forth in the Credentials Manual or otherwise deemed appropriate by the Credentials Committee;

(d) to participate in quality improvement and Peer Review activities of the Transitional Care Hospital and to accept committee assignments, as applicable;

1.  to release from liability, to the fullest extent permitted by law, all persons for their acts performed in connection with investigating and evaluating the Applicant;

(f) to submit to a mental or physical health examination as requested by the Department Chair, the President of the Clinical Staff, the Chair of the Credentials Committee, the Chief Executive Officer of the Transitional Care Hospital, the Dean of the School of Medicine, or the Director of the Physician Wellness Program; and

(g) to abide by all requirements contained in the Appointment Acceptance Form and all other requirements contained in the Credentials Manual.

**ARTICLE VII  
CORRECTIVE ACTION FOR MEMBERS AND NON-MEMBERS WITH CLINICAL  
PRIVILEGES  
**

**7.1 Criteria for Initiation**

A Member’s and Non-Member’s Clinical Privileges may be reduced, suspended or terminated for activities or professional conduct considered to be lower than the standards of the Transitional Care Hospital and the Clinical Staff, or to be disruptive to operations of the Transitional Care Hospital, or for violation of these Bylaws, directives of the Clinical Staff Executive Committee or the MCOB, the Code of Conduct, or policies, procedures, rules or regulations of the Transitional Care Hospital or the applicable Clinical Department. Any person may provide information to a Department Chair, the Clinical Staff Executive Committee, the Chief Executive Officer, the Dean, the President, the President-elect, the MCOB, the Associate Chief of Long Term Acute Care, or any member of the administration of the Transitional Care Hospital about the conduct, performance, or competence of any Member or Non-Member who has been granted Clinical Privileges.

A request for initiation of investigation or action against such Member or Non-Member shall be made by written request from any other Member, including the President, or from the Chief Executive Officer or the Associate Chief of Long Term Acute Care. Upon receipt of a written request for investigation or action, the individual or entity that received such request shall immediately forward the matter to the Credentials Committee for investigation when the information provided indicates that such Member or Non-Member may have exhibited acts, demeanor, or conduct reasonably likely to be: (a) detrimental to patient safety or to the delivery of quality patient care; (b) unethical; (c) contrary to the Transitional Care Hospital’s policies and procedures, these Bylaws, or the Code of Conduct; (d) disruptive to the operation of the Transitional Care Hospital; (e) below applicable professional standards; or (f) the result of impairment of the Member or Non-Member by reason of illness, use of drugs, narcotics, alcohol, chemicals or other substances or as a result of any physical or mental condition that impairs the Member’s or Non-Member’s clinical practice. To the extent possible, the identity of the individual requesting initiation of investigation shall not be disclosed.

**7.2 Alternatives to Corrective Action**

Initial collegial efforts may be made prior to resorting to formal corrective action, when appropriate. Such collegial interventions on the part of Clinical Staff leaders in addressing the conduct or performance of an individual shall not constitute corrective action, shall not afford the individual subject to such efforts to the right to a fair hearing, and shall not require reporting to the NPDB, except as otherwise provided in these Bylaws or required by law. Alternatives to corrective action may include:

(a) Informal discussions or formal meetings regarding the concerns raised about conduct or performance, including the actions outlined in these Bylaws or Transitional Care Hospital policies that may be taken to address disruptive conduct;

(b) Written letters of guidance, reprimand, or warning regarding the concerns about conduct or performance;

(c) Notification that future conduct or performance shall be closely monitored and notification of expectations for improvement;

(d) Suggestions or requirements that the individual seek continuing education, consultations, or other assistance in improving performance;

(e) Warnings regarding the potential consequences of failure to improve conduct or performance; and/or

(f) Requirements to seek assistance for impairment, as provided in these Bylaws.

**7.3 Initiating Evaluation and/or Investigation of Possible Impairing Conditions**

At any time, a Department Chair, the President, the Chief Executive Officer, the Dean, the Chair of the Credentials Committee, or the Director of the Physicians’ Wellness Program may require that a Member or Non-Member who has been granted Clinical Privileges undergo a physical and/or mental examination(s) by one or more qualified practitioners or programs specified by the individual requiring the evaluation. If the Member or Non-Member refuses to undergo the examination, his/her Clinical Privileges shall be automatically suspended and there shall be no further consideration of continued privileges until the examination is performed. The Member or Non-Member shall authorize the qualified practitioner(s), to submit reports of the evaluation(s), as appropriate, to the Chair of the Credentials Committee, the Department Chair, the President, the Chief Executive Officer, the Dean, the Director of the Physician’s Wellness Program and the person or entity requesting the examination(s). Any time limit for action by the Credentials Committee, as specified in Section 7.4 below, shall be extended for the number of days from the request for the examination(s) to the receipt of the examination report(s).

The MCOB and the Clinical Staff Executive Committee recognize the need to assist Members or Non-Members who have been granted Clinical Privileges regarding their physical and mental health issues as well as to protect patients from harm. Accordingly, upon the recommendation of the Department Chair, the President, the Dean or the Chief Executive Officer, or on its own initiative, the Credentials Committee shall investigate any Member or Non-Member who appears to suffer from a potentially impairing condition. Any such Member or Non-Member is encouraged to seek assistance from the Physicians’ Wellness Program and/or the Employee Assistance Program or any successor program thereto.

The Credentials Committee may also require periodic monitoring after completion of the initial treatment/rehabilitation. If the Member or Non-Member does not complete the initial treatment/rehabilitation program or does not comply with the required monitoring, the provisions of Article 7.4 or 7.5 shall be applicable. In addition, the Credentials Committee shall strictly adhere to any state or federal statutes or regulations containing mandatory reporting requirements.

The purpose of the evaluation and investigation process concerning potential impairing conditions is to protect patients and to aid the Member or Non-Member in retaining or regaining optimal professional functioning. If the Member or Non-Member in question seeks such assistance, the Credentials Committee shall report to the Clinical Staff Executive Committee that he/she is voluntarily seeking treatment and has agreed to appropriate monitoring.

If at any time during the diagnosis, treatment, or rehabilitation phase of the process it is determined that a Member or Non-Member is unable to safely perform the Clinical Privileges he or she has been granted, the Credentials Committee shall proceed in accordance with Sections

7.4 or 7.5, as appropriate, below. Additionally, the Credentials Committee shall strictly adhere to any state or federal statutes or regulations containing mandatory reporting requirements.

**7.4 Initiating Evaluation and Recommendation for Corrective Action**

**7.4.1 Investigation**

Upon receipt of the request for initiation of corrective action, the Credentials Committee shall conduct a thorough investigation of the Member or Non-Member who has been granted Clinical Privileges in question. The Member or Non-Member shall be notified in writing that an investigation is being conducted. In addition the applicable Department Chair, the Dean, and the Chief Executive Officer shall be notified of the investigation. The Member or Non-Member shall provide to the Credentials Committee all available information that it requests. Failure to provide such requested information will itself be considered grounds for corrective action. The Credentials Committee may, but is not obligated to, review medical files or other documents and conduct interviews with witnesses; however, such investigation shall not constitute a “hearing” as that term is used in Article VIII, nor shall the procedural rules with respect to hearings or appeals apply. The Credentials Committee may, in its sole discretion, request an interview with the Member or Non-Member under investigation and, during such interview, question the Member or Non-Member about matters under investigation. A record of such interview shall be made by the Credentials Committee. Within forty (40) days of the receipt of the request for initiation of investigation, the Credentials Committee shall report to the Clinical Staff Executive Committee on the progress of the investigation and the estimated time required to complete the investigation. In most instances, the investigation shall not last longer than ninety (90) days. However, for good cause, the Chair of the Credentials Committee may ask the Clinical Staff Executive Committee to extend the time for completion of the investigation. At the completion of the investigation, the Chair of the Credentials Committee shall submit to the Clinical Staff Executive Committee the Credentials Committee’s findings and recommendations resulting from the investigation.

The Clinical Staff Executive Committee may accept, reject or modify the findings and recommendations of the Credentials Committee and recommend to the MCOB approval of a final action. The Member and Chair of the Clinical Department to which the Member is assigned shall be notified in writing of the recommendation of the Clinical Staff Executive Committee.

**7.4.2 Recommendation**

The Credentials Committee’s written recommendation to the Clinical Staff Executive Committee of action to be taken on the matter may include, without limitation:

(a) determining that no further action is necessary on the matter;

(b) issuing a warning, a letter of admonition, or a letter of reprimand;

(c) recommending terms of probation or requirements of consultation;

(d) recommending reduction, suspension or revocation of Clinical Privileges in accordance with Sections 7.5 or 7.6 herein;

(e) recommending reduction of Clinical Staff category or limitation of any Staff prerogatives directly related to patient care;

(f) recommending suspension or revocation of Clinical Staff membership;

(g) recommending concurrent monitoring or retrospective auditing;

(h) requiring additional training;

(i) requiring evaluation by a physician assessment organization or individual; or

(j) requiring a proctor for all procedures.

Any corrective action in accordance with subsections (c) through (f) of this Section shall entitle the Member to the procedural rights provided in Article VIII of these Bylaws.

**7.5 Precautionary Summary Suspension**

(i) Whenever the conduct of a Member or a non-Member who has been granted Clinical Privileges reasonably appears to pose an imminent threat that requires that immediate action be taken to protect the health, life or well-being of patients or prospective patients, or any other person in or associated with the Transitional Care Hospital, or (ii) whenever the conduct of a Member or a Non-Member who has been granted Clinical Privileges reasonably appears to pose a substantial likelihood of harm to the life, health and safety of any patient or prospective patient, or (iii) whenever the Member or Non-Member who has been granted Clinical Privileges refuses to follow these Bylaws, the Credentials Manual, the policies, procedures, rules and regulations of the Clinical Staff and/or the Transitional Care Hospital, or (iv) whenever a Member or Non-Member has made a material misrepresentation on the application for Clinical Staff membership or Clinical Privileges, then in any such event the President, the Chair of the Credentials Committee, or the Chief Executive Officer may summarily restrict or suspend the Clinical Staff membership or Clinical Privileges of such Member of non-Member. Unless otherwise stated, such summary suspension shall become effective immediately upon imposition, and the person responsible shall promptly give written notice of the suspension or restriction to the Member or non-Member in question, the Chair of the Department and the Division Chief, if applicable, to which the Member is assigned, the Chief Executive Officer, the Associate Chief of Long Term Acute Care, and the Clinical Staff Executive Committee. The summary restriction or suspension may be limited in duration and shall remain in effect for the period stated or, if not so limited, shall remain in effect until resolved by the procedures specified in Article VIII with respect to Members only. Unless otherwise indicated by the terms of the summary restriction or suspension, the President or his/her designee shall assign the patients of the Member or Non-Member in question to another Member.

**7.5.1 Procedure for Members**

No later than thirty (30) days after the date of the precautionary summary suspension, and if the precautionary summary suspension still remains in effect, the Clinical Staff Executive Committee shall convene to review and consider the action; provided, however, that the Clinical Staff Executive Committee may extend the 30 day period for review for good cause if so requested by either a Member or the Chair of the Credentials Committee. Upon request and on such terms and conditions as the Clinical Staff Executive Committee may impose, the Member may attend and make a statement concerning the issues that led to the precautionary summary suspension, although in no event shall any meeting of the Clinical Staff Executive Committee, with or without the Member, constitute a “hearing” within the meaning of Article VIII, nor shall any procedural rules apply except those adopted by the Clinical Staff Executive Committee. The Member’s failure without good cause to attend any Clinical Staff Executive Committee meeting upon request shall constitute a waiver of his or her rights under Article VIII. The Clinical Staff Executive Committee may modify, continue, or terminate the summary restriction or suspension, but in any event it shall furnish the Member with notice of its decision.

Unless the Clinical Staff Executive Committee terminates the summary restriction or suspension within ninety (90) working days of such restriction or suspension, the Member shall be entitled to the procedural rights afforded by Article VIII of these Bylaws.

**7.5.2 Procedure for Non-Members**

A Non-Member whose Clinical Privileges are summarily suspended pursuant to Section

7.5 shall be notified in writing of the suspension and the grounds for the suspension. Within ten (10) working days of such suspension, the Non-Member may request a meeting with the Chair of the Credentials Committee in order to discuss the suspension. In any event, the Chair of the Credentials Committee shall refer the matter to the Credentials Committee at its next scheduled meeting. The Non-Member shall not be entitled to the procedural rights afforded by Article VIII of the Bylaws.

**7.6 Automatic Suspension**

In the following instances, the Member’s or Non-Member’s Clinical Privileges may be automatically suspended or limited, as specifically described by the President, the Chair of the Credentials Committee or the Chief Executive Officer. In addition, in each of the instances listed below, the Member’s Clinical Staff Membership shall be suspended or limited, as specifically described by the President, the Chair of the Credentials Committee or the Chief Executive Officer:

**7.6.1 Change in Licensure**

**7.6.1.1 Revocation or Suspension**

Whenever a Member’s or Non-Member’s license authorizing practice in the Commonwealth of Virginia is revoked or suspended by the applicable health regulatory board, Clinical Privileges shall be automatically revoked or suspended as of the date such action becomes effective.

**7.6.1.2 Probation and Other Restriction**

If a Member’s or Non-Member’s license authorizing practice in the Commonwealth of Virginia is placed on probation by the applicable health regulatory board, his or her Clinical Privileges shall automatically become subject to the same terms and conditions of the probation as of the date such action becomes effective and throughout its duration.

Whenever a Member’s or Non-Member’s license authorizing practice in the Commonwealth of Virginia is limited or restricted by the applicable health regulatory board, any Clinical Privileges that the Member or Non-Member has been granted by the Medical Center that are within the scope of such limitation or restriction shall be automatically limited or restricted in a similar manner, as of the date such licensing or certifying authority’s action becomes effective and throughout its duration.

**7.6.2 Change in DEA Certificate Status**

**7.6.2.1 Revocation or Suspension**

If a Member’s or Non-Member’s DEA certificate is revoked, limited, or suspended, the Member or Non-Member shall automatically be divested of the right to prescribe medications covered by the certificate as of the date such action becomes effective and throughout its term.

**7.6.2.2 Probation**

If a Member’s or a Non-Member’s DEA certificate is subject to probation, the Member’s or Non-Member’s right to prescribe such medications automatically shall become subject to the same terms of the probation, as of the date such action becomes effective and throughout its term.

**7.6.3 Lack of Required Professional Liability Insurance**

Failure to maintain professional liability insurance in amounts and of a type required by the MCOB, as such amounts shall be defined from time to time, shall be a basis for automatic suspension of a Member’s or a Non-Member’s Clinical Privileges. If within 30 days after written warnings of such delinquency, the Member or Non-Member does not provide evidence of the required professional liability insurance, such individual’s Clinical Privileges shall be automatically terminated.

**7.6.4 Federal Program Exclusion**

If a Member of a Non-Member is convicted of a crime pursuant to the Medicare and Medicaid Protection Act of 1987, Pub. L. 100-93, or a crime related to the provision of health care items or services for which one may be excluded under 42 U.S.C. Section 1320a7(a), or is suspended, excluded, debarred or otherwise declared ineligible to participate in Medicare or Medicaid or other federal or state health care or other programs, such Member’s or Non-Member’s Clinical Privileges shall be automatically suspended as of the date such conviction or action with respect to the Medicare or Medicaid federal program becomes effective.

**7.6.5 Loss of Faculty Appointment**

If a Member’s faculty appointment in the School of Medicine is terminated for any reason or for any length of time, his/her membership and Clinical Privileges within the Transitional Care Hospital shall be automatically revoked or suspended as of the date such loss of faculty appointment becomes effective. Loss of faculty appointment shall not give rise to a hearing under Article VIII as such appointment is a prerequisite to membership. Due process procedures applicable to contesting the loss of a faculty appointment are set forth in the University of Virginia Faculty Handbook.

**7.6.6 Failure to Undergo Physical and/or Mental Examination**

If a Member or Non-Member fails or refuses to undergo a physical and/or mental examination as required by Section 7.3 of these Bylaws, such failure or refusal shall result in automatic suspension of the Clinical Privileges of the Member or Non-Member.

**7.6.7 Article VIII Inapplicable**

When a Member’s or Non-Member’s privileges are restricted pursuant to any of the circumstances set out in this Section 7.6 , the hearing and appeal rights of Article VIII shall not apply and the action shall be effective for the time specified. If the Member believes that any such automatic restriction of privileges is the result of an error, the Member may request a meeting with the Clinical Staff Executive Committee. A Non-Member shall have no right to a meeting with the Clinical Staff Executive Committee.

**ARTICLE VIII  
HEARING AND APPELLATE REVIEW FOR MEMBERS  
**

**8.1 General Provisions**

**8.1.1 Right to Hearing and Appellate Review**

(a) When any Member receives notice of a recommendation of the Clinical Staff Executive Committee that, if approved by the MCOB, will adversely affect his or her appointment to or status as a Member or his or her exercise of Clinical Privileges, he or she shall be entitled to a hearing before a hearing committee appointed by the Chair or Vice Chair of the Clinical Staff Executive Committee. If the recommendation of the Clinical Staff Executive Committee following such hearing is still adverse to the affected Member, he or she shall then be entitled to an appellate review by the MCOB or a committee appointed by the Chair of the MCOB, before the MCOB makes a final decision on the matter. Such review shall be made based on the evidentiary record, unless the MCOB or the committee appointed by the MCOB to hear the appeal requests additional information.

(b) All hearings and appellate reviews shall be in accordance with the procedural safeguards set forth in Article VIII to assure that the affected Member is accorded all rights to which he or she is entitled.

**8.1.2 Exhaustion of Remedies**

If Adverse Action described in Section 8.2 is taken or recommended, the Applicant or Member must exhaust the remedies afforded by these Bylaws before resorting to legal action. For purposes of Article VIII, the term “Member” may include “Applicant”, as appropriate under the circumstances.

**8.3.4 Notice of Time, Place and Procedures for Hearing**

Upon receipt of a request for hearing, the Chair or Vice Chair of the Clinical Staff Executive Committee shall schedule a hearing and give notice to the Member of the time, place and date of the hearing, which shall not be less than thirty (30) days after the date of the notice. Each party shall provide the other with a list of witnesses within fifteen (15) days of the hearing date, unless both parties agree otherwise. Witness lists shall be finalized no later than five (5) working days before the hearing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Hearing Entity shall have the right to call such witnesses as it deems appropriate and necessary. Unless extended by the Chair of the Hearing Entity, described in Section 8.3.5 below, the date of the commencement of the hearing shall be not less than thirty (30) days, nor more than ninety (90) days from the date of receipt of the request for a hearing; provided, however, that when the request is received from a Member who is under summary suspension, the hearing shall be held as soon as the arrangements may reasonably be made and provided further that the parties may agree to a mutually convenient date beyond the ninety (90) day period.

**8.3.5 Hearing Entity**

The Chair of the Clinical Staff Executive Committee may, in his or her discretion and in consultation with the Chair of the Credentials Committee, the Chief Executive Officer and other members of CSEC as he or she deems appropriate, direct that the hearing be held: (1) before a panel of no fewer than three (3) Members who are appointed by the Chair of the Clinical Staff Executive Committee and the Chief Executive Officer and if possible are Peers of the Member in clinical practice or academic rank and are not in direct economic competition with the Member involved, or (2) by an independent Peer Review panel from outside the Transitional Care Hospital whose members are not in direct economic competition with the Member involved, or (3) a panel consisting of a combination of (1) and (2). Each type of panel described in the preceding sentence shall be referred to hereinafter as the “Hearing Entity.” Knowledge of the matter involved shall not preclude a Clinical Staff Member from serving as a member of the Hearing Entity; however each member must certify at the time of appointment and also on the record at the hearing that any prior knowledge he or she may have does not preclude rendering a fair and impartial decision. The Chair of the Clinical Staff Executive Committee shall designate the chair of the Hearing Entity. At least three-quarters of the members of the Hearing Entity shall be present when the hearing takes place and no member may vote by proxy. In the event of any conflict involving the Chair of the Clinical Staff Executive Committee, the Vice Chair of CSEC shall be responsible for performing the duties described in this paragraph.

**8.3.6 Failure to Attend and Proceed**

Failure without good cause of the affected Member to personally attend and proceed at such a hearing shall be deemed to constitute voluntary acceptance of the recommendations involved and his or her request for a hearing shall be deemed to have been withdrawn.

**8.3.7 Postponements and Extensions**

Once a request for hearing is initiated, postponements and extensions of time beyond the times permitted in these Bylaws may be permitted by the Hearing Entity, or its chairperson, acting upon its behalf. Such decisions are solely within the discretion of the Hearing Entity or its presiding officer and may only be granted for good cause.

**8.4 Hearing Procedure**

**8.4.1 Representation**

The hearings provided for in these Bylaws are for the purpose of intra-professional resolution of matters bearing on professional conduct, professional competency or character. Nevertheless, if requested by either the affected Member or the Credentials Committee, both sides may be represented by legal counsel. In lieu of legal counsel, the Member may be represented by another person of the Member’s choice.

**8.4.2 The Hearing Officer**

The President may appoint a hearing officer to preside at the hearing. In the sole discretion of the President, the hearing officer may be an attorney qualified to preside over a quasi-judicial hearing. If requested by the Hearing Entity, the hearing officer may participate in the deliberations of the Hearing Entity and be an advisor to it, but the hearing officer shall not be entitled to vote.

**8.4.3 The Presiding Officer**

The Hearing Entity shall have a presiding officer. If the President appoints a hearing officer pursuant to Section 8.4.2, then the hearing officer shall serve as the presiding officer. If no hearing officer is appointed, then the Chair of the Hearing Entity shall serve as the presiding officer. The presiding officer shall strive to assure that all participants in the hearing have a reasonable opportunity to be heard and to present relevant oral and documentary evidence in an efficient and expeditious manner, and that proper decorum is maintained. The presiding officer shall be entitled to determine the order of or procedure for presenting evidence and argument during the hearing and shall have the authority and discretion to make all rulings on questions that pertain to matters of law, procedure, or the admissibility of evidence. If the presiding officer determines that either side in a hearing is not proceeding in an efficient and expeditious manner, the presiding officer may take such discretionary action as seems warranted by the circumstances.

**8.4.4 Record of the Hearing**

An official reporter shall be present to make a record of the hearing proceedings. The cost of attendance of the reporter shall be borne by the Transitional Care Hospital, but the cost of the transcript, if any, shall be borne by the party requesting it.

Within reasonable limitations imposed by the presiding officer, the Credentials Committee, the Hearing Entity and the affected Member may call and examine witnesses for relevant testimony, introduce relevant exhibits or other documents, cross-examine or impeach witnesses who have testified orally on any matter relevant to the issues and otherwise rebut evidence. The Member may be called by the Credentials Committee or the Hearing Entity, as appropriate, and be examined as if under cross-examination.

(a) Burden of Proof. The Credentials Committee shall appoint one of its members to represent it at the hearing, to present facts in support of its adverse recommendation and to examine witnesses. Where the issue concerns the denial of initial Clinical Staff membership, it shall be the obligation of the affected practitioner to present appropriate evidence in support of his or her application, but the Credentials Committee representative shall then be responsible for showing that evidence exists to support the decision and that the Credentials Committee appropriately exercised its authority under these Bylaws and other applicable rules or regulations of the Transitional Care Hospital. In all other situations outlined in Section 8.2 above, it shall be the obligation of the Credentials Committee representative to present appropriate evidence in support of the adverse recommendation, but the affected Member shall then be responsible for supporting his or her challenge to the adverse recommendation by providing appropriate evidence showing that the grounds for the decision lacked support in fact or that such grounds or action based upon such grounds is either arbitrary or capricious.

(b) Written Statement. Each party shall have the right to submit a written statement at the close of the hearing.

(c) Written Decision. Upon completion of the hearing, the affected Member shall be informed in writing by the Clinical Staff Executive Committee of the recommendation of the Hearing Entity, including a statement of the basis for the recommendation, and shall be informed in writing of the decisions of the Clinical Staff Executive Committee and the MCOB, including a statement of the basis for the decision.

**8.4.6 Evidence**

Judicial rules of evidence and procedure relating to the conduct of the hearing, examination of witnesses, and presentation of evidence shall not apply to a hearing conducted under Article VIII of these Bylaws. Any relevant evidence, including hearsay, shall be admitted if it is the sort of evidence on which responsible persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious affairs, regardless of the admissibility of such evidence in a court of law. The Hearing Entity may question the witnesses or call additional witnesses if it deems such action appropriate. At its discretion, the Hearing Entity may request both parties to file written arguments.

**8.4.7 Recess and Conclusion**

After consultation with the Hearing Entity, the presiding officer may recess the hearing and reconvene the same at such times and intervals as may be reasonable, with due consideration for reaching an expeditious conclusion to the hearing. Upon conclusion of the presentation of oral and documentary evidence and the receipt of any closing written arguments, the hearing shall be closed. The Hearing Entity shall, at a time convenient to itself, conduct its deliberations outside the presence of the parties. The Hearing Entity may seek legal counsel during its deliberations and the preparation of its report. Upon conclusion of its deliberations, the hearing shall be declared finally adjourned.

**8.4.8 Decision of the Hearing Entity**

Within fifteen (15) days after final adjournment of the hearing, the Hearing Entity shall render a decision, which shall be accompanied by a report in writing and shall be delivered to the Clinical Staff Executive Committee. If the affected Member is currently under summary suspension, the Hearing Entity shall render a decision and report to the Clinical Staff Executive Committee within five (5) working days after final adjournment. A copy of the decision shall also be forwarded to the MCOB and the affected Member. The report shall contain a concise statement of the reasons supporting the decision.

The Clinical Staff Executive Committee may affirm, modify or reverse the decision of the Hearing Entity.

**8.4.10 Appeal**

The Member may submit to the Chief Executive Officer a written appeal statement detailing the findings of fact, conclusions, and procedural matters with which he/she disagrees, and his/her reasons for such disagreement. This written appeal statement may cover any matters raised at any step in the hearing process, and legal counsel may assist in its preparation. The statement shall be delivered by hand or by certified or registered mail to the Chief Executive Officer and received no later than fourteen (14) days after the Member’s receipt of the recommendation of the Clinical Staff Executive Committee. The Chief Executive Officer shall promptly provide a copy of the Member’s statement to the MCOB. In response to the statement submitted by the affected Member, the Clinical Staff Executive Committee may also submit a written statement to the MCOB and shall provide a copy of any such written statement to the Member.

**8.4.11 Decision by the Operating Board**

(a) At a regularly scheduled meeting following receipt of the Member’s written appeal statement (or the expiration of the time in which the Member had the opportunity to submit a written statement) and the Clinical Staff Executive Committee’s written statement, the MCOB shall render a decision in writing and shall forward copies thereof to each party involved in the hearing. The decision of the MCOB shall include a statement of the basis for its decision.

(b) The MCOB may affirm, modify, or reverse the decision of the Clinical Staff Executive Committee for reconsideration. If the matter is remanded to the Hearing Entity for further review and recommendation, such Hearing Entity shall conduct its review within fifteen (15) working days and make its recommendations to the MCOB. This further review and the time required to report back shall not exceed sixty (60) days except as the parties may otherwise agree, for good cause, as jointly determined by the Chair of the MCOB and the Hearing Entity or Clinical Staff Executive Committee. The Executive Committee, or remand the matter to the Hearing Entity or the Clinical Staff MCOB shall thereafter make its final decision.

(c) The decision of the MCOB as reflected in paragraphs (a) or (b) above shall constitute final action. This decision shall be immediately effective and shall not be subject to further hearing, appellate or judicial review.

**ARTICLE VI  
APPOINTMENT AND REAPPOINTMENT  
**

**6.1 Procedure for Initial Appointment**

When the Dean and a Department Chair have mutually agreed upon a candidate (hereinafter referred to as “Applicant”) for his or her Department, the Dean and the Chair jointly shall forward a copy of the offer letter and a request for appointment and privileges to the Credentials Committee for an initial period not to exceed one (1) year. All required information and documentation shall be submitted in accordance with the Credentials Manual, including the deadlines set forth therein using the application form or other forms required thereby. No application shall be considered until all required information and documentation is completed within the timeframes specified in the [Credentials Manual](https://www.healthsystem.virginia.edu/intranet/clinicalstaff/doc/Manual_ClinicalStaff_Jan2008.pdf).

The Credentials Committee shall then follow the credentialing procedures set forth in the Credentials Manual including the process related to the information required in an application for initial appointment and the processing of the application. Upon receipt and review of all necessary credentialing documentation, the Credentials Committee shall recommend to the Clinical Staff Executive Committee that such Applicant should either be granted or denied initial privileges in the Medical Center. The Clinical Staff Executive Committee shall then review the Credentials Committee’s recommendation and all applicable documentation. If the Credentials Committee and the Clinical Staff Executive Committee are both in favor of granting privileges to the Applicant, the favorable recommendation shall be forwarded to the MCOB for final action.

**6.2 Provisional Appointment Status**

Initial appointments and all initially granted Clinical Privileges for Active and Ph.D. Clinical Pathologist Staff shall be provisional for a period of one year. During this provisional period, the individual’s performance and clinical competence shall be observed and evaluated through FPPE and OPPE by the Chair, Division Chief, or Peer designee of the applicable Department. If at the end of the year the Active or Ph.D. Clinical Pathologist Staff satisfies the requirements to become an active Member as more specifically provided in these Bylaws and the Credentials Manual, the provisional status ceases. If at the end of the year the Active or Ph.D. Clinical Pathologist Staff does not satisfy the requirements to become an active Member as required by these Bylaws and the Credentials Manual, then membership in the Clinical Staff and Clinical Privileges for that individual shall cease. Failure to achieve active status from provisional status shall not give rise to the procedural rights, afforded by Article VIII of these Bylaws.

**6.3 Procedure for Reappointment**

Periodic redetermination of Clinical Privileges for Active and Ph.D. Clinical Staff Members, and the increase or curtailment of same, shall be based upon the reappointment procedures set forth in the Credentials Manual, including deadlines for submission of information and documentation and the forms required thereby. Criteria to be considered at the time of reappointment may include specific information derived from the Department’s direct observation of care provided, information gathered through FPPE and OPPE, review of records of patients treated in this or other medical centers, review of the records of the Departmental Clinical Staff as compared to the records of the particular Member and an appropriate comparison of the performance of the Member with his or her professional colleagues in the Department. If a Member chooses not to seek reappointment or renew privileges, the procedures set forth in Articles VII and VIII shall not apply.

**6.4 Active Status**

An Active or Ph.D. Clinical Pathologist Staff Member may become an active Member with Clinical Privileges upon the satisfactory conclusion of provisional status as provided in these Bylaws and the Credentials Manual, which appointment shall be for no more than two (2) years at a time and as more specifically provided in the Credentials Manual.

**6.5 Changes in Qualification**

If during the course of any period of appointment, the qualifications of the Member change, or the Department learns of Adverse Action taken by an official licensing or certification body or Medicare or Medicaid, then those changes in qualification or Adverse Action must be reported immediately to the Member's Department Chair and the Credentials Committee who will review the information and determine whether the Member's privileges should be revoked, revised, or suspended. The provisions of Section 7.6 or Article VIII may apply.

**6.6 New or Additional Clinical Privileges**

Requests for new or additional Clinical Privileges, including those related to the use of new technology or a new procedure, technique or treatment modality, shall be processed only when the Applicant meets the Medical Center approved criteria. In the event there are no approved criteria, the Medical Center shall first determine whether it will allow the new or additional Clinical Privilege, and if so the procedure described in the Credentials Manual or Medical Center policy for new or additional Clinical Privileges shall be followed. Applications for new or additional Clinical Privileges must be in writing and submitted by the Applicant as well as by the appropriate Department Chair. All applications for new or additional Clinical Privileges shall be submitted on a form prescribed by the Credentials Committee upon which the type of Clinical Privileges desired and, among other things, the Member’s relevant recent training and/or experience are set out, together with any other information required by the Credentials Manual or the Credentials Committee. Such applications shall be processed as provided in the Credentials Manual, including the timeline for processing. The Credentials Committee shall determine the conditions and requirements upon which any new or additional Clinical Privileges shall be granted, including but not limited to, how current competence will be demonstrated and any proctoring or other monitoring requirements, and will recommend the requirements to the Clinical Staff Executive Committee for consideration. In turn CSEC shall make appropriate recommendations regarding new or additional Clinical Privileges to the Medical Center Operating Board for final determination. A decision not to approve a new or additional Clinical Privilege to be performed within the Medical Center and/or to be added to the Medical Center privilege list shall not be deemed an Adverse Action or a denial of privileges nor entitle any individual to the hearing rights set forth in Article VIIII of these Bylaws.

**6.7 Burden of Producing Information**

In connection with all applications for appointment of membership and for Clinical Privileges, the Applicant shall have the burden of producing information for an adequate evaluation of the Applicant’s qualifications and suitability for the Clinical Privileges requested, of resolving any reasonable doubts about these matters, and of satisfying requests for information. This burden may include submission to a medical or psychological examination, at the Applicant’s expense, if deemed appropriate by the Department Chair, the President of the Clinical Staff, the Chair of the Credentials Committee, the Chief Executive Officer of the Medical Center, the Dean of the School of Medicine, or the Director of the Physician Wellness Program. The President of the Clinical Staff, the Chair of the Credentials Committee, the Chief Executive Officer of the Medical Center, or the Director of the Physician Wellness Program shall select the examining physician, program, and/or site of the examination.

The Applicant or Member has a duty to advise the Credentials Committee, within fifteen (15) days, of any change in information previously submitted by him or her related to his or her credentials. The Applicant’s failure to sustain these duties shall be grounds for denial of the application or termination of a Member’s Clinical Staff membership and a Member or Non-Member’s Clinical Privileges.

**6.8 Acknowledgment of Applicant**

Each Applicant shall sign and specifically acknowledge his or her agreement:

(a) to provide for appropriate continuous care and supervision of his or her patients;

**ARTICLE VII  
CORRECTIVE ACTION FOR MEMBERS AND NON-MEMBERS WITH CLINICAL  
PRIVILEGES  
**

**7.1 Criteria for Initiation**

A Member’s and Non-Member’s Clinical Privileges may be reduced, suspended or terminated for activities or professional conduct considered to be lower than the standards of the Medical Center and the Clinical Staff, or to be disruptive to operations of the Medical Center, or for violation of these Bylaws, directives of the Clinical Staff Executive Committee or the MCOB, the Code of Conduct, or policies, procedures, rules or regulations of the Medical Center or the applicable Clinical Department. Any person may provide information to a Department Chair, the Clinical Staff Executive Committee, the Chief Executive Officer, the Dean, the Chief Medical Officer, the President, the President-elect, the MCOB or any member of the administration of the Medical Center about the conduct, performance, or competence of any Member or Non-Member who has been granted Clinical Privileges.

A request for initiation of investigation or action against such Member or Non-Member shall be made by written request from any other Member, including the President, or from the Chief Executive Officer. Upon receipt of a written request for investigation or action, the individual or entity that received such request shall immediately forward the matter to the Credentials Committee for investigation when the information provided indicates that such Member or Non-Member may have exhibited acts, demeanor, or conduct reasonably likely to be: (a) detrimental to patient safety or to the delivery of quality patient care; (b) unethical; (c) contrary to the Medical Center’s policies and procedures, these Bylaws, or the Code of Conduct; (d) disruptive to the operation of the Medical Center; (e) below applicable professional standards; or (f) the result of impairment of the Member or Non-Member by reason of illness, use of drugs, narcotics, alcohol, chemicals or other substances or as a result of any physical or mental condition that impairs the Member’s or Non-Member’s clinical practice. To the extent possible, the identity of the individual requesting initiation of investigation shall not be disclosed.

**7.2 Alternatives to Corrective Action**

Initial collegial efforts may be made prior to resorting to formal corrective action, when appropriate. Such collegial interventions on the part of Clinical Staff leaders in addressing the conduct or performance of an individual shall not constitute corrective action, shall not afford the individual subject to such efforts to the right to a fair hearing, and shall not require reporting to the National Practitioner Data Bank, except as otherwise provided in these Bylaws or required by law. Alternatives to corrective action may include:

(a) Informal discussions or formal meetings regarding the concerns raised about conduct or performance, including the actions outlined in these Bylaws or Medical Center policies that may be taken to address disruptive conduct;

(b) Written letters of guidance, reprimand, or warning regarding the concerns about conduct or performance;

(c) Notification that future conduct or performance shall be closely monitored and notification of expectations for improvement;

(d) Suggestions or requirements that the individual seek continuing education, consultations, or other assistance in improving performance;

(e) Warnings regarding the potential consequences of failure to improve conduct or performance; and/or

(f) Requirements to seek assistance for impairment, as provided in these Bylaws.

**7.3 Initiating Evaluation and/or Investigation of Possible Impairing Conditions**

At any time, a Department Chair, the President, the Chief Executive Officer, the Dean, the Chair of the Credentials Committee, or the Director of the Physicians’ Wellness Program may require that a Member or Non-Member who has been granted Clinical Privileges undergo a physical and/or mental examination(s) by one or more qualified practitioners or programs specified by the individual requiring the evaluation. If the Member or Non-Member refuses to undergo the examination, his/her Clinical Privileges shall be automatically suspended and there shall be no further consideration of continued privileges until the examination is performed. The Member or Non-Member shall authorize the qualified practitioner(s), to submit reports of the evaluation(s), as appropriate, to the Chair of the Credentials Committee, the Department Chair, the President, the Chief Executive Officer, the Dean, the Director of the Physician’s Wellness Program and the person or entity requesting the examination(s). Any time limit for action by the Credentials Committee, as specified in Section 7.4 below, shall be extended for the number of days from the request for the examination(s) to the receipt of the examination report(s).

The MCOB and the Clinical Staff Executive Committee recognize the need to assist Members or Non-Members who have been granted Clinical Privileges regarding their physical and mental health issues as well as to protect patients from harm. Accordingly, upon the recommendation of the Department Chair, the President, the Dean or the Chief Executive Officer, or on its own initiative, the Credentials Committee shall investigate any Member or Non-Member who appears to suffer from a potentially impairing condition. Any such Member or Non-Member is encouraged to seek assistance from the Physicians’ Wellness Program and/or the Faculty and Employee Assistance Program or any successor program thereto.

The Credentials Committee may also require periodic monitoring after completion of the initial treatment/rehabilitation. If the Member or Non-Member does not complete the initial treatment/rehabilitation program or does not comply with the required monitoring, the provisions of Article 7.4 or 7.5 shall be applicable. In addition, the Credentials Committee shall strictly adhere to any state or federal statutes or regulations containing mandatory reporting requirements.

The purpose of the evaluation and investigation process concerning potential impairing conditions is to protect patients and to aid the Member or Non-Member in retaining or regaining optimal professional functioning. If the Member or Non-Member in question seeks such assistance, the Credentials Committee shall report to the Clinical Staff Executive Committee that he/she is voluntarily seeking treatment and has agreed to appropriate monitoring.

If at any time during the diagnosis, treatment, or rehabilitation phase of the process it is determined that a Member or Non-Member is unable to safely perform the Clinical Privileges he or she has been granted, the Credentials Committee shall proceed in accordance with Sections

7.4 or 7.5, as appropriate, below. Additionally, the Credentials Committee shall strictly adhere to any state or federal statutes or regulations containing mandatory reporting requirements.

**7.4 Initiating Evaluation and Recommendation for Corrective Action**

**7.4.1 Investigation**

Upon receipt of the request for initiation of corrective action, the Credentials Committee shall conduct a thorough investigation of the Member or Non-Member who has been granted Clinical Privileges in question. The Member or Non-Member shall be notified in writing that an investigation is being conducted. In addition the applicable Department Chair, the Dean, and the Chief Executive Officer shall be notified of the investigation. The Member or Non-Member shall provide to the Credentials Committee all available information that it requests. Failure to provide such requested information will itself be considered grounds for corrective action. The Credentials Committee may, but is not obligated to, review medical files or other documents and conduct interviews with witnesses; however, such investigation shall not constitute a “hearing” as that term is used in Article VIII, nor shall the procedural rules with respect to hearings or appeals apply. The Credentials Committee may, in its sole discretion, request an interview with the Member or Non-Member under investigation and, during such interview, question the Member or Non-Member about matters under investigation. A record of such interview shall be made by the Credentials Committee. Within forty (40) days of the receipt of the request for initiation of investigation, the Credentials Committee shall report to the Clinical Staff Executive Committee on the progress of the investigation and the estimated time required to complete the investigation. In most instances, the investigation shall not last longer than ninety (90) days. However, for good cause, the Chair of the Credentials Committee may ask the Clinical Staff Executive Committee to extend the time for completion of the investigation. At the completion of the investigation, the Chair of the Credentials Committee shall submit to the Clinical Staff Executive Committee the Credentials Committee’s findings and recommendations resulting from the investigation.

The Clinical Staff Executive Committee may accept, reject or modify the findings and recommendations of the Credentials Committee and recommend to the MCOB approval of a final action. The Member and the Chair of the Clincal Department to which the Member is assigned shall be notified in writing of the recommendation of the Clinical Staff Executive Committee.

**7.4.2 Recommendation**

The Credentials Committee’s written recommendation to the Clinical Staff Executive Committee of action to be taken on the matter may include, without limitation:

(a) determining that no further action is necessary on the matter;

(b) issuing a warning, a letter of admonition, or a letter of reprimand;

(c) recommending terms of probation or requirements of consultation;

(d) recommending reduction, suspension or revocation of Clinical Privileges in accordance with Sections 7.5 and 7.6 herein;

(e) recommending reduction of Clinical Staff category or limitation of any Staff prerogatives directly related to patient care;

(f) recommending suspension or revocation of Clinical Staff membership;

(g) recommending concurrent monitoring or retrospective auditing;

(h) requiring additional training;

(i) requiring evaluation by a physician assessment organization or individual; or

(j) requiring a proctor for all procedures.

Any corrective action in accordance with subsections (c) through (f) of this Section shall entitle the Member to the procedural rights provided in Article VIII of these Bylaws.

**7.4.3 Cooperation with Investigation**

All Members, Non-Members, and all other individuals working within or providing services to the Medical Center shall cooperate as necessary for the conduct of any investigation. Any individual who hinders or interferes with an investigation or attempts to influence the outcome thereof shall be subject to investigation under these Bylaws or subject to other disciplinary action.

**7.5 Precautionary Summary Suspension**

(i) Whenever the conduct of a Member or a non-Member who has been granted Clinical Privileges reasonably appears to pose an imminent threat that requires that immediate action be taken to protect the health, life or well-being of patients or prospective patients, or any other person in or associated with the Medical Center, or (ii) whenever the conduct of a Member or a Non-Member who has been granted Clinical Privileges reasonably appears to pose a substantial likelihood of harm to the life, health and safety of any patient or prospective patient, or (iii) whenever the Member or Non-Member who has been granted Clinical Privileges refuses to follow these Bylaws, the Credentials Manual, the policies, procedures, rules and regulations of the Clinical Staff and/or the Medical Center, or (iv) whenever a Member or Non-Member has made a material misrepresentation on the application for Clinical Staff membership or Clinical Privileges, then in any such event the President, the Chair of the Credentials Committee, or the Chief Executive Officer may summarily restrict or suspend the Clinical Staff membership or Clinical Privileges of such Member of non-Member. Unless otherwise stated, such summary suspension shall become effective immediately upon imposition, and the person responsible shall promptly give written notice of the suspension or restriction to the Member or non-Member in question, the Chair of the Department and the Division Chief , if applicable, to which the Member is assigned, the Chief Executive Officer, and the Clinical Staff Executive Committee. The summary restriction or suspension may be limited in duration and shall remain in effect for the period stated or, if not so limited, shall remain in effect until resolved by the procedures specified in Article VIII with respect to Members only. Unless otherwise indicated by the terms of the summary restriction or suspension, the President or his/her designee shall assign the patients of the Member or Non-Member in question to another Member.

**7.5.1 Procedure for Members**

No later than 30 days after the date of the precautionary summary suspension and if the precautionary summary suspension still remains in effect, the Chair of the Clinical Staff Executive Committee shall designate a panel of its members to convene for review and consideration of the action; provided, however, that the Clinical Staff Executive Committee may extend the 30 day period for review for good cause if so requested by either the Member or the Chair of the Credentials Committee. Upon request and on such terms and conditions as the panel of the Clinical Staff Executive Committee may impose, the Member may attend and make a statement concerning the issues that led to the precautionary summary suspension, although in no event shall any meeting of the panel of the Clinical Staff Executive Committee, with or without the Member, constitute a “hearing” within the meaning of Article VIII, nor shall any procedural rules apply except those adopted by the panel of the Clinical Staff Executive Committee. The Member’s failure without good cause to attend any meeting of the panel of the Clinical Staff upon request shall constitute a waiver of his or her rights under Article VIII. The panel of the Clinical Staff Executive Committee may recommend to the Clinical Staff Executive Committee that the summary restriction or suspension be modified, continued or terminated. The Clinical Staff Executive Committee shall consider this recommendation at its next scheduled meeting and shall furnish the Member with written notice of its decision.

Unless the Clinical Staff Executive Committee terminates the summary restriction or suspension within ninety (90) working days of such restriction or suspension, the Member shall be entitled to the procedural rights afforded by Article VIII of these Bylaws.

**7.5.2 Procedure for Non-Members**

A Non-Member whose Clinical Privileges are summarily suspended pursuant to Section

7.5 shall be notified in writing of the suspension and the grounds for the suspension. The Chair of the Credentials Committee shall refer the matter to the Credentials Committee at its next scheduled meeting. The Non-Member shall not be entitled to the procedural rights afforded by Article VIII of the Bylaws.

**7.6 Automatic Suspension**

In the following instances, the Member’s or Non-Member’s Clinical Privileges may be automatically suspended or limited, as specifically described by the President, the Chair of the Credentials Committee or the Chief Executive Officer.

**7.6.1 Change in Licensure**

**7.6.1.1 Revocation or Suspension**

If a Member’s or Non-Member’s license authorizing practice in the Commonwealth of Virginia is placed on probation by the applicable health regulatory board, his or her Clinical Privileges shall automatically become subject to the same terms and conditions of the probation as of the date such action becomes effective and throughout its duration.

Whenever a Member’s or Non-Member’s license authorizing practice in the Commonwealth of Virginia is limited or restricted by the applicable health regulatory board, any Clinical Privileges that the Member or Non-Member has been granted by the Medical Center that are within the scope of such limitation or restriction shall be automatically limited or restricted in a similar manner, as of the date such licensing or certifying authority’s action becomes effective and throughout its duration.

**7.6.2 Change in DEA Certificate Status**

**7.6.3 Lack of Required Professional Liability Insurance**

Failure to maintain professional liability insurance in amounts and of a type required by the MCOB, as such amounts shall be defined from time to time, shall be a basis for automatic suspension of a Member’s or a Non-Member’s Clinical Privileges. If within 30 days after written warnings of such delinquency, the Member or Non-Member does not provide evidence of the required professional liability insurance, such individual’s Clinical Privileges shall be automatically terminated.

**7.6.4 Federal Program Exclusion**

If a Member of a Non-Member is convicted of a crime pursuant to the Medicare and Medicaid Protection Act of 1987, Pub. L. 100-93, or a crime related to the provision of health care items or services for which one may be excluded under 42 U.S.C. Section 1320a7(a), or is suspended, excluded, debarred or otherwise declared ineligible to participate in Medicare or Medicaid or other federal or state health care or other programs, such Member’s or Non-Member’s Clinical Privileges shall be automatically suspended as of the date such conviction or action with respect to the Medicare or Medicaid federal program becomes effective.

**7.6.5 Loss of Faculty Appointment**

If a Member’s faculty appointment in the School of Medicine is terminated for any reason or for any length of time, his/her membership and Clinical Privileges within the Medical Center shall be automatically revoked or suspended as of the date such loss of faculty appointment becomes effective.

Due process procedures applicable to contesting the loss of a faculty appointment are set forth in the University of Virginia Faculty Handbook.

**7.6.6 Failure to Undergo Physical and/or Mental Examination**

If a Member or Non-Member fails or refuses to undergo a physical and/or mental examination as required by Section 7.3 of these Bylaws, such failure or refusal shall result in automatic suspension of the Clinical Privileges of the Member or Non-Member.

A Non-Member shall have no right to a meeting with the Clinical Staff Executive Committee.

**ARTICLE VIII  
HEARING AND APPELLATE REVIEW FOR MEMBERS  
**

**8.1 General Provisions**

**8.1.1 Right to Hearing and Appellate Review**

(a) When any Member receives notice of a recommendation of the Clinical Staff Executive Committee that, if approved by the MCOB, will adversely affect his or her appointment to or status as a Member or his or her exercise of Clinical Privileges, he or she shall be entitled to a hearing before a hearing committee appointed by the Chair or Vice Chair of the Clinical Staff Executive Committee. If the recommendation of the Clinical Staff Executive Committee following such hearing is still adverse to the affected Member, he or she shall then be entitled to an appellate review by the MCOB or a committee appointed by the Chair of the MCOB, before the MCOB makes a final decision on the matter. Such review shall be made based on the evidentiary record, unless the MCOB or the committee appointed by the MCOB to hear the appeal requests additional information.

(b) All hearings and appellate reviews shall be in accordance with the procedural safeguards set forth in Article VIII to assure that the affected Member is accorded all rights to which he or she is entitled.

**8.1.2 Exhaustion of Remedies**

If Adverse Action described in Section 8.2 is taken or recommended, the Applicant or Member must exhaust the remedies afforded by these Bylaws before resorting to legal action. For purposes of Article VIII, the term “Member” may include “Applicant”, as appropriate under the circumstances.

**8.2 Grounds For Hearing**

Except as otherwise specified in these Bylaws, the following recommended actions or actions shall be deemed Adverse Actions and constitute grounds for a hearing, if such action is based on professional conduct, professional competence, or character:

(b) denial of Clinical Staff reappointment (excluding failure to obtain active status following provisional status);

(c) suspension of Clinical Staff Membership;

(d) revocation of Clinical Staff Membership;

(e) denial of requested Clinical Privileges (excluding Temporary Privileges) for a Member;

(g) suspension of Clinical Privileges (excluding Temporary Privileges) for a Member; or

(h) termination of all Clinical Privileges (excluding Temporary Privileges and excluding loss of faculty appointment) for a Member.

However, actions described above in this Section that are the result of automatic suspension imposed pursuant to Section 7.6 of these Bylaws, shall not be considered an Adverse Action for purposes of Article VIII.

**8.3 Requests For Hearing; Waiver**

**8.3.1 Notice of Proposed Action**

In all cases in which a recommendation has been made as set forth in Section 8.2, the Chair or Vice Chair of the Clinical Staff Executive Committee shall send a Member affected by an Adverse Action written notice of (a) his or her right to a hearing if requested by him or her within thirty (30) days of the notice, (b) clear and concise reasons for the Adverse Action recommended, including the acts or omissions with which the Member is charged and a list of the medical charts in question, if applicable, and (c) his or her rights at such a hearing, including the hearing procedures described in Section 8.4. Such notice shall be sent by personal delivery or certified mail, return receipt requested.

**8.3.2 Request for Hearing**

The Member shall have thirty (30) days following receipt of notice of such action to request a hearing. The request shall be in writing addressed to the Chair of the Clinical Staff Executive Committee. The request shall contain a statement signed by the Member that the Member shall maintain confidentiality of all documents provided to the Member during the hearing process and shall not disclose or use the documents for any purpose outside the hearing process. Unless the Member is under summary suspension, he or she shall retain existing rights and privileges until all steps provided for in Sections 8.4 through 8.4.8 of Article VIII of these Bylaws below have concluded. If, however, the Member’s reappointment term is scheduled to expire during the hearing process, the Member’s membership and privileges shall expire unless (i) the Clinical Staff Executive Committee extends the reappointment until the hearing is concluded, or (ii) the Member is reappointed according to final action by the MCOB.

**8.3.3 Waiver of Hearing**

In the event the Member does not request a hearing within the time and manner described, the Member shall be deemed to have waived any right to a hearing and accepted the recommendation involved. The recommendation of the Clinical Staff Executive Committee shall then become final and effective as to the Member when it is approved by the MCOB.

**8.3.4 Notice of Time, Place and Procedures for Hearing**

Upon receipt of a request for hearing, the Chair or Vice Chair of the Clinical Staff Executive Committee shall schedule a hearing and give notice to the Member of the time, place and date of the hearing, which shall not be less than thirty (30) days after the date of the notice. Each party shall provide the other with a list of witnesses within fifteen (15) days of the hearing date, unless both parties agree otherwise. Witness lists shall be finalized no later than five (5) working days before the hearing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Hearing Entity shall have the right to call such witnesses as it deems appropriate and necessary. Unless extended by the Chair of the Hearing Entity, described in Section 8.3.5 below, the date of the commencement of the hearing shall be not less than thirty (30) days, nor more than ninety (90) days from the date of receipt of the request for a hearing; provided, however, that when the request is received from a Member who is under summary suspension, the hearing shall be held as soon as the arrangements may reasonably be made and provided further that the parties may agree to a mutually convenient date beyond the ninety (90) day period.

**8.3.5 Hearing Entity**

The Chair of the Clinical Staff Executive Committee may, in his or her discretion and in consultation with the Chair of the Credentials Committee, the Chief Executive Officer and other members of CSEC as he or she deems appropriate, direct that the hearing be held: (1) before a panel of no fewer than three (3) Members who are appointed by the Chair of the Clinical Staff Executive Committee and the Chief Executive Officer and if possible are Peers of the Member in clinical practice or academic rank and are not in direct economic competition with the Member involved, or (2) by an independent Peer Review panel from outside the Medical Center whose members are not in direct economic competition with the Member involved, or (3) a panel consisting of a combination of (1) and (2). Each type of panel described in the preceding sentence shall be referred to hereinafter as the “Hearing Entity.” Knowledge of the matter involved shall not preclude a Clinical Staff Member from serving as a member of the Hearing Entity; however each member must certify at the time of appointment and also on the record at the hearing that any prior knowledge he or she may have does not preclude rendering a fair and impartial decision. The Chair of the Clinical Staff Executive Committee shall designate the chair of the Hearing Entity. At least three-quarters of the members of the Hearing Entity shall be present when the hearing takes place and no member may vote by proxy. In the event of any conflict involving the Chair of the Clinical Staff Executive Committee, the Vice Chair of CSEC shall be responsible for

performing the duties described in this paragraph. In the event of any conflict or conflicts involving both the Chair and Vice Chair of the Clinical Staff Executive Committee, the Chief Executive Officer or designee shall be responsible for performing the duties described in this paragraph.

**8.3.6 Failure to Attend and Proceed**

Failure without good cause of the affected Member to personally attend and proceed at such a hearing shall be deemed to constitute voluntary acceptance of the recommendations involved and his or her request for a hearing shall be deemed to have been withdrawn.

**8.3.7 Postponements and Extensions**

Once a request for hearing is initiated, postponements and extensions of time beyond the times permitted in these Bylaws may be permitted by the Hearing Entity, or its chairperson, acting upon its behalf. Such decisions are solely within the discretion of the Hearing Entity or its presiding officer and may only be granted for good cause.

**8.4 Hearing Procedure**

**8.4.1 Representation**

The hearings provided for in these Bylaws are for the purpose of intra-professional resolution of matters bearing on professional conduct, professional competency or character. If requested by either the affected Member or the Credentials Committee in accordance with Section 8.4.2, however, both sides may be represented by legal counsel. In lieu of legal counsel, the Member may be represented by another person of the Member’s choice.

**8.4.2 The Hearing Officer**

The President of the Clinical Staff may appoint a hearing officer to preside at the hearing. In the sole discretion of the President, the hearing officer may be an attorney qualified to preside over a quasi-judicial hearing. If requested by the Hearing Entity, the hearing officer may participate in the deliberations of the Hearing Entity and be an advisor to it, but the hearing officer shall not be entitled to vote.

**8.4.3 The Presiding Officer**

The Hearing Entity shall have a presiding officer. If the President of the Clinical Staff appoints a hearing officer pursuant to Section 8.4.2, then the hearing officer shall serve as the presiding officer. If no hearing officer is appointed, then the Chair of the Hearing Entity shall serve as the presiding officer. The presiding officer shall strive to assure that all participants in the hearing have a reasonable opportunity to be heard and to present relevant oral and documentary evidence in an efficient and expeditious manner, and that proper decorum is maintained. The presiding officer shall be entitled to determine the order of or procedure for presenting evidence and argument during the hearing and shall have the authority and discretion to make all rulings on questions that pertain to matters of law, procedure, or the admissibility of evidence. If the presiding officer determines that either side in a hearing is not proceeding in an efficient and expeditious manner, the presiding officer may take such discretionary action as seems warranted by the circumstances.

**8.4.4 Record of the Hearing**

An official reporter shall be present to make a record of the hearing proceedings. The cost of attendance of the reporter shall be borne by the Medical Center, but the cost of the transcript, if any, shall be borne by the party requesting it.

**8.4.5 Rights of the Parties**

Within reasonable limitations imposed by the presiding officer, the Credentials Committee, the Hearing Entity and the affected Member may call and examine witnesses for relevant testimony, introduce relevant exhibits or other documents, cross-examine or impeach witnesses who have testified orally on any matter relevant to the issues and otherwise rebut evidence. The Member may be called by the Credentials Committee or the Hearing Entity, as appropriate, and be examined as if under cross-examination.

(a) Burden of Proof. The Credentials Committee shall appoint one of its members to represent it at the hearing, to present facts in support of its adverse recommendation and to examine witnesses. Where the issue concerns the denial of initial Clinical Staff membership, it shall be the obligation of the affected practitioner to present appropriate evidence in support of his or her application, but the Credentials Committee representative shall then be responsible for showing that evidence exists to support the decision and that the Credentials Committee appropriately exercised its authority under these Bylaws and other applicable rules or regulations of the Medical Center. In all other situations outlined in Section 8.2 above, it shall be the obligation of the Credentials Committee representative to present appropriate evidence in support of the adverse recommendation, but the affected Member shall then be responsible for supporting his or her challenge to the adverse recommendation by providing appropriate evidence showing that the grounds for the decision lacked support in fact or that such grounds or action based upon such grounds is either arbitrary or capricious.

(b) Written Statement. Each party shall have the right to submit a written statement at the close of the hearing.

(c) Written Decision. Upon completion of the hearing, the affected Member shall be informed in writing by the Clinical Staff Executive Committee of the recommendation of the Hearing Entity, including a statement of the basis for the recommendation, and shall be informed in writing of the decisions of the Clinical Staff Executive Committee and the MCOB, including a statement of the basis for the decision.

**8.4.6 Evidence**

Judicial rules of evidence and procedure relating to the conduct of the hearing, examination of witnesses, and presentation of evidence shall not apply to a hearing conducted under Article VIII of these Bylaws. Any relevant evidence, including hearsay, shall be admitted if it is the sort of evidence on which responsible persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious affairs, regardless of the admissibility of such evidence in a court of law. The Hearing Entity may question the witnesses or call additional witnesses if it deems such action appropriate. At its discretion, the Hearing Entity may request both parties to file written arguments.

**8.4.7 Recess and Conclusion**

After consultation with the Hearing Entity, the presiding officer may recess the hearing and reconvene the same at such times and intervals as may be reasonable, with due consideration for reaching an expeditious conclusion to the hearing. Upon conclusion of the presentation of oral and documentary evidence and the receipt of any closing written arguments, the hearing shall be closed. The Hearing Entity shall, at a time convenient to itself, conduct its deliberations outside the presence of the parties. The Hearing Entity may seek legal counsel during its deliberations and the preparation of its report. Upon conclusion of its deliberations, the hearing shall be declared finally adjourned.

**8.4.8 Decision of the Hearing Entity**

Within fifteen (15) days after final adjournment of the hearing, the Hearing Entity shall render a decision, which shall be accompanied by a report in writing and shall be delivered to the Clinical Staff Executive Committee. If the affected Member is currently under summary suspension, the Hearing Entity shall render a decision and report to the Clinical Staff Executive Committee within five (5) working days after final adjournment. A copy of the decision shall also be forwarded to the MCOB and the affected Member. The report shall contain a concise statement of the reasons supporting the decision.

**8.4.9 Decision of Clinical Staff Executive Committee and MCOB**

At its next regularly scheduled meeting, the Clinical Staff Executive Committee shall review the report and decision of the Hearing Entity and shall, within thirty (30) days of such meeting, give notice of its recommendation to the MCOB and the Member. The Clinical Staff Executive Committee may affirm, modify or reverse the decision of the Hearing Entity.

**8.4.10 Appeal**

The Member may submit to the Chief Executive Officer a written appeal statement detailing the findings of fact, conclusions, and procedural matters with which he/she disagrees, and his/her reasons for such disagreement. This written appeal statement may cover any matters raised at any step in the hearing process, and legal counsel may assist in its preparation. The statement shall be delivered by hand or by certified or registered mail to the Chief Executive Officer and received no later than fourteen (14) days after the Member’s receipt of the recommendation of the Clinical Staff Executive Committee. The Chief Executive Officer shall promptly provide a copy of the Member’s statement to the MCOB. In response to the statement submitted by the affected Member, the Clinical Staff Executive Committee may also submit a written statement to the MCOB and shall provide a copy of any such written statement to the Member.

**8.4.11 Decision by the Operating Board**

(a) At a regularly scheduled meeting following receipt of the Member’s written appeal statement (or the expiration of the time in which the Member had the opportunity to submit a written statement) and the Clinical Staff Executive Committee’s written statement, the MCOB shall render a decision in writing and shall forward copies thereof to each party involved in the hearing. The decision of the MCOB shall include a statement of the basis for its decision.

(b) The MCOB may affirm, modify, or reverse the decision of the Clinical Staff Executive Committee for reconsideration. If the matter is remanded to the Hearing Entity for further review and recommendation, such Hearing Entity shall conduct its review within fifteen (15) working days and make its recommendations to the MCOB. This further review and the time required to report back shall not exceed sixty (60) days except as the parties may otherwise agree, for good cause, as jointly determined by the Chair of the MCOB and the Hearing Entity or Clinical Staff Executive Committee. The Executive Committee, or remand the matter to the Hearing Entity or the Clinical Staff MCOB shall thereafter make its final decision.

(c) The decision of the MCOB as reflected in paragraphs (a) or (b) above shall constitute final action. This decision shall be immediately effective and shall not be subject to further hearing, appellate or judicial review.

**8.4.12 Right to One Hearing and One Appeal**
