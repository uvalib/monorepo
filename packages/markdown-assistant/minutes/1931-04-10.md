School of Public Health and Hygiene in the Department of Medicine changed to School of Preventive Medicine and Bacteriology.

On motion, duly made and seconded, being unanimously adopted, it was

**RESOLVED**, by the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, That the School heretofore known as the School of Public Health and Hygiene in the Department of Medicine, be now called the School of Preventive Medicine and Bacteriology, this change having been recommended by the Head of the school and approved by the Dean of the Department of Medicine, since Bacteriology is no longer associated with the School of Pathology but is now in the School above mentioned.

Mr. Perkins presented to the Board a report upon the gift made by Mr. John Armstrong Chaloner by two deeds, one dated February 8, 1907, and the other dated March 12, 1913, of the property in Albemarle County, known as "Merry Mills" as a "Home for Professors Emeritus", under which gift provision is also made by Mr. Chaloner for the perpetual use of the swimming pool upon said property by certain persons residing in the neighborhood thereof.

This report, which was read by Mr. Perkins, was ordered to be filed as a part of the minutes of this meeting in order that a complete record of the whole situation may be preserved.

The Board, being of the opinion that Mr. Chaloner's request should be complied with, and after a full discussion of the whole matter, it was

**RESOLVED**, That should Mr. Chaloner see fit to institute a proceeding in any court of competent jurisdiction, seeking to have the deeds aforesaid declared null and void, or seeking a revocation of the trusts created thereby, the Attorney for the University is hereby directed, in the name and on behalf of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, to file an answer in such proceedings in which shall be stated the fact that the University does not desire to insist upon the validity of said deeds, or either of them, or upon the enforcement of the trusts created thereby, and that it leaves the determination of all questions raised in such proceedings to the discretion of the court.

## REPORT OF W. ALLAN PERKINS, ATTORNEY.

Upon the present status of gift of John Armstrong Chaloner to the University.

Under date of January 23rd, 1905, John Armstrong Chaloner, the owner of a tract of land near Cobham, in Albemarle County, known as "The Merry Mills", and containing some 400 acres, conveyed said property to George Perkins and John W. Fishburne, Trustees, to secure two bonds aggregating $4500.00 of principal, both dated January 23rd, 1905, and both payable two years after date. See D. B. 129, p. 493, Clerk's Office of Albemarle Circuit Court.

On the 6th day of October, 1920, notation was made on the margin of the deed book where said deed of trust is recorded, by L. W. Wood, Attorney-in-Fact for John Armstrong Chaloner, whereby under Section 5827 of the Code of Virginia of 1919, the period of limitation upon said deed was properly extended. Said two bonds have since passed by assignment and are now held by some friend of Mr. Chaloner, whose name I am not advised of.

By a deed dated February 8th, 1907, recorded in said Clerk's Office, in D. B. 134, p. 145, said Chaloner conveyed said property known as "The Merry Mills", together with certain tangible personal property described in said deed, to The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia.

In said deed said Chaloner reserves a life estate to himself in all of said property, and said conveyance is likewise made subject to a life estate in Ernle G. Money should said Money survive said Chaloner. It may be well here to state that said Money departed this life several years prior to the date of this report.

But said conveyance is specifically made IN TRUST —;—; "as a home for such Professors Emeritus of said University as said The Rector and Visitors shall deem best". And said property is also made subject to the privileges reserved to the —; "gentry, i.e.- persons distinguished by birth or position in the neighborhood, and the ladies of their families", to use the swimming pool on said property, free of charge, on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays.

At a meeting of The Rector and Visitors of the University held on the 15th day of October, 1907, the following Resolution was adopted:

"Resolved that the Board of Visitors accept with gratitude the gift to it from John Armstrong Chaloner of his property in Albemarle County, Virginia, known as "The Merry Mills", and that the thanks of the Board be conveyed to the generous donor".

And by deed dated March 12th, 1913, and recorded in said Clerk's Office, in D. B. 152, p. 42, said John Armstrong Chaloner likewise conveyed to said The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, subject to the same trusts and conditions set out in the aforesaid deed, a tract of 6-4/10 acres of land, situated near the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway, and about one mile east of Campbells Station, being the same land in all respects that had been conveyed to said Chaloner by deed of Mrs. S. S. Bacon, dated March 4th, 1913, and recorded in said Clerk's Office, in D. B. 152, p. 40.

During the past year the original holders of said bonds insisted upon payment and Mr. Chaloner, through his Attorneys, proposed that if the University would take an assignment of these bonds he would execute a deed, in which deed he would remove the trusts from the title to this property created in his original deeds of gift. Upon consideration of his proposition I was of opinion that the trusts created by Mr. Chaloner's deed of February 8th, 1907, were of such a character that it was beyond his power to revoke the same, and if the University was ever to claim under said deed it must assume the burdens as well as the benefits. There were other considerations involved in the proposition which led me to the conclusion that it was thoroughly impracticable, and I, therefore, advised Mr. Chaloner that while it was the desire of the University to comply with his wishes in every respect, and to do all that we could toward the furtherance of his plans, that in my opinion the plan proposed involved an exercise by him of a power which he did not possess, and that we must, therefore, undertake to reach some other solution of the difficulty.

The matter rested in this way for several months, but within the last few weeks Mr. R. C. Walker, Attorney for Mr. Chaloner, tells me that Mr. Chaloner is exceedingly anxious to get back the fee simple title to "The Merry Mills", free of any and all trusts and encumbrances.

Mr. Walker believes that arrangements can be made to pay off the indebtedness above referred to, and he also expresses himself as being of opinion that the trusts which attach to this property under Mr. Chaloner's deeds to the University aforesaid will be declared null and void by a Court of competent jurisdiction in a Chancery Cause instituted for that purpose, and the fee simple title will thereupon again become vested in Mr. Chaloner. He even goes further than this, and expresses himself as believing in such a suit the Court will enter a decree absolutely annulling the deeds, which of course would revest the title in Mr. Chaloner.

Mr. Walker asks that the Board of Visitors will adopt a Resolution to the effect that if such a suit is instituted it will interpose no objection to the revocation of the trusts, or to the annullment of the deeds, but that it will file an answer in which it merely states to the Court that its interest in the matter is of such a character that it does not desire to insist upon the enforcement of the deeds.

I can see no valid reason why the Board should not comply with this request, although there is considerable doubt in my mind as to the form of proceeding which Mr. Walker has in mind, and also as to the sufficiency of any form of proceeding that might be instituted for the purpose of revoking the trusts or of annulling these deeds. However this may be, if you feel that the property will be of no value to the University as a "home for Professors Emeritus", I can see no objection to the filing of such an answer as Mr. Walker requests. The question of whether the deeds are valid or invalid will then be for the Court to determine.

In my opinion the filing of such an answer could in no sense be construed as an attempt on the part of this Board to convey or surrender a vested right in real estate. Such action would, of course, be ultra vires. The action requested is nothing more than a formal admission that this Board does not consider a four hundred acre farm, under present conditions, an especially suitable home for its Professors Emeritus, which is a self-evident fact, too plain to admit of argument. Mr. Chaloner has never offered to give us the place free of this trust, and you are not passing upon the question of whether you would take it if he made such an offer.

I am, therefore, submitting herewith a form of Resolution, which, if adopted, will direct that such an answer be filed if the suit in contemplation is instituted.

With much deference to Mr. Walker's opinion as to the sufficiency of such a suit, I strongly feel that a better plan for all parties concerned would be for this Board to say to Mr. Chaloner that if he desires you to do so you will recommend to the next Session of our Legislature the passage of an Act which will recite Mr. Chaloner's gift to the University, and the acceptance thereof by The Rector and Visitors; of the fact that during the passage of years the purpose of the gift has become no longer practical, and therefore the Legislature revokes the action of the Board in accepting the gift and respectfully declines to take title under said deed. Such an Act would unquestionably have the effect of annulling the conveyance, at least so far as the University is concerned.

I am also submitting a Resolution which provides for such an Act. If both Resolutions are adopted, then Mr. Chaloner and Mr. Walker will be in position to adopt either form of proceedure without further action on your part.

The endowment funds of the University under the control of this Board having increased in numbers to approximately 80 it was found desirable to follow the practice of other educational institutions having a number of such funds and consolidate the securities and uninvested cash belonging to these several funds into one fund to be known as the Consolidated Endowment Funds. The advantages to be gained by such consolidation were several, to-wit:

1. In several of the funds it was found that similar securities were held and these deposited in two or more of the University's four depositories, and if said securities were brought together in the general fund and deposited all in one depository, they could be looked after to better advantage to the University.

2. In nearly all of the 80 funds there were small uninvested cash balances that could not be readily invested, and if these were brought together in one fund, investments could be found for them.

3. With each fund separately invested any loss sustained by depreciation in its securities had to be borne by it alone which might prove a serious loss to the respective fund and the object sought by the donor in establishing it.

4. The work on the part of the Bursar's Office to keep the records of transactions would be materially lessened.

In view of the conditions set out above and the advantages to be gained by consolidating our endowment funds, the Bursar was instructed to proceed with the necessary accounting to effect the end desired.

The first step in perfecting the plan was a revaluation of all the securities so that their respective funds might properly represent their true values when consolidated with the other funds, where securities had advanced since their original purchase the respective fund should have advantage of such advance; likewise where securities had declined, the fund should reflect the same. The assistance of my office was placed at the disposal of the Bursar in securing the values as of August 1, 1930, and my secretary who keeps a complete record of all the securities belonging to the said funds, worked with the Bursar in arriving at the proper values at which the several securities should be brought into the consolidation.

I now beg to report that the task has been completed, and that I have found it much easier to analyze the several securities and to keep them in shape so as to be responsive to changing economical conditions, that the uninvested cash held by each depository is in one amount instead of divided into from 4 to 25 separate funds.

A Profit and Loss account has been set up to take care of profits or losses arising from sales and calls, and I am pleased to be able to report that this account, at present, shows a balance on the profit side.

The income from all the funds held in the consolidated fund will be distributed at the end of the year in proportion as the respective funds bear to the whole consolidated fund.

Funds held by trustees, such as the duPont, McIntire Business and Commerce, Alumni, Centennial, Folkes Scholarships, etc., were not, of course, brought into this consolidation as they are not under the jurisdiction of this Board and are, furthermore, separately invested and held by separate trustees.
