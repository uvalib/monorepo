## TENTATIVE MINUTES SUBJECT TO THE APPROVAL OF THE BOARD OF VISITORS October 1-2, 2004

The Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia met, in Open Session, in the East Oval Room of the Rotunda at 11:35 a.m., Friday, October 1, 2004; Gordon F. Rainey, Jr., Rector, presided. Thomas F. Farrell, II, William G. Crutchfield, Jr., Ms. Susan Y. Dorsey, G. Slaughter Fitz-Hugh, Jr., W. Heywood Fralin, Ms. Glynn D. Key, Mark J. Kington, Lewis F. Payne, Don R. Pippin, Terence P. Ross, E. Darracott Vaughan, Jr., M.D., Ms. Georgia M. Willis, John O. Wynne, and James W. Head were present.

Present as well were John T. Casteen, III, Leonard W. Sandridge, Alexander G. Gilliam, Jr., Paul J. Forch, Gene D. Block, Robert E. Reynolds, M.D., Ms. Yoke San L. Reynolds, Robert D. Sweeney, Craig K. Littlepage, James Booz, and Ms. Jeanne Flippo Bailes.

The Rector called the meeting to order and asked Ms. Willis to lead the Board in the Pledge of Allegiance.

## APPROVAL OF THE MINUTES OF THE JUNE AND JULY MEETINGS OF THE BOARD

On motion, the Minutes of the June 11-12, and July 30-31 meetings of the Board of Visitors were approved.

## DEATH OF PRESIDENT HEREFORD

The Rector noted the death of Frank L. Hereford, Jr., fifth President of the University, on September 21st. His funeral took place on September 27th and the Rector announced that there will be a University memorial service in Cabell Hall on November 20th.

## APPROVAL TO CONSIDER ADDENDA TO THE AGENDA

Following the rules set down in the Board Manual that the Board must vote on addenda to the meeting Agenda proposed since the publication of the Agenda, the Rector asked the Board to vote on whether or not to consider these items.

The Board voted unanimously to consider the addenda.

## ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE CERTIFICATION

Each year, the Atlantic Coast Conference directs the presiding officers of the governing boards of each of its member institutions to certify that the administration of the institution’s athletic program has been delegated to the Chief Executive Officer of that institution. The Rector read the required statement to the Board and said he would sign and forward it to the ACC.

## NCAA COMPLIANCE TRAINING

The Rector reminded the Board that once a year, the Compliance Officer in the Athletics Department conducts a brief NCAA compliance training session for Members of the Board. Mr. Booz, the Associate Athletic Director for Compliance, conducted the session, the principal aim of which was to inform Members of the strict NCAA rules governing the recruitment of athletes and what role members of governing boards may play in the process.

## SUMMER ORIENTATION

The Rector thanked Members who participated in the Summer Orientation sessions for incoming students in July, and he commended Ms. Tabitha Enoch, the Director of Orientation, for the work she did in organizing the sessions. He noted that Summer Orientation, a fairly recent innovation at the University, has gotten better each summer in recent years and that Ms. Enoch’s infectious enthusiasm and her good work has been the reason for this.

## PRESIDENT’S REPORT

The Rector then asked the President to give his customary report.

The President noted that Mr. Robert Harris, Dean of the Darden School, has announced that he will step down as Dean in June; a search committee for a new Dean has been organized under the chairmanship of the Provost.

The University Press has issued its first electronic imprint, The Dolley Madison Digital Edition, which is an edited collection of letters. It is being supported by the Mellon Foundation, with matching funds from private unrestricted gifts.

The President reported that he and Mr. Sandridge have held two open meetings for faculty, staff, and students to discuss the Charter legislation. More such meetings will held over the course of the semester. He then commented on the legislation and various groups who support and oppose it, as well as other legislation affecting the University that might come before the General Assembly at this Session.

The President discussed a recent racial incident in which a fourth year student, a resident of the Lawn, found a racial epithet written on her car. He described the University’s response to the incident and how matters of this sort should and will be handled in the future. He emphasized that intolerance has no place in the University and that if incidents of this sort occur again, the University will respond quickly and firmly.

## GIFTS AND GRANTS REPORT

The President noted first that private giving to the University and its related foundations for Fiscal Year 2004, that is the year that ended on June 30, 2004, amounted to $174.9 million. If the distribution last year from the estate of David Harrison is excluded, the base rate of fund raising has increased by 13% over the last fiscal year.

Turning to figures for the first two months of the current fiscal year, that is, July 1-August 31, he reported that private giving is $18.5 million, which is a decrease of $2.4 million or 12% from the same period last year. Nonetheless, the College, the University Library and The University of Virginia’s College at Wise report substantial increases in giving.

Among significant gifts received since the June Board meeting are a bequest of $2.32 million to the College from the Estate of Mrs. Frances M. Burger – the gift benefits the Alfred and Frances Burger Endowed Fellowship Fund for Chemistry. The Pew Charitable Trust has made a $1.5 million grant to the College for the Center on Religion and Democracy. There is a bequest of $1 million for the John C. Buchanan Professorship in Internal Medicine from the Estate of Jean Lui Phipps. A $1 million bequest from the Estate of Paul F. Dishner, M.D. is to be split between The University of Virginia’s College at Wise and the School of Continuing and Professional Studies center at Abingdon.

Among significant new pledges in the same period is a $10 million pledge from Mrs. Ann Lee Saunders Brown, to be split between the School of Engineering and the University Library – the President reminded the Board that Mrs. Brown would be their guest at lunch later in the day. Microsoft Corporation has made a $3 million pledge to the Darden School Foundation for a joint program between the Darden School and the Curry School of Education for the Virginia School Turnaround Specialist Program. The Horace W. Goldsmith Foundation has pledged $1.5 million for the endowment held by the Law School Foundation. Bristol-Myers Squibb Medical Imaging, Inc. has made a pledge of $1 million to the School of Medicine for the George A. Beller, M.D./Bristol-Myers Squibb Medical Imaging, Inc., Professorship in Cardiovascular Medicine. The John H. Birdsall Revocable Trust has pledged $1 million to The College Foundation for unrestricted use.

The final pledge the President reported came from Mr. Daniel Maxwell Meyers of Boston who announced last week that he intended to double his pledge to the Curry School, bringing his total pledge to $22 million; this is thought to be the second largest gift ever made to an American school of education.

### RESOLUTIONS FROM THE MEETING OF THE AUDIT AND COMPLIANCE COMMITTEE OCTOBER 1, 2004

#### University of Virginia AUDIT CHARTER

**Organizational Responsibilities**

* Independence
* Authorities and Limitations
* Systems Planning and Development
* Security Investigations
* Coordination With External Auditing Agencies
* Reporting
* Distribution of Reports

**University of Virginia Code of Ethics & Statement of Values**

**Preamble:**

It is the policy of the University to establish and support the Audit Department for the purpose of assisting management in the effective discharge of its responsibilities for the control of University resources.

The mission and objectives of the Audit Department are as follows:

To perform financial audits for the purpose of ensuring that:

To perform operational audits for the purpose of ensuring that University operations are conducted efficiently, effectively, and in accordance with appropriate and adequately documented policies, plans, and procedures. Operational audits will encompass a review of the policies, plans, procedures, organizational structure, staffing, and output of the audited unit. These audits will also include evaluating the accomplishment of established objectives and goals for operations and programs.

To provide the Board of Visitors and senior management with an independent, fair and objective appraisal of the effectiveness of the University’s financial accountability systems and operational performance in accordance with the priorities established by the Director of Audits in coordination with the Board of Visitors, the President and the Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer and approved by the President and the Board of Visitors.

To provide management with constructive criticism and positive recommendations designed to strengthen and improve performance results and cost-effectiveness of their operations.

#### University of Virginia AUDIT CHARTER

To inform the Board of Visitors and Senior University management of any financial irregularities, investigations, or other risks to the institution that the auditors discover during the course of their work.

The work of the Audit Department will be conducted in accordance with the Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing as promulgated by the Institute of Internal Auditors. Other professional standards, such as the Government Accounting Office “Yellow Book,” shall be utilized when appropriate.

The following policies identify the responsibilities of the Audit Department and provide guidelines for its interaction with all University departments and activities.

The Director of Audits shall be responsible to the Board of Visitors but shall maintain a dual reporting relationship to both the Board and the President. The Director will seek input on the department’s activities from the Board of Visitors, the President, and the Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. The Director will have unrestricted access to the President and the Board of Visitors. The Director is responsible for the direction of the audit function and for seeing that the results of examinations and actions taken are communicated to appropriate levels of University management and, as appropriate, the President and the Board of Visitors.

The Director of Audits will draft an annual audit plan and will solicit input on this plan from the Board of Visitors, the President, the Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer and other senior management of the institution. The plan will be submitted to the Board of Visitors for approval.

Nothing herein shall be construed as preventing the Director of Audits from consulting with the President and the Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer on activities of the department, its findings, or significant issues. Nor shall the President and the Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer be prevented from consulting with the Director of Audits as may be necessary to the execution of their duties.

#### University of Virginia AUDIT CHARTER

The Audit Department will give full consideration to scheduling special audit requests made by any department or activity. All requests should be in writing to the Director of Audits and state the purpose and scope of the audit.

The Audit Department will be organizationally and functionally independent from all University operations and will have no responsibility for the departments and activities being audited while being responsive to their needs and requirements. Because the Audit Department must be independent in carrying out its responsibility to monitor and evaluate control procedures instituted by management, the extent of audit work to be performed with respect to those procedures is limited to the assessment of such procedures.

The Audit Department normally performs tests of underlying records and documentary support for transactions. Accordingly, objectivity would be lost if the Audit Department participated in accumulating data or reconstructing records.

The Audit Department personnel will have complete, free, and unrestricted access to all University departments, activities, records, properties, and personnel, and is not to be restricted in their activities. Where appropriate, special arrangements will be made for the examination of confidential information.

The Audit Department will participate in the planning, development, implementation, and modification of major computer-based and manual systems to ensure that:

#### University of Virginia AUDIT CHARTER

The Audit Department will conduct post-installation evaluations of major information technology systems to ensure that these systems meet their intended purpose and objectives. The department also will review computer operations supporting such systems to ensure that generally accepted standards for systems integrity and security, as well as system-specific controls, are being observed.

The Audit, Risk Management and University Police Departments are to be notified if assets have been lost through defalcation or other security breaches. The Audit Department will perform sufficient tests and investigations to identify the weaknesses in procedures, which permitted the defalcation to occur. However, the investigation of the specific event with the objective of recovery and/or prosecution is the responsibility of the University Police Department, with the decision to prosecute being the responsibility of the appropriate Commonwealth’s Attorney.

The Director of Audits will coordinate the department’s audit efforts with those of the University’s independent public accountants or other external auditing agencies by participating in the planning and definition of the scope of proposed audits so the work of all auditing groups is complementary, and their combined efforts provide comprehensive, cost-effective audit coverage for the University. Duplication of work will be avoided as much as possible.

Prior to the completion of a formal report, an exit conference will be conducted with the department or activity head. The conference will be a review of all findings, conclusions, and recommendations. A formal report will be issued at the conclusion of every audit, which will present a concise, clear and factual review of the conditions found, together with recommendations for improvement. A formal written response shall be issued to the Director of Audits within 30 days addressing each finding, recommendation, and exception included in the audit report. This response will include the department’s or activity’s plan for implementing the recommendations or a presentation of significant disagreement with the findings and/or recommendations.

A follow-up review of significant audit recommendations will be made by the Audit Department to establish that agreed-to recommendations have been adopted. A memorandum will be issued on the follow-up review to the President and the Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.

Audit reports will be issued to the Vice President responsible for the department or activity involved. In addition, copies of all such reports will be distributed to the President, the Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, and the senior fiscal administrator having a functional interest in the subject matter.

All audit reports will be available for review by the Board of Visitors.

A summary of significant audit findings will be prepared for each Board meeting and submitted to the Board of Visitors, the President, and the Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.

Whereas, the success and reputation of the University as a premier center of learning and provider of public services is dependent upon public confidence in its operations and the integrity of its transactions; and

Whereas, the character of any organization is reflected not only by its aspirations and its standards but also by the ethics and behaviors of its leadership and staff; and

Whereas, the General Assembly of Virginia has enacted a comprehensive code of ethics which both defines and prohibits inappropriate and illegal conflicts of interests applicable state-wide to all governmental officers and employees; and

Whereas, the departments and schools of the University have likewise administratively enacted comprehensive personnel and procurement policies and procedures to promote objective fairness in their operations; and

Whereas, in recognition of the fundamental importance of integrity in all that the University does and undertakes, the Board of Visitors hereby adopts the following ethical principles to govern, guide and inspire the University community to the highest standard of ethical behaviors. These principles do not replace existing standards of conduct or personnel policies, nor obviate appropriate attention to professional ethics as may be applicable in specific circumstances.

Now therefore, with continued commitment to excellence and integrity, and to better serve the people of Virginia, the following principles are adopted applicable to all who act for or on behalf of the University of Virginia.
