**On motion, the Board approved the following resolutions:**

**EXTENSION OF THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON DIVERSITY**

**WHEREAS, the Manual of the Board of Visitors specifies that Special Committees of the Board be extended each year at the Annual Meeting;**

**RESOLVED, the Special Committee on Diversity is extended to the Annual Meeting of 2012.**

**SETTING OF THE DATE OF THE 2012 ANNUAL MEETING**

**OF THE BOARD**

**RESOLVED, the first meeting of the Board of Visitors in the Fall of 2012 will be designated the 2012 Annual Meeting of the Board.**

**The Special Committee on Research**

**The Rector said that with the advice and guidance of the Board Members, she has formed a new Special Committee on Research. She said this committee will help the Board focus on an aspect of the university’s mission that is growing in importance and complexity. As with the focus on the Health System strategic plan, the Board must understand the issues facing a research university. It will be difficult to fit an additional committee into the Board schedule, but she said the area is important enough to make it a priority. Mr. Kirk will chair the committee. Mr. Skalak and President Sullivan developed the charge for the committee, which is set forth below. She said more information will be forthcoming.**

**CHARGE TO THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON RESEARCH**

**The Special Committee on Research shall have authority to make recommendations in all matters relating to research programs and partnerships of the University. The scope of the Committee shall include all forms of research, scholarship, and creative activity including medical research; research opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students; all external and internal sources of research support; commercialization activities and translational research. The Committee may offer guidance on such issues as strategic investments in research, the role of research in the undergraduate educational experience, the working environment for researchers, the infrastructure for research, and strategic partnerships that enhance research capability and impact.**

**ACC Certification**

**The Atlantic Coast Conference requires the Rector to read a certification to the Board that states the President is responsible for the Athletic Program and has full authority from the Board to run the program. The Rector read the certification.**

**Statement by George Keith Martin**

**The Rector recognized Mr. Martin, who stated that he is an attorney with the firm McGuireWoods, which represents the University in some bond financing matters and matters related to the Medical Center. He is not involved in that work and he will not participate in any matters related to those engagements. Further, he previously represented some University-related foundations, but he will not do so while he is on the Board of Visitors.**

**Resolution Commending Austin Ligon**

**The Rector said Mr. Ligon has had a lasting impact on the University, and will continue serving the University as a Board appointed member of the University of Virginia Investment Management Company Board. She asked Mr. Fralin to read a resolution commending Mr. Ligon. On motion, the following resolution was approved by the Board:**

**RESOLUTION COMMENDING AUSTIN LIGON**

**WHEREAS, William Austin Ligon earned a bachelor of arts degree with special honors from the University of Texas at Austin, a Master’s degree in economics from the University of Texas, and an M.B.A. from the Yale School of Management; and**

**WHEREAS, after serving in various positions at Marriott Corporation including as its senior vice president of strategic planning for Marriott Hotels and Resorts, Mr. Ligon and Rick Sharp, then CEO of Circuit City, developed the concept of a used car superstore and opened the first CarMax store in Richmond, Virginia in 1993. CarMax became the largest used car retailer in the country and a Fortune 500 company. Mr. Ligon retired as its CEO in 2006; and**

**WHEREAS, following his retirement from CarMax, Mr. Ligon became an “angel” investor in seed stage start-up companies; and**

**WHEREAS, Austin Ligon’s curious nature and deep interest in education at all levels has led to involvement in a number of educational organizations, including as a board member of the Center for Talented Youth at Johns Hopkins University, the Maggie L. Walker Governor’s School Renovation Foundation, St. John’s College, and the Yale School of Management Advisory Board; and**

**WHEREAS, Austin Ligon has given a great deal of his time and substantial talent as an innovator, investor, and successful business leader for the benefit of the University as a member of the boards of the University of Virginia Foundation and the University of Virginia Investment Management Company, on which he continues to serve as a Board of Visitors appointee; and**

**WHEREAS, Mr. Ligon was appointed to the University of Virginia Board of Visitors in 2007 by Governor Kaine; and**

**WHEREAS, during his term on the Board of Visitors, Mr. Ligon chaired the Special Committee on Planning, which was charged with developing a new financial model for the University following the economic downturn in 2008; and**

**WHEREAS, Mr. Ligon’s willingness to ask the hard questions, and his straightforward style and commonsense advice, made him a valuable advisor to fellow Board members and the University’s administration; and**

**WHEREAS, Austin Ligon’s term on the Board of Visitors ended June 30, 2011;**

**RESOLVED, the Board of Visitors thanks its friend and colleague Austin Ligon for his dedication to the University of Virginia and its educational mission, and for his continuing service as a member of the University of Virginia Investment Management Company board of directors; and**

**RESOLVED FURTHER, the Board wishes Austin and his family well in all of their future endeavors.**

*   **\- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -**

**On motion, the resolution commending Austin Ligon was approved.**

**Resolution for Additions to the Agenda**

**On motion, the Board adopted the following resolution approving the consideration of addenda to the published Agenda of the meeting:**

**RESOLVED, the Board of Visitors approves the consideration of addenda to the published Agenda.**

**NCAA Orientation**

**Ms. Dragas introduced Mr. James W. Booz, Interim Associate Athletics Director for Compliance, to provide training on NCAA rules. She said the bottom line is “ask before you act”.**

**Mr. Booz said they always encourage individuals to ask questions; even if you have done something previously, the regulations change from time-to-time. He said Board Members are considered “boosters” along with donors, season ticket holders, and others. Once a booster, always a booster, so this status never changes. This means Board Members may not solicit or recruit prospective student athletes, which are those who have started 9th grade in high school (and with men’s basketball, 7th grade) in any way. Only coaching staff members may participate in any recruiting activities. A relationship with a prospective student athlete that began before the relevant time period may continue, but any recruiting conversation should not be undertaken with the prospect. Also, no benefits may be given to former student-athletes, current student-athletes, or prospective student-athletes. Contacts include President Sullivan, Mr. Strine, Mr. Littlepage, and the Compliance Office.**

**President’s Report**

**President Sullivan directed the Board to a book at their places about Frank Batten and the creation of The Weather Channel, written by Connie Sage and published by the University of Virginia Press. Mr. Batten provided the resources to found the Frank Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy, and the Batten Institute at the Darden School. She said his vision and leadership will have a profound influence on many generations of students who attend the University.**

**Gifts and Grants Report**

**The President gave the Gifts and Grants report.**

**Philanthropic giving to the University of Virginia and its related foundations is $19,210,268.16 for the fiscal year through August 31, 2011. This is a decrease of $2,852,361.47, or 12.93% below the results of the previous fiscal year. Gifts to the School of Architecture, College and Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, Darden School, Children’s Hospital, University Medical Center, Miller Center of Public Affairs, and the University of Virginia’s College at Wise helped to offset the decreases seen in other areas.**

Baltimore, Jr., and Hillary D. Baltimore Fellowship Fund and the Thomas J. Baltimore, Jr., and Hillary D. Baltimore Jefferson Scholarship;**

**The Rector recessed the Board to continue with committee meetings and adjourn for the day.**

**\- - - - - - - - - - - - -**

**The Full Board was called to order at 2:45 p.m., on Friday, September 16th in the Board Room of the Rotunda. All Members, save Ms. DiNardo, were present.**

**Six-Year Plan**

**The Rector explained the process of creating the six-year plan, which responds to the Higher Education Opportunity Act objectives, and asked President Sullivan to present the plan.**

**President Sullivan said the plan includes a 6.5% increase in tuition in each of the next two years, however, the revenue generated from incremental tuition will not cover the cost of all of the strategies included in the plan. The University will either need to rely on other funding partners or simply not implement some items. She said the legislation is almost exclusively focused on undergraduate students, but the University has included strategies focused on graduate students, and particularly has emphasized research initiatives.**

**The President said the University has taken the time to examine areas in which we already demonstrate strength, such as graduation rate, to determine whether there is a way of concentrating on a sub-population of Pell recipients in a way that might move the needle a bit further.**

**Degree production is one of the major foci of the legislation. The President said the plan contains four main strategies for degree production: 1. Enrolling more Virginians; 2. Accelerating degree production; 3. Expanding completer programs; and 4. Increasing the number of science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) and health-related degrees. She described the specific plans for accomplishing all four of the strategies, including enrolling 1,673 more undergraduates by 2018-19 (70% would be Virginians), developing a three-year bachelor’s and one-year master’s accelerated program, expanding summer session and January term, and expanding completer programs such as bachelor of interdisciplinary studies (BIS) and a program with PVCC for an allied health degree.**

**President Sullivan said the other major focus of the legislation is economic growth through job creation; the research enterprise can help the Commonwealth move in that direction. The University’s key strategies include strategic research opportunities in areas such as sustainability, biosciences, energy, medical areas, education enhancement, and defense intelligence. The University also plans to expand the number of clinical trials in cancer to find ways to translate discoveries into practical use, and reach out to Southwest Virginia with cancer treatment and prevention activities.**

**The President said creating new companies out of faculty research, diversifying the research base to include private-public partnerships, and increasing the availability of proof-of-concept funding to commercialize bench research, are other areas of activity.**

**In a partnership with Virginia Tech, James Madison, and George Mason, and corporate partners such as CISCO, the University is doing instructional resource sharing across institutions in language and culture, STEM, course redesign, dual enrollment classes so college credit can be earned in high school, and leveraging and sharing technology investment in research that have been made at each institution.**

**Other key elements of the plan include affordable access, greater use of facilities, providing competitive salaries for faculty and staff, and continuous improvement focused on curtailing costs and improving service.**

**President Sullivan said the state feedback has been generally positive. State officials appreciated that the University included a reasonable, realistic tuition increase. They did ask that the University prioritize items in the plan, and to not put the full burden of salary increases on students.**

**President Sullivan asked David Prior to present the College at Wise plan. Mr. Prior said the College developed guiding principles as it developed its six-year plan: The College remains focused on its region and on ensuring its students’ success while responding to the objectives of the legislation, but in a manner appropriate to a small liberal arts institution. They will focus on student retention and graduation, and the College will try to balance affordability and quality while complying with the state’s request not to assume any additional general fund support in developing the strategies.**

**Mr. Prior said their efforts to produce more degrees will include enhancing the Early Alert Program, which helps identify student risk factors and provides early intervention mechanisms. The College will also use new marketing strategies and outreach to promote its new STEM programs in software engineering, computer science, and biochemistry.**

**He said through the Center for Teaching Excellence, the College reaches out to public school educators so that students are better prepared to succeed in college. In addition, they plan to expand the summer College offerings.**

**Mr. Prior said other key elements include expanding the Appalachian Intermountain Scholars Program to promote affordable access, continuing development of Healthy Appalachia, and supporting undergraduate research.**

**Mr. Prior said they included an addendum that would have to be funded with direct state support that includes accelerating efforts to focus on STEM-H degrees, and providing competitive salaries for faculty and staff. Mr. Prior said a fuller discussion will be undertaken at the College at Wise Committee meeting in October.**
