The letter of resignation of Alexander Garrett being taken up, it was ordered that it be accepted.

On motion of Mr. Randolph it was resolved, That the board in accepting the resignation of their Bursar Alexander Garrett cannot refrain from expressing the feelings of confidence and kindness which have arisen from an association of thirty years in which the University have derived the benefit of his eminent services, his strict integrity, and vigilant attention to its pecuniary affairs - and tender him the assurance of their continued confidence & esteem.

Each of these Assistants shall be entitled to a dormitory, and the use of the Library rent free, and shall receive for annual compensation $700 each. These Assistants however shall not be allowed to board at the Hotels designed for the accommodation of Students.

On motion of Mr. Randolph, Mr. Wm. A. Bibb was appointed Bursar.

On motion of Mr. Mason, it was ordered that the Bursar be and is hereby authorised and directed to collect the interest accrued and accruing on the certificate of State Stock for $1500 invested on account of the legacy of James Madison for the benefit of the Library of the University - which certificate is dated May 18, 1848, and bears interest from that date, to which end he is further authorized to execute such receipts in the name of the Rector and Visitors, or otherwise as may be required.

It appearing to the board, that the sum of $540 appropriated by resolution of June 28, 1847, for arrears of interest due from the University on this legacy, had not been withdrawn or expended, as by said resolution directed, It is ordered that said sum of $540, with the further sum of $90 for interest accrued between the said order and May 1848, together with the interest that has accrued to May 1851 in said certificate of State Stocks, amounting in all to the sum of $900, be and the same is hereby appropriated to the purchase of books of Standard character and permanent value, as contemplated and directed by resolution of the 4th of July 1843 - That said books be selected by the Faculty, subject to the approbation of the Rector.

Resolved, that the interest on such certificates accruing after May 1851 be retained by the Bursar subject to future appropriations.

Resolved that it shall be the duty of the Librarian to designate the books so purchased, as well as others hereafter purchased out of this Fund by stamping on the back of each volume the words "Madison Donation", and that in future catalogues of the Library there shall be stated in a note, the number of volumes of the original donations, as well as future additions accruing from said fund.

The Rector laid before the Board a letter from the Revd. Wm. F.

The Rector laid before the Board a letter from Dr. Frank Carr, communicating his resignation as Secretary of the Board of Visitors, in consequence of ill health, whereupon it was resolved by the Board to accept his resignation, and in doing so to tender to him the expression of their sympathies and regret on account of the cause of his resignation, and also of the high respect and regard which they entertain towards him.

### Saturday June 28, 1851

On motion of Mr. Mason, resolved that the Proctor continue the arrangement made for the State Students on June 29, 1850, for the ensuing year, and that he be particularly desired, to make the farm and garden attached to the premises, tributary as far as practicable to the support of that Hotel.

On motion of General Cocke, resolved that Dr. Cabell be allowed, at the pleasure of the Board to occupy the lot, attached to the building occupied by the Societies and the moot court, and for that purpose to open a communication between his garden & said lot. But the University to be subjected to no expense by the arrangement.

It being stated to the Board, on behalf of Professors Wm. D. Rogers, and Robert E. Rogers that their engagements in occupations connected with their duties at the University, may make it particularly inconvenient to comply with the order of the Board in September last, requiring the Professors to be at the University for one week before the commencement of the course, It was ordered on motion of Mr. Mason, that from the circumstances stated, an exemption from this will be granted to the Professors named, in regard to the ensuing vacation -

A communication was received from the Faculty in the following words, viz:

"At a meeting of the Faculty June 28, 1851 - Whereas Mr. Joseph B. Day who last session passed successfully examinations for graduation in two of the classes of modern languages, but failed to obtain degrees, in consequence of being unsuccessful in his examination on the English Language, and having during the present session, not only passed the English Examination, but also examinations for graduation in three schools and being withal a most meritorious student, Resolved that it be recommended to the Board of Visitors to allow him the benefit of his successful examinations in modern Languages last session.

Whereupon it was resolved that the recommendation of the Faculty in regard to Mr. Day is approved -

On motion of Mr. Mason resolved, that Professor Harrison be appointed Chairman of the Faculty for the ensuing year.

The hour for the public exercises at the Rotunda, having arrived, the board adjourned until Saturday evening, in order to be present at the Exhibition.

### Saturday Evening June 28, 1851

The committee of Finance submitted the following Report, viz:

The committee of Finance have examined the matters submitted to their consideration and report as follows.

They have found the Accounts of the Proctor & Bursar duly audited & examined by Wm. A. Bibb, to whom that duty was entrusted by order of the Visitors. He has certified the Accounts to be correct, and the Committee have considered that certificate as evidence of the fact.

The receipts during the present Fiscal year, as appears by the Proctors report were $27522.80. To this must be added $5556 in the Patrons hands, as the surplus of Professors fees assigned to the uses of the University, thus making the amount of the entire receipts of the institution $33078. From this is to be deducted $23096.91 the entire disbursements of the year, which leaves the sum of $9981.19 as a surplus applicable to the service of the ensuing Fiscal year. During that year the demands on the funds of the University are likely to be very large on account of the Building which it was deemed indispensable to erect. In view of this necessity the committee have endeavoured to make with the aid of the Proctor, an estimate of the expenses to be founded on the most rigid system of economy. According to this estimate made by the Proctor upon the scheme of postponing some of the usual expenditures another year, although at some inconvenience to the institution, the ordinary disbursements will amount to $18925 - To this must be added appropriations made by special resolution of the present board, for satisfying the trust under the Madison Legacy, and repairs and additions about $1800, also $2100 for three Assistants in the Schools of Mathematics & of Ancient and Modern Languages, and also $3300 for additions to Professor's houses & $10,000 for an addition to the Rotunda. These several sums making a total of $36125. To meet this we should have, if the ensuing session be as prosperous as the last $28300 which added to the surplus of $9981.19 would make an available sum of $38281.19 which would leave a surplus over the expenditure of $2156.19, which is perhaps as great a reduction in the usual surplus, as would be safe and convenient. In the ensuing fiscal year, which would terminate in June 1853, we should have to provide for a second and last payment of $20000 on Jan 1, 1853 for the addition to the Rotunda & this sum in addition to the usual and necessary expenses of the Institution would probably far transcend the receipts of the University and make a loan necessary. What should be the amount of that loan this committee is unable to ascertain with an approach even to accuracy. The Building Committee have made no report as to the contracts and liabilities for the addition to the Rotunda, but the Finance Committee are informed by Mr. Spooner the Superintendent that the new building will cost $30000, of which $10000 are probably to be paid on Jan 1, 1852, and $20000 are probably to be paid Jan 1, 1853. The Committee on Finance are at a loss upon information so imperfect how to make an estimate as to the probable demands on the funds of the University for the year ending June 29, 1853. It is not usual for buildings of this sort, to be completed for the estimated sums, and there is also a doubt as to the future receipts of the University - A disastrous session might curtail so much the receipts of the Institution as to disappoint any calculation which might be made upon a supposed estimate of receipts. But if the Institution should maintain its present number of students, and its present condition as to demands for disbursements, the Committee are of opinion that a loan of $20000 would probably suffice. To provide however, against all contingencies the Committee would recommend the Board to petition the Legislature to authorize them to borrow a sum of money not exceeding $25000 upon the terms and on the conditions prescribed in the Act of March 7th 1827 entitled "An Act altering the stated meetings of the Visitors of the University and for other purposes." The Committee hope however that it may not be necessary to borrow more than $20000, or perhaps a less sum.

The Committee have also considered the application of the Proctor to be allowed a salary of $500 per annum for a Clerk. It is represented to them that the increased services in the office of Proctor & Patron required by the increased number of Students are such as to justify such a salary to the Clerk in the Office. Under the circumstances it would seem to be expedient to make such an allowance during the ensuing year. To carry out these views the Committee submit the following resolutions.

Resolved that the Rector in the name of the Board of Visitors present a petition to the next Legislature of the State of Va. for authority to contract a loan of $25000 upon the same terms and in the same manner as were authorized in the Act entitled "An Act altering the stated meeting of the Visitors of the University & for other purposes," passed March 7, 1827, with an additional provision that the interest be paid at the Treasury of the State out of the Annuity.

Resolved that an allowance of $500 per annum be made to the Clerk of the Proctor, for the present and future fiscal years.

*R.M.T. Hunter*

*Thos. L. Preston*

Whereupon the resolutions submitted by the Finance Committee were adopted.

On motion of Mr. Randolph it was ordered that in all cases where it becomes the duty of the Proctor to have the privies of the Professors or Hotel Keepers cleansed it shall be done at the expense of the Professor or Hotel Keeper respectively in whose occupancy the privy is - - - -

On motion of the Rector -

Resolved that James P. Holcombe be appointed adjunct Professor in the School of Law in the University, charged with the duty of giving instruction on the subjects of Equity & Commercial law, subject to like regulations as other professors.

That he have a room assigned him in the precincts, and enjoy the use of the Library on like footing with other professors, but receive no salary or other emoluments from the University.

That his compensation be derived exclusively from the fees paid by the Students in the school of Law, after those fees, shall have been augmented to the maximum allowed by the present laws of the University to the Professor of law, provided that when the compensation of the adjunct Professor, should reach the sum of $2000, any further fees in the school should accumulate and be invested with a view to a more permanent endowment.

That the fees in the school of law be for those who attend only the junior class the same as at present, (namely $25 if three Professors be attended, $30 if two, and $50 if one only,) for those who attend the intermediate class $60, and for those who attend the Senior Class $75, the payment of the higher fee, in either case giving admission to any lower class.

Ordered that St. George Tucker be appointed Secretary to the Board of Visitors in lieu of Dr. Carr, who has resigned.

On motion of Mr. Mason it was ordered that the sum of ten dollars required as a deposit by students to cover contingent charges and assessments against him for injuries done to the buildings & other property of the University shall be liable for any injuries or damage done to the furniture in the dormitories.

Ordered that the Board do now adjourn sine die.

### Monday June 30, 1851
