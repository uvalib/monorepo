RCB:jb

### Attachment A RETIREMENT PLAN DESIGN

#### OBJECTIVE:

#### CURRENT FORMULAS:

#### CONSIDERATIONS:

#### PROPOSED FORMULA:

#### IMPACT OF 12-1/2% FORMULA ON RETIREMENT CONTRIBUTIONS:

155 faculty in the regular formula would receive less in retirement contributions next fiscal year than in the current fiscal year:

$167,600

370 faculty in the step formula would receive less in retirement contributions next fiscal year than in the current fiscal year (186 of the 370 faculty have a projected decrease in their retirement contributions of less than $100):

40,256

**TOTAL**

207,856

(Applicable to individuals whose decrease in retirement contributions is $100 or greater)

A special one-time adjustment to the contractual salary will be made to offset the decrease in retirement contributions. For twelve (12) month faculty, the adjustment will be made on July 1 and for nine (9) month faculty, the adjustment will be made on September 1. The adjustments to salary will be calculated by taking the total decrease in retirement contributions ($207,856) minus the retirement contributions generated by the salary increase ($25,892 = 12-1/2% of $207,856).
