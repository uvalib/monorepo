McIntire, Hollis Rinehart, Fred W. Scott, A. C. Carson, and Mrs. M. C. B. Munford, and President Alderman, present.

The President made the following announcements:

Attendance for the present session, **2098.**

Gifts, as follows:

Bequest of the late Allie D. Smith, of Alexandria, Virginia, the sum of **$10,000** to be held in perpetual trust as a memorial to her deceased son, said fund to be designated and known as the "THOMAS C. SMITH MEMORIAL FUND." The devise was on condition that the net income from said fund should be devoted entirely to the upkeep of the Law Library of the University of Virginia. The Rector and Visitors are given authority and power to invest and reinvest said fund from time to time, and to convert any securities held to other securities, whenever, in their judgement, would seem best for the interest of the fund.

Resignation of Dr. Thomas Fitz-Hugh, as professor of Latin, and Dr. John Staige Davis, Professor of Practice of Medicine, both of whom had been placed on the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching Retirement Fund, and for whom the following actions were taken:

**RESOLVED**, That the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia accept with great regret the resignation of Dr. Thomas Fitz-Hugh, Professor of Latin. Dr. Fitz-Hugh has carried forward his work here at this University with great devotion and skill, and the Rector and Visitors deplore the fact that his health will not permit of a continuation of his duties here.

**RESOLVED**, That the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia accept with great regret the resignation of Dr. John Staige Davis, Professor of Practice of Medicine. Dr. Davis has carried forward his work here at the University with great devotion and skill, and the Rector and Visitors deplore the fact that his health will not permit of a continuation of his duties at his Alma Mater, which he has served so long, with such distinction.

The following professors, instructors, assistants, scholarship and fellowship holders, appointed by the President since the last meeting of the Board were approved:

Laurens Blakely Hitchcock, Associate Professor of Chemical Engineering for a period of three years, at a salary of **$3,500**.

Dr. R. R. Morgan, Assistant Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology, for one year, at a salary of **$3,500**.

Dr. Claude M. McFall, Assistant Professor of Biology for the session of 1928-29, at a salary of **$2,500**.

Mr. Alfred Akerman, Associate Professor of Forestry, at a salary of **$3,250**, **$750** of this sum being paid by Dr. Wm. M. Seward.

Mr. Nils Hammarstrand, Assistant Professor of History of Art, at a salary of **$1,800**.

Dr. Lyndon Frederick Small, Research Associate in Organic Chemistry, for the session 1928-29, at a salary of **$2,700**.

Charles H. Chandler, Superintendent of Buildings and Grounds, at a salary of **$3,600** per annum.

Appointments under the Co-operative Program of Experimental Education and Teacher Training entered into by the School Systems of the City of Charlottesville, the County of Albemarle, and the University of Virginia.

(83 du Pont scholarships have been awarded, one of which was not taken, leaving 82 now occupied).

With respect to the foregoing appointments, the following motion was adopted:

**RESOLVED**, That the above mentioned list be approved, and that the President be empowered to fill the one vacancy now existing in the du Pont Scholarships.

The resignation of Alvin Graydon Wood as the holder of the Ryan Scholarship from the Sixth Congressional District, was accepted, and Warren M. Ballard was appointed to fill the vacancy.

The following special appropriations were approved:

Letters from the Attorney for the University, submitting Final Decree of the Circuit Court of Clarke County, Virginia, in the matter of the Blandy Experimental Farm, were submitted, read and ordered spread upon the minutes.

On October 13th, I wrote you with reference to the Blandy estate, and stated that the final settlement of this estate shows the corpus of the trust fund set aside by the will of Graham F. Blandy, deceased, from which his widow is to receive the income during her lifetime, and which passes to the University at her death, amounts to **$971,486.12**.

A further examination of the final settlement shows that this statement is not entirely accurate. The eleventh paragraph of the will of Graham F. Blandy directs the Trustee, upon the death of Mr. Blandy's widow, to pay from the corpus of the trust fund in said Trustee's hands, three pecuniary bequests aggregating **$85,000.00**. If the corpus of the trust fund should not be reduced or increased by fluctuation in value of securities during the lifetime of Mrs. Blandy, then upon her death the payment of these pecuniary bequests will reduce the corpus of said fund to **$886,486.12**.

For the sake of absolute accuracy, therefore, I am sending you this letter so that your files may reflect the exact situation.

I beg to enclose herewith copy of final decree which has been entered in the Circuit Court of Clarke County in the Chancery Cause of Georgette H. Blandy v. The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia. You will observe that this decree finally determines the fact that the University of Virginia has complied with all the conditions specified in the will of Graham F. Blandy as conditions precedent to the vesting of title in The Rector and Visitors of the University in the land devised to the University by the will of Graham F. Blandy, deceased.

A number of other questions were presented to the Court in this proceeding, among others the question of the vesting of the title to this land in the event of the University discontinuing operation of the Blandy Experimental Farm. On this point much time and trouble were expended, and it may be interesting to know that the position taken by myself, as Attorney for the University, and concurred in by Mr. Morris Douw Ferris, of Counsel for the Estate, was declared to be sound by the Court. Our position in this matter was strongly opposed by Mr. Joseph F. Moore, Counsel for Mrs. Blandy. Upon the entry of the final decree, however, we all agreed that for the present it might be wiser for the Court not to pass upon this point. Should this point ever be raised in the future the record in this suit will be valuable.

You should also be advised that the final accounts of the Executors have been filed in the Surrogate's Court for the County of New York. This final settlement shows the corpus of the trust fund set aside by the will of Graham F. Blandy, deceased, upon which his widow, the said Georgette H. Blandy is to receive the income during her life time, and which passes to the University at her death, amounts to **$971,486.12**.

I am also enclosing herewith final statement of our account for services rendered in this Estate, showing a balance of **$316.50** due on fee account. I also enclose a condensed statement of expense account, all of which has been paid.

If, under your present system of accounting, it is necessary to itemize the fee account I shall be glad to do so. If, in its present form, it is sufficient for your purpose I shall appreciate your sending me check as soon as convenient.
