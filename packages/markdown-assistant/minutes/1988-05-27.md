NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE BOARD OF VISITORS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA:

Section 1. The Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia (the "Board") (a) covenants to fix, revise, charge and collect rentals, fees and charges, including without limitation those for room and board, for or in connection with the University's student housing system, including the Projects and (b) pledges such fees to the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on that portion of the Bonds issued to finance the Projects; provided that the current expenses of operating the University-owned student housing facilities, including the Projects (the "Current Expenses") shall be a first charge on such rentals, fees and charges. The Board further covenants that such rentals, fees and charges will be fixed, revised, charged and collected so that the net revenues therefrom, after payment of the Current Expenses, will at all times be sufficient to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on that portion of the Bonds issued to finance the Projects as and when the same become due, and to pay debt service on any outstanding obligations, if any, that have been previously issued which are secured by the rentals, fees and charges pledged herein, that portion of the Bonds issued to finance the Projects to be secured on a parity with such obligations (except the University's $3,000,000 Dormitory Revenue Bonds (Series 1962) and its $4,100,000 Student Apartment and Dormitory Buildings Revenue Bonds (Series 1965) which are secured by a prior right in the revenues to be derived from those projects). Any such rentals, fees and charges in excess of the amounts required for the payment of the Current Expenses, the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on that portion of the Bonds issued to finance the Projects when due, and debt service on any outstanding obligations which are secured by the rentals, fees and charges pledged herein may be used by the University for any other proper purpose.

Section 2. It is hereby found, determined, and declared that, based upon responsible engineering and economic estimates and advice of appropriate officials of the University as shown on Exhibits A and B hereto, the anticipated net revenues received from the rentals, fees and charges pledged above will be sufficient to pay the Current Expenses, the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on that portion of the Bonds issued to finance the Projects as the same become due, and debt service on any outstanding obligations which are secured by the rentals, fees and charges pledged herein, so long as (i) the effective true interest cost on the Bonds does not exceed 8.50% per annum, and (ii) the aggregate amount of debt service actually payable in any bond year and all bond years on that portion of the Bonds issued to finance the Projects does not exceed $105,368, unless the Vice President for Business and Finance provides the Governor and the Treasury Board of the Commonwealth of Virginia with satisfactory evidence that the rentals, fees and charges pledged in Section 1 above will also be sufficient to pay the additional amount of actual debt service which for any bond year(s) exceeds $105,368.

Section 3. The Board covenants that so long as the Bonds are outstanding, the University will pay to the Treasurer of Virginia not less than 30 days before each interest or principal and interest payment date, the amount certified by the Treasurer of Virginia to be due and payable on such date as principal and interest on that portion of the Bonds issued on behalf of the University to finance the Projects.

Section 4. The Board covenants that the University will pay from time to time its proportionate share of all expenses incurred in connection with the sale and issuance of the Bonds and all expenses thereafter incurred in connection with the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Bonds all as certified by the Treasurer of Virginia to the University.

Section 5. The Board covenants that the University within six months of the date of the issuance of the Bonds will spend all of the proceeds derived from the sale of that portion of the Bonds issued to finance the Projects for costs associated with the Projects. The Board further covenants that the University, either alone or in conjunction with the Treasurer of Virginia will, to the extent permitted by Virginia law, take all other actions necessary to maintain the exemption of interest on the Bonds from gross income under Federal and Virginia law and, unless advised in writing by bond counsel for the issuance of the Bonds that such compliance is not necessary in order to maintain such exemption, to comply with the provisions contained in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, relating to tax-exempt obligations, including without limitation (a) refunding any obligations previously issued to finance the Projects within 30 days of the issuance of the Bonds (unless the Treasurer of Virginia permits a longer period of time), and (b) paying any required rebate to the United States, all as may be directed by the Treasurer of Virginia.

Section 6. The Board covenants that for so long as the Bonds are outstanding the University will not enter into any operating lease, management contract or similar agreement with any person or entity other than a governmental unit, for all or any portion of the Projects, without first obtaining the written approval of the Treasurer of Virginia and bond counsel for the issuance of the Bonds.

## Clinch Valley College of the University of Virginia has recently acquired an apartment building and 2.24 acres of land located across the road from the campus. The ten-unit apartment complex includes 8,708 square feet and will be used to house 36 students. The building was constructed in 1978 and is in good repair. Clinch Valley requested and received approval for this acquisition during the 1987 General Assembly Session.

## Clinch Valley College student housing is a self-supporting auxiliary enterprise, acting in direct support of the educational mission of the college. Clinch Valley has three goals in providing student housing. One is to furnish students with a variety of housing arrangements at reasonable cost. Another is to provide an environment in which each student may achieve the maximum realization of his or her potential, intellectually, socially and physically. The third is to have the ability to move the students from temporary housing, which may be either small rooms on campus or substandard housing in the town of Wise. The population of Wise is only 3,800 and any off-campus housing is very limited. Many of the students cannot commute because of the mountainous terrain and the long distances to surrounding communities. Therefore, housing must be provided for the majority of the student body. At present, the College has beds for less than half of the FTE student population. The acquisition of this apartment complex will enable Clinch Valley to better accommodate this critical need for student housing.

| Project Costs              | Amount     |
|----------------------------|------------|
| Acquisition of Building and Land | $300,000 |
| Improvements and Furnishings | $60,000 |
| **Total Amount of Debt**   | **$360,000** |

| Appropriation for this project was included in the Revenue Bond Bill approved during the 1987 General Assembly Session. |

| The Item No. is R-13.1; Project Code is 13843; and Title is Acquisition: Student Housing. The University financed the purchase with a Treasury Anticipation Loan and intends to repay this loan and permanently finance the project with proceeds from revenue bonds. CVC expects to occupy the facility in 1988. |

### Incremental Annual Operating Expenses for the 36 beds are estimated as follows:

| Description                       | Amount     |
|-----------------------------------|------------|
| Personal Services and Fringe Benefits | $7,800 |
| Contractual Services              | $4,500    |
| Supplies and Equipment            | $4,000    |
| Utilities                         | $2,880    |
| Indirect Costs                    | $720      |
| **Total Operating Expenses**      | **$19,900** |

### Revenues generated from this dormitory will be as follows:

| Description                                   | Amount     |
|-----------------------------------------------|------------|
| 36 Beds x $1260 x .98 (regular session)     | $44,452    |
| 36 Beds x $450 x .70 (summer session)       | $11,340    |
| **Total Revenues**                           | **$55,792** |

The table above, together with the worksheets that follow, indicate the net revenue generated from this new housing facility will not be sufficient to cover the annual principal and interest payment of $43,351, plus 10 percent debt coverage. However, if one considers net revenue generated by the Clinch Valley College dormitory "system", there is sufficient revenue to service all debt without increasing the dorm fees now paid by students at the College.

It should be noted that the data provided in the accompanying cash flow worksheets reflects net revenue generated by the dormitory system under "Other" revenue. That information is also provided in Attachment A. The bond indenture does not require a reserve fund payment; although as a matter of practice, Clinch Valley College budgets a minimum contribution of 5 percent of the revenue generated by dorm rents for major maintenance, renovation and repair of the facilities. This percentage is identified as "Reserve Contribution" in Attachment A.

### Project Costs, cont.

| Description                                   | Amount     |
|-----------------------------------------------|------------|
| Revenues generated from this dormitory will be as follows: | |
| 36 Beds x $1260 x .98 (regular session)     | $44,452    |
| 36 Beds x $450 x .70 (summer session)       | $11,340    |
| **TOTAL**                                    | **$55,792** |

| Existing Debt Service                       | Amount     |
|---------------------------------------------|------------|
| $73,950                                   |            |

### The University of Virginia at Clinch Valley College hopes to demonstrate with this revised feasibility study that revenue from the dormitory system can support new bond issues without any significant impact on the fees charged to students.
