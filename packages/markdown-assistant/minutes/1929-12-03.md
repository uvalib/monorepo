A conference of the Rector and Visitors was held in Richmond at the John Marshall Hotel on this date at 8 o'clock, P. M., to consider certain matters in connection with the requests of the University for capital outlays for the biennium of 1930-32.

There were present the Rector, C. Harding Walker, and Visitors Buchanan, McIntire, Mrs. Munford, Rinehart, Scott and Williams, and President Alderman.

The President stated that he had, with the approval of the Board, submitted the following requests for capital outlays for the University for the biennial budget of 1930-32:

and that he had received a request from the Governor to meet him tomorrow morning in conference with respect to the University's budget requests, for capital outlays to be incorporated in the Governor's Budget, recommendations to be presented to the Legislature. The Governor had intimated to him that in view of the fact that he would be unable to recommend the whole amount for capital outlay, he would like to have the Board express its preference for priority of the items listed.

During the discussion of the matter it developed that not more than $600,000 might be expected for capital outlays, the question then being which items should have priority. It was generally agreed that completion of the central heating plant and additional dormitories were the most pressing needs in the field of capital outlays. The order of priority then would be, 1. Completion of heating plant, 2. Additional dormitories, 3. New Engineering building, 4. Home for Nurses, 5. Women's building, etc. Mrs. Munford moved that the order of the Women's Building be made 4th on the list, which was lost by a vote of 6 to 1 (Mrs. Munford voting in the affirmative).

The original motion was then put and adopted by a vote of 6 to 1 (Mrs. Munford voting in the negative), as follows:

**RESOLVED**, That in the list of capital outlays requested for the University, as presented to the Governor for incorporation in the biennial budget for 1930-32, the dormitory request be made second, and that the other items remain in their present order:

That in case the Governor cannot recommend the full amount of the first three items, including the dormitory request, totaling $902,000, any reduction therefrom be taken from the dormitory request.

It was voted that the Rector and President, and such other members of the Board as may find it convenient, present the action of the meeting to the Governor.

The conference then adjourned.
