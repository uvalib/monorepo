**Legislative Proposals**

**The Rector asked Colette Sheehy to present amendments to the Code of Virginia for consideration by the Governor and the General Assembly. She said the first proposal amends § 10.1-1302 of the Code of Virginia to allow employees of institutions of higher education that own or operate power plants to serve on the State Air Pollution Control Board. On motion, the Board adopted the following resolution:**

**LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL TO AMEND CODE OF VIRGINIA SECTION 10.1-1302**

**RESOLVED, the Board of Visitors approves and endorses amending the Code of Virginia as it pertains to the State Air Pollution Control Board.**

**The proposed amendment to § 10.1-1302 of the Code of Virginia is as follows:**

**The members of the Board shall be citizens of the Commonwealth and shall be selected from the Commonwealth at large on the basis of merit without regard to political affiliation. Members shall, by their education, training, or experience, be knowledgeable of air quality control and regulation, and shall be fairly representative of conservation, public health, business, and agriculture. _Except for employees of institutions of higher education subject to permits or_**

**_enforcement orders of the Board, no_ No person appointed to the Board shall be employed by persons subject to permits or enforcement orders of the Board or receive a significant portion of his income, whether directly or indirectly, from persons subject to permits or enforcement orders of the Board. Income from a vested retirement benefit shall not be considered income for purposes of this section. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section relating to Board membership, the qualifications for Board membership shall not be more strict than those that are required by federal statute or regulations of the United States Environmental Protection Agency. The provisions of this section shall be in addition to the requirements of the State and Local Government Conflict of Interests Act (§ 2.2-3100 et seq.).**

**\- - - - - - - - -**

**The second proposal amends § 2.2-3705.5 of the Code of Virginia clarifying that all communications and information that are privileged and exempt from discovery under § 8.01-581.17 of the Code of Virginia are also exempt from public disclosure under the FOIA. Creating a specific exemption in the FOIA for this already privileged information will close the gap in the law and will ensure that these records will not be disclosed to third parties. On motion, the Board adopted the following resolution:**

**LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL TO AMEND CODE OF VIRGINIA SECTION 2.2-3705.5**

**RESOLVED, the Board of Visitors approves and endorses amending the Code of Virginia as it pertains to the Freedom of Information Act.**

**University of Virginia Investment Management Company (UVIMCO) Board Appointments**

**The Rector said there are three Board of Visitors appointees on the UVIMCO board. He named John Macfarlane as the “official” representative of the Board as required by the Policy on University-related Foundations. The other two Board-appointed positions on the UVIMCO board are open now as well. The Rector proposed John B. Harris and A. Macdonald Caputo to fill those positions. Mac Caputo is a graduate of the College and Law School, a former member of the Board of Visitors, a former member and chair of the UVIMCO Board, and a partner in the New York office of Morgan Stanley; John Harris was raised in Richmond and graduated from the U.Va. School of Law in 1979; his undergraduate degree, in economics, is from Harvard University. He held various positions at Deutsche Bank from 1979 to 2008, including as director and head of client adoption management for New York, Jersey City, Frankfurt, Dublin and Bangalore. He worked overseas in global finance for many years, including establishing the bank’s representative office in Johannesburg, South Africa post-apartheid.**

**Mr. Harris lives in New York city, and his current position is as a member of the Manhattan Community Board Five, appointed by the Manhattan Borough president to address issues facing Manhattan and New York city. The Rector said he believes Mr. Harris’ experience in global finance, risk management, and regulatory affairs will serve UVIMCO well.**

**AMENDMENTS TO THE MANUAL OF THE BOARD OF VISITORS**

**RESOLVED, in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.9 of the _Manual of the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia_ (the Manual) and the Code of Virginia Section 23-75, and upon recommendation of the Executive Committee, Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.28, 4.11, and 4.12 of the _Manual of the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia_ are amended, and Section 3.29 is added, as follows:**

Among other responsibilities, shall encourage and support the attraction and retention of a diverse group of students, faculty, and staff.

**Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Policy**

**The Virginia Freedom of Information Act was revised this year to loosen up the rules around telephonic participation in board meetings for last minute emergency or personal reasons. However, the law requires the board to establish a policy on how last minute requests to participate by telephone are handled. The policy language is directly out of the code provision — no requirements were added that are not required by the law. The Rector cautioned the Board members that even though this loosens up the rules around telephonic participation in meetings, it does not change the quorum requirements that a quorum be physically present in the meeting room for a meeting to occur. If a member asks to participate by telephone under these provisions, and their telephonic participation will cause a quorum not to be present, the request will be denied. In addition, a member may participate only twice a year under these provisions. This is not a substitute for physical presence at meetings.**

**On motion, the Board adopted the following resolution:**

**POLICY FOR PARTICIPATION IN BOARD OF VISITORS MEETINGS BY ELECTRONIC MEANS OF COMMUNICATION IN THE EVENT OF EMERGENCY OR PERSONAL MATTER OR CERTAIN DISABILITIES**

**WHEREAS, Virginia Code § 2.2-3708.1 specifies the requirements for the remote participation in meetings by members of public bodies in event of emergency or personal matter, or certain disabilities; and**

**WHEREAS, the General Assembly amended Virginia Code § 2.2-3708.1, effective July 1, 2014, to require the adoption of written policies by public bodies allowing for and governing participation of its members in meetings by the means of electronic communication;**

**RESOLVED, the “Policy for Participation in Board of Visitors Meetings by Electronic Means of Communication in the**

**Event of Emergency or Personal Matter or Certain Disabilities” is adopted as follows:**

**POLICY FOR PARTICIPATION IN BOARD OF VISITORS MEETINGS BY ELECTRONIC MEANS OF COMMUNICATION IN THE EVENT OF EMERGENCY OR PERSONAL MATTER OR CERTAIN DISABILITIES**

**A. A member of the Board of Visitors may participate in a meeting through electronic means of communication from a remote location that is not open to the public only as follows and subject to the requirements of subsection B:**

**1\. On or before the day of a meeting, a member notifies the Rector that he or she is unable to attend the meeting due to an emergency or personal matter, and identifies with specificity the nature of the emergency or personal matter, and the Rector approves the request to participate in the meeting from a remote location.**

1.  **The Board of Visitors is to record in its minutes the specific nature of the emergency or personal matter and the remote location from which the member participated. If a member's participation from a remote location is disapproved by the Rector because such participation would violate subsection B of this policy, disapproval shall be recorded in the minutes with specificity.**
2.  **Such remote participation by the member shall be limited each calendar year to two meetings or 25 percent of the meetings of the public body, whichever is fewer.**

**2\. A member notifies the Rector that he or she is unable to attend a meeting due to a temporary or permanent disability or other medical condition that prevents the member's physical attendance.**

*   **The Board of Visitors is to record this fact and the remote location from which the member participated in its minutes.**

**B. Participation by a member of the Board of Visitors under subsection A shall be authorized only under the following conditions:**

**1\. A quorum of the Board of Visitors is physically assembled at the primary or central meeting location; and**

**2\. The Board of Visitors has made arrangements for the voice of the remote participant to be heard by all persons at the primary or central meeting location.**

**C. This policy shall be applied strictly and uniformly, without exception, to the entire membership and without regard to the identity of the member requesting remote participation or the matters that will be considered or voted on at the meeting.**

**Resolution for Exclusion of Certain Directors and Officers – September 2014**

**The Rector said that in order for the University to conduct federal classified research, certain officers and employees must undergo a federal security clearance. This is an updated resolution that includes the new board members.**

**On motion, the Board approved the following resolution:**

**RESOLUTION FOR EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS — SEPTEMBER 2014**

**WHEREAS, current Department of Defense Regulations contain a provision making it mandatory that the Chair of the Board, a Senior Management Official, and a Facility Security Officer meet the requirements for eligibility for access to classified information established for a contractor facility security clearance; and**

**WHEREAS, said Department of Defense Regulations permit the exclusion from the personnel of the requirements for access to classified information of certain members of the Board of Directors and other officers, provided that this action is recorded in the public Minutes;**

**RESOLVED, the Rector as Chair of the Board, Senior Management Official, and Facility Security Officer at the present time do possess, or will be processed for, the required eligibility for access to classified information; and**

**RESOLVED FURTHER, in the future, when any individual enters upon any duties as Rector of the Board, Senior Management Official, and Facility Security Officer, such individual shall immediately make application for the required eligibility for access to classified information; and**

**RESOLVED FURTHER, the following members of the Board of Visitors and other officers shall not require, shall not have, and can be effectively and formally excluded from access to all _CLASSIFIED_ information disclosed to the University and shall not affect adversely Board and University policies or practices in the performance of classified contracts for the Department of Defense or the Government contracting activities (User Agencies) of the National Industrial Security Program.**

**Comments by the Rector**

**The Rector took a moment to thank David Neuman for his exemplary service as the university architect. He said David has been at the helm during an extraordinarily active period of building and renovations all across the University. Barbara Fried read the following commending resolution:**

**RESOLUTION COMMENDING DAVID J. NEUMAN**

**WHEREAS, Mr. David J. Neuman joined the University on November 25, 2003 as Architect for the University after having worked and taught at Stanford University and the University of California at Irvine; and**

**WHEREAS, Mr. Neuman has guided University-wide land use and campus planning resulting in the Grounds Plan adopted in 2008 as well as numerous precinct-level and site plans; and**

**WHEREAS, Mr. Neuman has championed sustainability planning leading to a University commitment to reduce both carbon and nitrogen footprints to 25% below 2009 levels by 2025 and the attainment of LEED certification for all new buildings and major renovations; and**

**WHEREAS, Mr. Neuman oversaw the restoration and maintenance of the Academical Village and all other historic facilities, production of the Historic Preservation Framework Plan, historic structure reports, and the first University cultural landscape report, and has played an important role in the Jeffersonian Grounds Initiative, a $225 million restoration and educational campaign to comprehensively repair and restore the Academical Village to its original, central purpose of engaging, connecting, and inspiring learning and scholarship; and**

**WHEREAS, Mr. Neuman guided the planning for the first two phases of the $50 million Rotunda renovation project that will bring the Rotunda into the modern era and return it to its place as a center of student activity and academics; and**

**WHEREAS, Mr. Neuman has directed the design, development, and planning efforts across hundreds of thousands of square feet of University buildings and their surrounding landscapes; and**

**WHEREAS, Mr. Neuman also guided the planning, building design, and development efforts at the University of Virginia's College at Wise leading to a significant transformation of the campus; and**  

**WHEREAS, Mr. Neuman has been a knowledgeable, dedicated steward of the University’s physical assets and has demonstrated an ability to balance historic preservation with modern architectural demands; and**

**WHEREAS, Mr. Neuman was committed to the education of the University's students and engaged student interns to provide them with work experiences that complemented their education; and** 

**WHEREAS, Mr. Neuman will step down as Architect for the University in October 2014;**

**RESOLVED, the Board of Visitors commends David J. Neuman for his exemplary service and expresses its profound gratitude for his dedication to the University and to the Commonwealth; and**

**RESOLVED FURTHER, the Board offers its most sincere wishes for future success and happiness to David and his wife Anne.**

**On motion, the resolution commending David Neuman was approved.**

**\- - - - - - - - -**

**NCAA Orientation**

**The Rector explained that Board members are boosters under the NCAA rules, and so annually, the Board is trained on NCAA compliance issues. He said the lesson here is, if in doubt, ask before you act. The rules are very complex and it would be quite easy inadvertently to cause a violation that would be detrimental to the athletics program. The Rector turned the session over to Eric Baumgartner, Associate Athletics Director for Compliance to provide the training. Mr. Baumgartner spoke about institutional control, stating that the President is responsible for the athletics program, and she has delegated day-to-day control to the Athletics Director and himself. He said a “representative of athletic interests” retains that definition forever, and Board members are such. A representative of athletic interests may not recruit student athletes. Prospective student athletes should be referred to the coaching staff. He said benefits provided to student athletes cannot be more than what is provided to others.**

**\- - - - - - - - -**

**ACC Certification**

**Every year, the Rector and the President are required to certify to the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) that Board members understand the President is responsible for the athletics program and has full authority from the Board to run the program. The certification was read to the members and then signed by both the Rector and the President.**

**Comments by the Student Member**

**Comments by the Student Member, Meg Gould, are provided verbatim below:**

**Good morning,**

**I want to start off by saying thank you to everyone present for this meeting, especially all of the students sitting behind me showing immense concern for the University by being here on a Friday afternoon--not a lot of students’ preferred weekend activity, so I appreciate it.**

**I’d like to frame my brief report with a discussion of what so often we consider the marker of our uniqueness, the stamp of what sets UVa as a world apart: the maintenance and true accessibility of our traditions here – of the ones we cherish, ones we have a reason to discontinue, and new traditions we can begin.**

**First, let us consider student self-governance as an exceptionally well-maintained tradition here, but see it in a broader context. Self-governance has a deeper role than simply the virtue of a student acting independently, accepting the responsibility of accomplishing or achieving alone. In my opinion, it involves the realization that all the pieces matter here, and that each person works to make her own piece as valuable, important, and useful to the whole as possible. Therefore, here are four examples of collaboration between student groups, student initiative to create and to act, and students working in conjunction with other parts of the University to address problems more comprehensively and effectively.**

1.  **For instance, the collaboration of the Minority Rights Coalition and the Honor Committee two weeks ago generated a thoughtful forum on the Honor system, and how or if a community of mutual, and equal, and tangible trust can exist for everyone when certain groups are underrepresented. The dialogue continued on the topic of the composition of the Honor Committee, exploring how its membership could expand to include multiple perspectives and cultures without simply checking a diversity box for minority students.**
2.  **Another student-governed initiative is that Student Council has decided that its general body meetings will rotate between different University spaces and locations for better accessibility and convenience for different students, as opposed to the traditional meeting in Newcomb. This concerted effort to internalize and personally to act upon the problem of disengagement demonstrates care to engage directly with other organizations and students.**
3.  **Then there are the efforts of students instigating change here. For example, Greens to Grounds is a student group formed by planning and architecture students initiating environmental change at UVa by implementing green design and promoting green practices at the University.**

**The Black Student Alliance is also trying to bring about cultural change and awareness by vocalizing issues that matter to them and more broadly to all of us, such as the problems of police brutality and media misrepresentation they spoke against at a rally last Friday. This Tuesday, Sustained Dialogue, BSA, and NAACP at UVa will be hosting a follow-up, solution-generating conversation focused on finding tangible answers to these issues.**

1.  **Finally, as strong as is our tradition of self-governance, the students also act in concert with other parts of the University. As you just heard, the University-wide effort to address, respond to and prevent sexual misconduct demonstrates the priority of safety and respect for the _whole_ university, for every entity and from many perspectives. I won’t repeat myself too much from earlier but I would personally like to thank each administrator, faculty and staff member, and student involved in these efforts. Taking such holistic ownership of this issue is powerful and inspiring.**

**I have faith we’ll maintain students’ abilities to govern themselves, to work independently or together, and to realize solutions. But most importantly, I believe that we should ensure that this tradition of governance, and other traditions, are remaining universally accessible.**

**Accessibility of tradition means that practices we uphold permeate Grounds and the UVA experience on many levels and that students have equal opportunity to engage with them.**

**I would like to extend a thank you to John Griffin and each member of the Finance Sub-committee for working to strengthen the critical tradition of affordability for students here. The priority of finding creative solutions to ensure predictable tuition and to meet 100% need through AccessUVA, as much as we can through grants, confirms a dedication to supporting low- and mid-income students, even despite lack of funding.**

**Another precious tradition is our close faculty / student relationships. With this unprecedented turnover in our academic leadership and faculty, we cannot forget to see our faculty not only as teachers, but as mentors, role models, and advisors. We must make sure that these mentors are approachable to students from all walks of life, especially students from minority backgrounds who may feel alienated with the lower percentage of minority faculty. Inclusion extends beyond students, and I want to comment on how much I, and other students, appreciate the permanent commitment to the Diversity and Inclusion Committee. Especially with our critical opportunity to hire new faculty, we need to engage students and prioritize the diversity of background, experience, race, and opinion in conjunction with other points of data when considering the best choices for the University.**

**So we strengthen traditions that we see strengthening the experience here. Then I would like to end one tradition that I see permeating our Grounds, and create a new one. I feel that we can work to end any sort of disenfranchisement felt by many, whether they be minority students, athletes, students with disabilities, transfer students, or students that have not yet found their place. This is about creating a new practice and culture of diversity, multiculturalism and inclusivity, and of equality. We should strive for equality of experience, equality and visibility of resources for students, and inclusivity in public spaces for students from more underrepresented backgrounds.**

**You all more than anyone else can probably see that we are at a true, and fragile, and exciting transition point for the future as we approach our bicentennial and exponentially increase our reach and numbers. That means we have to think critically about how we maintain our traditions and how we conduct our business in this changing landscape of expanded student population, sexual assault awareness, financial aid, and a lack of funding, and more. Most importantly we need to think how we can make this experience at our University transformative for each student. I hope we continue what we started with the Strategic Plan – consulting and collaborating with students, faculty, and other community members in the process of selecting University leaders and finding solutions to our larger problems.**

**The Rector commented that Dr. Britt, a new member of the Board, graduated from the University as one of only three African Americans in his class. Dr. Britt was one of his mentors. The Rector said we’ve come a long way, but there is more work to do.**

**Comments by the Faculty Senate Chair**

**President Sullivan introduced Joseph Garofalo, Faculty Senate Chair and a faculty member of the Curry School of Education, who gave a presentation on faculty work profiles. He said that faculty work an average of at least 54.8 hours per week; full-time salaried: 56.8 hours per week; part-time salaried: 38.1 hours; and part-time wage: 31.8 hours. He explained the different work areas and activities in great detail. He said it is hard to compare all faculty because some have a teaching emphasis, others a research emphasis, and then there are those that are balanced or have a clinical/ service emphasis. In addition, faculty do consulting and administrative work. He stressed that faculty members are always on the clock and do a great deal more than just teach classes.**

**Comments by the President**

**President Sullivan began her remarks by informing the Board about a recently released plan by the Governor, entitled, “The New Virginia Economy Strategic Plan.” She said the Governor’s plan focuses on innovation, entrepreneurship, and the “skills-to-job” workforce.**

**President Sullivan said the Governor’s strategic plan intersects with the University’s Cornerstone Plan at multiple points. She gave a few examples:**

*   **Total Advising. Through Total Advising, we are mapping students’ choice of major to career options, aligning our efforts with workforce needs. We are putting greater emphasis on internships and experiential learning so students gain skills that employers need. We are moving forward with a plan to renovate the 2nd floor of Clemons Library to consolidate advising resources and academic support services in a single location. This will give students a one-stop-shop for Total Advising. The cost estimate $3.2 M – $4.0 M) and addresses Pillar 1, Strategy 2.**
*   **Research infrastructure. We advance an entrepreneurial environment and promote business development in the Commonwealth by growing research. This addresses Pillar 2, Strategy 5.**

**Examples:**

*   *   *   **U.Va.’s sponsored research awards grew 3% last year over prior year, with awards totaling over $292 million.** 
        *   **Federal sponsorship was $187 million, up 5%.**

*   *   *   **Industry sponsorship was over $33 million, up 35%.**
*   **Through the Cornerstone Plan’s pan-University research institutes we will generate new degree programs, minors, and certificate programs for students preparing to enter the job market in the Commonwealth and beyond. This addresses Pillar 2, Strategy 4.**
*   **In the Data Science Institute, we enrolled our inaugural class of students in the Master of Science in Data Science (MSDS) program this summer. 49 students are enrolled in this first MSDS class. This program will train students to meet employer needs in industry and government.**
*   **The University is in the process of creating the Meriwether Lewis Institute for Citizen Leadership, one of the signature programs from the strategic plan. This addresses Pillar 1, Strategy 1.**

**In the spring semester of their second year, students will take a “Leadership Fundamentals” course for academic credit; as part of the course, they will learn about leadership from speakers from the private and public sectors.**

**During the summer between their second and third years, they will participate in an intensive leadership program to build various skills: written and verbal communication, “hard skills” such as PowerPoint and Excel, and “soft skills” such as situational leadership.**

**The second half of the summer will include serving as Lewis Fellow interns and tackling experiential issues related to leadership. In the fall semester of their third years, students will conduct field-based independent study to apply their leadership learning to a specific issue at UVa.**

**The goal of the Institute is to prepare students for significant responsibilities as student leaders here at UVa, while setting the foundation for a lifetime of leadership.**

**The University recently received a commitment of donor support that allowed the University to begin creating the Meriwether Lewis Institute. As with Jaffray Woodriff’s gift to support the Data Science Institute and John Griffin’s gift for the Blue Ridge Scholars program, this is yet another example of donors stepping forward to invest in the Cornerstone Plan.**

**President Sullivan said more than a year ago, we began the Cornerstone Plan with the goal of aligning with the former Governor’s “Top Jobs” Act, and the plan aligns now with the current Governor’s “New Virginia Economy Plan.”**

**These synergies between U.Va.’s strategic plan and the Commonwealth’s priorities show that the University’s priorities are aligned with the Commonwealth’s priorities.**

**President Sullivan introduced Pamela Sutton-Wallace. In July, she became the CEO of the Medical Center. Pamela previously served as senior vice president for Hospital Operations of Duke University Hospital. She joined Duke in 1997, and held several management positions during her 17-year tenure: VP for Ambulatory Practice Management and Chief Operating Officer for Ambulatory Services, Director of Perioperative Services, and Chief of Staff for the Chancellor for Health Affairs and President / CEO of the Duke University Health System. In addition to her tenure at Duke, Pamela has experience in the pharmaceutical, insurance, and health care research industries. She earned her undergraduate degree in Political Science and African-American Studies from Washington University in St. Louis, and her Master’s of Public Health degree from Yale.**
