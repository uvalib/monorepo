Report of the Executive Committee to the Rector & Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia.

Your Committee submits the following report of their proceedings since the last annual meeting of the Board.

At a meeting held on the 22d of October 1890, on the recommendation of the Faculty the following fees in the optional two years course in medicine were established and ordered to be inserted in the forthcoming catalogue:

At the same meeting the application of Mr C. S. Purdy to attend the course of medicine in the University without payment of fees was refused.

The application of Mr J. E. Hubble to reenter the University on the 1st of April 1891 and complete the examinations for his degree in medicine without payment of fees, was granted.

The guarantee of the salary of $700. heretofore given to Mr Z. W. Coombs late instructor in Physical Culture was continued to his successor, J. S. Hutchcock.

The recommendation of the Faculty as to the change in the law requiring the Boarding house keepers to furnish bedding & furniture to the students living in the University was postponed until the next meeting of the Board.

Mr R. S. B. Smith was appointed at the last regular meeting of the Board of Visitors to the Birely Scholarship for the session of 1890-91 on the recommendation of the Executrix of Mrs Birely under the belief that he was eligible under the provisions of the will of the testatrix. A copy of the will not being before the Board at the time of the appointment. Upon an inspection of the will however which required the young man appointed to be a resident of Frederick city or of Frederick County Maryland, Mr Smith not being a citizen of either place, on the recommendation of Mr Benjamin F. Brown one of the Executors of Mrs Birely, W. R. Delashmutt of Frederick City, Maryland was appointed to sd scholarship. And the Proctor out of the general funds of the University was directed to credit an amount equal to the income of the Birely fund to the expense account of said W. R. Delashmutt for the Session of 1890-91. The income from said fund for the year having already been appropriated under the order of the Board to R. S. B. Smith who had matriculated before the error was discovered.

At a meeting of the Committee held on the 24th day of October 1890 the Proctor was directed to furnish the new chapel with fuel & lights from the time the building was turned over to the authorities of the University, viz since June last.

At a meeting of the Committee held on the 18th of November 1890 a proposition from the firm of \[T. &]? J. W. Johnson for the exchange with the University of Virginia for some of the broken sets of law books for certain books which were needed by the University to fill up some sets of reports already in the library. Upon the recommendation of the law professors the proposition was accepted and the exchange proposed directed to be made.

At a meeting of the Committee held on the 3d of December 1890 upon information received that W. R. Delashmutt who had been appointed to the Birely Scholarship at a former meeting had withdrawn from the University, on the recommendation of Mr Benj. F. Brown one of the Executors of Mrs Birely, Mr John S. Newman of Frederick County, Maryland was appointed to fill the vacancy for the remainder of the Session of 1890-91 and the Proctor was directed to apply so much of the yearly income of the Birely fund which had not been expended for the charges & Expenses of said Delashmutt to the charges & expenses at the University of said John S. Newman for the remainder of the Session of 1890-91.

The Committee being informed that the Boarding house keepers in the University preferred to collect the board of the students directly and not through the Proctor as heretofore, a resolution authorizing them so to do was adopted.

The Board met pursuant to adjournment on yesterday.

Present the same members as on yesterday with the exception of Mr McCabe who was excused & left for his home.

The following papers were handed in:

* Application of Profr Towles for leave of absence from the 15th of March to April 7th 1892.
* Special report from the school of applied Mathematics.
* Supplementary report from the Faculty.
* Application of Mr J. T. Jameson for permission to examine the Arthur Lee papers & other manuscripts of that period in the Library.
* A communication from the Faculty nominating David K. Butler for appointment to the Miller Scholarship for two years.

The following resolutions were adopted.

Resolved, that John B. Minor, Jr, be continued as instructor of law for the session 1891-92 and that his salary be fixed at one thousand dollars. Unanimously adopted.

Resolved, that the Faculty be authorized to grant a diploma for the requisite attainment in the subject of Celestial Mechanics.

Resolved, that David K. Butler be appointed to the Miller Scholarship for two years in accordance with the recommendation of the Faculty.

The following report from the Faculty in reference to Dr M. R. Leverson's application having been read and considered by the Board on motion it was

Resolved that the report be received and adopted and that the Secretary be directed to notify Dr Leverson of the action of the Board.

The Committee of the Faculty to which was referred the Resolutions of the Board of Visitors touching the application of Dr Leverson to be permitted to deliver in the University, a course of lectures on "the Science of Legislation", having carefully considered the subject submit the following report

It seems to the Committee that the need at present, for such a course of lectures is not as urgent as for instruction in some other subjects, and that it is not desirable, in the existing condition of the University further to multiply the Departments therein.

The introduction of a subject so wide, so various, and so undetermined as the Science of legislation, would probably demand a rearrangement of several existing Departments, and that might involve consequences more far-reaching than can be foreseen.

And lastly if it should appear to be expedient to introduce such a subject of instruction, the principles to be discussed would involve topics of such delicacy and importance that the University ought not to commit itself to any course of instruction thereupon, or to extend its sanction thereto, until the Board has had ample opportunity to inquire into the fitness in all respects, of the proposed instructor, and by comparison to select the best man for the position.

The Committee thereupon recommend that the Faculty report to the Board that they cannot approve of Dr Leverson's application.
