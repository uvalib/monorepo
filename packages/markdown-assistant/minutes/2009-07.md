### Friday, July 10 – Legislative Proposals

The session on Friday, July 10th, began at 1:00 p.m., and was led by the Rector.

The Rector introduced Mr. Sandridge, who gave a brief overview of the three legislative proposals for the 2010 General Assembly session.

The Board considered and approved three resolutions on the proposed legislation.

### Comments by the Rector

The Rector announced that three Board members had been reappointed by the Governor to serve a second term: Mr. Diamonstein, Mr. Mastracco, and Mr. Caputo. Randal J. Kirk was appointed to replace Thomas F. Farrell II, who completed two terms on June 30. The Rector said Mr. Kirk has served on the Board at Radford University, and so he is not new to the issues in higher education. He mentioned that Mr. Kirk has not yet received an orientation to the University.

### Performance Measures

The Rector provided some background information on the Performance Measure materials, which were provided to the Board in advance of the meeting. He stated that this is the fourth year the Board has reviewed the Performance Measures. He said the Performance Measures were developed to assess institutional progress and achievement in improving the University’s national rankings, focusing academic priorities on areas of excellence, strength, and potential, and positioning the University strategically with respect to institutional peers.

The Rector said one hour would be devoted to examining new measures developed to assess overall institutional financial health and the factors considered by the rating agencies in determining the University’s bond rating.

The Rector introduced Ms. Colette Sheehy, who, along with Ms. Yoke San Reynolds, reviewed the measures on overall institutional financial health and the bond rating factors. Ms. Reynolds created two measures on overall institutional financial health: Equity Ratio, which is total net assets divided by total assets, and free cash flow margin, which is cash generated through operations that remains after the bills are paid. The University’s free cash flow margin is 2% for 2008. The more free cash flow in the institution, the better it is able to invest in new ventures. If the margin is negative, this shows that the institution is using debt for operations.

### Financial Model of the Future

The Rector asked Mr. Sandridge to introduce the Financial Model of the Future topics. Mr. Sandridge said four topics would be discussed at the Retreat: State General Fund Revenues, Tuition, Sponsored Research, and Cost Containment. More topics would be covered as part of the regular Board meetings in the Fall and Spring.

A white paper was sent to Board members on each topic in advance of the Retreat, which provide context and metrics. The four white papers for the Retreat are attached to these Minutes.

#### State General Fund Revenue

Mr. Sandridge said for most public universities state revenues are one of the major budget drivers. For instance, the University of North Carolina receives almost three times as much in general fund revenues as the University. For the University, there is an $80 million gap between the amount appropriated in 1989-90, inflated by the CPI, and current appropriations. State funding accounts for 6.9% of the University’s budget including the Hospital. If the Hospital is excluded, the funding percentage is 11.5%.

Mr. Sandridge said that the future of state funding is uncertain because it is not on the Secretary of Finance list of necessities. Higher education funding is considered discretionary.

The University of Virginia’s College at Wise is more dependent on state funding; they receive 50% of their budget from the state. Budget cuts will affect them more severely than the University.

The Board discussed how to encourage the state to fund higher education, and how to protect the University from suffering in the event state funding is not forthcoming.

#### Tuition

Mr. Sandridge and Ms. Sheehy presented information on tuition.

The tuition increase for 2009-2010 will be 5.1%, which is artificially low due to federal stimulus money, which is temporary and not a permanent revenue stream.

The major cost drivers in the University operating budget are faculty and staff salaries, Access VA, and the operating and maintenance costs of new buildings. Mr. Sandridge and Ms. Sheehy asked the Board to provide advice on whether the University should assess a tuition surcharge to entering undergraduate students to better align price with quality. They proposed $1,000 a year for out-of-state students. This question instigated a lively discussion on the benefits versus the disadvantages of raising tuition.

Following the Tuition discussion, the Rector recessed the meeting until 8:30 a.m. Saturday morning.

The Rector called the Retreat to order at 8:30 a.m. on Saturday, July 11, 2009, and he asked Dr. Garson to begin the Sponsored Research presentation and discussion.

### Sponsored Research

Dr. Garson began the discussion by pointing out the benefits of research to the University, which are many including the value of discovery; the education of students; the attraction of faculty to do research as well as to teach; the production and dissemination of knowledge; innovation that attracts corporate partnerships; and technology transfer and commercialization. Research is essential to being a top university in the 21st Century.

Dr. Garson said that faculty who are excellent at both teaching and research are the most valuable because they are able to translate their research to students. Not all faculty are able to do this.

Dr. Garson introduced Mr. Skalak, Vice President for Research, who continued the presentation.

Mr. Skalak pointed out that sponsored research benefits society by pushing new disruptive innovations into the marketplace. The students benefit also because in many cases the University researcher pushes down the discovery to application process to their students, including even first year undergraduates.

The Board and administrators engaged in a discussion about the position of the University among top research universities. Although the University is among the top 50 research universities in the country, Mr. Skalak pointed out that the University ranks in the 35th percentile among AAU institutions for federal research expenditures, which is the lowest among its peers. One of the challenges is the size of the University, including the relatively small number of science faculty. Dr. Garson said that research is costly to the institution and these costs, particularly the full indirect costs, are not covered fully by the research sponsors.

Mr. Skalak explained the “V-RISE” research strategic planning initiative, which stands for “Virginia Research, Innovation, Science and Engineering”. V-RISE seeks to explore all areas of scholarship and research, and particularly how the University might strengthen and link areas in science, engineering, and the arts with strengths in the social sciences and humanities to produce outstanding student experiences and ways to create new knowledge at interfaces of disciplines.

V-RISE has 220 participants, which represent a cross-section of the University, providing review and input from a breadth of talent including faculty, students, Board members, and others. The deans of the schools identified priorities for research in which 7 themes arose: sustainability and the environment; energy; public health; bioengineering; nanotechnology; cyber security and information assurance; and innovation and entrepreneurship. Intended outcomes of this planning process include methods for connecting program champions with development (fund-raising) processes, and systems for adapting and modifying the plan via continuous discussion. The development plan will be refined over a six month period.

Mr. Skalak also mentioned the National Research Council review of research programs. More information will be forthcoming to the Board on this review.

### Cost Containment

Mr. Sandridge reviewed a number of measures already underway to contain costs including reducing the total number of employees through attrition and eliminating non-essential services. Details of these initiatives are contained in the attached white paper. The Board engaged in a discussion of various cost containment strategies.

### Executive Session

Upon the following motion, the Board went into Executive Session at 10:30 a.m.:

That the Board of Visitors go into Closed Session to discuss and evaluate the performance of specific employees, to discuss the awarding of a consultancy contract for executive recruiting services where discussion in open session would adversely affect the bargaining position and negotiating strategy of the University, and to confer with legal counsel on specific legal matters relating to the process for conducting a personnel search, as permitted by Sections 2.2-3711 (A)(1), (7), and (29) of the Code of Virginia.

The Board resumed its meeting in Open Session at 12:25 p.m. and adopted the following resolution certifying that its discussions in Executive Session had been conducted in accordance with the exemptions permitted by the Virginia Freedom of Information Act:

That we vote on and record our certification that, to the best of each Board member’s knowledge, only public business matters lawfully exempted from open meeting requirements and which were identified in the motion(s) authorizing the closed session, were heard, discussed or considered in closed session.

***

On motion, the Board adjourned at 12:30 p.m.

Respectfully Submitted,
