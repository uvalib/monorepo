The Annual Meeting of The Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia was scheduled for September 12-14, 2018. Because of weather reports indicating Hurricane Florence would severely impact the Central Virginia region beginning on Thursday, September 13, the Thursday and Friday meetings and events for the Board were cancelled and all action items were taken up in a meeting of the Full Board on the afternoon of Wednesday, September 12.

**Comments by the Rector**

Mr. Conner thanked everyone for making the effort to come to Charlottesville a day early for the meeting. He welcomed Jennifer (J.J.) Wagner Davis, who is the incoming Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; she will begin on November 4, 2018. He introduced Tim Heaphy, University Counsel, who is a double ‘Hoo (College and Law). Mr. Heaphy worked on Senator Joe Biden’s staff before law school, then in the U.S. Attorney’s office before moving to McGuireWoods. In 2009, he was named the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Virginia. In 2014, he left to work at Hunton & Williams in Richmond. Mr. Heaphy authored the report on the City of Charlottesville’s handling of the Unite the Right rally August 11 and 12, 2017. Mr. Conner noted that Mr. Heaphy is dedicated to public service and the University is fortunate to have him on our team. Mr. Conner spoke about the retirement celebration for Roscoe Roberts, mentioning that Mr. Roberts devoted his career to public service. He expressed appreciation for all that Mr. Roberts had done for the University.

Mr. Conner said the discussion on governance would have to wait because of the shortened meeting time. He said there are two major functions of governance: 1) where we plan to be in the future; and 2) the oversight function; on occasion the Board has gone too far in its oversight. He said the plans to honor Pat Hogan at dinner on Thursday were postponed until the December meeting.

**Report by the President**

President Ryan outlined priorities for the year and the issues he plans to focus on over his first 100 days in office.

Strategic Plan: The first and most important is to develop a strategic plan coupled with a financial plan for implementation. At the retreat, the Board learned from Michael Lenox the process for forming a strategic plan. Currently, the University administration is at the stage of having conversations and getting input from across the University and beyond about what a vision for UVA should look like. Mr. Ryan said the three themes of a future strategic plan are community, discovery and service. The next stage will be to develop strategic priorities around that vision, and he will seek input again as he works to do that. It will include revising the Strategic Investment Fund (SIF) grant process to support the strategic plan, its goals, and the targets for measuring progress.

Fill out and onboard the senior leadership team. Some of the newest members of the President’s leadership team attended the retreat in August.  Mr. Ryan will also search this year for new deans for nursing and Batten, and a new chief diversity officer. He said it is exciting having so many new people, but it also means there are a number of individuals just starting out, and it is important to be on the same page and to have the information necessary to make decisions.

Devise a restructured student recruitment, admission, and advising program. The University is doing a good job, but there are some opportunities for improvement. For example, simplifying financial aid and thinking strategically about enrollment management.

Develop a University strategy for Health System and Academic Division in Northern Virginia. The School of Medicine is partnering with Inova to send some third- and fourth-years to northern Virginia for clinical rotations. Inova also owns the old Exxon-Mobil campus in Fairfax and there is an option to have, in effect, a campus in northern Virginia. This is an opportunity, but also raises difficult questions: how do we avoid cannibalizing what’s happening here, and how do we determine what makes sense to put there? Greg Fairchild from Darden is leading a task force to develop recommendations.

Develop a long-term plan for the Emmet/Ivy corridor, Fontaine Research Park, and perhaps the West Complex. We need a holistic approach to these areas. 

Prepare a successful capital campaign launch, including meeting key donors, visiting key markets, and securing some major gifts to close out the silent phase of the campaign.

The campaign has been named “Honor the Future: The Campaign for the University of Virginia.”  Public launch will be October 2019. The total raised so far in the quiet phase is $1.8 billion.  He said it would be nice to get to 50% of the goal, but he is optimistic that the campaign will at least be able to get to 40% by the public launch date.

Strengthen university-wide culture of collaboration (through institutes, co-hiring and appointments, joint research, etc.) and accountability. Collaboration is key to some of the most important research efforts. There is a great deal of interest on Grounds for working in interdisciplinary teams, but also logistical obstacles in the way.  How do we make it easier?

Improve UVA/community relations. The relationship between UVA and the surrounding communities could be stronger than it is.  The current partnerships are often a little bit isolated or siloed.  A group of people from UVA and the community will be assembled to try to develop an agenda that is relevant to the needs and desires of those in the greater Charlottesville area that align with the University’s strengths.

Engender a sense of trust in administration and optimism about future of university among students, faculty, and staff. In some ways the most amorphous, but also the most important. The University has weathered a number of storms over the last five years, and hopefully people can take a deep breath and think with optimism and about the future of the University. While there is a lot of work to do, there are also tremendous opportunities.

Collaborate with the Board to align work with the University strategic plan. Communication is important and President Ryan will seek the Board’s advice and counsel on major decisions. The discussion on governance will help set expectations and a framework for how the Board and the President can work together.

President Ryan’s final priority is to stay in touch with and see his family, regardless of what else he does. He said he knows everyone probably shares that priority—not spending time with his family, necessarily, but spending time with their families.  It is a reminder that what we do at the University matters, but it is important to keep perspective and focus on what matters most. With that in mind, he said we can all do some good work for this university that we love.  

**Comments by the Student Representative to the Board**

Brendan Nigro provided a handout with updates from student organizations on their goals and initiatives for the year in an effort to provide the Board with a perspective on student life on a more granular level and to identify some of the working benefits of student self-governance. He focused his remarks on the University’s historic landscape and the ways that we can build on what he perceives to be tremendous momentum.

He said across the country, public sites are reckoning with their pasts in their landscapes of commemoration. We have no doubt seen this in the debates here in Charlottesville but also in places like New Orleans and Durham. We have begun this process at UVA too. It was a year ago at the September meeting that the Board made the brave decision to remove the plaques celebrating Confederate soldiers from the Rotunda. Most recently, there came the action of students at UNC-Chapel Hill to tear down the “Silent Sam” statue to a Confederate soldier. Each of these case studies tells us that we have a generation eager to interrogate the past and consider the consequences of racist symbols in public space.

Mr. Nigro said he believes the University has shown remarkable leadership in reckoning honestly with its history over the short time that he’s been a student. The President’s Commission on Slavery and the University resulted in an immense amount of new knowledge about slavery at UVA and, with the help of the Board, the construction of a memorial to the enslaved people at the University is soon to come. He encouraged the Board to remain steadfast in its support for this project and to move forward with construction despite the cost obstacles.

He said he would posit that after this memorial is in the ground, we can’t wipe our hands and say we’re done. As a University, it is our core mission to advance and disseminate knowledge. There are few more powerful ways to do so than in creating an environment of learning in the space that we inhabit. That tradition of learning through the physical space dates back to Jefferson himself and his ideas about constructing the Academical Village as a sort of 3D architectural textbook. We have the opportunity to bolster the larger public’s engagement with our history and fill substantial gaps through additions to the historic landscape.

As the Deans Working Group’s Advisory Committee on the Future of the Historic Landscape recommended, we ought to begin this process by recognizing agents of change at the University. It is unquestionable that the actions and bravery of the first African-American students at UVA like Gregory Swanson, Walter Ridley, and Robert Bland transformed the make-up and trajectory of our University, and yet nowhere do we see a recognition of these trailblazing students in our historic landscape. The same is true of people like Virginia Anne Scott, Nancy Anderson, JoAnn Kirstein, and Nancy Jaffe who sued the University in 1969 with the help of a UVA law alumnus to break down the barriers of an all-male undergraduate College. These people leave an indelible mark on the history of our University, but find no recognition in our public spaces. By including their stories and their resilience in additions to the historic landscape, we have the opportunity to further communicate our values of inclusion and mutual respect.

Mr. Nigro said we cannot just stop with additions to the historic landscape. We must also consider necessary contextualization or even removal of some of our present memorials. The Grounds are littered with statues and plaques about the University’s founder, Thomas Jefferson; a man that was as troubling as he was brilliant. How we interpret these aspects of our history in public space is critical towards our vision of a diverse and inclusive community moving forward. In other words, we should publicly address Jefferson as both a proclaimer of liberty and practitioner of bondage within our landscape. In some ways, Jefferson has always loomed over the University in its path towards progress. Edwin Alderman, the University’s first President, once said, “You cannot speak of Mr. Jefferson in Charlottesville without feeling that he is about to turn the nearest corner. It is a pungent form of immortality that every now and then almost gives one a turn.” We need to address the paradoxical legacies of our founder in more robust ways across the University, in its landscape and its curriculum, to ensure this kind of ‘pungent immortality’ doesn’t restrict us solely to the aspects of Jefferson’s person that we rightfully wish to celebrate.

Mr. Nigro suggested to the Board that calls for removal and contextualization of historic symbols at the University are not going away any time soon. And the process of deciding what to do with such symbols ought to occur in consultation with students, faculty, staff, alumni, and the local community. The built landscape affects our everyday lived experience and so in gathering various ideas and perspectives, we can prioritize both the advancement of knowledge _and_ the safety, power, and happiness of our community.

Mr. Nigro said this is not to detract from the remarkable work that UVA has already done in its honest scholarship about the history of slavery and the continued scholarship about the University’s role in the age of segregation; he suggested further action because he thinks our unique position in higher education calls us to it. We are, in fact, the only university in America designated as a United Nations World Heritage Site. We possess, to the American Institute of Architects’ eye, “the proudest achievement of American architecture” in this nation’s history. And our University’s founding roots are inextricably linked with the founding roots of our nation.

Mr. Nigro ended with a suggestion that the Board consider a permanent advisory body, potentially built out of the Committee on Naming, to interface with the community and recommend additions, contextualization, renamings, and removals within our historic landscape. He echoed the recommendation of the Deans Working Group Advisory Committee that we ought to continue this process by recognizing and celebrating agents of change at the University.

**Strategic Investment Fund Annual Report**

Mr. Hogan spoke about the second annual Strategic Investment Fund report, which was handed out to Visitors in the meeting. It summarizes the investments the Board has approved this year, which total $136 million (11 projects). Cumulatively, over the two-year investment period, the total awards are around $350 million.

Mr. Conner said that previously we had the Cornerstone Plan with no funding mechanism under it, and several years later the SIF fund came along and now we need to correlate the two. He said the guidelines will essentially remain the same but the evaluation process for determining which initiatives we will fund will be done a little bit differently. It will be tied more to the strategic plan and the president and provost will have a little more discretion within that constraint once the Board approves the strategic plan. All of these actions – the strategic plan, the process, and the individual grants – will still require Board approval. There will be more discussion on this in the future.

**NCAA Orientation**

Mr. Eric Baumgartner gave the annual briefing on NCAA rules and regulations. Visitors are boosters and must avoid any activity that could violate the athlete recruiting rules. He said boosters may not provide extra benefits to student athletes, i.e. benefits provided to student athletes or their family members that are not provided to the general public.

**ACC Certification**

The Rector read the annual ACC certification statement that designates the chief executive officer of the University as the individual responsible for the athletics program at the University.

**Commending Resolution for Patrick D. Hogan**

Mr. Murray said we will be honoring Pat Hogan at the Board dinner in December. Pat has created a transition plan and has been on-boarding J.J. Davis one piece at a time. He also has begun the next step in the organizational excellence plan, reorganizing the finance area. This will look a lot like the transition for human resources. He said we owe Mr. Hogan a great deal of gratitude for the transition process that looks to be remarkable. Mr. Murray then read the following resolution honoring Mr. Hogan, which was approved unanimously by the Board:

President Ryan has spoken with Greg Fairchild, who in turn spoke with all of the deans who expressed excitement about the potential opportunities for programs in Northern Virginia.

**Advancement Committee Action**

Mr. Griffin highlighted the philanthropic cash flow report found in the meeting book – it was a record-breaking year last year. He said the start of this year has been good. For the first two months, we are up 25% over last year. The goal is to keep up this momentum. He thanked President Ryan for making this one of his top priorities. He also thanked those who have agreed to host President Ryan in their home towns in order to introduce him to key donors. He said this approach is incredibly effective.

The Advancement Committee had plans to highlight one of their donors for the McIntire School of Commerce. Due to weather conditions, this could not take place. In the coming weeks, Mr. Griffin said we would see a very significant gift announcement that focuses on the key partnership between the McIntire School of Commerce and one of the other schools.

The Advancement Committee had one action item, the confirmation of the BOV representatives to the governing boards of the University-related foundations. On motion duly seconded, the Board approved the following resolution:

**Finance Committee Actions**

Mr. Murray presided over this part of the meeting. Mr. Hogan presented the Strategic Investment Fund item and Colette Sheehy presented the Six Year Plan item.

**Strategic Investment Funds**

Mr. Hogan said the Board of Visitors previously endorsed the University’s investment in the Biocomplexity Institute and Initiative and the Global Genomics and Bioinformatics Research Institute with the understanding that they would be funded using Strategic Investment Fund (SIF) monies. The action item seeks approval for the use of Strategic Investment Fund earnings to support the Biocomplexity Initiative, which includes a hiring package of $30 million to be reimbursed as expenses are incurred. This multi-site initiative will employ the principles of interdisciplinary team science to solve complex and multidimensional problems in medicine and society.

The Global Genomics and Bioinformatics Research Institute is a capital investment of up to $55 million to be made in three installments expected in December 2018, June 2019, and December 2019. The research institute will focus on translational science where scientific discoveries are turned into treatments, drugs, and devices that directly improve patient health. 

On motion duly seconded, the Board approved the following resolution.

**ALLOCATION OF STRATEGIC INVESTMENT FUNDS—THE BIOCOMPLEXITY INSTITUTE AND INITIATIVE AND THE GLOBAL GENOMICS AND BIOINFORMATICS RESEARCH INSTITUTE**

million to be made in three installments expected in December 2018, June 2019, and

December 2019.

RESOLVED, the Board of Visitors authorizes the Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer to use earnings on the Strategic Investment Fund to support the Biocomplexity Institute and Initiative at an amount not to exceed $30 million, and to support the Global Genomics and Bioinformatics Research Institute at an amount not to exceed $55 million; and

RESOLVED FURTHER, the Board delegates signatory authority to the Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer to execute equipment purchases specified in the approved projects that are in excess of the current annual limit ($5 million).

  

**Six-Year Institutional Plans for the Academic Division and Wise**

The Higher Education Opportunity Act requires institutions to develop six-year academic, financial, and enrollment plans in odd-numbered years. Plans are reaffirmed in even-numbered years. Although it is called a six-year plan, there is more detail provided for the first two years. The 2018-24 Six Year Plan was developed last year, so this is an “update” year.

UVA strategies: to make a world-class education affordable; assemble a distinguished, diverse faculty; implement the Quality Enhancement Plan; grow and diversify the research portfolio; enhance the student educational experience; align and optimize resources; and enhance economic development initiatives.

Wise strategies: grow enrollment and enhance student success; increase production of STEM-H Degrees; enhance outreach and economic development efforts; and address economic and demographic changes.

Mr. Murray said approval of this plan **does not** approve tuition and fee increases. The administration will bring forward a proposal for undergraduate and graduate tuition and fees at the December meeting. The budget development process, which lays the groundwork for the tuition proposal, is beginning now. Melody Bianchetto has been working with Alex Cintron, Student Council President, and Brendan Nigro, to increase outreach and engagement with students about the budget development and tuition setting process. A public session with students will provide information on these processes and seek student feedback to help inform the 2019-20 budget and tuition process. This session will be held on the afternoon of September 26 in Newcomb Hall Theater, and another one will be set for November. On motion duly seconded, the Board approved the following resolution.

**AMENDED 2018-2024 SIX-YEAR INSTITUTIONAL PLANS FOR THE ACADEMIC DIVISION AND THE COLLEGE AT WISE**

WHEREAS, the Virginia Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2011, § 23.1-306 of the Code of Virginia, requires the governing boards of all public institutions of higher education to develop and adopt biennially (each odd-numbered year) and amend or affirm annually

(each even-numbered year) institutional six-year plans and submit those plans to the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia (SCHEV), the Governor, and the Chairs of the House Committee on Appropriations, House Committee on Education, Senate Committee on Education and Health, and Senate Committee on Finance; and

WHEREAS, the University submitted its preliminary amended plans for the Academic Division and the College at Wise as required on July 12, 2018, outlining general strategies to advance the priorities of the Commonwealth and to enhance teaching, research, and service consistent with institutional priorities; and

WHEREAS, final amended institutional plans must be approved by the Board of Visitors and submitted to SCHEV, the Governor, and the Chairs of the House Committee on Appropriations, House Committee on Education, Senate Committee on Education and Health, and Senate Committee on Finance no later than December 1;

RESOLVED, the Board of Visitors approves the amended 2018-2024 six-year institutional plans for the Academic Division and the College at Wise; and

RESOLVED FURTHER, the President is authorized to transmit the amended six-year plans as required by § 23.1-306 of the Code of Virginia.

**In-State Tuition Rates for College at Wise**

Ms. Sheehy said that currently Kentucky and Tennessee residents within 50 air miles of the College are eligible for reduced tuition rates in accordance with Va. Code § 23.1-507. The College at Wise would like the University to ask the legislature for an amendment to extend this authority and provide reduced tuition rates for students domiciled within the federally-defined Appalachian Region, which includes parts of 13 states.

For reporting purposes, these students would continue to be classified as out-of-state and would be required to pay the out-of-state capital fee (consistent with current law). Several local legislators seem supportive of this proposal. The Secretary of Education and the Secretary of Health & Human Resources, as well as SCHEV and Department of Planning and Budget staff have been consulted. There was consensus of the Board to move forward with the legislative proposal but an official vote was not taken by the Board. The Board will take this up again in December for an official vote.

**LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL TO AMEND CODE OF VIRGINIA § 23.1-507**

RESOLVED, the Board of Visitors approves and endorses amending the Code of Virginia as it pertains to in-state tuition rates for College at Wise students domiciled within the authorizing federal legislation defining the Appalachian Region.

RESOLVED FURTHER, the proposed amendment to § 23.1-507 of the Code of Virginia is as follows:

§23.1-507 University of Virginia’s College at Wise; reduced rate tuition charges for certain students.

_C. The board of visitors of the University of Virginia may charge reduced rate tuition to any student enrolled at the University of Virginia’s College at Wise who resides in the Appalachian Region, as defined in the Appalachian Regional Commission’s authorizing legislation, is domiciled within the Appalachian Regional Commission region, and is entitled to in-state tuition to a state institution within the Appalachian Region._

**Memorial to Enslaved Laborers**

This was added to the capital plan in June 2016 and the financial plan was approved at $6 million in June 2017. The lowest bid is $7 million total project cost. Ms. Sheehy said they are seeking approval to increase the project budget to $7 million. The design was approved after extensive public outreach and input from the UVA community, alumni, and Charlottesville area residents. On motion duly seconded, the Board approved the following resolution.

**REVISED CAPITAL PROJECT FINANCIAL PLAN: MEMORIAL TO ENSLAVED LABORERS**

WHEREAS, the revised financing plan for the Memorial to Enslaved Laborers calls for the use of gifts in the amount of $7.0 million; and

WHEREAS, the Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer will confirm that appropriate funding is in place before the project commences construction;

RESOLVED, the Board of Visitors approves the financial plan for the Memorial to Enslaved Laborers.

**Comprehensive Health Insurance Plan for Students**

The Board is required to approve the execution of any contract where the amount per year is in excess of $5 million. The University subsidizes the Aetna Student Health plan’s annual premium cost for graduate students who earn at least $5,000 in wages over the course of the fiscal year as teaching or research assistants. Mr. Hogan asked the Board to consider delegating signatory authority to the EVP-COO to execute the current 2018-2019 Student Health Insurance Plan extension and subsequent three annual extensions. On motion duly seconded, the Board approved the following resolution.

**SIGNATORY AUTHORITY FOR CONTRACT TO PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH INSURANCE PLAN FOR STUDENTS ENROLLED AT THE UNIVERSITY IN CHARLOTTESVILLE**

RESOLVED, the Board of Visitors authorizes the Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer to execute current and subsequent contract amendments with Aetna Life Insurance Company, expected to exceed $5 million in University-paid premiums annually, to obtain comprehensive student health insurance for students enrolled at the University in Charlottesville under the existing agreement dated February 13, 2007.

**Amendments to the 2018-2020 Biennial Budget**

The University submits biennial budget operating requests to the Department of Planning and Budget in October for consideration by the Governor for his budget proposal, which is presented to the General Assembly in December. The University’s operating budget requests are developed based on the University’s goals as outlined in the Six-Year Institutional Plan to be submitted to the State. The Academic Division operating budget requests include support for safety and security enhancements, operations and maintenance for new facilities, the state’s share of both the VRS surcharge and the health plan, and educational and training needs for the digital future. The College at Wise’s operating budget requests include support for safety and security enhancements, growth and diversification programs, and a continuation of 2018-2019 support.

On motion duly seconded, the Board approved the following resolution.

**2019 OPERATING AND CAPITAL AMENDMENTS TO THE 2018-2020 BIENNIAL BUDGET**

WHEREAS, the Academic Division and the University of Virginia’s College at Wise have the opportunity to propose budget amendments to the 2018-2020 Biennial Budget for consideration by the Governor; and

WHEREAS, the six-year plans previously approved by the Board of Visitors and submitted to the state by the Academic Division and the College at Wise provide the basis for the proposed amendments;

RESOLVED, the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia approves the proposed amendments to the 2018-20 biennial budget; and

RESOLVED FURTHER, the Board of Visitors understands that to the extent these requests are not included in the Governor’s 2018-20 amended budget, the University may want to pursue similar requests to the General Assembly; and

RESOLVED FURTHER, the President or his designee is authorized to transmit to the General Assembly any request not funded by the Governor as long as there are no material differences from the items endorsed by the Board of Visitors.

**School of Medicine Plastic Surgery Quasi-Endowment**

The School of Medicine’s Raymond Morgan Professorship in Plastic Surgery Quasi-Endowment was established in 1995 from unrestricted sources and is no longer needed to fund the professorship, which is adequately funded from other departmental sources.  Approval is sought to repurpose the quasi-endowment principal to create the Plastic Surgery Department Unrestricted Endowment Fund. 

The new quasi-endowment will provide resources for: 1) the growth and professional development of young faculty in Plastic Surgery, and 2) the recruitment of diverse and innovative faculty to support the clinical and research missions of the Health System. On motion duly seconded, the Board approved the following resolution.

**REPURPOSE AND RENAME SCHOOL OF MEDICINE PLASTIC SURGERY QUASI-ENDOWMENT**

WHEREAS, the School of Medicine’s unrestricted quasi-endowment for the Raymond Morgan Professorship in Plastic Surgery is no longer required to financially support the Raymond Morgan Professorship; and

WHEREAS, the School of Medicine wishes to repurpose and rename the quasi endowment to the Plastic Surgery Department Unrestricted Endowment Fund to provide resources to support young faculty;

RESOLVED, the Board of Visitors authorizes the repurposing and renaming of the School of Medicine quasi-endowment from the Raymond Morgan Professorship in Plastic Surgery to the Plastic Surgery Department Unrestricted Endowment Fund.
