### APPROVAL OF THE MINUTES OF THE MEETING OF FEBRUARY 7-8, 2008

On motion, the Board approved the Minutes of the last meeting of the full Board, held February 7-8, 2008.

### RESOLUTION FOR ADDENDA TO THE AGENDA

After reminding the Board that the *Manual* specifies that consideration of addenda to the published Agenda of a Board meeting must be approved by the Board, the Rector called for a motion to approve the necessary resolution. The motion was moved, seconded, and passed, and the Board adopted the following resolution:

**RESOLVED**, the Board of Visitors approves the consideration of addenda to the published Agenda.

### INTRODUCTION OF THE NEW STUDENT BOARD MEMBER

The Rector introduced Ms. Adom Getachew, the Student Board Member-elect, who was chosen in the last session of the February Board meeting. Ms. Getachew is a third year student in the College from Arlington. She is a Jefferson Scholar, an Echols Scholar, and an honorary Holland Scholar, among a great many other achievements and activities. She will succeed Mr. Mignerey as the Student Member at the conclusion of this Board meeting.

### RESOLUTION COMMENDING CAREY JOSEPH MIGNEREY

The Rector then thanked Mr. Mignerey for his outstanding service on the Board and proposed a resolution of commendation. On motion, the following resolution was approved:

WHEREAS, Carey Joseph Mignerey matriculated in the College in 2000 as a Jefferson Scholar and again in the School of Law in 2006; and

WHEREAS, Mr. Mignerey, as an undergraduate, was elected an Echols Scholar, a member of the Raven Society, a member of Phi Beta Kappa, Sigma Chi and belonged to other organizations too numerous to mention; and

WHEREAS, Mr. Mignerey was Chair of the Honor Committee in 2003-2004; and

WHEREAS, Mr. Mignerey took a B.A. in Government and Foreign Affairs, in the Distinguished Majors Program, in 2004; and

WHEREAS, Mr. Mignerey, after working for McKinsey & Company in Atlanta and in the Middle East, entered the Law School in 2006; and

WHEREAS, Mr. Mignerey was elected the Student Member of the Board in February, 2007; and

WHEREAS, Mr. Mignerey’s term on the Board of Visitors expires on April 12, 2008; and

WHEREAS, Mr. Mignerey’s service on the Board has been exemplary as a Board Member, as an articulate and effective voice of student opinion, and in all ways as an expression of his devotion to the University;

**RESOLVED**, the Board of Visitors thanks Carey Joseph Mignerey for his service, and for his contributions to the Board and to the University as a whole, as well as for his friendship, and wishes him every success as he continues his study of the law.

***

At the Rector’s request, Mr. Sandridge, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, proposed a resolution approving the adoption of the Emergency Operations Plan, devised by the City of Charlottesville, Albemarle County, and the University. Mr. Sandridge explained that the Commonwealth of Virginia Emergency Services Law of 1973 requires that each city and county develop and maintain a plan of this sort.

On motion, the Board adopted the following resolution:

### ADOPTION OF INTEGRATED EMERGENCY OPERATIONS PLAN

WHEREAS, the Board of Visitors and the University of Virginia are concerned with the health, safety, and well-being of members of the University community and desire that the best possible emergency service be available to them; and

WHEREAS, the Commonwealth of Virginia Emergency Services Law of 1973 requires that each city and county develop and maintain an Emergency Operations Plan which addresses its planned response to emergency situations; and

WHEREAS, such a plan has been developed by University staff in coordination with the Virginia Department of Emergency Management with input from local agencies;

**RESOLVED**, the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia does hereby adopt the City of Charlottesville, County of Albemarle, and University of Virginia Integrated Emergency Operations Plan, to include plans and procedures for both peace time and war-caused disasters.

### DISCUSSION OF BOARD MEETING DATES FOR 2009-2010

At the Rector’s request, the Vice Rector, Mr. Wynne, who will become Rector on July 1, 2009, led a discussion of proposed changes in the schedule of Board meetings.

Mr. Wynne proposed first off a schedule of meetings on essentially a quarterly basis – one in September, one in mid-November, one in mid to late February, and one in early June. The Board Retreat, according to this plan, would be attached to a Board meeting – beginning, say, on a Friday afternoon and continuing through Saturday morning, or beginning Saturday morning and running all day.

The 2009 Retreat certainly would be held in conjunction with one of the fall meetings of the Board; the rest of the schedule changes could take effect that fall, depending on Members’ schedules.

Mr. Wynne proposed, too, returning to the schedule of a 1-1/2 – 2 hour session at each Board meeting devoted to discussion of a strategic topic. Also, he advocated going back to the custom of annual reports for committees. He suggested, too, that the Board do a periodic self-evaluation to make sure that it is working on the right things and in the right way; he said 2009-2010 would be the year to do this.

Some adjustments would have to be made to the present schedule of setting tuitions in order that this conform to the proposed meeting schedule, but it would not be an insurmountable problem. The Board Office will check the President’s long-term schedule and poll Members about changing the previously established meeting schedule for 2009.

### SUMMER ORIENTATION

At the Rector’s request, the Secretary spoke briefly about Members’ roles in the summer orientation of incoming undergraduate students. Members for the last several years have participated in the opening of each of the orientation sessions; the participation has consisted of brief remarks to the assembled matriculants and their parents on the importance of the Honor System to the life of the University. It has been a very successful part of orientation.

The Secretary urged Members to volunteer for this summer’s sessions, and he handed around a sign-up roster.

### PRESIDENT’S REPORT

The Rector asked the President to give his customary report.

The President spoke briefly about the General Assembly session which concluded when the Legislature rose on March 13th. April 12th, he said, is the last day for the Governor to take action on legislation sent to him by the General Assembly; the Legislature then will reconvene on April 23rd to consider the Governor’s vetoes and amendments. The General Assembly, also on April 23rd, will consider the capital improvement bond bills.

The President pointed out that because the state budget is not yet final, the undergraduate tuition rates which normally are brought to the Board for approval at the April meeting, will not be set until the budget bill is approved.

He then announced the appointment of Ms. Stewart Gamage as Director of the Morven Institute. Ms. Gamage, a Petersburger who is currently Vice President for Public Affairs at the College of William and Mary, will take up her duties in August. She was Director of the Virginia Liaison Office and Senior Assistant to Governors Robb and Baliles; Policy Director for the former U.S. House Majority Leader, Congressman Gephardt; and Chief Operating Officer of APCO Associates, one of the largest public affairs firms in Washington.

Ms. Gamage will be responsible for the development of programming at Morven.

The Hospital Auxiliary is celebrating its one hundredth anniversary this year – note was taken of this at the recent meeting of the Medical Center Operating Board, and a commemorative resolution was adopted by the General Assembly. The President said a reception honoring the Auxiliary will be held at Carr’s Hill this fall.

### GIFTS AND GRANTS REPORT

The President reported that philanthropic giving to the University and its related foundations this fiscal year (which began on July 1st, 2007) was $204.7million through February 29th. This is $13.9million, or 6.4%, less than giving during the same period last year.

Nonetheless, the Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy, Athletics, the Miller Center, the University Library, and the UVa Fund all report significant increases in giving.

Among significant gifts received since the last meeting of the Board, the President reported a bequest of $1,800,000 from David Allen Mayhugh for research in the School of Medicine; a deferred gift of $1,043,570 from Mrs. A. Stuart Robertson, Jr., for the endowed scholarships in the School of Law; a pledge payment of $1,000,000 from the Smithfield-Luter Foundation for an endowment for the Medical School; a pledge of $5,000,000 from the Claude Moore Charitable Foundation for the Claude Moore Medical Education Building; $2,000,000 from John G. Macfarlane, III to the Darden School Foundation for the Center for Asset Management; $1,000,000 pledged by Richard B. Gilliam, Sr. and Mrs. Leslie F. Gilliam for the Emily Couric Clinical Cancer Center; and a $1,000,000 pledge from Gregory S. Ledford to the McIntire School of Commerce Foundation, to be split between the Davis B. Ledford Faculty Fellowship and the Demong-Pettit Faculty Fellowship.

The Rector called for a resolution accepting the Gifts and Grants Report. The following resolution was proposed and approved:

**RESOLVED**, the Gifts and Grants Report for the period January 1, 2008, through February 29, 2008, is accepted.

***

The meeting of the full Board was recessed at 11:05 a.m. for Committee meetings.

## SESSION ON APRIL 11TH

### EXECUTIVE SESSION

The Board adopted the following motions allowing it to go into Executive Session, at 3:40 p.m.:

That the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia convene in Closed Session for the purpose of discussing and/or approving personnel actions involving the appointment, reappointment, nomination, evaluation, performance, compensation, and resignation of specific University officers and employees, as provided for in Section 2.2-3711 (A) (1) of the Code of Virginia.

That the Board of Visitors convene in Closed Session to consult with General Counsel regarding his privileged legal report to the Board on pending and anticipated litigation affecting the University, and on legal review of policy governing University-related foundations; and to consult further with legal counsel with respect to Code requirements governing conflicts of interests, as provided for in Section 2.2-3711 (A) (7) of the Code of Virginia.

That the Educational Policy Committee of the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia convene in Closed Session to discuss the scholastic performance of specific students and the competency of academic advising provided by specific personnel of the University, as permitted by Section 2.2-3711 (A) (1) and (2) of the Code of Virginia.

That the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia convene in Closed Session to discuss and review with legal counsel the adequacy of the University’s security preparations and planning to protect, deter, and respond to possible threats to public safety on properties near and on the University grounds, as permitted by Section 2.2-3711 (A) (7) and (19) of the Code of Virginia.

That the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia convene in Closed Session to consider and discuss the terms and conditions of a potential gift of funds and film rights, as permitted by Section 2.2-3711 Section 2.2-3711 (A) (8) and (29) of the Code of Virginia.

***

The Board resumed its meeting in Open Session at 5:20 p.m., and adopted the following resolution certifying that its discussions in Executive Session had been conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Virginia Freedom of Information Act:

That we vote on and record our certification that, to the best of each Board member’s knowledge, only public business matters lawfully exempted from open meeting requirements and which were identified in the motion(s) authorizing the closed session, were heard, discussed or considered in closed session.

***

### APPOINTMENT OF SPECIAL COMMITTEES

The Rector announced the appointment of two ad-hoc Committees, one to establish criteria to be used in preparation for choosing successors to retiring senior members of the Administration, and the other to study both the process of the election of the Rector and Vice Rector and their terms of office. The Members of the first Committee are to be Messrs. Wynne, Farrell, and Ligon, the President, and Ms. Gertrude Fraser, Vice Provost for Faculty Advancement. Ms. Dorsey and Messrs. Diamonstein and Mastracco are to be the Members of the second Committee.

### CHANGE IN THE DINNER AT THE JUNE BOARD MEETING

The Rector told the Board that changes in the structure of the dinner at the June Board meeting are advisable. The dinner has for some time been designated as an occasion to which former Members of the Board are invited, but in the last few years, very few former Members have attended. The dinner also is the occasion on which retiring Members are honored for their service on the Board. The Rector observed that the latter aspect of the evening has become the more important and he proposed a resolution approving his decision to change this to the stated purpose of the dinner.

He also charged the ad-hoc Committee which will consider the election and terms of the Rector and the Vice Rector, with considering other events at which former Members can be invited to return.

The following resolution was moved, seconded, and approved:

**RESOLVED**, the Board approves the change in format of the June dinner honoring retiring Members.

***

The Board recessed at 5:30 p.m.

## Session on April 12th

The Board convened, in Open Session, in the Board Room of the Rotunda at 8:35 a.m., Saturday, April 12, 2008, for a training session on the Virginia regulations regarding conflict of interest questions as they affect members of public boards. All Members were present save Messrs. Ligon and Thompson and Dr. Vaughan. The session was conducted by Mr. Forch, the General Counsel, and Mr. Kast, the Associate General Counsel. The session ended at 9:15 a.m.

### FINAL SESSION

The final session of the Board meeting, conducted in Open Session, followed immediately; all Members present for the conflict of interest training were present.

The Board adopted the following resolutions:
