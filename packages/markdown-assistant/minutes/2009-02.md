## Addendum to the Minutes of the February Board Meeting

The Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia met, in Open Session, at 1:10 p.m., Thursday, February 5, 2009, in the Board Room of the Rotunda; W. Heywood Fralin, Rector, presided.

Daniel R. Abramson, A. Macdonald Caputo, The Hon. Alan A. Diamonstein, Ms. Susan Y. Dorsey, Ms. Helen E. Dragas, Thomas F. Farrell, II, Robert D. Hardie, Austin Ligon, Vincent J. Mastracco, Jr., The Hon. Lewis F. Payne, Warren M. Thompson, E. Darracott Vaughan, Jr., M.D., John O. Wynne, and Ms. Adom Getachew were present.

Also present were Edmund W. Kitch, Chair of the Faculty Senate, and Ms. Elaine Gall, University Building Official.

The Rector asked Mr. Caputo to lead the Board in the Pledge of Allegiance. After the Pledge was recited, the Rector asked the Board to observe a moment of silence in memory of Mrs. Elsie Goodwyn Holland (a former Member of the Board of Visitors), Mr. Gilbert J. Sullivan (for many years the Director of the Alumni Association), and Mr. John A. Blackburn (Dean of Undergraduate Admission) – all recently deceased.

## Approval of the Minutes of the Board Meetings of October 2-4, 2008

The Minutes of the Board meeting of October 2-4, were approved.

## Resolution for Additions to the Agenda

RESOLVED, the consideration of addenda to the published Agenda of this meeting of the Board of Visitors is approved.

## University Building Official

At the Rector’s request, Mr. Sandridge, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, introduced Ms. Elaine Gall, the University Building Official. He reminded the Board that the position and Ms. Gall’s responsibilities are defined in the Management Agreement between the Commonwealth and the University, and he emphasized that Ms. Gall reports directly and exclusively to the Board and not to the administration of the University.

## Approval of the University of Virginia Hazard Mitigation Plan

Mr. Sandridge told the Board that the University is required, both by the federal authorities and by the Commonwealth, to have a Hazard Mitigation Plan. Such a Plan has been devised, but it now must be approved by the Board. He proposed the following resolution which the Board, on motion, adopted:

### APPROVAL OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN

WHEREAS, the University of Virginia strives to recognize and mitigate any potential natural and human-caused hazards to the health, safety, and well-being of members of the University community; and

WHEREAS, the Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 as amended, and 44 C.F.R. 201.6, require that local governments develop and adopt hazard mitigation plans in order to receive certain federal assistance; and

WHEREAS, as a sub-grantee of the Virginia Department of Emergency Management, the University of Virginia Disaster Resistant University Advisory Committee together with an experienced consulting firm, and in consultation with members of the public, private, and non-profit sectors has completed such a Hazard Mitigation Plan for the University;

RESOLVED, the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia approves the University of Virginia Hazard Mitigation Plan dated November 2008.

## Comments by the Rector

The Rector reported that Mr. Sweeney, the Senior Vice President for Development and Public Affairs, has undergone several very serious operations in the last week but is recovering well and should be released from the hospital shortly.

## President’s Report

The Rector asked the President to make his customary report.

The President briefed the Board on matters of interest before the General Assembly in the current Session. He said debates about in-state enrollment have been particularly intense this year and that many of the “facts” asserted about enrollments at this Session have been patently wrong.

Several bills to regulate out-of-state enrollment were introduced, but the University has just learned that they will not be heard by the relevant subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee. The Budget bill now becomes the vehicle for this issue, the President said, but the University is working with members of the General Assembly who are engaged with this question.

## New Appointments

The President spoke about Harry Harding, who was announced last week as the founding dean of the new Batten School for Leadership and Public; Mr. Harding will begin his term as dean on July 1st. One of the nation’s foremost experts on Southeast Asia, particularly China, he has served for ten years as the dean of the Elliott School of International Affairs at George Washington University. Before that he was a Senior Fellow in the Foreign Policy Studies Program at the Brookings Institution, a member of the political science faculties of Stanford University and Swarthmore College, and director of the Asia Program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.

Greg Roberts, who has been Senior Associate Dean of Undergraduate Admission since 2008, has just been named Dean, *vice* the late John A. Blackburn. Mr. Roberts joined the Admission Office in 2003 as an associate dean. Prior to that, he was Associate Director of Undergraduate Admission at Georgetown University.

The President also reported that Bruce Ambler Boucher has been named as the new Director of the University Art Museum. Mr. Boucher has been curator of European sculpture at the Art Institute of Chicago while teaching at the University of Chicago. Previously, he was an art history professor at University College, London, for 24 years.

## AAU-AGB Meeting

The President announced that presidents, chancellors, and trustees from several AAU (Association of American Universities) Institutions will be at the University February 26-27 for an AAU-AGB (Association of Governing Boards) meeting. Participants will include representatives of the Universities of Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Minnesota and Rochester, as well as the University of California at Los Angeles and Pennsylvania State University.

The meeting, organized under the theme “Crossroads: Leading and Governing America’s Research Universities,” is envisioned as a candid discussion of university leadership and governance issues. The President said the Vice Rector and Mr. Ligon – in the absence of the Rector, who cannot come, will participate in the meeting. He invited other Members to participate.

## Gifts and Grants Report

The President reported that philanthropic giving to the University and its related foundations in the current Fiscal Year, through December 31, 2008, amounted to $156,359,398.40, an increase of 11.18% over the previous Fiscal Year. Much of this, he said, was received toward the end of the year.

Among significant gifts since the October Board meeting were a Batten Foundation pledge payment of $40,000,000 to the Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy; a Gates Foundation private grant of $6,820,437 to the School of Medicine for its “Study of Risk Factors for Malnutrition using Molecular and Genomic Tools;” a pledge payment and gifts of $6,738,955 from Paul Tudor Jones II and Mrs. Sonia Klein Jones toward several areas of the University including the John Paul Jones Arena, Jefferson Scholars, and Environmental Sciences; $4,740,000 from the Estate of Gertrude S. Greenslade to the College and Graduate School of Arts and Sciences; and a private grant of $2,113,551 from the Lilly Endowment to the Religious Studies Department for “The Project on Lived Theology.”

Among significant new pledges were $3,100,000 from the Focused Ultrasound Surgery Foundation for the Focused Ultrasound Facility Fund; $1,000,000 from Frederick P. Hitz and Mrs. Mary Buford Bocock Hitz for the Batten School of Leadership; a pledge of $500,000 from the Hobby Family Foundation for the John A. Blackburn AccessUVa Endowed Scholarship and other areas of the University; and a $500,000 pledge from Paul Tudor Jones II for Jefferson Scholars.

The Rector asked for a motion approving the President’s Gifts and Grants Report. The motion was made and approved and the Report accepted.

The Preliminary Meeting ended at 1:45 p.m., and the Board recessed as the full Board to go into Committee meetings.

## Friday, February 6th

The Board resumed meeting as the full Board after lunch on Friday, February 6th.

### Executive Session

After adopting the following motions permitting it to do so – under the terms of the Virginia Freedom of Information Act – the Board went into Executive Session at 1:15 p.m.

All Members of the Board, save Mr. Pippin, were present.

1. That the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia convene in Closed Session for the purpose of discussing and/or approving personnel actions involving the appointment, reappointment, transition, nomination, evaluation, performance, compensation, and resignation of specific University officers and employees as provided for in Section 2.2-3711 (A) (1) of the Code of Virginia.

2. That the Board of Visitors convene in Closed Session to consult with General Counsel regarding his privileged legal report to the Board on pending and anticipated litigation affecting the University, as provided for in Section 2.2-3711 (A) (7) of the Code of Virginia.

3. That the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia convene in Executive Session to consider the appointment of a specific student member to the Board of Visitors, in accordance with Section 2.2-3711 (A)(1) of the Code of Virginia.

4. That the Board of Visitors go into Closed Session to consider and discuss investing in new educational modules where competition is involved and in connection therewith assessing the performance and leadership capability of specific University personnel, where discussion in public session at this time would be detrimental to the University’s financial interests, as permitted by Section 2.2-3711 (A) (1) and (6) of the Code of Virginia.

The Board resumed its meeting in Open Session at 2:35 p.m., and adopted the following resolution certifying that its deliberations in Executive Session had been conducted in accordance with the exemptions permitted by the Virginia Freedom of Information Act:

That we vote on and record our certification that, to the best of each Board member’s knowledge, only public business matters lawfully exempted from open meeting requirements and which were identified in the motion(s) authorizing the closed session, were heard, discussed or considered in closed session.

## Report of the Diamonstein Committee: On the Election of the Rector

The Rector reminded the Board that at the April Board meeting, he had appointed an ad-hoc committee, chaired by Mr. Diamonstein, to consider possible changes in the procedure for electing the Vice Rector, and thus the Rector. He asked Mr. Diamonstein to report on the Committee’s recommendations.

Mr. Diamonstein said his Committee had polled the Board and based on that, have decided to recommend no changes, either in the electoral process or in the terms of office of the Rector and the Vice Rector. The Committee, however, does feel strongly that there should be no electioneering on the part of candidates more than thirty days before the election meeting.

## Report of the Diamonstein Committee: On the Recognition of Former Members of the Board

The second charge to the Diamonstein Committee, the Rector said, was to find a suitable occasion on which former Board Members might be invited to return to the University to be honored by the Board (the provision of the Manual calling for an annual social occasion involving current and former Members has been struck from the Manual). Mr. Diamonstein told the Board that his Committee recommends that an occasion such as an athletic event be used for this purpose. He and the Rector suggested that the Secretary and the Secretary-elect consider possibilities and make a recommendation to the Board.

The Rector accepted the Committee’s recommendations.

## Final Session

All Members, save Mr. Pippin and Dr. Vaughan, were present for the Final Session.

The Board approved the following resolutions:

### II. Phase I Review Procedures

**A. Standard First Level of Phase I Review**

1. **Bring complaint to Director of Human Resources.** Complainants are encouraged to discuss their grievances in person with those able to resolve them before the procedure described in this document is initiated. If the complainants are not comfortable discussing their grievances directly with each other, they can request the assistance of a third party mediator to informally discuss their grievances in an effort to resolve them before the procedure described in this document is initiated. The mediator can be assigned by the Director of Human Resources or the Chancellor. This procedure is not intended as a substitute for such discussions, but rather as an additional means of resolving disputes.

2. **If the dispute cannot be resolved through informal discussion, the complainant must initiate a review by providing their immediate supervisor, within ten calendar days of the event which is the basis for the complaint, a written statement describing both the nature of the complaint and the relief requested.** Failure to timely provide the written statement shall preclude proceeding under this grievance procedure unless the Chancellor may rule otherwise finding good cause to proceed and that the failure to timely provide the written statement is not attributable to the fault of the complainant. The complainant and the supervisor should attempt to resolve the complaint informally during the supervisor’s following five workdays.

3. **Within ten workdays after receipt of the complainant’s written statement, the complainant's immediate supervisor shall provide to the complainant a written response to the statement.** The response shall state the supervisor's decision and the supporting reasons.

**B. Anonymous First Level Review Option**

1. **For complaints of harassment or discrimination, instead of proceeding as stated in above, the complainant may initiate this Anonymous Review within ten calendar days after the event which is the basis for the complaint.** The complainant must request in writing, that the Chancellor review the complaint directly. The Chancellor may designate an appropriate individual to conduct the review who shall not be the immediate supervisor of the complainant or otherwise the subject of the complaint. The anonymity of the complainant shall be respected to the extent practicable except as may be required by law or necessary in connection with the investigation.

2. **The designate shall take such steps as the designate and the complainant deem appropriate to attempt to resolve the complaint without the need for disciplinary action or further use of this procedure.**

3. **The complainant may terminate the Anonymous Review at any time upon informing the designate in writing or by initiating a complaint as described in Section II.A in a timely manner.**

**C. Second Level of Phase I Review**

1. **If the immediate supervisor's response from the First Level Review does not resolve the complaint to the complainant's satisfaction, the complainant may advance the complaint to the Second Level Review.**

2. **Within five days of receipt of the immediate supervisor's response, a written statement describing the complaint and the relief requested must be submitted to the Director of Human Resources, with copy to the immediate supervisor and the head of the department (or appropriate vice chancellor as provided in the next paragraph).**

3. **A Second Level reviewer shall be the head of the complainant's department or, if the head was the First Level reviewer, the appropriate vice chancellor or other person reporting to the Chancellor or, if such person was the First Level reviewer, the Chancellor or his or her designee.**

4. **The Second Level reviewer shall schedule a meeting with the complainant to be held within five workdays (of the Second Level reviewer) after receipt of the complainant's statement.** The Second Level reviewer shall also gather such additional information concerning the complaint as he or she deems appropriate.

5. **Within ten workdays after meeting with the complainant, the Second Level reviewer shall provide the complainant a written response to the complaint, with a copy to the Chancellor.** The response shall state the reviewer's decision and the supporting reasons.

### III. Request for Further Investigation Phase II or Hearing Phase III Reviews

1. **Further Investigation Phase II**
   1. If the Second Level reviewer's response does not resolve the complaint to the complainant's satisfaction, the complainant may request the Chancellor to qualify the complaint either for Further Investigation Phase II or Hearing Phase III. Such a request must be submitted to the Chancellor in writing, with a copy to the First and Second Level reviewers, within ten calendar days after the complainant's receipt of the Second Level reviewer's response. The request to the Chancellor must be timely as above provided and include the complainant's statement of the complaint, the relief requested, the facts the complainant claims support the complaint, and an explanation of why the complainant believes the complaint should be reviewed by a Further Investigation Phase II or Hearing Phase III review. Failure to comply with the foregoing shall preclude further proceedings hereunder, unless the Chancellor directs otherwise for good cause.

   2. If Further Investigation Phase II is ordered, the Chancellor shall designate an investigator, who shall not be under the authority of the previous reviewers or report to the immediate supervisor.

2. **Hearing Phase III Review**
   1. A Hearing Phase III Review shall be ordered if the Chancellor determines after consultation with counsel that a procedural due process hearing is legally required or would be in the College's best interest.

   2. If a Hearing Phase III is ordered, the Chancellor shall provide a copy of the decision to the chair of the Administrative and Professional General Faculty Hearing Committee and shall include in the decision a determination of which party shall have the burden of proof on which issues. Such decision is not grievable. In the case of disciplinary action against the complainant, management shall have the burden of proving that its action was a reasonable exercise of discretion.
