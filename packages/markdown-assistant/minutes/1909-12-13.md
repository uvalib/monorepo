At a called meeting of the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia at 2:00 o'clock P. M., on above date, in the President's Office,

**Present:** The Rector, and Visitors Craddock, Harmon, Shackelford, Irvine, Drewry, and Flood,

The Board having been called to order by the Rector, the following was adopted:-

Resolved: That the resignation of Dr. Carl Ridge Meloy, Adjunct Professor of Pathology, be accepted with regret and with expressions of appreciation of his ability and faithfulness.

In view of the purpose of Dr. C. W. Kent not to stand for re-nomination at the expiration of his term of office as a member of the State Board of Education, the Rector and Visitors desire to place on record their appreciation of the very high quality of service he has rendered in that office, and to express their gratitude to him for his valuable work for public education in Virginia.

Resolved: That Dr. James Morris Page be nominated by the Rector and Visitors to the General Assembly for election to membership upon the State Board of Education for the term beginning.

Resolved: That the sum of $54.00 be appropriated for the printing of a monograph of Thomas Jefferson, by Professor William M. Thornton.

Resolved: That the sum of $50.00 be appropriated to the Department of Pharmacology for equipment and apparatus.

Resolved: That a student assistant be granted to Dr. J. C. Flippin in the laboratory of Clinical Diagnosis.

Resolved: That the salary of Miss M. J. Hurdley, Superintendent of the Hospital, be increased from $65.00 to $75.00 per month, from October 1, 1909.

Resolved: That Messrs. Harmon, Shackelford and Moon be appointed a Committee to confer with the authorities of Charlottesville, with regard to the water situation, with authority to said committee to act on behalf of the University Corporation.

Resolved, further: That the report of Mr. John B. Moon, counsel for the University in regard to the contracts between the University and the City of Charlottesville, in relation to water supply, be received and spread on the minutes; and that, in the event the above named Committee be unable to come to a satisfactory agreement with the authorities of Charlottesville, then, that Mr. Moon, as Counsel for the University, with the advice and concurrence of said Committee, be authorized and directed to take such legal steps as he may deem necessary to protect and enforce the rights of the University in the premises.

Resolved: That the Report of the Committee on University Commons be received and adopted and spread on the minutes; and that the Board suggests to the Committee, in addition to the scheme suggested in the report, that the Committee consider the feasibility of assigning certain rooms within the University to be occupied by students, who shall, while occupying said rooms, board at the Commons.

The Report follows:

Your Committee on Commons Hall begs to submit the following report covering the operations of Commons from the inauguration of this enterprise on September 1, 1908 to December 1, 1909, together with plans for balance of the current session.

The financial statement furnished by the Bursar for session 1908-1909, exclusive of Summer School, which is a separate account, shows:

The number of students served during session 1908-1909 is as follows:\
September, 222;\
October, 220;\
November, 210;\
December, 184;\
January, 180;\
February, 161;\
March, 144;\
April, 120;\
May, 97;\
June, 51;\
making a total of 1589. The average number served per month was 159. The average cost of food supplied per man was $12.20 per month. The average cost for service per man was $5.20 per month.

Using the figures above and estimating on the basis of an average attendance of 200 men, it follows:

We believe this statement justifies the Committee's early contention that an average attendance of 200 from a total registration of 785 in the University would guarantee the financial success of Commons.

Your Committee believed our students were divided financially into two classes: 1. Those to whom $15.00 per month charged for table board at Commons was burdensome, possibly preventing their return to the University; and 2. those who desired and could afford a better board than $15.00 per month could possibly furnish. Acting on this belief we decided that Commons could better serve the paramount purpose for which it was established, and at the same time attract a larger number of students, if we changed our plan of boarding from a fixed ménu giving three meat meals a day at $15.00 per month, to the combination plan which has worked so successfully at Harvard University. The combination plan consists of a fixed ménu with only one meat meal a day, and a list of extras giving wide range of selection, from which orders are taken at the student's wish. The fixed ménu with one meat meal a day furnishes all that is necessary for good health and growth, while the "extra card" permits the indulgence of a more elaborate taste. The fixed ménu is purchased by meal tickets at $12.50 per month, while the extras are paid for with coupons, the charge being only sufficient to cover cost of food supplied, plus the necessary addition for its preparation and service. This combination plan was inaugurated at the beginning of the present session, and by popular vote taken on October 21, resulting in 102 for and 38 against, it is con- tinued at present.

The Bursar's financial statement for this session, from September to November inclusive, is as follows:

The total number of students served during three months of present session are as follows:\
September, 183;\
October, 129;\
November, 136;\
making a total of 448. The average number served per month is 149. This does not take into account the foot-ball men for whom special arrangements were made. The greater monthly deficit this session when compared with the same months last session, is in our opinion directly due to the decreased attendance, and not to the change in our plan of boarding. The Store-keeper's books show this year's plan slightly more economical than last year's plan.

On November 1, 1909, Mr. H. C. Bardin tendered his voluntary resignation as Manager of Commons, to be effective December 31, 1909. His reason for leaving the service, as stated in his letter of resignation, was plain discouragement because of his inability to make Commons a financial success. In discussing his successor the Committee decided that the employment of a woman would both reduce the cost of operation and perhaps attract a larger number of students. Accordingly we have engaged the services of Mrs. Virginia T. Bell of Staunton, Va., who will assume the duties of manager on January 1, 1910. Mrs. Bell is at present manager and cateress for the Van Dyke League House in Lynchburg, Va., and was formerly for several years cateress for an institution similar to our own connected with a school for girls in Washington, D. C. By her employment we will save in salaries at least $100.00 per month; but this saving will not enable us to meet expenses; and a deficit of not less than $2000.00 for the remaining six months of this session must be expected unless the number of boarders can be greatly increased.

In seeking to find the reasons for our small attendance at Commons, we have discovered the following fact which is given here for your information and serious thought. The cheapest dormitory rates in the University plus the cheapest board at Commons is in excess of the combined cost of room and board at the cheapest student boarding houses in town. This is because of our comparatively high dormitory rates. It means that the poorer students are forced, because of our higher room rents, to live outside the University grounds. To them, Commons is not easily accessible, and in most cases impossible, because almost all of these landladies compel their roomers to take meals with them. It follows that those rooms most accessible to Commons, namely the University dormitories, are filled with students who can afford and desire more expensive board. Thus Commons, falling as it has between the two stools, cannot hope to have a full attendance unless the present dormitory rates are lowered.

To improve conditions, we suggest the following changes:

1. Offer rooms in the Randall Building to students at one-half their present price, on condition that the occupants perform their own janitor services, and on further condition that they board at Commons.

2. Increase all other Dormitory rates in the University by 15%, and offer a reduction of 25% from these new rates to all students who board at Commons.

Permit our first suggestion to become an established fact, and you enable students to combine board at Commons with rooms in the University at less expense than the cost of cheapest outside room and board.

Act favorably on the second suggestion, and provided half these men eat at Commons, our attendance will have been increased and the University will receive as much revenue from the dormitories as at present.

As a matter of further information we beg to report that the Committee inaugurated at the beginning of this session the student-waiter system. We were unable to obtain more than one half the number of students necessary for this service, and as it was impossible to piece them out the plan was abandoned after a two weeks' trial. We hope the plan will be tried again next session, and we believe that by earlier advertisement, it will have a fair chance of success.

Resolved: That the request of the Park Place Corporation that the University level up and improve the lot east of the Hospital, belonging to the University, be acceded to, at a cost not to exceed $100.00, with permission to said Park Place Corporation, to open a street through said lot, and lay granolithic walks, as requested, subject to the approval of the Superintendent of Grounds and Buildings.—;—;

—;—;Mr. Harmon not voting on this resolution.

Resolved: That the President be authorized to make a contract by March 1, 1910, with some competent expert, for the inauguration of a modern system of accounting at the University.

Resolved: That the application of Dr. Theodore Hough for a lease for 50 years of two acres of land on the McCormick Road, East of and adjoining the property leased to Dr. R. H. Whitehead, be approved; the lease to be in the form and upon the same condition and same consideration, heretofore prescribed; and the Rector is hereby authorized to execute such deed of lease when prepared by the Counsel of the University in the name and behalf of the Rector and Visitors of the University.

Resolved: That the letter of Spencer Cornick be referred to Mr. John B. Moon, Counsel of the University, for investigation and report.

Resolved: That the petition of the Golf Club of the University be granted, and the golf-course be rented to them at a nominal rental equivalent to the sum now received from the lessees.

Resolved: That the petition of I. K. Moran be granted; and that the resolution, adopted by this Board December 2, 1907, with reference to lease to Professors, of residence building-sites on University ground, be and is hereby amended so as to include Executive Officers of the University, under the same rules and terms.

Resolved: That the President be requested to express to Mr. Charles R. Crane, the thanks of the Rector and Visitors of the University, for his generous gift.

Resolved: That Mr. John B. Moon, Counsel for the University, be authorized to confer with a committee consisting of the President, the Rector, and Mr. Harmon, with regard to the codification into one statute of the State laws of the —;University—;with authority to said counsel and committee, to procure the proper legislation in regard thereto.

Resolved: That the Bursar be directed to turn over to Mr. W. B. Thomas of Norfolk, Va., the two old watches, BK pin, some plated silverware, and a family Bible, belonging to the estate of the late E. W. James, in response to the application of Mr. Thomas for the same.

Resolved: That the Annual Report of the President for the year ending July 1, 1909, to the Board, and of the Rector to the Superintendent of Public Instruction for the same year, which have been forwarded to the last named official as the "Annual Report of the Rector and Visitors" be approved and adopted.

Resolved: That the Finance Committee be requested to invest the sum of $2,775.62 reported by the Bursar as being in bank, uninvested.

Resolved: That the report of the Finance Committee regarding the re-investment of securities of the E. W. James Estate, be accepted and approved, and the Secretary directed to file same with the papers relating to the James Estate.

On motion, the Board adjourned, subject to the call of the Rector.
