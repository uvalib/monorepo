At the annual meeting of the Rector and Visitors held at the University on the 25th day of June 1888.

Present. Hon. J. L. Marye, Rector, and Messrs Randolph, Stuart and Noland, of the Old members, and Hon. Wm H. Bolling of Wythe County and Mason Gordon, Esq of Albemarle County, of the new members.

The Rector called the Board to order.

Since the last meeting of the Board the Governor appointed four new Visitors, viz, the said Messrs, Bolling and Gordon, W. Gordon McCabe, Esqr of Petersburg and Hon. Legh R. Watts of Portsmouth, which appointments were ratified by the Senate and the appointees commissioned by the Governor, to fill the places of Messrs Martin, Venable, Parrish and Perkins, whose terms expired on the 28th of February last.

Messrs Bolling, Gordon and Watts, previous to this meeting, filed with the Secretary of the Board official certificates, certifying that they had each taken and subscribed to the oaths of office required by law to be taken by them as such Visitors.

The Rector appointed the standing Committees of the Board, as follows:

* Finance, Miller & Observatory Funds: Messrs Conrad, Randolph, Stuart & Gordon.
* Grounds, Buildings & Boarding Houses: Messrs Stuart, Noland & Bolling.
* Library & Apparatus: Messrs Watts, McCabe & Gordon.
* Conduct of Schools & Examination of Students: Messrs Randolph, McCabe & Watts.
* Infirmary, Health, Sewerage & Drainage: Messrs Noland, Bolling & Stuart.

A telegram was received from Judge Watts stating that he was prevented from attending the meeting by the illness of a member of his family.

The Executive Committee submitted its report which was read and considered, and on motion it was resolved, that the same be received, approved and adopted, together with its recommendations, and that it be spread upon the records of the Board.

**University of Va**

**June 23d 1888.**

To the Rector & Visitors of the University of Va.

Gentlemen,

Your Committee at its meeting in October last acting under the recommendation of the Faculty and the Proctor, after thorough investigation, authorized the building of the Dawson Row Mess Hall at a cost not to exceed fifteen hundred dollars, of which sum the three hundred dollars appropriated by the Board to erecting two wooden kitchens, one on Dawson's Row and the other on Carr's Hill, was to constitute a part. The reasons for such change in and increase of your appropriation, was so fully discussed at your meeting in January as to render it unnecessary to go into it again.

The Board at its meeting in June having neglected to provide for the teaching of Zoology in its resolution assigning such subjects as had been taught in the School of Agriculture to the other schools, your Committee directed Profr Fontaine of the School of Natural History and Geology to organize and take charge of a class of such students as might desire instruction in that subject.

Acting under the authority conveyed to them by your resolution of June 27th 1887 in regard to the "Commutation of the Austin Legacy", your Committee requested the Rector to visit the Executor and Legatees, and directed the Proctor to pay his expenses. This was reported to your Board at its January meeting.

The Professor of Medical Jurisprudence, Obstetrics and the Practice of Medicine having urged the necessity to his School of tuition in Microscopy and having stated that he had not applied to the Board for the money to purchase Microscopes because of the University finances, applied for authority to expend one hundred & twenty five dollars for that purpose. His application was endorsed favorably by the Faculty.

The increase in the numbers at the University during the past year was one almost entirely to the Medical School; in view of that fact your committee deemed it proper and well for them to authorize such expenditure.

Profr J. W. Mallet was requested to take the supervision of the Agricultural Course of such students as desired instruction in that subject.

The Board at its last meeting having authorized the election by the Executive Committee of a Secretary, the committee unanimously elected Mr James D. Jones to that position.

At the meeting of your Committee April 16 the Chairman of the Faculty forwarded a petition of certain citizens of Charlottesville and its vicinity endorsed favorably by the Faculty requesting that the use be given to the State Normal Institute of the lecture rooms and such other facilities as are practicable and may be consistent with the privileges already granted, provided they decided to hold their annual meeting in Charlottesville.

Your Committee gave permission, subject however to the decision that the Board might come to as to the advisability of permitting the dormitories on the Lawns & Ranges to be occupied during the summer.

The Board informally requested the Committee to ascertain the views of the University Board of Health as to the advisability of the occupation of the dormitories on the lawn & ranges during the summer:

Dr Cabell's reply is herewith submitted & reads as follows:

In reply to your communication of the 11th inst received last evening I have to inform you that the same has been submitted to the several members constituting the Health Board of the University and that I have been authorized to submit the following statement.

The question as to the possibly sanitary results of the occupation of dormitories by summer Students may be considered under the aspects, that of the danger of the importation of disease from without and that of its spontaneous development in appartements occupied by persons who do not observe proper care in maintaining their proper sanitary condition.

With reference to the former it is obvious, of course, that there is precisely the same kind of risk which exists during the regular session in a greater degree because of the larger number of regular students. But it may be added that the experience of many years seems to show that the risk is not great. Such facts as you referred to in your letter have never occurred since the establishment of the summer schools until this year. It is not easy therefore to estimate the chances of their recurrence in any future year.

The question submitted by you has, however, another aspect, that namely of the likelihood of a spontaneous outbreak of disease among the summer students or among those who may succeed them owing to a continuous occupation of the dormitories without sufficient intervals for disinfection and thorough removal of accumulated filth. With reference to this view of the question we venture to say that the danger may be very largely, perhaps wholly, removed by restricting the privilege of the occupation of the dormitories to the localities of Dawson Row and Carr's Hill and to the interval of time between the 15th July and 12th September, provided, however, that the most scrupulous care be taken to secure a thorough and universal cleanliness and disinfection for two weeks before and after their occupation by the summer students.

We take occasion to remark that the sanitary police of the dormitories & of the grounds & buildings of the University has seldom or never been as searching and as effective as the exigencies probably call for. There ought to be a frequent room to room inspection during the session and during the summer when the rooms are occupied, with a constant vigilance against the many forms in which dirt may disguise itself both inside the rooms and immediately around the buildings. With such measures faithfully carried out we are of opinion that there would not be any very serious objection to the occupation during the middle portion of the vacation of the dormitories which have been specified. Very respectfully your obt sert etc.

The Proctor requested that the Executive Committee should interpret for his guidance the law of the University that requires of each occupant of a pavilion "to keep them in repair, internally and externally, so far as doors and windows are concerned." Your Committee passed the following resolution:

"Resolved, that the law requiring occupants of pavilions in the University to keep them in repair internally, and externally so far as doors and windows are concerned, is interpreted to mean, that all doors, door frames, window frames, sash, blinds and fastings, shall be kept in good order and fully protected by paint."

Your Committee advise that you add to this, that the Proctor & Superintendent of Grounds & Buildings shall be the Judge of the necessity of repairs and his notification as to what repairs are needed shall be binding on the occupant.

We advise the following references to standing Committees:

In conclusion Your Committee take pleasure in congratulating the Board upon the increased numbers in its professional Schools and to Express the hope that the Academical Schools will show greater increase in the coming year.

The Board met pursuant to adjournment on yesterday.

Present. The same members as on yesterday.

Resolved, that, a Committee of three be appointed to wait upon Professor Venable, and to express the regrets of this Board, at his resignation of the Chairmanship of the Faculty, and to ask him to reconsider his resignation, or declination, of reappointment, with the assurance that any clerical help which he may desire will be furnished by this Board.

The Rector appointed Messrs Randolph, Gordon & Bolling the Committee under the foregoing resolution.

Messrs Conrad and McCabe appeared and took their seats as members of the Board, the latter after having presented an official certificate of his having taken the oaths of office required by law, which certificate was placed on file by the Secretary.

The Committee on Grounds, Buildings and Boarding Houses submitted their report of which the following is a copy.

To the Rector & Visitors of the University of Va.

The Committee on Grounds, Buildings and Boarding Houses having examined the Reports of the Faculty, the Executive Committee, and the Proctor, and having taken a general survey of the grounds and buildings, beg leave to report:

1. That the premises are in fair condition, quite as good in the main, as the resources of the University will justify.

2. Your Committee approves the appropriation of $1100. to complete the first and second stories of the main medical building.

3. A dining room for messing students on Carr's Hill should be erected, and a resolution appropriating $1500. therefore is recommended.

4. The Committee highly commend the action of the Faculty in contracting for the lighting of the buildings and grounds of the University by Electricity. The Committee regard the change from gas to the electric light as very important, as a matter of comfort, economy and fty. They therefore offer the accompanying resolution, providing for a continuance of the contract for the ensuing year.

The Committee further recommend that the proctor take immediate steps to obtain the consent in writing of all Insurance Companies having policies on the University property, to the introduction or continuance of electric lighting at the University.

The Committee further recommend that all students be advised to use the electric light in their rooms, instead of gas or oil, provided the electric light can be supplied them as cheaply.

5. Your Committee recommend the small appropriation of $100. asked for for the improvement of Squibbs Gymnasium, to be used, if the Faculty find it necessary.

6. The recommendation of the Faculty respecting the extension of the Old Reservoir main from its present terminous at Dawson's Row, to the building in rear of the Rotunda is approved, & the work should be done as soon as the income of the University will justify the outlay. In this connection this Committee desire to enter their protest against the running of the steam engine now supplying power to the Physical Laboratory, by the Janitor who is said not to be an Engineer. A serious accident might result, if this arrangement is allowed to continue.

7. The sale of the Steam Boiler and Pump recommended by the Faculty is approved by the Committee, provided a great sacrifice can be avoided.

8. On the suggestion of the Faculty, Your Committee recommend that the gas used for heating purposes in the Chemical Laboratory and the Physical Laboratory, be paid for out of the appropriation for fuel and lights.

9. The recommendation of the Faculty that the University furnish to the Professor of Biology hereafter to be appointed, a residence in lieu of that erected at the expense of the Miller trust, is approved by your Committee.

10. Numerously signed petitions in favor of reopening to the public, the road leading through the Base Ball grounds to Dawson's Row, and maintaining a gate thereon, were laid before Your Committee, & are herewith presented. The request seems a reasonable one, but the Committee at present refrain from making a recommendation in regard thereto.

The foregoing report was read and considered, and on motion the same was approved and adopted, together with its recommendations, with the exception of the 10th Section of the report which refers to reopening the road through the Base Ball grounds to Dawsons Row for the use of the public, which is reserved for future consideration.

The Committee on the Infirmary, Health, Sewerage and Drainage submitted their report of which the following is a copy:

To the Rector & Visitors of the University of Virginia. Gentlemen.

Your Committee beg leave to report that they have learned with much pleasure of the excellent health of the students and residents generally, of the University during the session just closing; and have noted with great satisfaction the improved sanitary condition of the buildings & grounds, all of which they believe is directly due to the wise recommendation of the Board heretofore made & the prompt & efficient manner in which those recommendations have been executed.

With the abundant supply of pure water, the good sewerage & drainage, the efficient police of the grounds, and the well equipped Infirmary we now have, Your Committee think disease need not hereafter be feared. Certainly it seems now, that vigilance on the part of the Board of Health with full authority from this Board to have their orders executed, is all that is necessary to secure the perfect health of the University.

In this connection Your Committee would submit to the Board the letter from the Chairman of the Board of Health on the subject of the occupation of the Dormitories by summer students, & would recommend that his wise suggestions be adopted. \[See p. 122 \[105] where this letter appears as part of the report of the Executive Commee], and to effect this they recommend the adoption by this Board of the following resolution, viz,

Whereas in in opinion of this Board the continuous occupation of the Dormitories, without sufficient intervals for disinfecting & removal of accumulated filth therefrom, is for various reasons most objectionable, and whereas the Board is nevertheless desirous of offering every accommodation to the summer Students, consistent with a due regard for the sanitary condition of the University. Therefore Resolved, that the privilege heretofore extended to the Summer Students of occupying the Dormitories of the University be hereafter limited to the Dormitories, A. B. C. & D. of Dawson's Row and the Dormitories on Carr's Hill, from the 15th of July to the 15th of September, upon the terms heretofore prescribed for the Dormitories generally. And upon the further terms that the said Dormitories be at all times during the summer session subject to the inspection of the Proctor, whose orders in regard to keeping the same in a cleanly condition, at the expense of the occupant, shall be strictly complied with.

In reference to the report of the Medical officers of the Infirmary made to the Board of Visitors & referred to this Committee, they deem it only necessary to recommend that it be approved, and that in accordance with the suggestions therein made it be ordered that the deficiency of $63.88 be made good to the Medical Officers out of any surplus receipts of the next Session.

All of which is respectfully submitted

**B. P. Noland**

**W. A. Stuart**

**W. H. Bolling.**

The foregoing report was read to the Board, and after consideration, the same, together with its recommendations, was approved and adopted.

On motion the Board adjourned to meet tomorrow at 9 A. M.

**Jas D. Jones, Secretary.**

**Jno. L Marye Rector**

**University of Va, June 27th 1888.**

The Board met in pursuance of adjournment on yesterday.

Present The same members as on yesterday.

Resolved, that the present occupants of the Boarding houses, be allowed to continue in possession for the ensuing year, upon the same terms as last year.

Resolved, that the Executive Committee be empowered and requested to contract for the continued lighting during the ensuing year of the University Buildings & Grounds by Electricity.

Resolved, that the report of the Committee on the Library & Apparatus, be postponed until the meeting in July.

The Committee on the Conduct of Schools and examination of Students submitted their report of which the following is a copy.

Your Committee beg leave to report:

1. Report from Schools.

A close examination of these reports shows the usual faithful discharge of duty on the part of each Professor and an unusual amount of diligence on the part of the students of the various classes.

2. Local Examinations

These seem to be doing good work. There were 30 candidates of which 24 were successful during the past year.

Your Committee advise that the Faculty be requested to hereafter furnish the names and addresses of the successful candidates for record in the minutes of this Board.

3. Teachers of Public Schools.

This addition to the usefulness of the Institution has proved entirely successful. Your Committee cannot too highly commend the spirit that actuated the Faculty in making valuable additions to the University System. They recommend that its continuance be advised and authorized by the Board.

4. The petition of the Students of the Law Class.

The Committee recommend that the action of the Faculty in refusing permission to the students of the Law Department to hold a separate celebration at the end of their academic year and in consenting to the formation of an association to be styled the "Law Association of the University of Virginia" be confirmed.

5. Academic Degrees.

The importance of such action as recommended by the Faculty in regard to the "Academic Degrees" and the short time that Your Committee have had for its consideration has induced them to request that they be permitted to postpone their report on that subject until the meeting of the Board in July.
