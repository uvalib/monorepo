The regular annual meeting of the Board of Visitors was held in "Madison Hall," University, on above date.

Present: The Rector, Visitors Harmon, Flood, Moore, Hunton, Buchanan, Norton, Craddock, and President Alderman.

The Board was called to order at 10:00 A. M., by the Rector.

Mr. John B. Moon, the attorney of the University was present, and submitted his report, embracing a scheme looking to the retiring of the out-standing bonds of the University, in accordance with a recent act of the Legislature. This report, after being read and explained, was adopted by the Board.

### The report follows:-

Resolved:-

1. That this Board deems it expedient, in the exercise of the powers conferred upon it by an act of the General Assembly of Virginia, entitled, "An Act to authorize the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia to issue new bonds, secured by deed of trust, for the purpose of retiring certain bonds now outstanding and secured in like manner." Approved, March 10, 1906, to issue such new bonds to the amount of two hundred thousand dollars, bearing interest at the rate of four per centum per annum, and secured by deed of trust as hereinafter set forth.

2. That the bonds of this corporation, to the amount aforesaid, be accordingly so issued, of the denomination of Five Hundred Dollars each, bearing date on the first day of November, 1906, and carrying interest from date at the rate of four per centum per annum, the principal thereof to be payable forty years after date, but with the option to this corporation to redeem and pay the same, or any of them, at any time after ten years from this date; the interest aforesaid to be payable on the first day of May, and the first day of November each year, but the same to cease from and after such time as the principal of the bonds respectively, upon which it accrues, shall be called in for payment; and that the proceeds of said bonds coming into the hands of this corporation shall be devoted exclusively to the purposes specified in said Act.

3. That the said bonds, principal and interest, shall be secured by a deed of trust duly executed with general warranty by this corporation to the "Virginia Trust Company," as Trustee, conveying and assigning in trust to secure the principal and interest of said bonds, all the real estate of this corporation together with all buildings, betterments and improvements erected and to be erected thereon; and also certain of its personal property, to wit: its libraries, statuary, and paintings, and all its equipment, appliances, furniture, apparatus, and other similar tangible chattel property, used in the conduct of the business of the University, or in connection with the courses of instruction given at said institution, including all tangible personal property of this character and description, which may hereafter be acquired by this corporation; and also all the interest of this corporation in, and all its claims to the estate or any part thereof of the late Arthur W. Austin of Milton in the State of Massachusetts, a certain legacy (which) was bequeathed to this corporation.

4. Said deed of trust shall be executed, acknowledged and delivered in the name of and for, and on behalf of this corporation by its chief officer, the Rector, and attested by its Secretary, with its corporate seal affixed, and shall contain a provision giving to this corporation, the right from time to time to sell or exchange said articles of tangible chattel property and replace them with others of equal or greater value, which shall be subject to the said deed of trust, and also reserving to this corporation, the right in its own name to demand, sue for, receive, receipt for and collect; and also to commute, compromise and adjust all the said interest of this corporation in and all its claims to the said estate of the said Austin, without the intervention of said trustee company; provided that all amounts realized thereon shall remain in the hands of and be held by this corporation, subject to said deed of trust, except that this corporation may, until the right to foreclose shall have accrued under said trust deed, use the current income therefrom for and about its current expenses. And said deed of trust shall further contain such other provisions as the said Rector may be advised are usual, apt and proper.

5. And for the purpose of further securing said bonds, the said trust deed shall contain a covenant that the said buildings shall be kept insured in some one or more reputable fire insurance companies for the sum of One Hundred and Fifty Thousand Dollars, until such time as the aggregate amount of such bonds outstanding shall be reduced below said sum of $150,000.00 after which time an amount of insurance at least equal to all the bonds outstanding shall be sufficient. All such policies of insurance shall be drawn or assigned so that loss, if any, shall be payable to said Trust Company, for the protection of the holders of said bonds. And said deed of trust shall also further contain a covenant on the part of this corporation for the establishment, setting apart, and maintenance of a Sinking Fund of Two Thousand Dollars per annum, out of appropriations made by the General Assembly of Virginia for that purpose, or out of the current revenues of the University, to meet and discharge the principal of said Bonds.

6. The said bonds shall be signed by the said Rector and attested by the Secretary, with the corporate seal affixed, and shall consist of a series of four hundred bonds for Five Hundred Dollars each, numbered consecutively from one to four hundred. The form of said bond shall be as follows:

   "The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, a public corporation created and existing under the laws of the State of Virginia, for value received, hereby acknowledges itself indebted and promises to pay to the bearer of this bond, or in case the same be registered, then to the registered owner thereof, forty years after the date hereof, at the office of the Virginia Trust Company at Richmond, Virginia, the sum of Five Hundred Dollars in the true and lawful money of the United States of America, with interest thereon at the rate of four per centum per annum, thereon from this date until paid, payable semi-annually on the first day of May and the first day of Nov. in each year, at the said office of the said Trust Company, on the presentation and surrender of the proper coupons representing the same hereto attached."

   "This bond is issued in pursuance of an Act of the General Assembly of Virginia, approved March 10, 1906, entitled, "An act to authorize the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia to issue new bonds, secured by deed of trust, for the purpose of retiring certain bonds now outstanding and secured in like manner,' in which said act it was stated that the bonds issued thereunder were to be non-taxable; and this bond is one of an issue of Two Hundred Thousand Dollars of said bonds, the principal and interest whereof is secured by a deed of trust of even date herewith upon all the real estate and certain personal property of the said Rector and Visitors to the Virginia Trust Company of Richmond, Virginia, as Trustee, to be found of record in the Clerk's Office of the Circuit Court of Albemarle County."

   "In case of default in the payment of the above interest for ninety days after any instalment of the same is due and has been demanded, the principal of this bond shall, at the option of the holder thereof and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the said deed of trust, become forthwith due and payable."

   "The said Rector and Visitors hereby reserve the right to pay the principal of this bond at any time after ten years from this date; and after this bond shall have been called in by the said Rector and Visitors in pursuance of this provision, and after notice of such call shall have been published once a week for four successive weeks in some newspaper published in the City of Charlottesville, Va., and for six days a week for three successive weeks in some newspaper published in the City of Richmond, Va., all the interest on this bond shall cease and determine and no further interest accrue thereon; and all coupons attached hereto and thereafter maturing shall be and become wholly void and of no effect; but the principal together with any interest theretofore accrued and represented pro tanto by the coupon next thereafter maturing, is to be paid upon the presentation and surrender of this bond and all the said coupons thereafter maturing."

   "The holder of this bond may cause the same to be registered on the books of the University in the name of such holder, and the same shall be thereafter transferable only on such books; and until there be a further transfer thereof on said books, the principal thereof shall be payable only to such registered holder, or to the legal representatives of such holder; the coupons or interest warrants remaining always transferable by delivery; but where assigned to bearer by any such registered holder and such assignment registered on said books, this bond shall again become negotiable and transferable by delivery, and will so continue until again registered in the name of an assignee; and each successive registration shall be endorsed thereon."

   "This bond shall not be valid until the certificate endorsed thereon shall be signed by the said Trust Company, or some officer thereof."

   "In testimony whereof, the said Rector and Visitors have caused this bond to be signed by the said Rector and sealed with its corporate seal, and attested by its Secretary, this first day of November Anno Domini 1906."

And to which said bonds coupons for interest shall be annexed to the following effect, (the signatures thereto being lithographed or engraved):

(Form of Coupon.)

The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia will pay to the bearer at the office of the Virginia Trust Company, Richmond, Virginia, on the 1st day of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 19\_\_ Ten Dollars, being six months interest on their bond No. \_\_\_\_ for Five Hundred Dollars: and this coupon is issued and redeemable in accordance with the terms of the said bond.

*(signed) J K ma Bursar.*

7. None of the said bonds shall be issued until authenticated and verified by a certificate endorsed on each bond by an officer of said Trustee Company, or its successor in the trust, to the following effect:

(Form of Certificate).

"The Virginia Trust Company of Richmond, Virginia, the trustee referred to in the within instrument, hereby certifies that this is one of the issue of bonds to the amount of Two Hundred Thousand Dollars, therein specified and described.

Richmond, Virginia, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 19\_\_\_

Virginia Trust Company, By \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_"

8. All the said bonds with the interest accruing thereon shall stand secured equally and ratably in the said deed of trust, without reference to the date of their issue.

9. If at any time after the lapse of ten years from the date of said bonds, it should be determined to call in and redeem a portion thereof, this corporation shall determine by lot the bond or bonds so to be called in and redeemed out of those then outstanding.

### The lease follows -

This indenture made this 1st. day of June in the year 1906 between the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, a corporation, hereinafter styled the lessor, party of the first part, and Dr. R. H. Whitehead, hereinafter styled the lessee, party of the second part:

Whereas the lessee is a professor at the said University holding his appointment as such under the lessor, and it is desirable in view of his employment that he should be enabled to provide himself a place of residence at the said University:

Now Therefore this Indenture Witnesseth,

1. That the said lessor doth lease and demise unto the said lessee for the term of Fifty (50) years, commencing on the first day of June 1906, all that lot or parcel of land owned by the said lessor in Albemarle County, Virginia, situated on the Observatory Road, near the University Ice Ponds and bounded and described as follows: Beginning at a stake on the South side of the Observatory Road near the said Ice Ponds, thence running along the margin of the said road West 23° North, 200 feet to a corner stake, thence South 23° West, 400 feet to a corner stake, thence East 23° South, 200 feet to a corner stake, thence North 23° East, 400 feet to the place of beginning, enclosing a rectangular plat containing eighty thousand square feet. And the said lessor reserves as rent for the said land for the first five years of said lease the sum of Twenty-five Dollars ($25.00) per annum, payable at the end of each year; and after the expiration of said five years, and also after the expiration of each period of five years thereafter during the continuance of this lease, the rent, reserved and to be paid for the said lot, shall be fixed by the agreement of the parties; or if they cannot agree, then the same shall be ascertained and determined by three disinterested men, to be selected, one by the lessor, and one by the lessee or those having his estate, and they to choose a third in case of their disagreement. The annual rental so ascertained and fixed shall be final for the five year period for which it is so ascertained, but in no case shall less than the sum of Twenty-five dollars ($25.) per annum be paid as such rental.

2. The lessee covenants that he will within one year from the beginning of the lease erect a dwelling house and other improvements upon the said lot of the cost and value of not less than $5,000.00 to be occupied by him as a place of residence so long as he continues as a professor or otherwise in the employ of the said University; and in case of his death, leaving a widow, then at her option to be occupied by her during her life as a place of residence, but not exceeding however the aforesaid term of 50 years.

3. In the event that the lessee, or his widow, shall cease to occupy the leased premises as a residence as aforesaid, either by reason of his or her death or removal from the University, then the lessor shall have the right at any time thereafter to lease back from the lessee or those having his estate, the lot aforesaid with the improvements thereon for the remainder of the term at such annual rent for the said improvements as may be agreed upon by the lessor and lessee or those having his estate, or in the event of their failure to agree upon the amount of rent to be paid for such improvements then the same shall be ascertained and determined in all respects by arbitration as hereinbefore provided, and the decision and award of the men selected as aforesaid for this purpose shall be final. And whether the lessor shall or shall not have exercised its right to lease and rent back the said lot with improvements thereon as aforesaid, it shall nevertheless always have the further right and privilege, after the lessee or his widow shall have ceased to occupy the premises as aforesaid, upon giving at least three month's notice to the lessee or those having his estate, to cancel and terminate this lease and take the improvements erected upon the leased premises at an appraised valuation to be determined in all respects by arbitration as hereinbefore provided, and this right to so cancel and terminate this lease may be exercised by the lessor at any time after the same may have accrued to it.

4. For so long a time as the leased premises may remain under the control of the lessee, or those having his estate, after the same shall cease to be occupied as a residence of himself or his widow as aforesaid, and subject always to the rights of the lessor as provided in paragraph three hereof, the lessee, or those having his estate, shall have the right, by and with the consent in writing of the lessor, to assign and sublet the leased premises and improvements thereon; and the lessee covenants to and with the lessor that no person shall ever occupy and hold the leased premises or any part thereof as such assignee or sublessee, without the consent in writing of the lessor first for that purpose obtained.

5. The lessee further covenants to and with the lessor that at no time during the term shall the buildings or improvements upon the leased premises be allowed to become so as to be of less value than $5,000. as aforesaid; and that if the same shall be destroyed by fire or the elements, that they shall be rebuilt and restored so as to be of not less than the value of $5,000., within twelve months after the lessor shall give notice to the lessee or those having his estate that such rebuilding or restoration is required.

6. The lessee further covenants to and with the lessor that he will pay the rent reserved and provided for in paragraph one hereof.

7. It is further hereby expressly agreed and stipulated between the parties that should any installment of the rent accruing to the lessor, remain in arrears and unpaid for 90 days after the same becomes due and payable; or should there be a breach by the lessee or those or those having his estate, of any of his covenants herein contained, then and in that event, the lessor may at any time after said 90 days has expired, or at any time after there shall have been a breach of any of said covenants, cancel and terminate this lease upon giving at least 30 days notice to that effect to the lessee or those having his estate; and the lessee waives any further or other notice to be given or act to be performed by the lessor in order to cancel and determine this lease as above specified.

8. At the expiration of the term of this lease, in case it shall not have been previously terminated as aforesaid, the lessor at its option may purchase the buildings and improvements then on the leased premises at a price agreed upon by the parties in interest, or if they cannot so agree, then at an appraised value to be ascertained and fixed by disinterested parties in the manner hereinbefore provided; but if the lessor does not exercise its right to so purchase such buildings and improvements, then the lessee, or those having his estate in the premises, shall have the right either to remove the said buildings and improvements then on the premises, or to require from and be granted by the lessor a renewal of this lease for the further term of fifty years upon the terms, conditions and stipulations hereinbefore set forth, except that any such renewal lease shall not itself contain a further renewal clause.

9. All taxes and public demands, if any, accruing against the leased premises during the lease shall be paid by the lessee or those having his estate.

In testimony whereof the said party of the first part has caused its name and Corporate seal to be hereunto affixed by A. C.
