Pursuant to call of the President, a special meeting of the Executive Committee of the Board of Visitors was held in the office of the President at the University on Wednesday, July 19th, 1939, at 10:30 A.M., the President and the following members of the Executive Committee being present - Hollis Rinehart, R. Gray Williams and C. O'Conor Goolrick.

The President stated that the primary purpose of the meeting, as expressed in the call, is to consider the terms of a proposed agreement between National Geographic Society and the University providing for an expedition to the Central South Pacific Islands under the leadership of Professor Wilbur A. Nelson, and to be known as the - "National Geographic Society—;University of Virginia Geophysical Expedition to the Central South Pacific Islands with the Co-operation of the United States Coast Guard 1939-1940".

The President then requested Dr. Wilbur A. Nelson, who was present at the meeting, to explain to the Committee the plans and purposes of the proposed Expedition; and in accordance with this request Dr. Nelson addressed the meeting, giving a brief outline of the background of the Expedition, its purposes and the possibilities of important scientific discoveries being made by reason thereof.

Mr. Perkins, Attorney for the Board, then presented to the meeting a form of agreement between National Geographic Society and the University, covering the conditions under which the expedition is being organized and the respective undertakings of the National Geographic Society and the University with reference thereto.

After a full discussion of the whole situation, the following resolution was adopted:

RESOLVED that the proposed agreement between the National Geographic Society and the University of Virginia, submitted to this meeting by the Attorney for the University, be and is hereby approved, and the President is hereby authorized and requested to execute and deliver said contract in the name and on behalf of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia. Said contract shall not be operative, however, until Professor Nelson, the Leader of the Expedition, and each and every member of said Expedition's scientific staff shall have executed and delivered to the University a properly executed release by which the University shall be relieved from any and all responsibility for loss or damage to personal property, from liability for illness, accident, personal injuries, or death, arising out of, connected with, or in any manner occurring during the Expedition, the preparations therefor, or resulting therefrom, said release to be in such form as may be prescribed by the Attorney for the University.

Bids for the construction of a Research Teaching Laboratory at the Mountain Lake Biological Station, Mountain Lake, Virginia, were received in the Office of the President on Thursday, July 6. These bids were opened in the President's Office, by Mr. Rinehart, Chairman of the New Buildings Committee of the Board, the President of the University, and the Superintendent of Buildings and Grounds.

Messrs. T. E. Coffey and Company, Boxley Building, Roanoke, were found to be the low bidders with a base bid of $48,700. This amount slightly exceeded the total available for expenditure. After accepting certain alternates provided in the proposal, namely, alternates 2, 5, 6, 8 and 9, the net value of the contract was reduced to $46,680. This being the low bid, and the total sum being within the amount of money available, it is recommended by the Chairman of the New Buildings Committee that this contract in the sum of $46,680 be awarded to T. E. Coffey and Company, of Roanoke, Virginia. It was thereupon

RESOLVED, by the Executive Committee of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the contract for construction of the Research Teaching Laboratory at the Mountain Lake Biological Station, Mountain Lake, Virginia, be and same is hereby awarded to T. E. Coffey and Company, Boxley Building, Roanoke, Virginia, in the net value of $46,680.

RESOLVED, FURTHER, that the President be and he is hereby authorized and directed to execute the contract on behalf of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia with T. E. Coffey and Company for the construction of this building, in the sum of $46,680.

The President advised that the American Investment Company of Peabody, Kansas, had negotiated a sale of the Coffinberry Land owned by the University of Virginia and located in Peabody, Kansas, to Fred Gard, in Peabody, for the sum of $1550.

The terms of the sale were $550 cash, with the remaining $1,000 payable on or before March 1, 1940 without interest.

The Rector of the University was consulted and approved of this sale. A contract was thereupon prepared in triplicate, with deed to be placed in escrow with the agency until final payment is made. On July 6, 1939 the Rector and the Secretary executed the contracts and deed and mailed them to the agency, retaining a copy of the contract which is made a part of the minutes of this meeting. Whereupon it was

RESOLVED, by the Executive Committee of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, that the action of the Rector and Secretary in entering into this agreement and executing this deed be and the same is hereby ratified and confirmed in all respects.

The President stated to the Executive Committee of the Rector and Visitors of the University that he had received an offer of $7500 cash for the premises at 328 Ridgewood Avenue, Glen Ridge, New Jersey. This offer was made by Arthur E. Masters, Inc., on behalf of Robert E. O'Donovan, of Glen Ridge.

The President stated further that upon receipt of this offer he telegraphed to a friend of the University, Mr. Oglesby, who lives in Bloomfield, New Jersey, which is a town adjoining Glen Ridge, and asked Mr. Oglesby to inspect this property and estimate its fair price. The President received a telegram from Mr. Oglesby under date of July 8, indicating his estimate of a fair price to be between nine and eleven thousand dollars; whereupon the President declined to accept the offer of $7500 cash on this property.

RESOLVED, by the Executive Committee of the Rector and Visitors of the University that the action of the President in connection with the offer on the Premises at 328 Ridgewood Avenue, Glen Ridge, New Jersey, be and the same is hereby ratified and approved.
