**Discussion with University Leadership**

President Ryan said the session would cover how COVID was managed through the fall, the lessons learned, and a look ahead to the spring. He announced that in January John Jeffries will be stepping down as Senior Vice President for Advancement to return to the Law School to teach. Mr. Jeffries has agreed to stay on part-time as counselor to the President and will continue to participate in certain meetings of University senior leadership. Mr. Ryan thanked Mr. Jeffries for his efforts on behalf of Advancement and the University.

President Ryan said overall the fall semester went well. The goal was to safely deliver on the mission of teaching, research, and medical care. There were a total of about 1,250 positive COVID cases among students, faculty, and staff from the start of classes through Thanksgiving. Seven staff members were hospitalized and four recovered. No students were hospitalized, and the vast majority of the cases were within the student population. There has been no evidence of transmission in the classroom and no evidence of transmission from UVA students to community members. The UVA community across the entire semester had an infection rate of 2.15%. By comparison, the overall positivity rate for the Commonwealth of Virginia was consistently above 5% between August and September and decreased over the semester in part because of increased testing. UVA’s positivity rate declined as it was rising across the Commonwealth. There remained plenty of isolation and quarantine space.

The University ran smoothly, and faculty managed online, in-person, and hybrid classes. This was an effort of thousands of faculty, students, and staff. He said they learned too many lessons to talk about all of them, but a few stand out including how important it is to stay one step ahead of the virus. Early detection is key, so increasing testing capacity, getting students into isolation or quarantine, keeping gatherings to small numbers, and requiring students to wear masks, all contributed to containment.

Mr. Ryan said adaptability was crucial. Faculty had to adapt to different teaching methods, many staff volunteered for jobs different from their day jobs, and students adapted to public health requirements.

Effective communication was difficult to achieve. There was a great deal of information to share and it took hard thinking to figure out how to communicate all the information effectively. He said they learned it is most effective to use diverse channels of communication to convey messages during the course of the semester. They relied on a regular newsletter video but also social media reminders and e-mail.

Next semester they will continue to experiment; they have learned the importance of staying humble and being vigilant. Lastly, and most importantly, they learned that the UVA community can do hard things. It is an understatement to say the semester was a challenge; it was one of the most powerful challenges the University has ever faced and everyone rose to the challenge.

Mr. Ryan said the spring will bring some new challenges including new opportunities. First, the vaccine coming on the scene is a potential game changer and the healthcare system is awaiting doses of the Pfizer vaccine. Because not everyone will receive the vaccine by late January, UVA will continue regular testing for students and follow similar health protocols regarding social gatherings and masks. Nursing School and Medical School students will be tested once a week, staff will be tested on a more regular basis, and UVA will continue to do testing in the community.

He said they are also planning more in-person experiences for students and thinking about and working on creative ways for students to gather, which will be especially difficult during the colder months. He ended by thanking the Board for their assistance during this period.

Provost Magill and Chief Operating Officer Davis were asked to introduce the panelists. Before the introductions, Ms. Magill provided additional remarks. She said there are three legs of the stool: health and safety, advancing the mission, and all the operational supports to support health and safety and the mission. Each panelist was asked to give one example of a challenge they faced this semester and explain how they and their team tackled it and what lessons they are taking forward into the spring from the challenge they faced.

Ms. Magill said the pandemic is better analogized to a major and constantly evolving weather event that started in late February and has not stopped. Like any major weather event it directly challenged UVA’s ability to do what we do: to educate students and give them a transformative experience to create new knowledge, to pass that knowledge on to the next generation, to serve the community and state, and to offer safe medical care. This challenge has brought a lot of other challenges but it's like a hurricane starting in February that has changed almost daily and hasn't stopped and has required UVA to do so many different things and do them in new ways. She said she thinks of health and safety as a blanket that covered everything and permeated everything they were doing.

Ms. Magill introduced the first three panelists: Dr. Mitchell Rosner, chair of the Department of Medicine; Dean Ian Baucom, dean of the College and Graduate School of Arts & Sciences; and Melur (Ram) Ramasubramanian, the vice president for research. Dr. Costi Sifri, director of hospital epidemiology, also participated in the panel along with Dr. Rosner.

Ms. Davis introduced the other three panelists: Dr. Chris Holstege, director of Student Health; Susan Davis, associate vice president for Student Affairs; and Colette Sheehy, senior vice president for Operations.

Speaking on testing strategy, Dr. Rosner gave some background on how they approached designing a COVID testing strategy. UVA had a student population arriving from around the world living in many different communal situations from residential dorms to apartment buildings. The problem was how to design a testing strategy that recognized these things. Ultimately, they decided to use a combination of testing methodologies to get the broadest coverage and focus on the highest risk areas. He said they learned early on that in conjunction with Student Health and Student Affairs they were able to identify where cases were occurring on Grounds and move testing to those areas. He said testing is part of the strategy, but isolation and quarantine also are necessary to make a containment strategy effective.

Dr. Rosner said they brought together a collaborative group of experts who didn’t always agree, but ultimately the decisions were well thought out and people were invested in making sure the semester could continue and the community was safe. There was a “can do” attitude with strong operations and student health teams. He said the Student Health team may be the best in the country; they were an effective arm of testing and without them the testing strategy would not have been successful.

Dr. Rosner said the “game changer” was the development of a saliva testing program which blanketed the on-Grounds students. He showed a data slide from Health Industry Advisor with seven-day averages, and the conclusion of this study was UVA/Albemarle County had the lowest rate in the country for metro areas with major Universities, well below the national average. He said this is a testament to the effectiveness of the testing strategy and the broader containment strategy. Dr. Rosner said he particularly enjoyed working with senior leadership and his colleagues on an effective testing strategy for students.

Vice President for Research Ram Ramasubramanian spoke next about the saliva testing program. To test on a large scale, the test had to be rapid, cost effective, highly accurate, and easy to administer, and once the decision to test was made there were several competing choices. Saliva testing was determined to be the best choice. Through an effort of people working in unprecedented ways they built a laboratory from scratch that met regulatory standards, modifying the space and the tools to meet the standards, training everyone on testing methods, developing a testing protocol, and implementing it on a large scale as well as meeting documentation standards. He said the challenge then was collecting 2,000 or more samples a day while maintaining social distancing.

A large IT infrastructure was needed for notification, collection, processing, and developing data. They worked collaboratively to make it happen, and as a result they went from 150 tests per day in the beginning to a total of 45,000 tests as of this morning.

Dean Baucom then spoke about two overlapping challenges in the fall. The first challenge was even after the first quick miraculous transition to online teaching in the spring, taking place in eight days, most teachers had no real training in digital pedagogy. They did it on the fly.

The second challenge was that the job market collapsed. The country went into a hiring freeze. They decided to solve the two problems together. Faculty who hadn't had training in online pedagogy and graduate students who lost professional opportunities would both benefit. They developed a digital bootcamp over the summer for PhD students and then paired the PhD interns with faculty to give them the training they needed. The key to solving the two problems together was to come up with a solution that would benefit the faculty, graduate students, and undergraduates. He said the program was cost-neutral. The students learned some valuable skills and the faculty were prepared to teach online and hybrid courses in the fall.

Dr. Holstege spoke next. He explained the work of the Exposure Call Center, which guided students worried about potential exposure. The call center was staffed with individuals who could educate students on the CDC definition of “close contact” and advise them immediately on whether they needed to be tested and/or quarantined. UVA former students were deployed at the COVID contact center who were dedicated to the safety and health of the population. Dr. Holstege showed a slide depicting the data from the call center: over 3,000 calls were made to the call center since launch on September 2. Over 1,500 students were rapidly placed into quarantine and removed from the community to limit the spread of the disease. All calls were electronically documented, and data was shared in real time with the isolation and quarantine control team.

Ms. Susan Davis said the call center gave them a window into student concerns. She showed an info graphic based on those early conversations. The process included direct handoff from the call center to the dean on call, and one-on-one contact with each student who was being moved into isolation or quarantine. There was a focus on talking to the students through all the steps and working with others across Grounds including Dining, Housing, Facilities Management, the Emergency Management team, and the security team. All played a role behind the scenes to make sure that every single student had their needs met and the comfort level that they desired.

She said that once students were in the quarantine or isolation locations, they were assigned a care team member and each team member had regular ongoing contact with the student and their family. They fielded questions about what students wanted and needed in those spaces; they were a critical part of the quarantine and isolation effort.

Ms. Sheehy spoke about operationalizing living and learning at UVA during COVID. A functional group of 35 leaders met weekly representing functions from Facilities Management to athletics to libraries to housing and dining, classroom support, research, environmental health and safety, Parking and Transportation, and many more. The key to success was the cross collaboration and coordination that a number of individuals across different functions of the University were able to achieve by coming together. She showed a slide of what they achieved. She said they partnered with the merchants and delivered to them masks and signage for restaurants and shops, and put up a tent across the street from the corner so that students could pick up meals at the restaurants and eat them under the tent. They also partnered with the city and county governments as well.

After reviewing several slides depicting individuals who participated in the effort, the panel took questions from the Board. Dean Baucom said the biggest challenge for spring may be the combination of hope with a vaccine on the horizon and keeping the commitment going. Dr. Kent said the biggest challenge will be the unpredictably of the virus and trying to manage the students. Dr. Rosner said we will have a community where some people have been vaccinated and some have not. The people who have been vaccinated will want to get on with regular life and it will be critical to keep the diligence and attention as a community.

**Remarks/Reports**

**Remarks by the Rector**

The Rector thanked his fellow Board members. The Board was scheduled to have four meetings and a retreat this year, and including the Executive Committee meeting, there have been 12 full board meetings. He thanked the leadership for their work to mitigate the effect of COVID-19 on the mission and named a number of individuals who have been flexible and dedicated. He said the most important contribution came from the students—it was the students who got themselves through the semester and they are responsible for the success.

The Rector said education, medicine, and research are the primary missions, and in those areas the University has continued apace. He recited a list of things that have gone right, including developing our own PCR test, manufacturing our own swabs, and doing 2,000 tests a day, and hopefully 4- to 5,000 a day in the spring if needed. He said that outside of the COVID preparations, in undergraduate admission, applications were up over 30%; Mark Luellen reported that they had raised over $530M this year for the 2020 fiscal year; the Strategic Investment Fund (SIF) has continued to work throughout the pandemic, including the seed-stage interdisciplinary research projects which were so successful that the President asked for more money from SIF; the Memorial to Enslaved Laborers was unveiled and has received many accolades; the bond issuance in September was at the lowest interest rates of any institution; the athletics task force continued their work and developed a plan for athletics to sustain the department for a decade. In rapid succession he named a number of additional items: the political activity of our students around the election; a Rhodes Scholar; an affirmation by the three bond rating agencies of the University’s Triple A bond rating; School of Medicine recognition for their diversity efforts; moving forward with plans to assist the community with affordable housing plans; free speech policies; and several impressive national rankings of our schools and accolades bestowed on faculty.

He said alumni, parents, and friends have continued to serve on foundation boards. And lastly, the Facilities Management department won a national award for effective and innovative practices. UVA is a great university; the spring will be challenging but we should be cautiously confident.

**Remarks by the Student Member**

Student representative Mazzen Shalaby’s remarks are reproduced verbatim:

Good afternoon everyone. While I’m saddened that we are once again meeting virtually, I’m glad to “see” you all in whatever capacity we can manage. I want to start by taking a moment to recognize the indigenous peoples upon whose land the University was built, and the enslaved laborers who were forced to build it. I also want to recognize the now 300,000 Americans, and the millions of others around the world who have lost their lives to COVID 19; many members of our community have lost friends and family to this disease, and I offer my most sincere condolences. Finally, I want to recognize and thank those who have been on the frontlines of this pandemic, from the 13,000 folks over at the Medical Center, to the staff and employees who come into work every day to keep the University running, to the scientists and first responders working tirelessly to combat this pandemic.

We made it everyone! While it feels weird to say that in celebratory fashion, I think it’s necessary. Yes, we are entering yet another dark chapter in this pandemic. Yes, our nation continues to roil with political and civil unrest. But in the midst of a now nine month old pandemic, I want to take the rare opportunity to celebrate and congratulate my student peers and you all as leaders on making it through what was doubtlessly one of the most challenging, and, as you may have heard before, “unprecedented” semesters in its history.

To be frank, we, a bunch of college students, managed to do what most of the world has not been willing or able to do: we followed public health guidelines, we rallied together, and we largely managed to control the virus and have a successful semester. We didn’t do it alone. It took the help and guidance of most of the people in this room, and the thousands of others I mentioned earlier, and for that I’m thankful. And I won’t pretend that it was perfect or easy; yes, we made mistakes and didn’t always follow guidelines perfectly. But when we needed to, we buckled down and did what we had to in order to have a largely successful semester. In a time where there is so much negativity and so little to celebrate, I think that deserves some recognition.

The University community built the plane as we flew it this semester. Students picked up the pieces from spring and restarted their organizations. In the continued spirit of student self-governance, hundreds of students worked through countless groups to help the University return safely, from #Youva to the folks at HRL, student council, and the UJC, this semester has truly taken a village-to that village I say thank you, and please enjoy your well-earned break. Professors and students continued figuring out how Zoom University works, and I’ve found their empathy and patience reassuring.

The University continues to adapt and improve, from increasing testing-which has been a tremendous source of relief for students-to improving communications with students. Strong communication will be key going forward as we navigate a new semester with new challenges, rules, and developments. Looking ahead, I know I speak for many of my peers when I say I hope we can devise some creative ways to safely increase in person classes and student events next semester, whether that includes opening more academic spaces to CIOs or providing opportunities for outdoor class meetings. It’s imperative for our collective mental health that we create more safe and acceptable opportunities for in-person interaction. Finally, the new opportunities presented by increased testing and vaccines come with a moral hazard that will need to be navigated next semester as well. I don’t want to repeat the same thing over and over, but I really cannot express enough gratitude to everyone who has made this semester possible.

Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic is a perfect segue into my next topic: equity. The pandemic has exposed and exacerbated the systemic inequalities that underprivileged groups continue to face. On the University level, we sat here 3 months ago to the day and approved the Racial Equity Task Force’s recommendations. It’s easy to rest on our laurels and focus on other things right now because there are so many important things that need our attention, but this is not something that we can put on the backburner. That said, I want to recommit our focus on these issues; I know I speak for my peers when I say I hope we can see real progress being made on some of the task force’s recommendations in the near future. I know many will require a great deal of time and planning, but, as our University’s founder once said, “Never put off for tomorrow what you can do today.”

While the racial equity task force may represent the pinnacle of these equity issues, it is certainly not the only one. Making equity a priority means we view everything through the lens of equity. I’m excited to work with Vice Provost Farmer to see what this looks like from an enrollment perspective. I’ve spent the last month working with students to push the University to make equity a focus for our investing, including an initiative through Divest UVA that is urging the university to divest its endowment from socially and environmentally irresponsible investments.

Even in these leadership meetings, I am painfully aware of how few faces of color I see around the room. I reiterate that we will never be great, and we certainly will not be good, as a university, or even as people, until we do everything in our power to address these issues.

Another conversation linked to equity is that of tuition. One of the biggest issues facing my age group today is the rising price of education, particularly in light of the economic consequences of the pandemic. As I said in September, though the University is facing great challenges through no fault of its own, students feel that we are not getting the UVA experience we are paying for. Moreover, many students have been hit hard financially by the pandemic. I do want to recognize that the university has worked hard to increase its financial support to all students who need it. But even without the pandemic-which I know is impossible to think about- continuing to increase tuition should raise serious eyebrows as we see ballooning student debt and increasing discourse about the value of higher education. I know that everyone in the room shares this desire, and I know you all know where this is going, but I’m going to say it anyway: we must try to freeze or reduce tuition for the coming year. Such decisions will likely come with tradeoffs, and I hope we can communicate candidly with the student body about what these tradeoffs may look like in an effort to increase students' understanding and agency in the tuition setting process.

Finally, my speech comes to the topic of speech. In the last few years, we’ve seen the decay of civil discourse, and civility more generally, around the nation and its college campuses. I will be upfront in saying, I’m an ardent supporter of the freedoms of speech and expression; my father was raised in a country where those rights don’t exist, so their importance was instilled in me from a young age. That is what prompts me to raise this issue right now and get on something of a soapbox.

As a society, and certainly as a University, we should be able to at least hear each other out, even if we disagree, and if we do disagree, we should strive to listen even more so that we may find some common understanding because more often than not we agree on a lot of the same goals, we just see different ways of getting there. I recognize that in such polarized times it can be taxing to do this and everyone should prioritize their personal health, but that is why we are here as students, to push outside our comfort zones, hear things we find jarring and disagreeable, and to grow. There are hateful voices out there spewing hateful things, that’s a reality that will never change and I’m certainly not saying that indignation and condemnation never have their place, but that this is the exception rather than the rule. I’m also not asking folks to change their minds on any of these issues or to become best friends with the people they disagree with. But I am asking that we at least give each other the time of day and the benefit of the doubt.

To be clear, this goes all ways and concerns all parties, starting with myself, including every person in this room, our faculty, students, _and_ alumni; the point being that we should not be cherry picking freedom of expression to suit ourselves. Stepping off my soapbox for a minute, I think this is one of the great challenges our University faces going forward. Though I know at least some of my peers agree with me, I speak for myself when I say the University cannot, and should not, be the judge, jury, and executioner of every controversial exercise of expression on its Grounds or by its community, nor should we want or expect this as students. The University’s fostering of free speech and civil discourse - and the way it handles controversial exercises of expression by its community- now requires deliberate attention. And, as with most things around here, I think that endeavor will be best served if students play an active role in it as there are already so many members of our community who live these values and work in these spaces. The University is on the right path here (the Rector stole my thunder on this one) UVA was just ranked 6th out of 55 of the nation’s top schools in freedom of speech, but we should continue to be purposeful in how we consider this issue going forward.

In conclusion, you all will not be surprised to hear that there are still challenges to be faced. So, I will end with the same words I uttered in September because I think we’re off to a good start, but this journey has only just begun. We will continue to face difficult and unpopular decisions, but if we make the right decisions, we can emerge as a stronger and better community that truly lives up to its aspirations of being both great _and_ good. This is our chance to be on the right side of history, and I challenge myself, and all of you, to make sure that we are not timid in doing so, but bold. I welcome your feedback and input, and I appreciate all of your efforts to serve this community I love so dearly. Thank you, and I’m happy to answer any questions you may have.
