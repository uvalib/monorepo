**SUBJECT: Minutes of the Special Meeting of the Full Board of Visitors on November 25, 2014**

**The Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia met, in Open Session, at 12:00 p.m., on Tuesday, November 25, 2014, in the Albert & Shirley Small Special Collections Library of the Harrison Institute; Mr. George Keith Martin, Rector, presided.**

**Present were Frank B. Atkinson, L.D. Britt, M.D., Frank M. Conner III, Allison Cryor DiNardo, Helen E. Dragas, Kevin J. Fay, Barbara J. Fried, Frank E. Genovese, William H. Goodwin Jr., John A. Griffin, Victoria D. Harker, Bobbie G. Kilberg, Stephen P. Long, M.D., Margaret N. Gould, and Leonard W. Sandridge Jr. Edward D. Miller, M.D., participated by phone.**

**Also present were Teresa A. Sullivan, Patrick D. Hogan, Richard P. Shannon, M.D., John D. Simon, Susan G. Harris, Roscoe C. Roberts, Patricia M. Lampkin, David W. Martel, Nancy A. Rivers, and Debra D. Rinker.**

**Participating in a panel discussion were Hawa A. Ahmed, Ashley O. Brown, Christopher P. Holstege, M.D., Timothy Longo, Thomas J. Reid, and Jalen J.B. Ross.**

**Rector George Keith Martin called the special meeting of the Board to order. He asked for everyone to stand and observe a moment of silence in honor of a former Board member, Glynn Key, who passed away recently, as well as a student, Peter D’Agostino, who also passed away.**

**Rector Martin began his remarks by saying to Jackie and her parents that he was sorry. He extended that to all survivors of sexual assault and their families. He said this type of conduct will not be tolerated at the University of Virginia. As Rector, efforts to address this crisis and change this environment would be his top priority. He said he had initiated a suggestion with the Attorney General that he appoint independent legal counsel to assist the University with several issues: 1) to help determine how best to deal with the issue of sexual assault on campuses; 2) how best to maximize opportunities for successful criminal prosecution of sexual misconduct cases; 3) to examine relevant law as well as the University’s policies, procedures, and practices and to give particular attention to how we respond when there is a serious and credible allegation of sexual misconduct but the survivor is not willing to go forward with the complaint; and 4) to advise as to potential changes in state and federal law that will help maximize the opportunities for criminal prosecution.**

**The Rector thanked the Attorney General for his support and stated he had learned at 1:18 this morning that the Attorney General has appointed a team from O’Melveny & Myers as independent counsel. The Rector said the University would also hire additional experts, both within the University and outside, to help explore other available options. He provided some examples of areas they would explore:**

1.  **How to better train Greek organizations about sexual misconduct – mandatory training.**
2.  **How to deal with alcohol issues including underage drinking.**
3.  **How to best create an environment that will not foster the conduct that we so deplore.**

**Rector Martin said to be careful not to judge all fraternities or their members. Some fraternities are problems but hopefully it is limited to a few; the overwhelming majority are law abiding. He said we need to take this negative energy and turn it into something positive that will help us move forward and prove that we can effect change. He said the Board and administration cannot do it alone. It has to be both a top down and a bottom up approach. We need all members of the University community to support efforts to solve this problem.**

**The Rector reminded Visitors that at the September Board meeting, a substantial amount of time was devoted to the topic of sexual misconduct. During that presentation, Dean Groves said over 90% of the sexual misconduct issues involve alcohol. An editorial that appeared in the Richmond Times Dispatch on November 24 likewise highlighted the issue of alcohol. Bobbie Kilberg had pointed out during the session in September that 3/4 of students are not even old enough to drink. Mr. Martin said there is a clear correlation between alcohol consumption and sexual misconduct; we cannot ignore that fact.**

**The Rector suggested the Greek system may need to be overhauled, however, the Greek organizations will be a part of any conversations about changes. He said so far they had been very cooperative and he expected that cooperation would continue. To be successful will require a team effort. Faculty, staff, students, alumni, Greek organizations, and parents will be consulted. To that end, the Rector reached out to the Faculty Senate, students, and alumni as well as the Charlottesville community.**

**Mr. Martin said at a later date the Board will hear recommendations from consultants, and at that time a town hall meeting will be held to have an open conversation and to allow for further input. He said this is clearly a tragedy but we want to turn this tragedy into an opportunity and in fact lead the country in finding solutions to this awful challenge.**

**President’s Remarks**

**President Sullivan thanked the Board members for assembling on such short notice. She said the story in Rolling Stone was shocking. Her initial reaction was numbness which very quickly turned to anger and a deep grief for the survivors. She said she wanted to make it perfectly clear to everyone that nothing is more important to her than the safety of our students; not our reputation, not our success, and not our history or traditions. She said we must create and maintain a safe and healthy environment in which all of our students can follow their academic pursuits free from sexual violence. She said if we can’t deliver on this fundamental duty, then we – all of us – will have failed. She said Jackie’s experience should not have happened and nothing like it should ever happen again.**

**President Sullivan said we need to support any survivor of violence with caring and sensitivity. It is equally urgent that we prevent any further violence. She said if there are systemic problems, they must be rooted out. Foremost in her mind is fully investigating these allegations as well as thoroughly reviewing our current practices, which is why she asked the Charlottesville Police Department to investigate the gang rape as described in Rolling Stone. She fully endorses the forthcoming investigation by an independent counsel who will advise the University of Virginia, as well as propose necessary changes to state law. She said we are here today to address these issues head on, and we will spend the coming days, weeks, months – however long it takes – to ensure that the honor about which we preach is lived every day and every night.**

**The President said we have made significant progress in implementing new programs and policies, but the article in Rolling Stone points to an entrenched cultural problem in student life. She said alumni have written to say that the problem is an old one and now is the time, and this is the generation of students, when it must stop. Her role as president is to find answers to difficult questions and to develop solutions. In the past few days, she has opened conversations with the Honor Committee, and with students, faculty, and staff. The conversations are uniform in their content and tone: “Let’s be a catalyst for change, and let’s do it here and let’s do it now.” These conversations will continue, because the students understand the parts of the culture that foster violence.**

**President Sullivan said the most important change is a fundamental mind shift_,_ which can only come after deep introspection, to preserve what’s outstanding in our classrooms and across Grounds, and to repair and strengthen what isn’t. First, we must deal with the complexity of sexual assault, which is often emotionally too difficult for some survivors – mostly women – to come forward and report. We must work to ensure that our students know that if they have experienced a sexual assault, they will have a caring advocate to go with them to the police or hospital – and be with them to help secure justice and healing. She said if you report, you might save someone else. There is also an important role for students themselves in creating a culture of reporting, and of equipping students to better assist and support their friends in times of need. To that end, beginning in January, Green Dot, a nationally respected violence prevention organization, will begin offering bystander training for our students and our faculty.**

**President Sullivan said all fraternal organization social activities are suspended until January 9. This suspension is not an indication of wrongdoing for every part of the Greek system, or for every individual who chooses to participate in it. The actions of even a single individual within a larger community do reflect on the community as a whole. She said she is going to work with staff and the Greek community to make their environment safer for residents and visitors. This is a defining moment to improve oversight of the Greek system.**

**President Sullivan said we must do more to deal with the problems of alcohol, underage drinking, and binge drinking, because they are harmful in themselves and because they are often at play in sexual assaults. We need to wipe out the notion that the college experience is incomplete without heavy drinking. The University has a good alcohol education program, but it’s not enough. She said we have to do more to inform and guide the decisions that students make outside of the classroom. Law enforcement, state government officials, local businesses, and everyone in our community need to be a part of that mind shift.**

**President Sullivan said her concern for the safety of students and visitors must extend beyond the technical boundaries of Grounds. For a number of weeks, and at her direction, the Chief Operating Officer, Pat Hogan, and his team, have been upgrading lighting and expanding the capacity of the 24/7 surveillance cameras across Grounds. With the cooperation of the Charlottesville Police Department, they are moving forward quickly with the opening of a police substation on The Corner, staffed jointly by the Charlottesville and U.Va. Police Departments. Working cooperatively with the City, County and local apartment owners, lighting will be improved in neighborhoods near Grounds where many students live. By the beginning of the spring semester, a police substation will open and security personnel will increase in the vicinity of the Corner and surrounding neighborhoods, including Rugby Road.**

**In closing, President Sullivan said, “In the past week, I have seen dismay, anger, and sadness. But I’ve also seen energy and a passion to make things better. We are not as good as we should be. Our job now is to channel the energy and passion into action. Changing a culture takes the whole community working together, but in particular we need leadership from our students, faculty, staff, and alumni. Our U.Va. community strongly rejects a culture of sexual violence. Together we need to work to isolate, and to exclude, any sub-culture of deviance.”**

**After the President’s remarks, each of the panelists gave a report from their respective areas.**

**Jalen Ross, President of Student Council, emphasized the need to seize the moment to make the necessary changes. He said any one of the tragedies of this semester would have been enough to hurt, but together they have left us in a swirl of grief, confusion, sadness, anger, fear, and uncertainty. He said it has also left us with a powerful call to act. He said we need to come out of this as a better place, closer family, and a stronger people. How we act now has a chance to powerfully bring us together but it could also drive us hopelessly apart. We need to have an extraordinarily inclusive process when dealing with these problems; a diverse student voice. It should include student survivors who know the problem more deeply than any of us ever could, student advocates, student activists, fraternity members, student leaders, faculty, staff, administrators, community members, etc. He chose to focus on students because that is where the problems lie and they should be the ones to help fix them.**

**Ashley Brown, Representative of 1 Less, said she was not at all surprised by what was published in the Rolling Stone article. She said their advocacy group is entrenched in these issues and they recognize the need for change. Due to all the national media coverage, she said they now have the backing they so badly need, which makes her hopeful. She expressed her disappointment in the Board of Visitors and administration because she had never been approached by either group before this happened, but then she said she saw it as an opportunity for them to ask the advocacy groups how they could help. She said they need the Board and administration to continue to work with them after the cameras are gone to be able to make sustainable changes. She concluded by asking the Board to help her group help the students, and let the students help the Board. The Rector assured her that they have the support of the Board and that they truly appreciate their efforts.**

**Thomas Reid, President of the Interfraternity Council (IFC), said sexual assault is a serious cultural problem in fraternities. He confirmed what Jalen Ross had said earlier: the cultural change needs to be carried out on a student-by-student, individual level, not from any policies that would only change the climate over the short term. He said Rolling Stone has delivered this University a wake-up call. We must harness this issue and this collective attitude.**

**Hawa Ahmed, Resident Advisor and Chair of the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention Team (ADAPT), expressed the need to never blame the victim. She spoke about the effect that alcohol has on someone and how it impairs judgment, makes it difficult to realize danger, impairs memory, and changes one’s likelihood to respond when being provoked. She said that alcohol disrupts just about every part of the brain negatively. Through her work on substance abuse, she has realized the best approach to tackle alcohol problems on campus is through social norms education. She said about 16% of students drink at least seven drinks on a typical Saturday night. The heaviest drinkers in college were the heaviest drinkers in high school. If students aren’t allowed to drink on Grounds, they will go elsewhere to drink; fraternity houses should be the safest places around Grounds to drink. There is no reason that hard liquor is served at these houses and only given to females. She said that we need to take care of one another each and every day – not stand around and wait for the next tragedy to happen. We cannot leave each other alone at night, we cannot remain in this reactive, surprised, sad, and confused state; we need to be proactive.**

**Meg Gould, Student Board Member, said we are reacting to more than just one numbing, cruel, and sickening account. There are far more instances that occur than are reported. She said the panelists that have spoken before her are crucial to the solution process. She also spoke about a group of 400 students who gathered at Newcomb Hall the night before to discuss actions that need to take place in order to become a safer community for all. She handed out a document that lists some actionable ideas from the panelists. She said it should not be seen as comprehensive, but should be used as a beginning step. These ideas can be found in the attached document to these Minutes (Attachment 1).**

**Dr. Chris Holstege, Director of Student Health, physician in the Emergency Department, and former chair of the Faculty Senate, said as a faculty member, he shares the concerns of the President about the safety of students. As a clinician (ER physician for 20 years), he is appalled by the number of victims he sees who have not wanted to pursue prosecution. He said studies that are available both nationally and here at the University of Virginia that lay out evidence and give best practices to ensure programs will give us the change we are looking for and will provide the most improvement. Dr. Holstege said he has six children and his youngest is a girl; he wants to ensure that for future generations they matriculate through universities safely and with confidence they can report and have the support they need as they move through any difficult situations.**

**Chief Tim Longo, Charlottesville Police Chief, said as he listened to this panel of students speak so eloquently about the reality of their life, he was heartbroken but encouraged by their thoughtfulness, their courage, but most importantly by their willingness to cooperate across the board with everyone involved. He said the Charlottesville Police Department takes their duty to keep our students safe very seriously. He said while he cannot comment on the current investigation behind the allegations made in the Rolling Stone article, he will say there were bystanders that were in that room and he hopes that those bystanders have the moral courage to come forward and help with this investigation. He stated that they welcome the opportunity to work closely with the University, the independent counsel, and the students in finding solutions to this problem. He concluded by saying it is very important for bystanders with any information to come forward – nothing sends a clearer picture of “Not on Our Grounds” than that.**

**The Rector opened up the floor for individual comments and questions from members of the Board. These individual comments can be heard on the live stream, which is located here:** [**http://www.virginia.edu/bov/videos.html**](http://www.virginia.edu/bov/videos.html)

**Ms. Harker suggested that a University management team come back to the Board within the next 30 days with an action plan. Mr. Goodwin suggested that two Board members also be a part of this team that reports back to the full Board.**

**Mr. Conner read a suggested statement of the Board, for consideration by the Board. Board members reviewed the statement and made recommendations for changes, and upon motion the Board agreed to affirm the commitment of zero tolerance for sexual assault. In addition, the Board agreed to develop a statement by the Board, with the exact wording to be refined by the Secretary and General Counsel working with members of the Board. Dr. Miller expressed his disagreement with a statement from the Board. The final statement is attached to these Minutes (Attachment 2).**

**The Rector said next steps will include convening the ad hoc group of Visitors, students, faculty, and administrators to develop recommendations that will be presented to the Board at the next meeting. In addition, the independent counsel will brief the Board at the next meeting. These are the short-term steps.**

**On motion, the meeting was adjourned at 3:00 p.m.**

**Respectfully submitted,**

**_Sexual Misconduct: Actionable Ideas_**

_\]alen Ross, Meg Gould, Hawa Ahmed, Ashley Brown, Tommy Reid_
--------------------------------------------------------------

### ADAPT

*   social norms: create infographics in small Gordie check card sizes of UVa drinkers, including how many drinks; put in the hands of every student
    *   same with climate survey results on campus sexual assault
*   more "dry" community-wide events especially on Saturdays, a day where University engagements rarely occur, leaving people with few sober options
*   If only beer is being served at fraternity parties, have some sort of wristbands available with removable tabs- such as when one goes beer tasting- to keep track of drinks
*   Bystander Intervention
    *   internalize GreenDot language to move from "intervene intervene intervene" to "I know you want to intervene but there are social factors that are keeping you from doing so"
        *   allow spaces to discuss these factors (social hierarchies, "cockblocking," etc.)
    *   unpack the "empty language” that sometimes surrounds bystander intervention

\-Yeardley and Hannah's great gift to us is that there are people in our daily lives whom we know need our tending

*   just as we have realized you cannot eliminate alcohol from college settings, you can only teach students how to use it safely- encourage talking about having sex safely and readily accessible literature on healthy sex
*   Block Party- why does it still exist
*   offer alternatives
*   Foxfield- high-risk behaviors have gone way down at this event, provide safe transportation to get there

CAPS:
=====

*   larger staff
*   mission shift: students' mental health maintenance
*   look at Women's Center for layout design: decentralized, discrete offices
    *   many students do not understand their own mental health or trauma, provide readily attainable literature on this in public spaces

### Women's Center:

*   hire another trauma counselor

OTHER
=====

*   Bring a big act for the night of Block Party
*   Remove alcohol policing authority from RA's
*   Student Watch
*   Buddies on Call
*   ODOS survivor-intake policy shift: _encourage_ referring to SMB/police

Green Dot:

*   expand to two weekends; expand (and cancel classes if necessary) to include _all students (if_

_possible)_
-----------

*   allow excused absences for students if someone wants to attend but has an academic conflict
*   Require for a certain percentage of faculty from every school, and for staff of every department.

One Less:

*   Restructuring and reevaluating of CAPS
    *   *   Extending sessions to 3/6/12 month intervals not just preliminary screenings
        *   Relocating counseling services to destigmatize the healing process
        *   Reopening Green Dot sessions to 2 per semester
            *   Considering them excused absences from class/work
            *   **Way more funding for WC trauma counselor**
            *   Must engage professional students more, in discussions, many upper level students had no idea of the state of their university
            *   Hold SMB info sessions where students can have questions answered. Overwhelming amount of students have no idea how policy works and where they fit in.
            *   \*Constituent concern\* What is the university's responsibility to notify students of those being brought up on SMB charges, how to make students safer esp. because they are often repeat offenders (I realize they'll bring up the legally can't do a lot of things, but I want to find a way to mention it)
            *   Partner with ADAPT/PHE to do more programming about healthy relationships with sex and alcohol.

Greek Life:

*   *   Elimination of hard alcohol in fraternity houses
    *   Wristband system - you receive one wristband with every drink you have
    *   The article has gripped every individual's attention, giving the IFC the ability to put more substantial "teeth" behind the following policies:
*   Every bedroom door remains locked during a party
*   One alcohol distribution location, managed by a sober brother and with a timed, measured distribution (i.e. only x amount served every half hour)
    *   *   A working door list that checks student IDs - of which no fakes exist - ensuring that no first year is served alcohol
        *   STRICT adherence to a list
        *   Formalization of all these plans to be submitted to the IFC five days before a social event
        *   Pay a student-led, third party party-patrol to ensure that each of the risk prevention steps are being taken
        *   Significant fines for offenders and repeat offenders
*   At least 2 dry social events every year
*   For social functions, the house will be split into "zones" - i.e. door, bar, front yard, basement, main floor, and steps leading into the bunk area of each house - for which one sober brother is responsible monitoring
    *   Right now, we have these monitors with no specific zones
    *   Additionally, we'll furnish these monitors with brightly colored shirts that designate them as the risk managers
    *   We'll work with peer advocacy groups to develop a specific educational event for these monitors
*   A Greek zero tolerance sexual assault policy - any member found guilty by the SMB or CPD for such behavior will be removed from their respective organization and barred from

re-joining the Greek system

*   Annual, student-led presidents summit with speakers from Green Dot, etc.
*   The placement of signs around the house with the president, risk manager, and sober brothers' phone numbers during a party
*   Required FOA on sexual assault/misconduct for every Greek chapter (MGC, ISC, NPHC, IFC)

Academic:
=========

*   more funding for tenured professors in WGS track. Expansion of courses available
*   make WGS classes an area requirement

**Board of Visitors Statement on Sexual Assault**

RESOLVED, on behalf of all who comprise the University of Virginia community, the Board of Visitors adopts the following statement:

We affirm that our first priority, of all of our responsibilities, is to ensure the safety of all in our community, especially the students entrusted to our care;

We condemn with all our being the alleged violations in our community of the most basic rights of any civil society;

We feel, as do all, the conflicting emotions, particularly anger, generated by the alleged conduct, but we will not allow the innocent to be victimized in the absence of complete facts;

We will pursue with all due urgency the complete truth relating to those and other possible violations of our most basic rights;

We will repair on a sustainable basis those aspects of our culture that have enabled the abhorrent conduct we all condemn;

We will implement all measures to address these violations and instill a culture of reporting with an understanding that our community is committed to the fundamental principles of zero tolerance for sexual assault and the right to due process;

We will ensure that the support of the community is provided to those whose rights were violated and that the rule of law is applied to those who violated those rights;

We know the moral imperative of our work is unassailable. We commit ourselves to illuminating and nourishing the extraordinary and enduring strengths of the University even as we honestly confront and work to change uncomfortable truths that threaten to erode an environment of safety and trust. We act for our own students. We also act so that the University may serve as an example for, and a thought leader with, other institutions of higher learning facing similar and intolerable impediments to a culture of humane and civilized respect, open-mindedness, and learning. We undertake to help the University evolve into a place where each person can without fear or mistrust achieve his or her potential, academically and personally;

We will not permit any tradition to be preserved if it jeopardizes a student’s safety;

We will not end our work until we restore the trust in this great institution.
