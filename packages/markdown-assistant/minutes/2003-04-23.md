## TENTATIVE MINUTES SUBJECT TO THE APPROVAL OF THE BOARD OF VISITORS April 3-5, 2003

The Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia met, in Open Session, at 4:00 p.m., Thursday, April 3, 2003, in the East Oval Room of the Rotunda; Gordon F. Rainey, Jr., Rector, presided. William G. Crutchfield, Jr., Ms. Susan Y. Dorsey, Thomas F. Farrell, II, Charles L. Glazer, William H. Goodwin, Jr., Mark J. Kington, Lewis F. Payne, Don R. Pippin, Terence P. Ross, Thomas A. Saunders, III, Ms. Georgia M. Willis, John O. Wynne, and H. Timothy Lovelace, Jr., were present.

John R.M. Rodney, the Student Member-elect, also was present.

Present as well were John T. Casteen, III, Leonard W. Sandridge, Alexander G. Gilliam, Jr., Paul J. Forch, Gene D. Block, Ms. Colette Sheehy, Robert D. Sweeney, Ms. Patricia M. Lampkin, Robert E. Reynolds, M.D., Ms. Yoke San Reynolds, Steven H. Kaplan, and Ms. Jeanne Flippo Bailes.

The Rector opened the meeting by introducing the new Members: Ms. Dorsey, Mr. Payne, Ms. Willis, and Mr. Wynne. He also introduced Mr. Rodney, the Student Member-elect. He then commented on Mr. Lovelace, the current Student Member, and thanked him for his service on the occasion of this, his last Board meeting.

## RESOLUTION OF COMMENDATION TO HERBERT TIMOTHY LOVELACE, JR.

At the Rector’s request, the Secretary presented a resolution thanking and commending Mr. Lovelace. On motion, the following resolution was approved:

WHEREAS, Herbert Timothy Lovelace, Jr., of Roanoke, matriculated in the College in 1999; and\
WHEREAS, Mr. Lovelace has been a leader in a wide variety of extracurricular activities and at the same time a recognized scholar, having won Intermediate Honors and election to the Raven Society; and\
WHEREAS, Mr. Lovelace became the Student Member of the Board of Visitors in April, 2002, and has served the Board with great distinction; and\
WHEREAS, Mr. Lovelace’s term as the Student Member expires on April 5, 2003;

RESOLVED, the Board of Visitors thanks its friend and colleague Tim Lovelace for his counsel and devoted service to the Board and to the University, and wishes him well when he matriculates in the School of Law in the fall.

## APPROVAL OF THE MINUTES OF THE JANUARY 31-FEBRUARY 1, 2003 MEETING

### President’s Commission on Diversity and Equity

### Alumni Engagement Task Force

### Gifts and Grants

The Rector called for a motion to approve the Minutes of the meeting of January 31-February 1. The motion was offered and the Minutes were approved.

The President made his customary report.

He reviewed several racial incidents that have occurred at the University over the last few months and announced that he will create a President’s Commission on Diversity and Equity. The membership will include faculty, students, representatives of the administration, alumni, parents and community members. The list of members will be announced in the next several weeks.

The commission will be charged with evaluating University programs that address issues of diversity and equity; identifying gaps in programs and suggesting remedies for filling those gaps; reviewing previous University studies on diversity and equity and examining comparable programs elsewhere for recommendations that should be implemented; and developing a “best practices” model. The commission will begin work later in the month and will deliver its final report to the President by May 1st, 2004, and will issue quarterly reports previous to that.

The President emphasized that he expects the commission to recommend specific courses of action for consideration by the University administration and the Board.

The previous weekend, at a Virginia 2020 session with the Alumni Board of Managers, the President said he had announced his intention to form the Alumni Engagement Task Force, a proposal which was endorsed by the Board of Managers. The Task Force will be asked to examine alumni relations programs in detail, and to make broad recommendations concerning approach, programs, resource allocation, and reporting structure.

The President reported private giving through January 31st, of the current fiscal year has amounted to $188.6 million, an increase of .45% over the comparable period last year.

Significant gifts since the last meeting of the Board include $4.5 million from Paul T. Jones, II, and Sonia K. Jones to athletics and to the College, in addition to a $1 million pledge to the Jefferson Scholars Foundation for a graduate fellowship to benefit the College. Mr. and Mrs. Goodwin have given $4,675,000 for athletics, the Medical School, historic preservation, the Darden School and The University of Virginia’s College at Wise. A $1 million deferred gift from Dr. Carol R. Angle to the Art Museum.

John and Bobbie Nau of Houston have made a commitment of $8.5 million for the building in the South Lawn Project that will house the History Department.

Funds raised for the Arena have reached $75 million and construction will begin shortly in order that the Arena can be open for the 2006-07 basketball season. Two significant recent gifts are $5 million from Mr. and Mrs. Goodwin and an additional $10 million – beyond their initial pledge of $20 million – from Mr. and Mrs. Paul Jones.

The President reported, too, that he expects a large gift for the fine arts to be made before the next Board meeting.

On motion, the Board accepted the President’s Gifts and Grants Report.

## RESOLUTION OF COMMENDATION FOR MR. C. RAY SMITH

The Rector noted that Mr. C. Ray Smith of the Darden School is retiring from the faculty after 42 years. He asked the Provost to present a resolution honoring Mr. Smith and marking the occasion. Mr. Block read the following resolution which on motion was approved by the Board:

WHEREAS, C. Ray Smith was raised in Bassett, did his undergraduate work at Bridgewater College, and matriculated in the Darden School in 1956; and\
WHEREAS, Mr. Smith took his M.B.A. in 1958, a member of the second Darden class, and returned in 1961 to join the faculty; and\
WHEREAS, Mr. Smith thus is the longest serving member of the Darden faculty and has taught virtually every living alumnus of the School; and\
WHEREAS, Mr. Smith was elected a full professor in 1971 and Tipton R. Snavely Professor of Business Administration in 1981; and\
WHEREAS, Mr. Smith continues to teach but also has held virtually every significant administrative position at the Darden School, including appointment as interim dean on three occasions; and\
WHEREAS, Mr. Smith is also Executive Director of the Darden School Foundation; and\
WHEREAS, Mr. Smith intends to retire on the occasion of the 45th reunion of his Darden class in the spring of 2003;

RESOLVED, the Board of Visitors salutes C. Ray Smith, exemplary good citizen of the University, thanks him for his years of devoted service, and extends him every best wish in his retirement.

Mr. Robert Harris, Dean of the Darden School, thanked the Board and spoke to Mr. Smith’s years of devoted service to the University. The President commented as well.

## SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON GOVERNANCE

The Rector asked the Vice Rector, Mr. Farrell, to report on the work of the Special Committee on Governance, appointed after the last Board meeting by Mr. Ackerly, who designated Mr. Farrell as Chair.

Mr. Farrell said the Committee, whose members are Messrs. Crutchfield, Goodwin, Saunders and Vaughan, has held several meetings; other Members of the Board have participated in the Committee’s deliberations. His report, he said, would be preliminary as the Committee has not yet finished its work.

The Committee suggests that Board committees as much as possible hold their working meetings outside the context of Board of Visitors meetings. These meetings could be held on Friday mornings, concurrently if necessary. The regular Board meeting would begin after lunch on Friday and continue through Saturday morning. Members and their spouses would still gather informally at Carr’s Hill on Thursday evening, but otherwise the Board would not meet on Thursday.

Mr. Farrell then commented on each of the Board’s standing committees:

* **Audit** – the Audit Committee should become the Audit and Compliance Committee and it should act more like a corporate audit committee. An important part of its expanded functions should be oversight of the University’s compliance with NCAA regulations.

* **Buildings and Grounds** – the current issue of the Board Manual specifies instances of architectural decisions that can be made by the Committee without reference to the full Board. The Special Committee, however, agreed that there are instances where the whole Board should be involved in these decisions; the preliminary conclusion was that the Rector and the Chair of Buildings and Grounds would decide when projects should be referred to the full Board.

* **Educational Policy** – the Special Committee agreed that the Educational Policy Committee should be revitalized. The Committee suggested that the President, the Rector, the Provost, and the Chair of Educational Policy – with perhaps additional comments by Deans – meet to examine the charter of the Committee and suggest how it might be restructured.

* **External Affairs** – the External Affairs Committee should be charged with the planning and execution of the Capital Campaign. Relations between the Board and the various foundations are at present partly overseen by the External Affairs Committee and partly by the Finance Committee; these relationships must be examined further.

* **Finance and UVIMCO** – there is concern about the potential lack of continuity of Board of Visitors Members on the UVIMCO Board. This question needs further study.

* **Health Affairs** – the Special Committee recommends that this committee be abolished as its functions have been assumed by the Educational Policy Committee and by the Medical Center Operating Board. The Chair of the Health Affairs Committee, Dr. Vaughan, concurs in this recommendation.

* **Student Affairs and Athletics** – discussion in the Special Committee focused on the proposal to separate these functions, create a new standing committee, and assign student affairs to one and athletics to the other. After a great deal of discussion, the Special Committee concluded that it did not have enough information to make an intelligent recommendation. It is important that there be an “in depth” look into the oversight of athletics.

* **Committee on Wise and Executive Committee** – the Special Committee saw no need to recommend changes in the functions of these committees.

* **Special Committee on Diversity** – the Special Committee on Governance recommended that the Rector appoint a Special Committee on Diversity to consider a number of these issues and to determine the Board’s specific responsibility in oversight.

Mr. Farrell observed that the Special Committee would continue its work and that perhaps some of the issues it has raised could be discussed at the Board Retreat in July.

The Rector concluded that two recommendations of the Special Committee called for immediate action: the abolition of the Health Affairs Committee and the creation, by him, of a Special Committee on Diversity. After discussion by the Board and noted approvals from Dr. Vaughan – in absentia - , the President and Mr. Sandridge, the Rector entertained a motion to abolish the Health Affairs Committee. The motion was approved.

## ABOLITION OF THE HEALTH AFFAIRS COMMITTEE

WHEREAS, the academic responsibilities of the Health Affairs Committee have been assumed by the Educational Policy Committee and the oversight of the Medical Center by the Medical Center Operating Board;\
RESOLVED, the Health Affairs Committee of the Board of Visitors is abolished.

## CREATION OF THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON DIVERSITY

The Rector announced that on the recommendation of the Special Committee on Governance, he was creating the Special Committee on Diversity, to be chaired by Mr. Thompson. In addition to Mr. Thompson, there will be five members who will be appointed later in the month. The Special Committee on Diversity will report to the Board at the Board Retreat in July. Initially, it is to consider:

* The scope of efforts to promote diversity among members of the student body, faculty of all schools, staff and administrators;
* The scope of efforts to promote diversity in external relations of the University, including with surrounding communities and all aspects of procurement of goods and services;
* Efforts to promote understanding among all elements of the University community; and
* The appropriate role of the Board in continuing oversight of diversity issues.

(A copy of the Rector’s charge is appended to these Minutes as an Attachment)

The meeting of the full Board was recessed at 5:05 p.m., for the meeting of the Committee on The University of Virginia’s College at Wise.

The Board reconvened in Open Session at 1:55 p.m., Friday, April 4, 2003, in the East Oval Room of the Rotunda; all Members present at the previous meeting were present, with the addition of Mr. Thompson.

After adopting the following motions, the Board went into Executive Session:

That the Educational Policy Committee of the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia go into Executive Session for the purpose of discussing personnel matters pertaining to the appointment, assignment, reappointment, promotion, performance, compensation, discipline, separation and resignation of specific employees of the University of Virginia; as provided for in Section 2.2-3711 (A) (1) of the Code of Virginia.

That the Board of Visitors go into Executive Session to confer with General Counsel on litigation risks involving the University, and to receive privileged legal advice from counsel on legislation governing meetings of this body and, further to evaluate with legal counsel a contested personnel termination and continued participation in a medical limited liability company that will also involve discussion of proprietary, business-related information of the University’s Medical Center where disclosure at this time would adversely affect its competitive position as provided for in Section 2.2-3711 (A) (1), (6), (7), (8), and (23) of the Code of Virginia.

That the Buildings and Grounds Committee of the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia go into Executive Session for the purpose of discussing a personnel matter pertaining to the appointment of a specific employee of the University of Virginia; as provided for in Section 2.2-3711 (A) (1) of the Code of Virginia.

The Board adopted the following resolution certifying the legality of its Executive Session discussions and recessed at 3:20 p.m., to reconvene at 3:30 in the Dome Room of the Rotunda:

Mr. Rector, I move that we vote on and record our certification that, to the best of each Board member’s knowledge, only public business matters lawfully exempted from open meeting requirements and which were identified in the motion(s) authorizing the closed session, were heard, discussed or considered in closed session.

The Board assembled in the Dome Room, in Open Session, at 3:30 p.m., and approved the following resolution creating the Harrison Distinguished Professorship in Medicine:

## ESTABLISHMENT OF THE HARRISON DISTINGUISHED PROFESSORSHIP IN MEDICINE

WHEREAS, the late David A. Harrison, III, of Prince George County, an alumnus of the College and of the School of Law, made generous gifts and bequests to various elements of the University; and\
WHEREAS, Mr. Harrison’s last benefaction to the School of Medicine amounted to $20.3 million, to be used to fund chairs and provide academic support; and\
WHEREAS, the School of Medicine has designated $19.3 million of this for professorships in the School and $1 million for the Harrison Scholars Awards in Medicine, a prize to recognize excellence in teaching; and\
WHEREAS, the President and the School of Medicine have requested the establishment of the Harrison Distinguished Professorship in Medicine with $2 million of Mr. Harrison’s bequest; and\
WHEREAS, it is the intention of the President to request from the Board of Visitors in the future the establishment of additional professorships in the School of Medicine with funds from the Harrison bequest;

RESOLVED, the Board of Visitors establishes the Harrison Distinguished Professorship in Medicine, to be held in the School of Medicine, and once more pays tribute to the magnificent generosity of David A. Harrison, III, to the University of Virginia.

## THE BIM PATTON PRESS BOX AT THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA BASEBALL STADIUM

The Board heard a report from the President on the naming of the Bim Patton Press Box at the University of Virginia Baseball Stadium. The Press Box was named in memory of the late James Doddridge Patton, III, of Richmond, known as “Bim.”

The Board recessed for the day at 4:00 p.m.

The Board resumed its meeting, in Open Session, at 10:40 a.m., on Saturday, April 5th, in the East Oval Room of the Rotunda. All Members present at the sessions the day before were present, save Mr. Farrell.
