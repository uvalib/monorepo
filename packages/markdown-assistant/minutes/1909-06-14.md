At the June meeting of the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia, at 10:30 A. M. on above date, in the President's Office,

**Present:** The Rector, and Visitors Shackelford, Flood, Drewry, Irvine, White, Craddock, and Harmon.

The Board was called to order by the Rector, and the following adopted,—;

Whereas, certain subscriptions were made and agreed to be given to the General Alumni Association Endowment Fund of the University of Virginia after the said Association had been organized under the Act of the General Assembly of Virginia of March 7, 1903, and prior to the creation of "The Alumni Board of Trustees of the University of Virginia Endowment Fund" as constituted by the deed of February 15, 1908, from The General Alumni Association of the University of Virginia to Joseph Bryan, Thomas Nelson Page and others, Trustees constituting such board, which said subscriptions were as follows:

And, whereas, the parties who made the said subscriptions desired to pay the same before the said Board of Trustees had been constituted, as provided in the charter of the said Association, and the Rector and Visitors of the said University agreed to receive the said subscriptions for the Endowment Fund of the said Alumni Association, and the same was accordingly paid to the said Rector and Visitors prior to the formation of the said Board of Trustees, and have been invested and are now held by the said Rector and Visitors;

Therefore, it is resolved and ordered by the said Rector and Visitors of the University that all of the aforesaid subscriptions and all the securities in which the same or any part thereof have been invested by or in the name of the said Rector and Visitors, be paid, transferred, assigned, turned over and delivered to the aforesaid Alumni Board of Trustees of the University of Virginia Endowment Fund to be held by the said Board of Trustees under and in pursuance of the aforesaid deed of February 15, 1908; and all the officers, agents and employees of this Board are hereby instructed and directed for and on behalf of this Board to pay, transfer and deliver all the aforesaid monies and securities which came into the hands of this Board from the subscriptions aforesaid or were acquired by this Board by way of investment of the said subscriptions or any part thereof. And the Rector of the University of Virginia, acting by and with the advice and concurrence of President E. A. Alderman shall ascertain and determine what monies and securities shall be paid, transferred and delivered to the said Board of Trustees of the said Alumni Association under this resolution.

Resolved: That the title of the School of Practice of Medicine and Pediatrics be changed to that of Practice of Medicine.

Resolved: That the correspondence of Prof. G. O. Davis, relating to the Lynchburg Alumni Scholarship, be referred to President Alderman, with authority to act.

Resolved: That the President write Mr. John Kevan Peebles, Architect, in answer to his letter of June 11th, regarding compensation for his services in connection with the "Law Building" plans, etc.

Resolved: That the Rector and Visitors of the University accept with gratitude the gift by Mrs. Mary S. Venable of a portrait of Col. J. Thompson Brown.

Resolved: That the Rector and Visitors of the University accept with gratitude the gift by Mr. Samuel Broaddus of a portrait of Dr. John A. Broaddus.

Resolved: That the Rector and Visitors of the University accept with gratitude the gift by Miss Julia S. Tutwiler of a bust and portrait of her father, Prof. Henry Tutwiler.

Resolved: That the Rector and Visitors of the University accept with gratitude the gift by Mrs. Randolph McKim of a portrait of Dr. Randolph H. McKim.

Resolved: That the Rector and Visitors of the University accept with gratitude the gift of the children of Dr. Haslett McKim of a lot of Biological instruments.

The following resolution of the Academic Faculty was approved:-

1. It is recommended that a course in Public Speaking be added to the list of Academic electives-at-large.

2. It is recommended that the candidate for either baccalaureate degree shall be permitted to offer, in lieu of one elective-at-large, either two or three short courses,—;provided that the short courses shall together constitute,—;in length of time required, amount of work required, and standard,—;the full equivalent the average B.A. course now offered in the College.

Whereas, it appears to this Board that Mr. H. G. Whitmore pursued the course of Organic-Physical Chemistry during the session of 1908-'09, with the belief that it was an "M.A. Course;" that this section of the Chemistry Course was not offered before the present session, and was not in the catalogue prior to the catalogue issued in March 1909; and that on April 7th, 1909, Mr. Whitmore wrote to the Chairman of the Committee on Academic Degrees, the following letter,—;

I hereby ask my application for the Degree of Master of Arts be changed to the following form:

I. Courses completed,

II. Course to be completed; any one of the following three:

(same as 5D of Catalogue in effect Sept. 1908).

There are other candidates having similar conditions.

And whereas it further appears that Mr. Whitmore was informed that his request as set out in his letter had been granted, in consideration of these facts, and in view of the provisions in the Catalogue, on Page 165, it is recommended by the Board that the action of the Faculty in refusing the M. A. Degree to Mr. Whitmore, be reconsidered.

Resolved: That the Superintendent of Grounds and Buildings, with the advice of the Committee on Buildings and Grounds, be, and is hereby instructed to investigate the feasibility and practicability of enlarging the power and heating plant of the University, so as to provide power, heat and lights for all, or as many as may be desirable, of the buildings now on the University grounds and those in immediate contemplation, and to meet all probable requirements of the University for the next twenty-five years, and to report in detail the result of these investigations to the Visitors at a meeting not later than \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Should the report be favorable to the installation of a central plant of the scope above indicated, the Superintendent of Grounds is requested to furnish detailed information suggested under the headings next below.

(a) Cost of enlargement and equipment of power plant.

(b) Cost of extension of wiring, steam pipes and fittings in buildings not now served by the power plant, including the new Law Building.

(c) Probable revenue, estimated conservatively, from heat and light furnished private parties, including dormitories on the grounds.

(d) Upon same basis estimate value of light, heat and power furnished the University buildings, including Law building.

(e) Estimate cost of pipes, hydrants, hose, underwriter's pump, \&c., necessary for installation of adequate fire protection facilities for all buildings on the University grounds.

$300.00, or so much of same as may be needed, is hereby appropriated for carrying into effect this resolution.

Resolved: That $450.00 be appropriated for maintenance of Laboratory in Pharmacology.

Resolved: That $150.00 be added to the salary of Prof. Faulkner.

Resolved: That the Bursar be authorized to pay the bill of Messrs. Loring, Coolidge, and Noble for fees in the matter of the Austin Estate.

Resolved: That a Committee of two be appointed to confer with a committee of the Miller Board on the subject of Forestry. Committee appointed by Rector, Mr. Irvine & Dr. Drewry.

This Board has observed with marked interest and admiration the speech of Dr. Alderman delivered at Petersburg, Virginia, in May last on the occasion of the reception of President Taft, and believing that such an able tribute to the Commonwealth of Virginia should be put in some enduring form for preservation and proper distribution; therefore

Resolved: That the Committee cause to be printed 5000.00 copies of the said oration, and send 20 copies to each member of the Board and distribute the others as directed by Committee on Publication.

On motion, the Board adjourned, subject to the call of the Rector.
