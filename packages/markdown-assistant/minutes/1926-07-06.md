A special meeting of the Rector and Visitors was called on this date to consider matters pertaining to the Blandy Farm bequest, with the following members present: Hull, McIntire, Rinehart, Scott, Williams, Walker, Mrs. Munford and President Alderman.

Upon the recommendation of the President the appointment of Dean J. L. Newcomb as Assistant to the President was approved in the following resolution:

**RESOLVED**, by the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, That Dean J. L. Newcomb be and is hereby elected Assistant to the President, for the year 1926-27, at a salary of $1,500, incumbency to begin September 1, 1926.

Upon the recommendation of the President the following elections to the faculty were unanimously approved:

**RESOLVED**, by the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, That Mr. Frank Bane, Commissioner of Public Welfare, be and is hereby elected Associate Professor of Applied Sociology, at a salary of $1,200 and traveling expenses, incumbency to begin with the session of 1926-27.

**RESOLVED**, by the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, That Mr. Henry G. cker be and is hereby elected Instructor in Education for the year 1926-27, at a salary of $500.00.

The committee appointed to report on the Blandy Farm bequest made the following report, which was adopted: (Mrs. Munford desiring to be recorded as not voting, writing as follows:

"I am reluctantly not voting on this proposition because I very strongly approve of the acceptance of the Blandy Farm by the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia, but I think that should the policy be pursued which the discussion in the Board indicated with reference to Mrs. Blandy, the widow of the donor of the farm, we might very well find ourselves involved in some legal difficulty owing to her anxiety as evidenced by her letter read at the Board meeting, which indicate,d I thought, that she felt disturbed lest the purpose of her husband in making this gift to the University might not be carried out according to his wishes.

As the only woman on the Board, and myself a widow, I sensed a danger in not dealing with Mrs. Blandy in a more direct nd sympathetic way than we seemed up to that point to have done. It was, therefore, with peculiar regret that I felt myself obliged not to vote in regard to a proposition which involved agricultural education in connection with the Univer- sity of Virginia.")

Whereas Graham F. Blandy, deceased, of New York City, has by his last will and testament, dated November 5, 1925, provided in the Ninth Clause of said will:

I give, devise and bequeath to my said wife all that portion of my farm in Clarke County, Virginia, as shown in a survey made by C. H. Purcell, September 22, 1904, being my original purchase of land from the Boyce family, known as "The Tuleyries" consisting of about 210 acres with all buildings thereon including contents of buildings and all live stock on said farm, and I give and devise the remainder of my said farm to the UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA, situated at Charlottesville, provided the Board of Trustees or other governing body of said University will agree to and does call said farm "THE BLANDY EXPERIMENTAL FARM", and will run it to teach boys farming in the various branches, including fruit raising; but if said University shall refuse to accept said farm with the conditions attached thereto as specified herein, I direct that the remainder of said farm shall become part of my residuary estate, and that said remainder of said farm shall be sold. The refusal of said University shall be conclusively assumed, unless written acceptance of the gift of said remainder of my said farm and an agreement to conduct as specified heroin, duly signed by an authorized official of said University, shall be delivered to my Trustee, hereinafter named, within six (6) months after my death;

And, whereas the said Graham F. Blandy in the Eleventh Clause of said will has provided

Upon the death of my wife I direct my Trustee to pay to my nephew, GRAHAM BLANDY, Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000.00); to my nephew, DALLAM BLANDY, Twenty-five Thousand Dollars ($25,000.00); to my nephew ALEXANDER B. BLANDY, Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00); all the remainder of my estate I direct my Trustee to give, transfer and set over to the UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA, provided and only in event that said University has accepted the remainder of my said farm as hereinbefore devised under the conditions specified. Should the UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA fail to accept the gift of the remainder of my said farm under the conditions specified within six (6) months after my death, I direct that my Trustee shall pay over the remainder of my estate to such charity or charities or institutions as my wife shall direct by her Last Will and Testament.

And, whereas the said Graham F. Blandy in the Twelfth Clause of said will has provided

I hereby nominate, constitute and appoint my brother, ISAAC CRUSE BLANDY of Greenwich, New York, and my wife, GEORGETTE H. BLANDY, and/or the survivor, Executors of this my Will, and I do hereby direct that no bond or other security shall be required of either of them for the faithful performance of their duties as Executor. Upon the death of both of said persons I nominate, constitute and appoint the UNITED STATES TRUST COMPANY of New York sole executor. I hereby nominate, constitute and and appoint the UNITED STATES TRUST COMPANY of New York, Trustee of the Trusts created by this my Last Will and Testament. I hereby authorize said Trustee to hold in its discretion such securities as I may own at my death or to sell the same for such price and upon such terms as it may deem expedient, invest and reinvest the proceeds in securities which are lawful for the investment of trust funds under the laws of the State of New York, at the time of such investment or reinvestment.

Now, therefore, be it resolved by the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the University of Virginia hereby formally accepts the devise of the remainder of the said farm of Graham F. Blandy, as set out in the ninth and eleventh clauses of the will of said Graham F. Blandy hereinbefore quoted.

And be it further resolved by the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the University of Virginia solemnly undertakes and agrees to carry out and perform all the conditions attached to the aforesaid devise and residuary gift, set out in said will, namely to "call said farm 'THE BLANDY EXPERIMENTAL FARM', and will run it to teach boys farming in the various branches, including fruit raising."

And be it further resolved that the Rector of the University of Virginia be, and he hereby is, authorized and empowered to give notice of written acceptance of the gift to the United States Trust Company of New York, the trustee named in the said will, and also to the joint executors, Isaac Cruse Blandy and Georgette H. Blandy, and to sign, as an authorized official of said University, and deliver to said trustee and executors, and agreement to conduct said farm as specified in the Ninth Clause of the said will of Graham F. Blandy, deceased.

**TO:** Isaac Cruse Blandy and Georgette H. Blandy.

Pursuant to a Resolution of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, which is the governing body of said University, duly approved at a meeting thereof held at said University on the sixth day of July, 1926, a copy of which is attached hereto, written notice is hereby given you, as Joint Executors of the last will and testament of Graham F.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF said The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia has caused its name to be signed hereto by C. Harding Walker, its Rector and agent hereunto duly authorized this \_\_\_\_ day of July, 1926.

THE RECTOR AND VISITORS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,

BY,\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_RECTOR.

The President presented the following statement of the Medical Construction Fund:

I have the honor to announce the following gifts completely finishing the Medical Construction Fund. One hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) of this sum has been received since the last meeting of this Board from the General Education Board as an extra grant to their original $700,000.

The President read the correspondence he had had with Prof. Albert Lefevre, in which he stated that he had fully complied with the requirements of the resolution of the Board of June 24, 1925.

He was thereupon restored to his former status of Professor from July 1, 1926.

The agreement with the General Education Board in re. gift for Medical Buildings Fund was approved and the President was authorized to sign same on behalf of the Board.

The following resolution of the Alumni Board of Trustees in connection with the increasing of the salary of President Alderman was presented:

**WHEREAS**, Edwin Anderson Alderman, President of the University of Virginia, has rounded out the twenty-first year of his service to that institution, and by way of testimonial to his powers of leadership, his extraordinary ability in organization and administration, his exceptional educational, literary, and oratorical attainments, and his constant devotion to the University of Virginia, the Alumni Board of Trustees desires to signalize in some appropriate form its appreciation of his services;

**THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED**, that there be appropriated from the income of the Jefferson Memorial Fund, and paid in monthly installments by the Bursar from the income of that Fund, as received from the First and Merchants National Bank of Richmond, the sum of Two Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($2,500.00) per annum, this appropriation to be effective as of the close of the academic session of 1925-26, and to be paid to Dr. Alderman in addition to the salary now received by him.

The above resolution was passed by a mail vote.

Whereupon the Board adopted the following:

**RESOLVED**, That this Board has heard with pleasure and gratification of the action of the Alumni Board of Trustees of the University of Virginia Endowment Fund in appropriating annually from the income of said Fund, the sum of $2,500 to increase the salary of Pres. E. A. Alderman from $10,000 to $12,500, as set forth in the resolution of the said Board, and we wish to add our approval of the said appropriation.

The committee appointed at the June meeting to draw up a resolution of appreciation of the services of Pres. Alderman in raising the funds for the medical buildings, presented the following, which was adopted:

**RESOLVED**, That the Rector and Visitors record their deep appreciation of the accomplishment of President Edwin A. Alderman in raising, by his sold efforts, $1,152,250 for the University of Virginia, which with the State Appropriation of $250,000 makes available $1,402,250 for a group of much needed medical buildings.

While Dr. Alderman has previously, from time to time, been instrumental in securing large contributions for endowment and for new plant equipment, the Rector and Visitors recognize that he has shown remarkable faith, courage and resourcefulness in procuring this splendid fund for these medical buildings against many discouragements and almost insurmountable difficulties.

Since Dr. Alderman came to the University of Virginia as its first President he has not only added greatly to its endowment, its plant and its equipment, but by patient effort, coupled with exceptional tact and rare ability he has succeeded to a marked degree in interpreting the University to the people of the state as a source of its greatest strength, and to the outside world as a valuable national asset.

As in Dr. Alderman's vision the future of the University depended to no small extent upon the realization of the plan for these medical buildings the Rector and Visitors are firm in the conviction that the success of this enterprise, which he initiated, is but the beginning of greater usefulness of the University in every department. The state of Virginia, which regards the University with just pride, owes to Dr. Alderman a debt of profound gratitude for this added evidence of wise and effective leadership.

The President announced a gift of $1,000 by Mrs. B. B. Munford to the Medical Buildings Fund in memory of her husband, Col. B. B. Munford.

On motion, the meeting then adjourned.
