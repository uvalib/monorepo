## APPROVAL OF REVISIONS TO THE MILLER CENTER GOVERNING COUNCIL BYLAWS

The Governing Council of the Miller Center of Public Affairs voted unanimously at its April 2009 meeting to amend its Bylaws. Amendments must be approved by the Board of Visitors. Most of the proposed revisions clarify or conform the Bylaws to customary practice. Several revisions are new additions, including a conflict of interest provision. The addition of the office of Vice Chair is proposed, as well as prospective term limits for service on the Governing Council, applicable to members elected at its next meeting or subsequent to its next meeting.

A standing nominating committee is also proposed to formalize the nominating process. As set forth in the current Bylaws, pursuant to agreements between the University and the founding donor Burkett Miller, the Board of Visitors, under the revised Governing Council Bylaws, would continue to elect members of the Governing Council on nomination by the Council.

Revising and updating the Bylaws to reflect current practice in corporate governance will be beneficial in attracting new members to the Governing Council, as the Miller Center continues to build its national reputation.

The following resolution was adopted:

**WHEREAS**, the Miller Center of Public Affairs of the University and its Governing Council has certain rights and responsibilities concerning the Center; and

**WHEREAS**, since the Center’s founding in 1975, its Governing Council has operated under Bylaws approved by the Board of Visitors, which have been amended from time to time; and

**WHEREAS**, the Center’s Governing Council at its April 17, 2009 meeting, approved by unanimous vote among those present certain clarifying and procedural amendments to its Bylaws; and

**WHEREAS**, by the terms of the Bylaws of the Center’s Governing Council (Article XII, Section 2), the Board of Visitors must approve any amendments to the Bylaws;

**RESOLVED**, the amendments to the Bylaws of the Governing Council of the Miller Center of Public Affairs, shown below, are approved.

Projects undertaken should be brought into relationship to the on-going educational process at the University through participation of University faculty and students.

***

## NCAA Orientation

Mr. Abramson introduced Mr. Steve Flippen, Director of Compliance, who explained that Board members are considered “boosters”; they must be very careful to avoid any recruiting activity of student athletes or potential athletes, and they must be aware that any extra benefit provided to a potential student athlete, a former student athlete, or a current student athlete, could constitute an NCAA rules violation. If a Board member finds him or herself in a situation that could be considered recruiting or providing an extra benefit, the Board member should contact the Compliance office before taking any action.

***

## President’s Report

The President remarked on several matters prior to presenting the Gifts and Grants report.

President Casteen said that AccessUVA’s numbers have increased dramatically this year. This year, almost one-third of the first year class has at least some AccessUVA support. He referred to slides with statistics about the increase. The total cost of AccessUVA from all sources has increased from $39 million in Fall 2004 to an estimated $75 million for Fall 2009. The amount funded by endowment, unrestricted funds, and state grants is now over $40 million. He said that funding Access UVA should be a priority for everyone at the University.

The President provided statistics from the AAU Data Exchange on the University’s standing among AAU institutions when salaries are adjusted to take into account the cost of living in a region. When adjusted for cost of living, the University moves from 26th among U.S. AAU institutions to 15th among the same group.

The President reviewed the latest report on federal stimulus funds. The University has submitted funding proposals totaling $293 million, and to date the University is in line to receive $30.8 million in stimulus grant funds over a two-year period.

***

## Gifts and Grants Report

The President reported on the current fiscal year through July 31, 2009. Philanthropic giving to the University and its related foundations is $13,473,214.41 for the fiscal year. This is an increase of $3,867,210.81, or 40.26% above the results of the previous fiscal year. This year’s early increase is largely a result of significant gifts to the School of Medicine and the Medical Center.

The significant gifts received since the last meeting of the Board include the following:

* The Foundation for the National Institutes of Health private grant of $6,467,836 to the Internal Medicine Department in the School of Medicine for its Global Network for Malnutrition and Enteric Disease Research.
* Mr. Richard L. Sharp and Mrs. Sherry Sharp, through The Community Foundation of Richmond and Central Virginia, gift of $1,000,000 to the School of Medicine for the Emily Couric Clinical Cancer Center - 5th Floor.

* American Cancer Society private grant of $720,000 for the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics for its study of “Centromere Structure and Assembly.”
* Mr. John L. Nau pledge payment of $320,628 to the College and Graduate School of Arts & Sciences for the South Lawn Project.

Significant pledges since the last meeting include the following:

* John W. Kluge Foundation pledges of $1,000,000 and $2,000,000 to the Schools of Medicine and Nursing, respectively, for the Tussi and John Kluge Professorship in Palliative Care and the Tussi and John Kluge Professorship in Contemplative End-of-Life Care.
* Food Lion, Inc., pledge of $1,000,000 to the University of Virginia Children’s Hospital Building Fund.
* Mr. Paul Tudor Jones and Mrs. Sonia Klein Jones $500,000 pledge for the Klockner Baseball Stadium – Phase Two.

The President recommended that the Board accept the Gifts and Grants report. On motion, the Board approved the Gifts and Grants Report.

The Rector recessed the full Board meeting at 1:50 p.m. to begin the afternoon committee meetings.

The Board Reception Thursday evening was held in the Bayly Building, which was recently renovated. The Board heard brief remarks from Bruce Boucher, Director of the University Art Museum, and James Leach, former Member of Congress and newly named Chair of the National Endowment for the Humanities.
