Despite gloomy predictions of cutbacks in government funding of grants, and possible reductions in giving to the University, the President reported that both of these areas have held up well. Based on a two month sample, these will amount to about $70 million when annualized for this year.

## REPORT ON CONSTRUCTION

The President reported that extensive construction work valued at $652,000,000 is being done in the University Division, the Hospital Division, and the Clinch Valley College Division. He explained that these were discussed in detail in the Buildings and Grounds Committee meeting.

## REPORT ON LEGISLATIVE MATTERS

The President reported on a number of bills passed by the 1988 General Assembly which will affect the University. Among these he pointed especially to legislation on retirement which will permit the University to offer more attractive retirement incentives to faculty members. He noted that this has become especially important since the mandatory retirement age was eliminated by the General Assembly in 1987.

## ATTACHMENT A UNIVERSITY POLICY ON USE OF THE LAWN

\[This policy was originally adopted by President Robert M. O'Neil upon his receipt of the Final Report of the President's Ad Hoc Committee on the Use of the Lawn, dated September 24, 1986. That Policy was accepted by the Board of Visitors at its October, 1986 meeting. Subsequently, on May 15, 1987, President O'Neil amended paragraph B of the Policy.]

This report addresses the uses of that part of the University of Virginia Historic District which includes the entire area between McCormick Road and Hospital Drive (on the West and East, respectively) and University Avenue and the Boundary formed by Pavilions IX and X, Rouss Hall, Old Cabell, and Cocke Hall (on the North and South, respectively). Excluded, for example, is the Amphitheater.

The Lawn is the geographical and spiritual heart of the University. The entire University Community -- students, faculty, administrators -- are its trustees, as well as the beneficiaries of this beauty and usefulness. To us who are here now have been given both all the benefits that we currently enjoy from the Lawn and also the obligation to preserve those benefits for future generations.

The University Community has developed a proud tradition of mutual accommodations of all these diverse uses. The Lawn must perforce be open and accessible under reasonable rules and regulations (many of which are and have long been in place, administered, a.o., by the Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs, the Rotunda Administration, et al.).

The Lawn is replete with fragile, delicate structures and landscape content. Preservation is a constant concern and a burgeoning curatorial responsibility. That responsibility has been entrusted to the University as part of its fiduciary obligations to future generations. The danger that misuse of the Lawn presents to the historic edifices, and to their dependencies and surroundings, are real, not theoretical. Differing rules and regulations may apply to different parts of the Lawn -- e.g., the lower terrace may be governed by different safety precautions and regulations from those that apply to the upper three terraces. Moreover, space limitations and the plethora of requests for facilities perforce dictate orderly administrative rules, always provided that these rules will be content neutral.
