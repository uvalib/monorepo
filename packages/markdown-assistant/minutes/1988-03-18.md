Despite gloomy predictions of cutbacks in government funding of grants, and possible reductions in giving to the University, the President reported that both of these areas have held up well. Based on a two month sample, these will amount to about $70 million when annualized for this year.

REPORT ON CONSTRUCTION
----------------------

The President reported that extensive construction work valued at $652,000,000 is being done in the University Division, the Hospital Division and the Clinch Valley College Division. He explained that these were discussed in detail in the Buildings and Grounds Committee meeting.

REPORT ON LEGISLATIVE MATTERS
-----------------------------

The President reported on a number of bills passed by the 1988 General Assembly which will affect the University. Among these he pointed especially to legislation on retirement which will permit the University to offer more attractive retirement incentives to faculty members. He noted that this has become especially important since the mandatory retirement age was eliminated by the General Assembly in 1987.

ATTACHMENT A UNIVERSITY POLICY ON USE OF THE LAWN
-------------------------------------------------

\[This policy was originally adopted by President Robert M. O'Neil upon his receipt of the Final Report of the President's Ad Hoc Committee on the Use of the Lawn, dated September 24, 1986. That Policy was accepted by the Board of Visitors at its October, 1986 meeting. Subsequently, on May 15, 1987, President O'Neil amended paragraph B of the Policy.\]

This report addresses the uses of that part of the University of Virginia Historic District which includes the entire area between McCormick Road and Hospital Drive (on the West and East, respectively) and University Avenue and the Boundary formed by Pavilions IX and X, Rouss Hall, Old Cabell, and Cocke Hall (on the North and South, respectively). Excluded, for example, is the Amphitheater.

The Lawn is the geographical and spiritual heart of the University. The entire University Community -- students, faculty, administrators -- are its trustees, as well as the beneficiaries of this beauty and usefulness. To us who are here now have been given both all the benefits that we currently enjoy from the Lawn and also the obligation to preserve those benefits for future generations.

The University Community has developed a proud tradition of mutual accommodations of all these diverse uses. The Lawn must perforce be open and accessible under reasonable rules and regulations (many of which are and have long been in place, administered, a.o., by the Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs, the Rotunda Administration, et al.).

The Lawn is replete with fragile, delicate structures and landscape content. Preservation is a constant concern and a burgeoning curatorial responsibility. That responsibility has been entrusted to the University as part of its fiduciary obligations to future generations. The danger that misuse of the Lawn presents to the historic edifices, and to their dependencies and surroundings, are real, not theoretical. Differing rules and regulations may apply to different parts of the Lawn -- e.g., the lower terrace may be governed by different safety precautions and regulations from those that apply to the upper three terraces. Moreover, space limitations and the plethora of requests for facilities perforce dictate orderly administrative rules, always provided that these rules will be content neutral.

Purchase Order No. A507090 established a contract between the University of Virginia and the Bechtel International Corporation to provide a project management report and additional project management consulting services for the Replacement Hospital and Related Facilities project in accordance with Request for Proposal 8490, Addendum No. 1 issued August 1, 1984, Bechtel Proposal dated August 13, 1984; and a Memorandum of Understanding dated August 28, 1984. This purchase order provided for the provision of the Project Management Report on a lump sum basis and the provision of additional project management consulting services as required by the University of Virginia in accordance with pricing information included in the proposal.

Amendment No. 1 to Purchase Order No. A507090, dated February 20, 1985, provided for the delivery of additional project management consulting services, established the scope for the specific additional additional services required, established additional understandings concerning the provision and payment for such additional services, and established a project budget for their provision.

The University of Virginia now wishes to add to the scope of these project management consulting services and to extend their duration. This amendment establishes the scope of the specific extended services required, and establishes a projected budget for their provision.

Bechtel will provide the additional project management consulting services for an additional period in accordance with the basic scope description of Amendment No. 1, and will provide project staff in numbers and classifications and for such durations and at such locations as are specified in this amendment.

Extending beyond the duration of staffing provided for under Amendment No. 1, Bechtel shall continue to provide extended project management consultation to assist the owner in management activities on the project. Full-time, on-site project management staff will be provided by Bechtel to fill positions in the University's project management organization as agents of the University. This staffing shall include a project manager who will report to and receive direction from the University's project director, and will provide direction to other subordinate positions in the project management organization engaged directly by the University. Additional off-site support shall be furnished to the on-site staff from the Bechtel home office.

All other provisions of the original agreement and Amendment No. 1 relating to the provision of these project management consulting services shall remain unchanged.

In addition to the extended general project management and administration consulting services described above, Bechtel will continue to provide other special project management consulting services or assistance when required by the University under separately and additionally compensated effort. These additional special services will be provided only upon specific prior written authorization by the University as provided in Amendment No. 1.

The University of Virginia shall reimburse for all the necessary and reasonable costs and expenses incurred by Bechtel in the performance of the extended services in accordance with the pricing information for additional project management and consulting services provided in the Bechtel proposal dated August 13, 1984, and Amendment No. 1 of February 20, 1985, modified and amplified as follows:

Paragraph A(3)(a) and (b) of Amendment No. 1 are hereby amended to read as follows:

Grade Position Current Rates (1987) ($/day) 1988 Rates ($/day) (a) Off-site (home office assignments, technical) (1) (1) Actual rates for 1988 and thereafter will be determined under procedure used for 1987 and 1986/85. 30 Project Sponsor, Manager of Projects 905 29 Senior Project Manager, Chief Engineer 846 28 Project Manager; Engineering Supervisor 752 27 Assistant Project Manager, Project Operations Specialist; Technical Specialist 670 26 Technical or Operations Specialist; Project Administrator 575 25 Project Construction Coordinator; Administrative Specialist 481 24 Construction Engineer; Administrative Assistant 422 23 Administrative Assistant; Technologist 364 22 Administrative Assistant 317 (b) On-site (permanent assignments) 29 Resident Manager 717 28 Resident Manager (construction) 646 27 Assistant Resident Manager 564 26 Senior Construction Engineer; Contract Engineer 494 25 Construction Engineer; Contract Engineer 414 24 Expeditor 364

Actual rates for 1988 and thereafter will be determined under procedure used for 1987 and 1986/85.

These daily rates are based on a 40-hour work week, 5 days per week. Daily rates include payroll costs for secretarial and other non-technical staff supporting project-related activities at the home offices. The rates are a weighted average and are subject to adjustment as mandated by Bechtel's personnel policies and practices. Off-site positions shown in the above are for typical potential assignments. They may vary with project requirements. Billing will be on a time card basis for a given salary grade. Daily rates will be prorated if less than 8 hours-per-day are worked off-site. Travel time will be billed when traveling on project business.

It is agreed that extended on-site project management consulting staff, together with related off-site support services, will be provided in accordance with the following summary, and their costs shall be limited to the budget amount shown unless these amounts are increased by prior written agreement between the University and Bechtel. Any such increase will be considered an amendment to the contract, and shall be covered by Section 7 of Attachment B, Mandatory Contractual Provisions of the University's Request for Proposal No. 8350 of July 20, 1984.

Extended on-site project management consulting services will be provided by Bechtel for the duration of construction of vertical and horizontal expansion of the Replacement Hospital and renovations of the Multi-story Hospital which are scheduled to end at the beginning of 1990.

For these extended project management consulting services, Bechtel shall provide full-time on-site project management staffing as follows: Project Manager-October 1988 to December 1988Project Manager, Construction-October 1988 to April 1990Construction Engineer Multi-story Hospital-March 1988 to February 1990
