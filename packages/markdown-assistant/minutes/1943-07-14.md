Minutes of meetings of the university's governing body which is the legal owner and operator of the institution. Recorded in the minutes are appointments and other personnel decisions concerning faculty, decisions about construction of facilities, gifts to the university, and all other board actions, decisions and resolutions.

A special meeting of the Board was held on this date in the office of the President at 11 o'clock, A.M. There were present, R. Gray Williams, Rector, and visitors Garnett, Weaver, Corbitt, Lewis C. Williams and Edward C. Anderson, and President Newcomb.

The Rector advised the meeting of the death of Mr. Hollis Rinehart, a member of the Board, which occurred at his residence here on July 12th, and stated that he had called this special meeting for the purpose of having the members pay their respects by attending his funeral in a body.

On motion of Mr. Garnett, the Rector was requested to prepare appropriate resolution with respect to Mr. Rinehart, and presented the following memorial and unanimously approved by the Board:

### MEMORIAL TO HOLLIS RINEHART

ADOPTED BY THE RECTOR AND VISITORS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA AT A SPECIAL MEETING HELD ON THE 14TH DAY OF JULY, 1943, IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO ATTENDANCE UPON THE FUNERAL OF MR. RINEHART

BE IT RESOLVED, by the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, that the following Memorial to Hollis Rinehart is adopted, that a copy thereof be preserved upon the Minutes of this Board, and that a copy be sent to Mrs. Rinehart.

Hollis Rinehart died suddenly at his home, in Albemarle County, Virginia, on the 12th day of July, 1943, and The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia have met, this 14th day of July, 1943, to adopt this Memorial to him and to attend his funeral.

Appointed a member of this Board of Visitors in February, 1924, Hollis Rinehart has served continuously for more than nineteen years, and has displayed a lively interest in the welfare of our University until the very day of his death.

He was a member of the Finance Committee of this Board and was Chairman of the Board's Committee on Buildings and Grounds. He placed at the service of the University his sound and seasoned business experience, born of a long and successful business career.

In 1925, through his generosity and wisdom, there was established at the University of Virginia, "The President and Visitors' Research Prize," which is awarded annually to the author of the most meritorious paper presenting an original investigation in the fields of Mathematics and the Natural Sciences. In 1925, Mr. Rinehart also established the "Rinehart Scholarship." Appointment is made by the Rector and Visitors to a needy boy from either Albemarle County or the City of Charlottesville. Mr. Rinehart always stressed a need in the award of this scholarship, for he was vitally interested in providing the opportunity for a college education for a worthy local boy who did not, himself, possess the necessary funds.

Mr. Rinehart also contributed, annually, for a time, to the support of the Virginia Quarterly Review.

Mr. Rinehart was a native of Botetourt County, Virginia. His father, Captain William A. Rinehart, rode with J. E. B. Stuart in the War Between the States and Mr. Rinehart was proud of his father's record. As a member of his father's contracting firm, the Rinehart and Dennis Company, Mr. Rinehart participated in the building of the Maysville and Big Sandy Railroad, now the Chesapeake and Ohio, from Ashland, Kentucky, to Cincinnati, Ohio. This firm also built other railroads, constructed the Torresdale Water Works of Philadelphia, ten miles of the Catskill Aqueduct for the City of New York, and built, for the United States Government, Camp Lee, in Virginia, and two hydro-electric plants in North Carolina.

In his older life, after he had established his home in Charlottesville, Mr. Rinehart founded the National Bank and Trust Company, which he served both as President and as Chairman of the Board. He was interested in several other local corporations, and was active in founding the Farmington Country Club. A good citizen, of broad interests, he served for several years as a member of the Board of Supervisors of Albemarle County, and was a Charter Member of the local Rotary Club.

Courteous and wise in counsel, Mr. Rinehart contributed good sense and good judgment to the deliberations of this Board, and he responded promptly to every call of the President of this University for practical advice between sessions of this Board.

Mr. Rinehart enjoyed the respect and esteem of each member of this Board and the charm of his personality will linger as a fragrant memory in the hearts of each of us who were privileged to be associated with him in the services of the University.

The President stated to the members the difficulties he had experienced in preparing the usual annual budget for the University for the fiscal year beginning July 1; that it had been impossible to make an estimate of the income for the year until the contracts with the Army and Navy had been completed, and, further, until the number of cadets and students had actually registered on July 1; that the budget was now in process of compilation and copies would be mailed to the members in the next few days.

A meeting of the Board was fixed for Thursday, July 29, at 11 o'clock, A.M. for consideration of the budget, and such other matters as may be presented.

The meeting then adjourned.
