### Approval of the University of Virginia Policy Statement Governing Exercise of Procurement Autonomy by the University on Behalf of the Medical Center

The following resolution was adopted: WHEREAS the General Assembly of Virginia, during its 1996 session, enacted legislation ("enabling legislation") providing the University of Virginia with autonomy to conduct the procurement of goods, services, including professional services, and construction by the University on behalf of the University of Virginia Medical Center; and WHEREAS the legislation requires that the autonomy for procurements by the University on behalf of the Medical Center shall not be effective until the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia ("Board of Visitors") adopt guidelines that are generally applicable to such procurements and that are based on competitive principles and meet certain other requirements of the enabling legislation; and WHEREAS the Board of Visitors finds that the proposed "Policy Statement Governing Exercise of Procurement Autonomy by the University on Behalf of the University of Virginia Medical Center" ("Medical Center Procurement Policy Statement"), attached hereto, constitutes the guidelines required by the enabling legislation and is appropriately designed to ensure both efficiency and competition in procurements by the University on behalf of the Medical Center and to ensure accountability for such procurements by both the President and other appropriate officials in the central administration of the University and in the Medical Center; and WHEREAS the attached Medical Center Procurement Policy Statement was published in the Virginia Register on May 22, 1996 as "proposed" regulations to be considered by the Board of Visitors, and after the Board of Visitors considers the proposed Medical Center Procurement Policy Statement and makes any changes to that document it deems appropriate, the Statement as adopted by the Board of Visitors will be published a second time in the July 1996 issue of the Virginia Register as the Board of Visitors' final regulations on the subject; RESOLVED that based upon the expressed and implied powers of the Board of Visitors to protect and preserve the University's interests and resources, the Medical Center Procurement Policy Statement, attached hereto, be approved, effective upon the date of its second publication in the Virginia Register; and RESOLVED FURTHER that the President be delegated the authority (1) to implement the adopted and approved Medical Center Procurement Policy Statement in the manner he deems most appropriate; (2) to delegate further to other appropriate officials, including appropriate Medical Center officials, the administrative responsibility to implement and ensure compliance with the Medical Center Procurement Policy Statement; and (3) to establish whatever internal reporting requirements he deems appropriate to ensure compliance with the Medical Center Procurement Policy Statement and to protect the interests of the University.

### Approval of the University of Virginia Policy Statement Governing Exercise of Medical Center Personnel Autonomy

The following resolution was adopted: WHEREAS the General Assembly of Virginia, during its 1996 session, enacted legislation ("enabling legislation") providing the University of Virginia with increased autonomy regarding the adoption of personnel policies and a unified personnel administration system for employees of the University of Virginia Medical Center, and with considerable autonomy and flexibility regarding the adoption of alternative retirement, health care plans and insurance plans for Medical Center employees; and WHEREAS the primary reason the University sought enactment of the enabling legislation was to give the University, on behalf of the Medical Center, the autonomy and flexibility to enable management of the Medical Center to make and implement promptly decisions necessary to conduct the affairs of the Medical Center in an efficient manner so that the Medical Center can compete effectively with other providers of health care who are not subject to the requirements of law applicable to agencies of the Commonwealth; and WHEREAS the Medical Center employs approximately 4,200 faculty and staff, composed of approximately 140 members of the general faculty, 2,500 health care providers and 1,500 classified employees; and WHEREAS the Rector and Visitors of the University ("Board of Visitors") recognize the hard work and dedication of these employees and wish to ensure that their rights and interests are protected through a personnel system that is fair and equitable; and WHEREAS the current personnel system governing members of the general faculty at the Medical Center is the University of Virginia Faculty Handbook (1994) and the Provost's Office Handbook; as those documents are amended from time to time, and the current personnel system governing health care providers is the University of Virginia Human Resources Policies and Procedures Manual; and WHEREAS the current personnel system governing other Medical Center employees is the University of Virginia Human Resources Policies and Procedures Manual, and for those employees who are classified as State employees, the Virginia Personnel Act also is applicable; and WHEREAS the enabling legislation provides that, effective July 1, 1996, all employees of the Medical Center will be exempt from the Virginia Personnel Act; and WHEREAS the general faculty of the Medical Center and those Medical Center employees who have been designated as "health care providers" have been exempt from the Virginia Personnel Act for a number of years; and WHEREAS there are alternative personnel systems in place at the Medical Center for health care providers and general faculty, but there is no alternative personnel system available for other employees of the Medical Center, including those who, until July 1, 1996, will have been covered by the Virginia Personnel Act, and there is a need, therefore, to have an alternative personnel system in place for these other Medical Center employees by July 1, 1996; and WHEREAS the Board of Visitors recognizes that in the future the Medical Center may need to adopt changes to the personnel systems for its employees so that it may remain competitive with its private sector counterparts; and WHEREAS the Board of Visitors finds that the proposed "Policy Statement Governing the Exercise of Medical Center Personnel Autonomy" ("Medical Center Personnel Policy Statement"), attached hereto, is consistent with the requirements of the enabling legislation and is appropriately designed (1) to protect the rights and interests of Medical Center employees; (2) to provide the autonomy and flexibility for needed for the Medical Center to compete effectively with its private sector counterparts; and (3) to ensure accountability by both the President and other appropriate officials in the central administration of the University and in the Medical Center for the development and implementation of an appropriate personnel system for Medical Center employees; RESOLVED that, based upon the expressed and implied powers of the Board of Visitors to protect and preserve the University's interests and resources, the Medical Center Personnel Policy Statement, attached hereto, be adopted and approved, effective July 1, 1996; and RESOLVED FURTHER that, although the proposed Medical Center Personnel Policy Statement does not propose or authorize any changes in current Medical Center compensation plans, alternative retirement plans, health care plans or insurance plans, the President is directed that any proposals for such changes in the future must be presented to the Board of Visitors for its review and approval; and RESOLVED FURTHER that the President be delegated the authority (1) to implement the adopted and approved Medical Center Personnel Policy Statement in the manner he deems most appropriate; (2) to delegate further to other appropriate officials, including appropriate Medical Center officials, the administrative responsibility to implement and ensure compliance with the Medical Center Personnel Policy Statement; and (3) to establish whatever internal reporting requirements he deems appropriate to ensure compliance with the enabling legislation and the Medical Center Personnel Policy Statement and to protect the interests of the University and of Medical Center employees.

### THE RECTOR AND VISITORS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA POLICY STATEMENT GOVERNING EXERCISE OF POST-APPROPRIATION AUTONOMY FOR CERTAIN NON-GENERAL FUND CAPITAL PROJECTS

**I. Preamble**

Chapters 995 and 933 of the 1996 Acts of Assembly (House Bill No. 884 and Senate Bill No. 389, respectively) delegated limited but significant autonomy to the University of Virginia to establish its own post-appropriation system for undertaking the implementation of non-general fund capital projects for the University of Virginia Medical Center. In general, the autonomy is designed to replace the traditional post-appropriations system of reviews, approvals, policies and procedures carried out by a variety of central State agencies identified in the enabling legislation. The University's system for carrying out the post-appropriation capital outlay process for non-general fund capital projects of the Medical Center is to be governed by policies adopted by the Board of Visitors. Similarly, § 4-5.08 of the 1996 Appropriation Act delegated nearly identical limited autonomy to the University as a whole for non-general fund capital projects authorized for the 1996-1998 biennium. This latter delegation of autonomy is subject to certain conditions, the foremost of which is that the Board of Visitors must adopt a system of reviews and approvals for University non-general fund capital projects and submit the proposed system for prior approval to the Secretaries of Finance and Administration prior to September 1, 1996.

The following provisions of this policy statement constitute the adopted Board of Visitors policies regarding both Medical Center non-general fund capital projects and other University non-general fund capital projects.

**II. Definitions**

The following words and terms, when used in this policy statement, shall have the following meaning unless the context clearly indicates otherwise:

"Board of Visitors" means the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia.

"Capital project" and "project" mean Medical Center non-general fund capital projects and University-wide non-general fund capital projects unless the text expressly differentiates between Medical Center projects and projects involving the remainder of the University.

"Enabling legislation" means Chapters 995 and 933 of the 1996 Virginia Acts of Assembly (House Bill No. 884 and Senate Bill No. 389, respectively) and § 4-5.08 of the 1996-1998 Appropriations Act.

"University" means the University of Virginia, including the Medical Center unless otherwise expressly stated.

"University of Virginia Medical Center" or the "Medical Center" means that part of the University of Virginia Health Sciences Center consisting of the University of Virginia Hospital, referenced in the 1996-98 Appropriation Act as Agency 209, and related health care and health maintenance facilities.

**III. Scope of Policy**

The current pre-planning process and budget development process for capital projects has not been altered by the enabling legislation. Consequently, this policy statement will only apply to post-appropriation implementation of capital projects which are funded entirely by a non-general fund appropriation made by the General Assembly. Specifically, this policy applies to items identified as authorized capital projects for the University of Virginia or the University of Virginia Medical Center in an Appropriation Act enacted by the General Assembly and approved by the Governor. For non-Medical Center projects at the University, this policy is applicable only during the 1996-1998 biennium unless extended or continued by a subsequent act of the General Assembly. During the 1996-1998 biennium, projects costing less than $500,000 are exempt from this policy, except that the provisions of Section IX shall apply to any project costing in excess of $100,000. For purposes of this policy statement, the term "project" or "capital project" excludes any project funded with a general fund appropriation, in whole or in part. In addition, the terms and structure of any financing of any capital project shall remain subject to other provisions of law including, but not limited to, § 2.1-179 of the Code of Virginia.

**IV. Project Management System**

The President or his designee is authorized to implement a system for the management of University capital projects. The system may include the delegation of management authority to appropriate University officials, including a grant of authority to such officials to engage in further delegation of authority as the President or his designee deems appropriate.

The management system for capital projects shall be designed to ensure that such projects comply with the provisions of this policy statement and other Board of Visitors policies applicable to closely related subjects such as selection of architects or policies applicable to University buildings and grounds.

The management system may include a reporting system applicable to capital projects whereby University officials responsible for the management of such projects provide appropriate and timely reports to the President or his designee on the status of such projects during construction. The project status reporting system adopted by the President or his designee may include requirements for prior consultation with and approval by the President or his designee as are deemed appropriate.

**V. Project Size and Scope**

It shall be the policy of the University of Virginia that the implementation of capital projects shall be carried out so that the project as completed is the project authorized by the General Assembly. The President or his designee shall ensure strict adherence to this requirement.

Accordingly, no Medical Center capital project shall be materially increased in size or materially changed in scope beyond the plans and justifications which were the basis for the project's appropriation, either before or during construction, unless: (i) the President or his designee determines that such increase in size or change in scope is necessary due to an emergency and the Governor concurs in such determination, or (ii) the General Assembly approves such increase or change in a subsequent appropriation.

Similarly, no University capital project other than a Medical Center capital project shall be materially increased in size or materially changed in scope beyond the plans and justifications which were the basis for the project's appropriation, either before or during construction, unless such increase in size or change in scope is required because of circumstances determined by the Governor to be an emergency. Minor increases in square footage shall be permissible if they are determined by the Director of the Department of General Services to be reasonable based on a written justification submitted by the University stating the necessity for the increases, with the condition that such increases would not increase the cost of the project beyond the amount appropriated.

**VI. Project Cost**

(a) It shall be the policy of the University of Virginia that capital projects be completed for an amount which is less than or equal to the sum appropriated therefor by the General Assembly. The President or his designee shall ensure strict compliance with this requirement. The President or his designee shall make appropriate periodic reports to the Board of Visitors on the status of projects.

(b) The President or his designee is authorized to include in the project management system implemented pursuant to Section III of this policy authorization for designated University officials to approve construction contract change orders and to approve professional services contract change orders.

(c) Subject to the limitations set forth elsewhere in this policy regarding change orders and material increases in size or material changes in scope, the President may propose and the Board of Visitors may approve a transfer of funds during any fiscal year in order to supplement funds appropriated for any Medical Center capital project, provided that:

(i) the transferred funds are transferred from a non-general fund appropriation for the Medical Center; and

(ii) the project to which the funds are transferred is a Medical Center non-general fund capital project authorized by the General Assembly; and

(iii) the amount transferred does not exceed 15% of the sum appropriated for the Medical Center project to which the funds are transferred unless the Board of Visitors determines that special circumstances necessitate the transfer of an amount in excess of 15% of that sum in which case the amount transferred shall not exceed the limitations set forth in § 23-77.4(1)(a)(iii) of the Code of Virginia; and

(iv) the Board of Visitors finds that the transfer is necessary to effectuate the intention of the General Assembly in making the original appropriation for the Medical Center project or projects in question.

Should it become necessary for the President or his designee to seek a transfer of funds to supplement amounts appropriated for a University capital project other than a Medical Center capital project, the procedures set forth in the 1996 Appropriation Act shall be utilized.

**VII. Acquisition of Land for Capital Projects**

It is the policy of the University that projects involving land acquisition will be subjected to thorough inquiry and due diligence prior to closing on the acquisition of such land. The President or his designee shall ensure that the management system implemented pursuant to Section III provides for a review and analysis of all pertinent matters relating to the acquisition of land as any prudent purchaser would perform to the end that any land acquired by the University shall be suitable for its intended purpose, that the acquisition can be made without discernible risk of liability to the University and that the cost of the land to be acquired, together with any contemplated development thereof, will be such that compliance with the provisions of Section VI of this policy statement is achieved. In addition, the President or his designee shall ensure that, where feasible and appropriate to do so, the following specific policies pertaining to the acquisition of land for capital projects are carried out.

(a) Environmental and Land Use Considerations. While pre-appropriation activities relating to planning and budget development of capital projects are not subject to this policy statement, it is sometimes the case with projects involving land acquisition that certain environmental and land use planning requirements cannot be fulfilled until after the appropriation process has been completed. In such cases, depending on the cost of the land and any contemplated development thereof, the University may be required, as a matter of law, to file an Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") with the Department of Environmental Quality ("DEQ") in order to perfect its authority to expend funds for a capital project (see Section IX). If an EIR requirement is applicable in the post-appropriation phase of a project involving land acquisition, the project management system implemented by the President or his designee pursuant to Section IX shall assure that no closing on such land acquisition takes place until after the EIR requirement has been fulfilled.

It is the policy of the University to cooperate with each locality to whom an EIR is furnished by DEQ during the post-appropriation phase of a project involving land acquisition. Such cooperation shall include but not be limited to furnishing any information which the locality may reasonably request and reviewing any requests by the locality with regard to any such capital project. The University will assure examination of the zoning and comprehensive plan designation of the land and surrounding parcels by the locality, as well as any designation of historically or archeologically significant areas on the land by state or federal agencies.

(b) Infrastructure and Site Condition. The President or his designee shall ensure that, in the case of projects involving the acquisition of land, the management system implemented under Section III provides for a review of the following matters prior to acquisition of the land: that the land can be developed for its intended purpose without extraordinary cost; that an environmental engineer has been engaged by the University to provide an assessment of any environmental conditions on the land; that there is adequate vehicular ingress and egress to serve the contemplated use of the land; that utilities and other services to the land are adequate; and that the condition and grade of the soils have been examined to determine if any conditions exist which would require extraordinary site work or foundation systems.

(c) Title and Survey. An ALTA survey shall be prepared for the land and an examination of title to the land shall be conducted by a licensed attorney or, in the alternative, a commitment for title insurance shall be procured from a title insurance company authorized to do business in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Based upon the survey and title examination or report, the President or his designee shall conclude, prior to acquisition of the land, that title to the land will be conveyed to the University in fee simple, free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, covenants, restrictions, easements or other matters which may have a significant adverse effect upon the University's ability to own, occupy, convey or develop the land.

(d) Appraisal. An appraisal shall be conducted of the land to determine its fair market value and the consistency of the fair market value with the price agreed upon by the University.

**VIII. Capital Project Compliance With The Code Of Virginia**

Among the requirements of the enabling legislation is that, notwithstanding the delegation of limited, post-appropriation autonomy to the University regarding University-wide and Medical Center capital projects, all such projects must nevertheless comply with the provisions of the Code of Virginia regarding capital projects, excluding only the review, approval, policy and procedure functions of central State agencies which are referenced in the enabling legislation.

It therefore shall be the policy of the University that capital projects shall be implemented so as to comply with the requirements of the Code of Virginia and the Appropriation Act applicable to capital projects, including those enacted in the future, except to the extent the Code of Virginia or the Appropriation Act exempts such projects from those requirements. The President or his designee shall take all necessary and reasonable steps to assure (i) that University officials responsible for the implementation of capital projects are knowledgeable regarding the requirements of the Code of Virginia and the Appropriation Act regarding capital projects, and (ii) that compliance is achieved.

**IX. Environmental Impact Reports**

The Board is cognizant that the Department of Environmental Quality is authorized pursuant to provisions of Title 10.1 of the Code of Virginia to require all state agencies to submit an environmental impact report ("EIR") for any state project which involves (i) the acquisition of any interest in land for any state facility construction or (ii) the construction of any facility or the expansion of any facility if such acquisition or construction costs $100,000 or more. Accordingly, it is the policy of the University of Virginia that, in all cases in which an EIR is required but has not been filed with DEQ during budget development, no land acquisition shall take place and no construction on such land or previously acquired land shall be commenced for any capital project until the University has complied with the EIR requirements as set forth in the Code of Virginia and the DEQ guidelines and has done so in a timely manner so as not to adversely affect the project.

**X. Project Inspections And Certification For Occupancy**

(a) Medical Center Projects. Building Code and fire safety inspections shall be conducted for all Medical Center capital projects, and the State Fire Marshal or his designee shall inspect projects prior to certification for occupancy by the University's Assistant State Building Official ("ASBO"). The ASBO will be responsible to the Board of Visitors for ensuring that necessary plan reviews and inspections are conducted prior to certification for occupancy. The Chief Facilities Officer will be the University ASBO as long as the incumbent is a registered professional engineer or architect; the ASBO shall maintain a staff of registered professionals in the major engineering disciplines and architecture who will perform the required reviews and inspections.

(b) Non-Medical Center Capital Projects. For any University capital project other than a Medical Center capital project, the Department of General Services, acting through the Division of Engineering and Buildings, shall continue to function as the State Building Official pursuant to § 36-98.1 of the Code of Virginia.

**XI. Reporting Requirements**

The President or his designee shall report to the Department of General Services on the status of any capital project prior to the commencement of construction and at the time of acceptance of any such capital project. In addition, the President or his designee shall promptly comply with any request for a report on the status of any capital project made by the Governor or the General Assembly pursuant to §§ 2.1-403 and 2.1-404 of the Code of Virginia, respectively.
