B. Johnson Barbour late Rector called the Board to order, and on motion, it was resolved that he be requested to act as Rector pro tempore.

The Rector PT laid before the Board a report which had been unanimously adopted by the Faculty at a meeting held on the 22nd instant, requesting that some definite arrangement be made before the close of the session for filling the vacant Chair of Chemistry and Pharmacy- and also a report from the Proctor exhibiting the condition of the finances of the University-

Whereupon

Resolved, that a committee of three (of which the Rector pro tem shall be one) is appointed to confer with the Faculty in reference to the Chair of Chemistry and Pharmacy- and to counsel with the Trustees of the "Miller Fund" on all points in which said Chair pertains to the Department of Agriculture-and the said Committee is further instructed (as far as is compatible with the discharge of the duties above imposed) to consider the financial condition of the University, and to report the result of their investigations to the next meeting of this Board. The Committee under the foregoing resolution consists of Messrs. Barbour, Kean and Woods.

Resolved, that Mason Gordon Esq. be appointed Commissioner of Accounts for the University of Virginia- before whom the Proctor shall make his monthly settlements- provided that the fee for each settlement shall not exceed the compensation now allowed by law to Commissioners in Chancery for similar work under orders of the Court and provided further that the fee for each settlement shall not exceed ten dollars.

Resolved, that the Proctor submit to the Board of Visitors through the Chairman of the Faculty, at the regular meeting in June next, a detailed estimate of the expenditures for the ensuing fiscal year, showing under appropriate heads, the various items of necessary expenditure, basing such estimates upon the average expenditures of past years, as far as applicable and having regard to a rigorous economy.

Resolved, that in view of the financial condition of the University developed by the report of the Proctor transmitted to this Board at the present meeting by the Chairman of the Faculty, and of the suggestion contained in his letter, the Chairman and Faculty are requested to give special consideration to the subject of Scholarships as a means of financial relief, in the Report to the next regular meeting of this Board to be made under the first Resolution adopted by the Board of Visitors on the 2nd August 1864- and to make such other suggestions looking to the improvement of the finances of the University as they may deem expedient.
