The Board met this morning present the same gentlemen as on yesterday with the addition of J. B. Baldwin Esqr Whereupon the Rector called the Board to order when the following proceedings were had.

A letter from Prof Bledsoe having been received asking leave of absence from the University for the purpose of delivering three lectures at the Smithsonian Institute.

Resolved that while the Board feel unwilling to interfere with the engagement already made by Prof Bledsoe, and therefore grant his request they do not wish to be understood as approving of engagements on the part of Professors inconsistent with the regular performance of their duties in the University.

Resolved that hereafter the Rector be requested to have a copy of his semi-annual report to the President and Directors of the Literary fund transmitted to each of the Visitors one month before it is transmitted to the proper authority.

Resolved that the loans already made by the Proctor from the office of the Farmers Bank of Virginia at Charlottesville under the direction of the Executive Committee, of two thousand dollars in February be approved, and the Proctor be authorized to borrow in March one thousand dollars and in April seven thousand dollars for the uses of the University and the two bonds one payable July 1st 1860 and the other July 1st 1861 given for the sale of the Dawson farm be deposited in said Bank as collateral security.

Resolved that the application of Mr. Lanza for additional compensation with the title and position of Professor, endorsed as it is, by Prof. Shele, meets with the favorable consideration of this Board - but inasmuch as there is a bare quorum present, this Board will defer to the regular meeting, any change in the School of Modern Languages, as at present organized.

The Proctor having in his report to the Board at this meeting submitted an account of Gales & Seaton against the University commencing in the year 1848 and never heretofore presented but which appears from said report not to have been paid. Therefore Resolved that the Proctor be instructed to pay the said account but without interest inasmuch as it would have been paid at any time on presentment and as the University has derived no advantage from the delay.

The communication of Mrs. Mary J. Smith in reference to the land belonging to her which has been overflowed by the University ice pond was referred to the Executive Committee.

The Board of Visitors beg leave to call the attention of the Professors to the following resolution passed June 30th 1857.

"Resolved that it shall be the duty of each Professor having in his custody for use, in connection with his school any property belonging to the University, to keep constantly a complete list and inventory of such property, subject at all times to the inspection of the Executive Committee and that such inventories be laid before the Visitors at every meeting."

A communication from Thomas B. Holcombe Esqr Librarian of the University having been laid before the Board, upon consideration thereof, it was resolved that the salary of Thomas B. Holcombe Esqr librarian from and after the first of September 1860 shall be one thousand dollars per annum until the further order of the Board.

The consideration of the foregoing resolution in relation to the compensation of Thomas B. Holcombe was postponed until the regular annual meeting of the Board.

It appearing from the report of the Executive Committee that Prof. Shele was recently absent from his duties in the University for about a fortnight, in consequence of the severe illness of a near relative.

Resolved that under the circumstances Prof. Shele is excused for such absence.
