University, Va.

June 10, 1918.

The annual June meeting of the Rector and Visitors was held on this date with the following members present: Rector Irvine and Visitors Hatton, Bryan, Norton and Robertson.

The minutes of the meeting of May 15th were approved.

Prof. J. L. Newcomb, representing the University in the Training School for Motor Truck Drivers, appeared before the Board in the matter of amending the existing contract with the War Department as to the per-diem charge for said training, housing and subsistence to cover the cost of erecting an additional building to be used as a dining hall and kitchen, as the combination buildings now being used for said purposes have proven inadequate. After a full discussion of the matter it was disposed of in the following, offered by Judge Norton and adopted:

RESOLVED: First, That the Board is unwilling to change the contract with the United States Government, entered into April 5th, 1918, except that the Board is willing to so modify said contract as to remit to the Government, upon final settlement, all profit; and Further, is willing to agree to pay for a desired additional building in consideration of an advance in the rate per man of five cents per day, and return to the Government any profit made.

RESOLVED: Secondly, That G. R. B. Michie, John Stewart Bryan, Prof. J. L. Newcomb and Allan Perkins be and they are hereby appointed a Special Committee to consider changes, modifications, or additions to said contract, within the scope of resolution 1 above, and that the Rector is authorized to execute and deliver a contract or contracts in the name and on behalf of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia carrying any such changes, modifications or additions, and that the the same be entered on the minutes.

The following report of the Special Committee on lighting contract with the C. & A. Ry. Co. was submitted, read and adopted, and referred to the Attorney for the University with instructions to prepare the necessary contract to carry same into effect:

Concerning the proposition of the C. & A. Ry. Co. for connecting with the University plant, we recommend the following:

1st. That all expenses for labor, materials and equipment growing out of this change be borne by the C. & A. Ry. Co. (i.e. Meters, Motors, Lines, etc.).

2nd. That meters at points of distribution be furnished and installed free of charge to the University. That they be replaced by the University meters at the beginning of neating season (on or before October 10th) also free of charge.

3rd. That on May 10th, 1919 the C. & A. Ry. Co. must again put in their same equipment under the same conditions as above and on October 10th remove and replace the University material, meters, etc., as in this season, 1918.

The recommendation of the Medical Faculty, as set out in the following communication from Dean Hough, that the fourth year work in said department begin June 24th and run until March 1, 1919, was approved:

Under date of May 28, a communication was received from the Office of the Surgeon General of the Army requesting all medical schools which can possibly do so to begin the session 1918-1919 for fourth year medical students not later than July 1, so that the Class of 1919 may be graduated by the end of February or early in March 1919. This measure is to help meet the extraordinary demand for medical officers for the Army which is sure to come within the next year or so.

In accord with this request the Medical Faculty has voted to begin the fourth year work for the coming session on Monday, June 24, and to run continuously until March 1, 1919 at which time the class will receive their diplomas. The other three classes of the medical school will have the usual schedule for the coming session.

Prof. Maphis, of the Special Committee in the Smith-Hughes appropriation for Agricultural Education in the University, made a report of the matter to the Board, after which the following resolution was adopted:

RESOLVED: That after having hear Prof. Maphis in the matter of the Smith-Hughes professorship, the matter of going forward with the University's part of the Statework and the employment of Prof. Scott be left with the President with power to act.

The following committee was appointed by the Rector to look into the matter of administering the Ryan Scholarships and report to the Board: Judge Norton, Mr. Hatton, and Mr. Bryan.

The following motions were adopted:

RESOLVED: That the Superintendent of Buildings and Grounds be authorized to lay in at least 1,000 tons of coal during the summer for use next winter.

RESOLVED: That the heating arrangement with the Colonnade Club be revised by a committee consisting of Mr. Michie, the President, Superintendent of Buildings and grounds.

RESOLVED: That when the Pavilion now occupied by Professor Francis H. Smith becomes vacant, the courtyard between this house and the house occupied by Professor Minor be restored to its original state as designed by Mr. Jefferson; that the whitewashed board fence, wood shed and coal houses be removed. This alley is the most prominent cross axis of the University, and in its present encumbered state is very unsightly.

The President reported that it had been with very great difficulty the services at the Chapel were kept up during the session just closed, and that the Committee on Religious Exercises had recommended, after very careful consideration, that the chapel services be discontinued for the coming session owing to the expected small attendance and the difficulty experienced in securing preachers. The matter was left with the President with power to act.

The Special Committee, consisting of Judge Norton, Mr. Hatton and the President, appointed to draft appropriate resolutions with regard to Mr. Armistead C. Gordon's services as a member of the Board of Visitors and Rector of the University submitted the following, which were adopted:

The retirement of Hon. Armistead C. Gordon from the Board of Visitors of the University, after sixteen years of service, marks an epoch in the history of the institution.

The disaster wrought by the fire of October 27, 1895, fell during his first term of office (1894-1898) and in the labours of reconstruction he bore an important and honourable part.

Out of the problems of reconstruction arose the movement for creating an executive head for the University and of this movement Mr. Gordon was both the spirit and the spokesman.

Reappointed in 1906, after an interval of eight years, he was at once chosen Rector of the Board under which the new president was to exercise his office. He was continued as Rector by successive elections for twelve consecutive years until his retirement in 1918.

Himself an alumnus of the University of Virginia, saturated with her traditions of character and conduct and scholarship, he brought to the service of his Alma Mater not only the wisdom of a deep affection, but also the knowledge and sympath of a man of letters, the breadth of view of a thoughtful publicist, and the sustained devotion of a faithful son. With an energy that never faltered, a patience that never tried, a love that never grew cold, he made of public duty a private pleasure and a patriotic privilege.

The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia desire to make official record of their esteem and respect for this distinguished citizen and son of Virginia and do hereby resolve

I. That this statement of the service as Visitor and Rector of Hon. Armistead C. Gordon be spread upon the minutes of the Board.

II. That a copy of these proceedings over the signature of the present Rector be communicated to Mr. Gordon by the Secretary of the Board.

President Alderman reported to the Board the receipt of the memorial tablet to James McConnell from the University of Paris, which has been acknowledged by him on behalf of the Board, as follows:

I am empowered and directed by the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia to convey to you the deep appreciation and gratitude of the University for the commemorative tablet in honor of James Rogers McConnell, an old student of this Institution who gave his life for France. This tablet shall be set up in a conspicuous place upon the walls of this University, and shall serve as a tie to bind together in everlasting affection and memory the two great nations now struggling to protect the freedom of mankind against a menace of tyranny and oppression.

Upon the recommendation of the President, Prof. J. L. Manahan was granted a leave of absence to enter the service of the War Department.

The Superintendent of Buildings and Grounds, in response to a request of the Board at a former meeting, submitted a report on the fire protection afforded the University by fire plugs, hose, etc., which was read and ordered filed.

The proposal of the Medical Class of 1918 for the Richard Henry Whitehead Endowment Fund, as outline in the following letter, was accepted by the Board with its approval and appreciation.

I would like to submit for your approval and that of the Board assembled, the enclosed plan of an endowment fund to be raised in the future for the Medical School of the University, and in beloved commemoration of the late Richard Henry Whitehead. The plan is that of the Graduating Class in Medicine, with a view to extending it to the alumni and also the future classes in Medicine.

## THE RICHARD HENRY WHITEHEAD ENDOWMENT FUND OF THE MEDICAL CLASSES OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA.

In recognition of our great indebtedness to the University of Virginia for our training in Medicine, and in beloved commemoration of Richard Henry Whitehead, we, the undersigned, do hereby pledge ourselves to give at some time to the Medical School one thousand dollars each, or as much as our financial status shall allow, toward the establishment of an endowment fund to be called by the above title.

Furthermore be it understood that the above shall be payable to the Bursar of the University of Virginia, and only the interest thereof used by such authorities as shall have just administration of such affairs, for promoting the welfare of the Medical School.

Be it also understood that the privilege of donation be not confined to this Class, but an attempt be made to elicit the cooperation of the future classes graduating in Medicine.

Signed:
