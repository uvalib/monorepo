The Rector and visitors ordain and enact as follows.

A Patron of the Students of the University shall be hereafter appointed for the purpose of receiving & administering the funds to be expended by them while at the University;- who before he enters upon the duties of his office shall give bond with good security, in a penalty of Twenty thousand dollars payable to the Rector and Visitors of the University, conditioned well and truly to account for and pay to them entitled to receive it all monies or other funds which may come to his hands by virtue or by colour of his office, and faithfully to discharge all the duties of his office.

Such bond given during the sitting of the Board of Visitors must be approved by the Board, and given during their recess must be approved by the Executive Committee, and their approbation endorsed on the back of the Bond. When thus given and approved it shall be filed by the Secretary and carefully preserved.

If any bond be given by the Patron otherwise than is herein provided, and delivered to the Visitors, their Secretary or other agent, and the Patron afterwards actually proceed to execute the duties of his office or any of them, the Bond so given shall be deemed good and valid to bind the Patron and his surety or sureties, and their representatives, according to the legal import of the terms thereof;- but the Patron himself as soon as the variance of his bond from the requisitions of this enactment shall be discovered shall be removed from office either by the Board in session or by the Executive Committee in the recess of the Board, unless a proper bond be forthwith given.

The Patron shall be appointed by the Board, or in their recess by the Executive Committee, by writing under their hands and seals; and vacancies occurring during the recess of the Board may be filled by appointment under the hands and seals of the Executive Committee subject to the approval or disapproval of the Board at their ensuing meeting.

He shall be the Patron of all Students resident within the precincts; for the purpose of receiving and administering the funds to be expended by them, while at the University.

All the Funds of Students placed in his hands or made subject to his control, in pursuance of this or any other enactment of the Visitors shall be administered by him as herein provided, unless otherwise specially directed by the laws of the University.

First: He shall retain out of such Funds a commission of two per cent, as a compensation for his services in administering them.

Second: Upon the warrant of the Proctor, he shall pay to the professors whom each Student shall desire to attend, their tuition fees, and deliver to the student the professors' tickets of admission into the schools; shall pay to the Hotel keepers, at the expiration of each month what shall be due them respectively for Board, after deducting what they may owe for rent, or may be chargeable with on account of failure to repair their tenements, or on account of any other delinquency, and shall pay to the Bursar the sums due from the Students for the use of the Dormitories and public rooms, the sums due from the Hotel keepers for rent, and the sums due from the Students and Hotel keepers for other charges against them.

Third: He shall pay for all books and stationary, all articles of clothing and other supplies contracted for by the Students within the limits of the Funds placed in his hands for these purposes respectively, & according to the rules & regulations of the University; provided that no such payment shall be made unless to the order of the Student endorsed upon a bill containing a distinct account of each item, and the price thereof, signed by the person to whom it is due.

Fourth: He shall pay the orders of the Students drawn upon him from time to time, on account of Pocket money; provided such orders do not exceed at any time the amount in his hands deposited for that purpose, and do not in any quarter of the session exceed a due proportion of the amount allowed for pocket money for the whole session, by the laws of the University.

Fifth: At the end of the session or whenever the Student shall be expelled or dismissed from the University or shall withdraw from it by leave of the Faculty, or dies during the session the patron shall pay over to him, or his representatives, parent or guardian whatever balance may be in his hands to the credit of the Student after deducting therefrom all proper charges against him.

From Students not resident within the precincts of the University, the patron upon the warrant of the Proctor shall receive all money to be paid by them for tuition fees and the use of the public rooms, & the money required as a deposit to cover contingencies, with two per cent on the whole for the patron's commission; and retaining his commission shall pay the professors' fees, pay to the Bursar what is due for the use of the public rooms, and pay the surplus, if any, to the Student, his parent, guardian or representative.

When the Patron receives the money of any Student he shall give him a fair receipt therefor, specifying the several purposes to which it is to be applied, and the amount appropriated to each purpose;- which receipt shall be deposited with the Proctor, to be by him carefully preserved;- and, if the Student desire it, the patron shall, at the same time give him a duplicate receipt for his own keeping.

He shall keep regular books in which shall be entered fair accounts of all his receipts and disbursements, and for every disbursement he shall take and preserve an authentic voucher.

He shall, under no circumstances mingle the funds received by him as patron with the funds held by him in his own, or any other right, but he shall preserve them, so distinct and so designated, that they may at all times be ascertained, and applied to the purposes for which they may have been received. To further this purpose and the more effectually to guard against accidents, he is required to open an account, in the Bank of Virginia at Richmond in the name of the patron of the Students of the University of Virginia; and, without delay to deposit to the credit of that account all money & all other funds received by him as Patron which are not to be immediately disbursed. The funds so deposited shall be disbursed by checks drawn by the patron for the time being and payable to order.

His accounts and vouchers shall be at all times subject to the inspection of the Chairman of the Faculty & the Executive Committee,- shall be regularly exhibited to the Chairman for inspection at the end of each month; and shall be laid before the Faculty and the Visitors whenever required. On the first day of each annual meeting of the Visitors he shall lay before them a fair statement of his accounts of the preceding year, & at the end of each session he shall furnish to the parent or guardian of the Student a fair copy of his account.

If the Chairman of the Faculty perceive that the patron is in default in any respect, in the Administration of the Funds committed to his care, he shall forthwith report the default to the Executive Committee and to the Faculty in order that the proper correctives may be applied. And if the Executive Committee find that he hath improperly converted to his own use any funds entrusted to him as patron, or mingled such funds with his own, or with the Funds of others; or retained in his own hands what he ought to have deposited in Bank, he shall be removed from office.

The Patron shall reside within the precincts, & shall be allowed to occupy the buildings & grounds now occupied by the Proctor, on the same terms on which he has been heretofore allowed to occupy them. He shall be assistant to the Proctor in enforcing the police of the Institution, so far as to aid when called on, in preventing all breaches of the law, and bringing the offenders to punishment; and so far as to report to the proctor all breaches of the law by students or others which shall come to his knowledge. He shall moreover when called upon by the proctor aid him in making estimates & contracts for building & repairs, & in settling the accounts of contractors & undertakers.

The patron shall be authorised to keep a book store within the precincts of the University and a suitable apartment shall be assigned him by the Executive Committee rent free; he maintaining the repairs thereof but not being answerable for unavoidable accidents by fire or tempests; provided that he shall keep on hand a constant supply of the text books required in the University, and shall furnish them to such students as desire to purchase of him of good quality, at reasonable prices to be judged of by the Faculty, and not exceeding in any case fifteen per centum advance upon costs; and to enable the Faculty to judge of the prices his invoice shall be laid before them.

If the Patron, in disbursing the Funds of the Students shall pay for any article of merchandise or for any supplies not warranted by the laws & regulations of the University; or shall in any other manner disburse them or any part of them contrary to the provisions of this or any other enactment of the University; besides being liable to an action on his official bond, he shall pay to the Bursar for the benefit of the University, a fine not exceeding double the amount of the improper disbursement to be assessed by the Faculty:- and if he shall neglect or violate any other duty prescribed to him by the laws of the University, besides being liable to an action on his bond, he shall pay to the Bursar, for the Benefit of the University a fine, not exceeding twenty dollars for any one offence, to be assessed by the Faculty.

No Student resident within the precincts shall matriculate till he shall have deposited with the Patron all the money, checks, bills, drafts, & other available Funds which he shall have in his possession or under his control, in any manner intended to defray his expenses while a Student of the University, or in his return from thence to his residence. Nor shall he matriculate till he shall have deposited a sum at least sufficient, after deducting the patron's commission, to pay for the use of his dormitory and the public rooms;- to pay the fees of the professors whom he may design to attend;- to pay three months board to his Hotel keeper; and to purchase the text books and stationary he may want at the commencement, & ten dollars to cover contingent charges & assessments against him. If he deposit more than this, he shall designate the uses to which it is to be applied, whether for board, for clothing, for books and stationary or for pocket money; Nor shall he matriculate till he shall have produced to the proctor the patron's receipt for the deposit so made.

In like manner he shall deposit with the Patron all the Funds, which he shall receive while a student of the University, for the purpose aforesaid, designate the uses to which they are to be applied, take the patron's receipt therefor, and forthwith deliver it to the proctor.

At the end of the first three months of the session he shall deposit enough to pay his board and other expenses for the next three months, and at the end of the second period of three months he shall deposit enough to pay his board & other expenses for the residue of the session.

If the student fail to deposit in advance the two last instalments of his board as herein required, or to produce the patron's receipt to the proctor; and shall be in default for ten days, the proctor shall report him to the Chairman of the Faculty, that proper measures may be taken to compel performance, and if necessary to punish the default.

Upon the final settlement of the patron with each student about to leave the University, or having left it, the patron shall take from him a written declaration to the following effect:

I do hereby declare that I have deposited with the patron all the Funds which have been received by me, or have been under my control since I matriculated according to the obvious intent and meaning of the enactments upon that subject and that I have received from him the sum of —;—;—;—; in full for the balance in his hands due me.

If the Student shall not have deposited all his funds then the form of the declaration shall be altered by adding an exception of the sum not so deposited and the patron shall be entitled to a commission of four per cent on the amount thereof.

If the Student shall refuse to give such written declaration the patron shall be entitled to demand and receive from him the sum of twenty dollars in addition to his commission on the Funds deposited.

In all cases in which the Student shall fail to make the written declaration above required, or in which it shall appear that he has not deposited the whole of his funds with the patron pursuant to the enactments, the patron shall report the fact to the Chairman of the Faculty in order that it may be laid before the Faculty and visitors, and otherwise properly animadverted upon:- For such offence the student shall be liable to any of the punishments prescribed by the Enactments minor or major; and the Chairman shall communicate the delinquency to the parent or guardian; Provided however that when a student shall have made a written declaration of the amount not deposited by him, no other penalty than the payment of the four percent as above prescribed shall be inflicted.

The proctor shall no longer perform the duties of patron to the Students; and before he enters on the duties of his office, he shall give bond with good security in the penalty of ten thousand dollars payable to the Rector and Visitors of the University, and conditioned for the performance of all the duties of his office - Such bond shall be given approved and preserved in like manner as the bond above required from the patron, and shall in like manner be valid and binding tho' not taken according to the requisitions of this enactment.

The Proctor shall perform all the duties of proctor and assistant proctor as now prescribed by the Enactments, except so far as they are taken from him or varied by this enactment; & the office of assistant proctor, shall be and is hereby abolished - Buildings and grounds for the accommodation of himself and Family shall be assigned him from time to time by the Executive Committee subject to the control of the Board; which buildings and grounds he shall occupy on the same terms on which the present proctor has been allowed to occupy them now in his possession.

He shall receive a compensation for his services of a thousand dollars per annum, payable quarterly as the salaries of the other officers are paid.

He shall issue his warrants to the Bursar from time to time to receive all monies due from students, Hotel keepers, and others whether for rents fines assessments or otherwise, stating in each warrant the exact amount to be received, and on what account due:- and he shall open an account in his books against the Bursar in which he shall enter to his debit all warrants drawn in his favor, and to his credit all warrants drawn upon him. He shall moreover keep a regular account on his books of all monies paid to the patron by Students, as evidenced by the receipts returned to him. Both of these accounts embracing the transactions of the preceding year, shall be fairly copied and laid before the Visitors on the first day of each annual meeting of the Board.

It shall be the duty of the proctor to appoint a fourth Hotel keeper, and assign him his apartments. All Hotel keepers are enjoined to be diligent in aiding the Proctor to maintain the police of the Institution, and it shall be their duty to report to him all offences against the enactments which come to their knowledge whether they be called upon or no. They shall moreover at least once a week if required by the Proctor, visit the rooms of the Students in the morning, and report to him all violations of the law requiring early rising.

The Janitor shall in like manner be assistant to the Proctor, and when required by the Proctor he shall visit the Dormitories in the morning and report to him all violations of the law requiring the Hotel keepers to put the rooms in order and requiring the Students to rise early.

Whenever the washing for any student shall not be done by the Hotel keeper in a proper manner, the Faculty may authorise the Student to have it done by another and deduct the price thereof from his board.

Resolved, That a new edition of the laws of the University, having prefixed the acts of Assembly establishing and regulating the Institution, and an index added, be prepared by the Secretary of the Board, and printed under the direction of the Executive Committee, who will prescribe the number of copies. The professor of law is respectfully asked to assist the Secretary in preparing the Edition, digesting it into proper order, and dividing it into appropriate chapters and sections, with marginal notes of the contents and other requisite notes of explanation & reference.

Resolved That the Chairman of the Faculty be required to note in the journal of his proceedings, to be annually laid before the Visitors, all offences reported to him by others with the name of the person giving the Information, and the measures taken in consequence thereof. The Board earnestly enjoin upon the Chairman, a mild and paternal yet firm and inflexible execution of the laws, admitting no exemption from the operation of general laws, no excuse for their habitual disregard; and being indulgent to those violations only, which are casual and proceed from no design to offend. In this spirit the law respecting uniform and all the laws of the Institution will be constantly executed.

Doubts having been entertained on the construction of that enactment which requires of a professor intending to resign, three months' previous notice thereof, for the removal of which doubts;

Resolved, That no notice of an intended resignation which is not unconditional will be deemed sufficient, and that such notice must import plainly that the professor vacates his seat at the end of the session, so that the Rector and Visitors may be without embarrassment in their endeavour to provide a successor.

Resolved, That if the number of Students require it, the Executive committee may cause the doors connecting adjoining Dormitories to be closed, and require two Students to occupy each room.

Resolved, That the plan of outer gardens reported by the Executive Committee at the present session be approved by the Board and that they be directed to carry it into effect so soon as the Funds will permit.

2. Resolved that the debt due by Mr. Bonnycastle be adjusted with him by the proctor and settled in his account.

4. Resolved that the balance of the Sterling fund be applied to the purchase of periodicals and other books for the library pursuant to the Authority given to the Executive Committee at the last meeting of the Board.

The Committee of Inspection made a report accompanied by the following resolutions which were adopted:

3. Resolved; That the Executive Committee be required to cause shutters to be annexed to the windows in the present museum at the Anatomical Theatre; and that they cause the moiety of the pavement in front of and contiguous to that building to be taken up and laid down in water proof lime, with a view to remove the cause of the dampness now appearing in the Eastern wall of that apartment.

4. Resolved, That the Executive Committee cause the kitchen garden contiguous to the Anatomical Theatre to be removed at the end of the current year, and that they cause the square of ground around that building and extending to the small brick building in the Valley below to be laid down in a lawn and planted with trees, with reference to the suitable improvement of the ground as a part of the future botanic garden.

5. Resolved that the Executive committee, on consultation with the professor of chemistry & Materia Medica, cause a range of cases with glass doors; two panes of glass deep, to be placed on each side of the Door of Entrance to the chemical lecture room, so as to extend from the door to the curved cases at each end of the apartment, and at such elevation on the wall as to exhibit advantageously to the classes the specimens in the collections appertaining to that department.

6. Resolved, That authority to change the position of the Wood pillars in the chemical lecture room, or to substitute them by pillars of iron, be confided to the discretion of the Executive committee.

7. Resolved, That the duty of procuring information from Mr. Barlow in England as to the cost of the philosophical and astronomical apparatus as required by a resolution adopted at the last annual meeting, should no longer be delayed in its execution by the Executive Committee, and that a special report upon this subject be made to the Visitors at their next annual meeting.

8. Resolved, That the proctor cause the desks in the Philosophical lecture room to be painted of such colour as the professor of Natural Philosophy may prescribe.

The Board adjourned sine die.

## Report to the President & Directors of the Literary Fund.

In obedience to the law, requiring the Rector & Visitors of the University of Virginia to make a report annually to the President & Directors of the Literary Fund, to be laid before the Legislature at their next succeeding meeting, embracing a full account of the disbursements, the Funds on hand, & a general statement of the condition of the University, the Rector & Visitors make the following Report.

In conformity to the provisions of the Act of the General Assembly establishing the University of Virginia, which requires of the Rector & Visitors that they should annually visit the institution for the purpose of enquiring into the proceedings & practices thereat, and of examining into the progress of the Students, they held a stated annual meeting at the University commencing on Monday the 11th of July and terminating on the 20th of that month.

During this session of the Board, embracing the period of the public Summer examination the members were engaged in discharging such duties as the condition of the University relative to its general Economy and management, rendered incumbent on them, & in occasionally attending on the Examinations of the several classes.

The results of these examinations were highly gratifying; and together with an increased number of successful candidates for those academic distinctions which constitute the appropriate rewards of merit in the Student, give satisfactory proof that a large & respectable proportion of the youth who resort hither for instruction, have thus far fulfilled the hopes of their country and the expectations of their friends. These in gratifying numbers, are gathering the fruits of their Industry, application, & devotion to their Studies, while they vindicate the judicious liberality of the State in the construction & endowment of the University. They testify, at the same time; to the general zeal and ability of the Professors who guide & direct them.

The general management & Economy of the Institution have been such during the past Academic year as, in most respects, to meet the approbation of the Board. With a view, however, of rendering the police of the Institution more efficient, they have deemed it expedient to abolish the office of assistant Proctor, & to separate those of Patron & Proctor, heretofore united in the same individual. The office of Patron has been continued with Mr. Arthur S. Brokenborough, with the permission to keep a book store within the precincts of the University, in some tenement rent free to be designated by the Executive Committee of the Board, with a view, particularly, of furnishing the requisite text books to the Students at a specified rate, to be regulated by the Faculty.

The office of Proctor now embracing the duties formerly assigned to the assistant Proctor and aided in the discharge of some of them by the Hotelkeepers & Janitor has been filled by the appointment of Mr. John A. Carr of Albemarle, a gentleman highly recommended to the Board as possessing the requisite qualifications for its discharge.

Mr. John A. G. Davis, who at the last meeting of the Board had consented, on their invitation to fill for the limited term of twelve months the Chair of Law, then vacant by the appointment of the former Professor to a judicial office, has been appointed Professor of Law on a permanent footing.
