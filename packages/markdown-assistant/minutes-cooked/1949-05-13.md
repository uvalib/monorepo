Mr. W. Allan Perkins, Attorney for the University, appeared before the Board and made the following statement.

At a meeting of the Board of Visitors held on the 15th day of June, 1925, a resolution was adopted authorizing Mr. C. Harding Walker, who was then Rector of the University, to execute a contract by which a lot owned by the University, situated a short distance north of the Fayerweather Gymnasium and having a front of 160 feet along the west side of Rugby Road, a depth of 138 feet on its southern side, and a depth of 102 feet on its northern side was leased to Beta Chapter of Zeta Psi Fraternity of North America, Incorporated, and pursuant to this resolution Mr. Walker, as Rector, executed said lease which was dated June 15, 1925.

Mr. Perkins then presented a carbon copy of said lease, with the signature of C. Harding Walker affixed thereto.

And by deed of trust dated June 15, 1925, recorded in the Clerk's Office of Albemarle County, in D.B. 191, p. 135, said Beta Chapter of Zeta Psi Fraternity of North America, Incorporated, conveyed all of its interest and rights under this lease to John S. Battle and C. H. H. Thomas, Trustees, to secure its 20 bonds for $1,000.00 each, all dated June 15, 1925, and payable to the University in from 1 to 20 years after date, respectively, with interest at 6%.

Apparently this lease was never completed by having the University's seal affixed and attested and the only copy we have, which is the copy just presented to this meeting, was never executed by Beta Chapter of Zeta Psi. However this may be, the Fraternity proceeded to erect a large and expensive house on the lot which has been occupied by said Beta Chapter ever since its completion in 1926, and said Chapter has otherwise complied with all other terms of said lease.

On May 21, 1938, the charter of Beta Chapter of Zeta Psi Fraternity of North America, Inc., was revoked and annulled by the State Corporation Commission on account of failure to pay annual registration fees for the two preceding years.

Under date of April 6, 1948, the active alumni of Beta Chapter, believing that the situation described above should not be allowed to continue, obtained a new charter for a corporation under the name of "Beta Chapter House Corporation." This is a non-stock corporation, its members being all members of Zeta Psi Fraternity, namely, B. F. D. Runk, William R. Duke, Jr., Dr. R. Gregory Magruder, Cammann C. Duke, Dr. Frederick H. Wilke, and W. Allan Perkins. The principal office of this corporation is in Charlottesville, and one of the main purposes of this incorporation was to have in existence an organization composed of local and responsible alumni who could more properly manage the business of Beta Chapter. To this end the Trustees of Zeta Psi Fraternity of North America, Inc., a National organization, have filed their bill in chancery in the Circuit Court of Albemarle County, asking that pursuant to Sections 3813 and 3880 of the Code of Virginia one or more persons be appointed as receiver or receivers of the defunct corporation to take charge of its estate and effects and to collect any debts due and belonging to said corporation, and that its affairs be would up and any equity of redemption held by the old corporation in the original lease and in the fraternity house aforesaid, subject to any debts still due by it, be transferred to said new corporation.

The Rector and Visitors of the University is made one of the parties defendant in this bill, and as Attorney for the University I would like to be instructed to file an answer for the University to this bill, in which answer the statement will be made that the University recognizes the correctness of the allegations of the bill, believes that the lease of June 15, 1925, above referred to, should be further approved, and states that the University is ready and willing, upon transfer of all of the assets and equities of the old corporation to the new Beta Chapter House Corporation to execute and deliver the new lease, the terms of which shall be identical with those of the old, except that the lessee under the new lease shall be Beta Chapter House Corporation, it being understood that this new lease shall not be delivered to said Beta Chapter House Corporation until after all assets and equities of Beta Chapter of Zeta Psi Fraternity of North America, Incorporated, the defunct corporation, shall have been properly vested in said Beta Chapter House Corporation, pursuant to decree or decrees of Albemarle Circuit Court entered in the chancery cause aforesaid.

It was, thereupon,

RESOLVED - (1) That the terms of said lease of June 15, 1925, are hereby ratified and approved;

(2) That W. Allan Perkins, Attorney for the University, be and is hereby instructed and authorized to prepare and file an answer on behalf of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia to the bill in chancery which has been filed in the Circuit Court of Albemarle County by the Trustees of Zeta Psi Fraternity of North America, as complainant against Ivey F. Lewis, Bernard P. Chamberlain, and others, in which answer the University will admit the correctness of the allegations of the bill, will express its approval of the terms of the old lease of June 15, 1925, and will state that it is ready and willing to execute and deliver a new lease upon terms identical with those of the old except that the lessee under the new lease shall be Beta Chapter House Corporation, such new lease not to be delivered to said Beta Chapter House Corporation until after all assets and equities of Beta Chapter of Zeta Psi Fraternity of North America, Incorporated, the defunct corporation, shall have been properly vested in said Beta Chapter House Corporation pursuant to decree or decrees of Albemarle Circuit Court entered in the Chancery Cause aforesaid.

Mr. Perkins then presented to the meeting a form of new lease which he stated had been drawn so as to embody the exact terms of the old lease of June 15, 1925, and asked that a resolution be adopted authorizing the execution of this lease on behalf of the University and directing him to deliver said executed lease when the conditions set out in the foregoing resolution have been complied with.

It was, thereupon, further

RESOLVED that Colgate W. Darden, Jr., President, be and is hereby authorized and directed to execute said lease in the name and on behalf of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, and Vincent Shea, Secretary of this Board, be and is hereby authorized and instructed to affix the corporate seal thereto and attest the same, and W. Allan Perkins, Attorney for the University, is instructed to deliver said lease to the lessee named therein, Beta Chapter House Corporation, when he is satisfied that all assets and equities of Beta Chapter of Zeta Psi Fraternity of North America, Incorporated, have been legally vested in said Beta Chapter House Corporation pursuant to decree or decrees of Albemarle Circuit Court entered in the chancery cause of the Trustees of Zeta Psi Fraternity of North America v. Ivey F. Lewis, and others, now pending in the Circuit Court of Albemarle County.

The Board then went into executive session with Judge Barksdale presiding. At the completion of the session Judge Barksdale reported that Mr. Barron Foster Black had been elected Rector of the University, succeeding Edward Rielley Stettinius, Jr. who resigned on March 16, 1949.

Captain Norton G. Pritchett, Director of Athletics for the University, was present for this discussion.

Dr. Trout stated that several members of the Board had asked that action on the continuance of inter-collegiate boxing be deferred until the study being made at the University of Wisconsin was completed. He said that this study would take two years to complete and he very much doubts that the results will be conclusive.

Since the last meeting of the Board, Dr. Trout has written the heads of the five State mental institutions. To date he has received four replies, all stating that they believe inter-collegiate boxing should be abolished. Dr. Trout reiterated the statement he made at the April meeting, to the effect that the Virginia Medical Society was opposed to boxing.

Captain Pritchett stated that he felt if boxing were discontinued, the University should examine the effects upon participants of other bodily contact sports such as football and lacrosse. Captain Pritchett has investigated the reasons why so many colleges have abolished boxing, finding that there are five major reasons:

1. Lack of interest by students.
2. High costs.
3. Poor sportsmanship on the part of the fans.
4. Difficulty of securing a good coach.
5. One school because of the death of a boxer from a blow received in a match.

Captain Pritchett stated that he personally had tried to see that every precaution was being taken to protect our boxers. He feels very strongly that if the Wisconsin study shows that boxers are permanently injured by participation, the University should discontinue the sport.

Mr. Carrington then introduced a letter addressed to the Board of Visitors by James A. Leftwich, the only Olympic boxing representative from the University.

***

**Twenty-four years have elapsed since I left the University, '25. It has been 28 years (1921) since the first boxing team was organized at Charlottesville. It is still a source of considerable pleasure and pride, to me, that I was a member of that first team. I am also happy to have been Captain of two of Virginia's successful teams in the early 'twenties, and the University's representative on the American Olympic Boxing Team, to Paris, France during 1924.**

The late President Alderman and his wife called on me in France at the Olympic Team camp, a quarter of a century ago. I will never forget his kindly remarks to me at that time. He told me boxing had earned a fine place in the hearts of Virginia men, and that I had contributed greatly to bring dignity to a sport that had long been held in disfavor. He told me Virginia was grateful to me for my effort in helping to make the sport respectable and a credit to Virginia's sporting activities. He said he was delighted with the way the sport helped to develop the minds and bodies of Virginia men, and that boxing was a credit to The University. "I know Virginia boxers," Dr. Alderman told me, "and yourself in particular, will derive enormous benefit from your athletic activity in this sport later in life, as well as now. You have my sincerest wishes for your success in both." This was a long time ago. But it is a quote I shall never forget!

It comes as a distinct shock to me that your Board is now considering terminating boxing as a sport at The University. Boxing for nearly several decades has given a great deal to The University. The excellent results have had high visibility, both in sporting prestige and in substantial earnings of the teams, down the years.

At this distance from my own undergraduate days, the thing to consider is the effect on the participants, and nothing else. I certainly do not propose to hold myself up as a shining example of the benefits of the sport of boxing, or its ultimate effects. However, it has been my good fortune to know many fine men who have boxed during their college days. I do not recall one who had suffered because he had once boxed. On the contrary, countless scores succeeded, where otherwise they would possibly have been mental and physical weaklings had they not had the advantages of boxing.

Col. Edward Eagan, former Assistant U. S. Attorney, New York City, and now Boxing Commissioner for the State of New York, boxed his way through Yale, won a Rhodes Scholarship to Oxford, where he also boxed, and was a member of three Olympic Teams. The very Canadian from McGill University who defeated me in the '24 Olympics is now a highly respected physician.

I could type out a list of twenty outstanding men in nearly all the professions (attorneys, engineers, architects, doctors, statesmen, artists, and any number of writers) who gave able account of themselves in the amateur boxing ring when they were collegians. With rare exception, none carry more than a dented proboscis, a prominent cheek-bone, or perhaps a cartileged knuckle, or two. All of them have brought sturdy bodies, clean minds because of the necessity for health living, enormous amounts of stamina, and undefeatable determination to their nature lives, because of the peculiar nature of the sport of boxing in which they engaged while youths!

It is remarkable to observe boxing at Virginia. For it transcends the usual fisticuffs found in other amateur-inter-collegiate circles: TEAM-PLAY! While boxing is a sport of individual against individual, Virginia for nearly three decades has instilled an esprit de corps in its demonstrations of the manly art of self-defense. Team-play is a marvelous thing to behold. Virginia teams, in my memory, have always been more closely knit than many another sport one could examine.

After many years of newspaper and magazine activity, I recall many interviews for articles on the subject of sports and the after-effects. I would like to report to you Gentlemen some of my findings regarding boxing. Perhaps you have heard the expression: `punch-drunk', more frequently encountered in professional rather than amateur circles. These are the subjects who are said to have `taken too many' on the chin, or around the optics. They are usually found to be slightly more than somewhat \`off-the-beam.' THEY WERE IN THAT CONDITION BEFORE THEY EVER STEPPED INTO A BOXING RING! This can be verified. The injuries received during any given period among a group of amateur boxers is negligible, and completely off-set by the advantages of keen physical and mental condition, not to mention the numerous invaluable lessons learned in combat, and team-play, the boys obtain in boxing.

I sincerely trust, Gentlemen, that you will give the Student Body, and the Alumni an opportunity to express themselves before you take any action directed toward eliminating boxing as a sport at Virginia. It might be helpful to have the opinions of the Presidents of other universities, where boxing prevails, as well as the Superintendents of the United States Naval and Military Academies. It would be interesting to know what they think boxing does for the young men at those institutions.

At the meeting of the Compliance Committee held April 7, 8, and 9 at Savannah, Georgia it was voted to extend until July 1, 1949 the date by which it will be necessary for you to advise us in regard to compliance with the Code. If you are intending to take steps which will result in compliance, it is still necessary that these steps be taken prior to September 1, 1949.
