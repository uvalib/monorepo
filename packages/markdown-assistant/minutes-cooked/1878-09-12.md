Board of Visitors' minutes, Accession # RG-1/1/, Special Collections Dept., University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Va.

Minutes of meetings of the university's governing body which is the legal owner and operator of the institution. Recorded in the minutes are appointments and other personnel decisions concerning faculty, decisions about construction of facilities, gifts to the university, and all other board actions, decisions and resolutions.

Board met pursuant to the Call of the Rector of the University and was called to order by the Rector.

Present: A.H.H. Stuart, Rector, in the Chair, and Messrs. Hart, Marye, Goode, Randolph, Conrad, Bocock & Whitehead.

Pursuant to an order of the Board, the Secy. pro tem informed Dr J. F. Harrison, Chairman of the Faculty, that the Board had organized and was ready to receive any communications from the Faculty. Dr. Harrison reported in person, verbally, that he had as Chairman no communication to make.

The Rector read to the Board the following letter from Mr. W. W. Corcoran of Washington City:

I propose to make the University of Virginia a similar donation with same conditions as that made on the 8th December 1876, for the purpose of endowing a professorship of Natural History, as a token of my warm personal regard, and as an expression of the gratitude which I, in common with the Citizens of the Old Commonwealth, feel for the profound scholarship it has given to the Country- a scholarship which has impressed itself on the Universities of the Old World, and enlisted the sympathy of the honored Queen of England.

I am sure that the admiration in which we hold the memory of its illustrious founder, whose statesmanship was only equalled by his masterly pen, will make the condition I am about to name, a pleasure and not a burden.

It is that the authorities of the University pledge themselves to keep the Monument and the grounds around it in good order for all time.

We owe a duty to the memory of one who gave dignity to office, and who showed his high appreciation of letters by kindling so bright a light in the earlier age of the Republic.

We cannot forget his own inimitable epitaph, "Here lies buried, Thomas Jefferson, author of the Declaration of American Independence, of the Statute of Virginia for religious freedom, and Father of the University of Virginia."

Nor can we forget the reasons assigned for it, which are thus beautifully expressed,

"Because by these, as testimonials that I lived, I wish most to be remembered."

I am satisfied that I could in no way reflect greater honor on your University, than by connecting at more closely, if possible, with the tomb of Jefferson: and I could crave no greater blessing to the country than its return to the grand principles of wise government he has unfolded.

Please say what disposition I shall make of the bonds.

To Hon A. H. H. Stuart, Rector, University of Virginia Staunton, Virginia

To the foregoing letter Mr. Stuart replied as follows:

I had the pleasure of receiving by the mail of yesterday, your letter, dated 13th inst: in which you communicate to me officially, your purpose to make, to the University of Virginia, a farther donation of $50,000 in Virginia Consol bonds, for the purpose of endowing a Professorship of Natural History, in the Institution.

On behalf of the Visitors & Faculty of the University & of the people of Virginia, I hasten to tender to you their thanks for this munificent gift. I am sure, too, that they will be especially gratified by the particular appropriation of the fund to the endowment of a professorship of natural history, as it will enable the University to enlarge its circle of instruction, & contribute, more effectually, to the development of the natural resources of Virginia, & her sister states.

The condition which you have thought proper to annex to the gift, to wit: "that the authorities of the University pledge themselves, to keep the monument \[about to be erected by national authority over the grave of Jefferson] & the grounds around it, in good order, through all time," must be recognized by all, as not only reasonable, but exceedingly appropriate.

As he was the "Father of the University of Virginia" there seems to be a peculiar propriety in entrustine, to this child of his old age, the sacred duty of keeping guard at his tomb, & protecting from injury & decay, the monument erected by national gratitude, to commemorate his patriotism & illustrious public services.

A meeting of the Visitors of the University will be held, at an early day, to take the necessary measures to give practical effect to your generous purposes.

In regard to the disposition of the bonds, I would respectfully, suggest, that they be sent to Richmond, to the care of Genl Asa Rogers, Second Auditor, to be held by him, for the use of the University, until the meeting of the General Assembly of Va. in December next.

The Rector reputed that Mr. Cordoran has delivered to Genl Asa Rogers the Virginia bonds referred to in the foregoing letter.

The Rector then read a communication from Professors Mallet & Smith, in reply to a letter from himself to them asking for their opinion as to the subjects of study which should be embraced in the school to be organized now by the Board.

On motion of Mr. Bocock,

**Resolved**, that the new Chair to be established and maintained in the University of Virginia, by means of the recent donation of Mr. Corcoran, shall be designated and known as the "Corcoran School of Natural History and Geology."

On motion of Mr. Bocock,

**Resolved** that in the Corcoran School of Natural History and Geology in the University of Virginia, shall be taught Geology, Mineralogy, and such branches of Natural History as the Board of Visitors may, hereafter, determine.

On motion of Mr. Goode,

**Resolved**, That the election of the Professor of "Natural History and Geology" be postponed until Tuesday the 4th day of February 1879 and, in the meantime, that the Executive Committee be requested, by correspondence, and otherwise, to collect such information as they can, in regard to the qualifications of the Candidates.

A letter to the Rector from Professor Jno. R. Page, in relation to the appointment of a Janitor for the "Brooks Museum" and asking that the order of the Board directing Prof. Page "to move into the building" be rescinded was referred to the Committee on Public Buildings.

A letter from James F. Harrison, Chairman, dated 11th Sept. '78, asking for instructions as to the precise extent and degree of the control and authority of the Chief Executive Officer of the Uy. over the several rooms used by the literary and temperance societies, by the students as a general reading room and by the Hotels as dining rooms; and suggesting an increase of the annual pay of the Janitor, Mr. J. L. Parker - was also referred to the Committee on Public Buildings.

The Committee on Public Buildings through its Chairman, Dr. Randolph reported the following which were adopted - in response to the letter of Dr. Harrison;

**Resolved**, That the Literary societies, the Temperance society, and the Young Men's Christian Association have control over the rooms in which their several meetings are held and in which they have their reading room; subject however to the supervision of the Superintendent of Grounds and buildings as to any alteration of the same, or as to any subject pertaining to the care and safety of the Buildings; and to that of the Chairman of the Faculty, the Faculty, or Proctor, as to such regulations as may be necessary for due subordination to the University discipline, provided also that the said rooms respectively shall be used only for the purposes designated in the grant of the same except only by the special permission of the Faculty and the consent of the grantee, nor shall the Hotel dining rooms be applied to any other uses than those provided by existing regulations, except by permission of the Faculty and the consent of the Hotel-Keepers renting them.

In regard to the suggested increase of the pay of the Janitor:

**Resolved** that the Board do not consider that the means of the University justify this increase at the present time.

In regard to Prof. Page's communication touching the large number of Visitors to the Museum & to the need of a janitor for that Building the following was adopted:

Being desirous to do all in its power at present to meet this exigency, the Board resolves that One Hundred and fifty Dollars shall be applied to pay for this service during the ensuing session out of any funds of the University not otherwise appropriated, and that said sum shall be at the disposal of Prof. Page to be applied by him in procuring the needful service in such manner as he may determine.

Also,

**Resolved**, that the orders assigning the lecture-rooms occupied during the past session by Prof. Page to Prof. Smith and the Lecture room in the Brooks Natural Science Museum to Prof. Page be hereby rescinded.

A Committee consisting of Messrs. Bocock, Marye and Conrad to prepare resolutions in regard to the donation of W. W. Corcoran, Esq. made the following report which was adopted: viz:

The letter of W. W. Corcoran Esq. of the 13th of August last, tendering to the University of Virginia a donation of $50,000 of the consol bonds of the State of Virginia, to endow a chair of Natural History in this Institution, and the reply thereto of the Rector, the Hon. A. H. H. Stuart, having been laid before the Board,

1. **Resolved** that we recognize in this munificent donation, the third which has been received from the same source within the last two years, a new and striking proof of the large liberality of the donor, his earnest devotion to the State of Virginia, and his warm interest in this, her foremost Institution of learning. And we tender to Mr. Corcoran the expression of our grateful acknowledgements and our assurances, that by this new act of enlightened beneficence, he has erected a lasting memorial in the hearts, not only of the people of Virginia generally, but of the friends of thorough culture throughout the land.

2. **Resolved** that we accept this donation, on the conditions of its tender, regarding the requirement therein contained as only affording us a new occasion to signalize our devotion to the memory of that great Virginian, who having adorned the first office in the gift of a people whose institutions he had aided to form in wisdom, and establish in virtue, yet modestly preferred to give to the world as one of the three testimonials of his existence, for which he wished most to be remembered, the fact that he was "Father of the University of Virginia."

3. **Resolved** as an enduring testimonial for this act of liberality on the part of Mr. Corcoran, the chair endowed thereby, be called the "Corcoran School of Natural History and Geology, in the University of Virginia."

4. **Resolved** that a copy of these resolutions be forwarded to Mr. Corcoran by the Secretary.

The following resolution was presented by Mr. Bocock and by him presented to the Board & by them adopted;

**Resolved** that the letter of the Rector, the Hon. Alex: H. H. Stuart, in reply to the letter of Mr. Corcoran tendering a donation of $50,000 to endow a chair of Natural History in the University of Virginia, meets our approval and entitles him to our sincere thanks.

On motion,

**Resolved** that when this Board adjourns it adjourn to meet on the 4' of February next.

**Resolved** that the Board do now adjourn.
