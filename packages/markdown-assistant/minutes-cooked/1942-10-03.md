A committee of students, representing those residing in the Lawns, Ranges, Randall Hall and Dawson's Row, appeared before the Board with the request that the rule against the entertaining of women in the dormitory rooms be rescinded, and that permission be granted under certain rules and regulations. Following some discussion of the request it was referred to the administrative authorities with power to act.

Following some discussion of the further use of the facilities of the University in the prosecution of the war, a Committee consisting of Mr. Garnett, Stettinius and the President, was appointed to confer with the War and Navy Departments with reference to use of the facilities of the University for that purpose.

The President advised the Board that Mr. Edward R. Stettinius, Jr., had presented the University with a complete set of British War Posters which he had secured from the British Minister of Information, Sir Brendan Bracken, and the thanks of the Board were extended Mr. Stettinius and Sir Brendan Bracken for this addition to the art department of the University.

Mr. E. R. Stettinius, Jr., Chairman of the Special Committee on the question of fraternity houses at the University, stated that the committee had interviewed numerous persons and had received many letters from alumni on the subject. He further stated that upon being informed that Governor Darden would appreciate the opportunity of conferring with the Committee, a meeting with him was held in Richmond of September 24th, and submitted the following memorandum of the conference:

### MEMORANDUM OF CONFERENCE HELD AT 5315 CARY STREET ROAD, SEPTEMBER 24th, AT 7.00, BETWEEN COMMITTEE OF BOARD OF VISITORS AND GOVERNOR DARDEN

**Those present were:**

* Governor Colgete W. Darden, Jr.
* E. R. Stettinius, Jr., Chairman
* James H. Corbitt
* Lewis C. Williams

The Chairman asked the Governor to express his views to the Committee on the subject of Fraternity houses at the University of Virginia. The Governor made a general statement covering his objection to fraternity houses which may be summarized briefly as follows:

1. The Governor said that, in his campaign for Governor, which was the first general State campaign that he had ever made, he was surprised to find a lack of interest in the University of Virginia. In too many instances there was unfriendly criticism both by alumni and by responsible individuals who had never attended the University. He felt that this feeling was to be attributed in part to a separation of students by some men living in fraternity houses. At the same time, he expressed the view that there was something deeper that was wrong and that perhaps the greatest trouble is that the boys are engaged in too many activities to permit them to give the close attention to their studies that a stiff academic course should require.

2. That the use of fraternity houses brought about an undesirable stratification in student life. This stratification tends to rigidly circumscribe the life of the fraternity man almost immediately after his entry into college. He joins very shortly after arriving. In many cases he knows little of the group to which he is adhering. The making of the fraternity house their headquarters and social center deprives him of the opportunity of knowing his fellow students as he should. While it undoubtedly confers upon him benefits-these benefits would be obtained by membership in the Organization without the separate quarters. The present arrangement adds unnecessarily to the expense of students, and in the future this will be of greater importance.

3. That he did not object to fraternities, as such, but felt that, after fraternity meetings have been held, conditions should be such that the young men would again drop back into the student body. He favored the maintenance of the organizations.

4. That his experience in his State-wide campaign also led to the discovery that too few men who had occupied outstanding positions in college life had made marked successes in the communities in which they had settled. This led him to question the elements that evidently made for leadership in the student body. Solid accomplishment in school seems to play too small a part.

5. That he was impressed with the close association existing between V.M.I. men and the affection of the alumni for V.M.I.

6. He expressed the opinion that the University of Virginia needed to be strengthened as much as possible by raising entrance requirements and by dismissing those students who did not maintain a satisfactory average. He thought this would also require a gradual lifting of high school requirements in order that students seeking admission might be prepared for University work.

7. He was also of the opinion that women should not be allowed to enter fraternity houses except under certain rigid restrictions.

8. On the financial question and loss that might result from banning fraternity houses, he said, if the fraternity houses are forbidden at the University of Virginia, he would not agree to anything that would amount to confiscation, but would insist that the State make provision to take them over at a fair price.

9. He felt that students should not be permitted to keep automobiles.

10. He questioned the value of the ribbon societies and kindred organizations, and thought that in the interest of work and unity in the student body as a whole a number of organizations might well be allowed to drop out.

11. He believed that the gap between high school and college too great, and that there should be more supervision and direction of the undergraduates. He did not favor anything resembling rigid discipline but rather sympathetic leadership.

12. That he had no desire to hurry the conclusion of the Board's investigation, but suggested February 1, 1943, as a deadline.

13. He approved the Board's plan that a committee be appointed to investigate and report to the Board, such Committee to consist of four from the student body, two fraternity and two-non-fraternity men appointed by the Student Senate, three from the faculty, chosen by the President of the Alumni Association, this Committee to elect a Chairman. This Committee is to hold hearings and make a study of the matter and report to the Board of Visitors not later than February 1, 1943.

14. There was a discussion of education in general, and it was agreed that a demand exists for reform in college.

The above memorandum was not made from notes taken at the time, but was dictated the following morning by James H. Corbitt and Lewis C. Williams, the Chairman having been compelled to return to Washington at 10:20 p.m. the night of the meeting.

Following a general discussion of the matter, the following statement by the Committee, together with the resolution appended, were adopted:

The Special Committee of the Board of Visitors, E. R. Stettinius, Jr., Chairman, James H. Corbitt and Lewis C. Williams, reported to the Board at a meeting held on the 3rd day of October, 1942:

That the Committee had examined the question of the abolition of fraternity houses in general, had conferred with many persons and considered many letters and reports on the subject, and had likewise conferred with Governor Darden.

That, as a result of its consideration of the matter, the Committee deemed it advisable that a hearing be given to students, alumni and other interested persons and recommended that this hearing be conducted by a Hearing Board composed of four from the student body, two fraternity men and two non-fraternity men, appointed by the Honor Committee of the student body; three from the faculty, chosen by the general faculty, and two from the alumni, one fraternity man and one non-fraternity man, appointed by the Board of Managers of the General Alumni Association of the University, with instructions that this Hearing Board shall elect a tenth member to act as Chairman.

That this Hearing Board shall hold appropriate hearings, make a study of the fraternity house question in general and collect information and data as to how fraternity houses are treated or governed in other institutions of learning, particularly where the desirability of such houses has been questioned, and consider and report the effect of fraternity houses on:

* (a) education,
* (b) formation of character, discipline and studious habits,
* (c) life at the University,
* (d) housing of students at the University, if fraternity houses be abolished,
* (e) the financial loss, if any, to the University and fraternities, if fraternity houses are abolished.

Thereupon, the Board of Visitors adopted the following resolutions:

**RESOLVED,** that the recommendations of the Special Committee of the Board be adopted, and a Hearing Board of ten be appointed, consisting of four from the student body, two fraternity and two non-fraternity men, appointed by the Honor Committee of the student body; three from the faculty of the University, selected by the general faculty; two from the alumni, appointed by the Board of Managers of the General Alumni Association,-one fraternity and one non-fraternity man,- and a tenth member to act as chairman, to be elected by the nine other members of the Hearing Board, appointed as provided herein, to hold appropriate hearings and report on the questions propounded by the Special Committee, and

**RESOLVED,** that this Hearing Board be requested to report to the Board of Visitors not later than February 1, 1943.

**RESOLVED,** that the hearing board incur only such expenses as may be approved by President Newcomb.

The meeting then adjourned.
