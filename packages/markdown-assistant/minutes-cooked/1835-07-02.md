The Board of Visitors having had under consideration the paper addressed to them by Mrs. Brokenborough, relative to the preservation of equality in the rights and privileges of the resident and non-resident Hotelkeepers:

The following preamble and resolutions were brought before the Board for consideration, & some difficulty arising respecting them, were laid over for consideration at a fuller meeting: viz.

The proceedings of the professors having in view the adoption of measures for the erection by private contributions, of a chapel on the grounds of the University for the more convenient and appropriate performance of the religious services already provided for by an arrangement which has received the sanction of the Board of Visitors, being presented:

Resolved, that the board duly estimating, as their predecessors have done, the importance of religious worship to the well-being of the Institution over which they preside, & finding that the apartment heretofore allotted and occupied for that purpose is totally inadequate to the accommodation of the Students and professors and their families , who have shown an earnest desire to attend on the religious services which have for some years been regularly performed there, do cheerfully assent to the proposed building of a chapel on the grounds of the University; reserving to their future decision, upon a more deliberate consultation with the professors, the precise designation of the site for the chapel, and it being well understood that the same jealous care to maintain a strict impartiality and equality between the several religious denominations in their relations to this institution, shall continue to be scrupulously and sacredly preserved.

Resolved, that in cases of suspension from the University, the Faculty shall prescribe the place at which the suspended Student shall reside during the period of suspension; and, in cases of expulsion, dismission, or suspension, the utmost promptitude & punctuality are recommended to the chairman in apprising the parents or guardians of the Students so expelled, dismissed or suspended of the sentemces passed on them.

Resolved, That the privilege heretofore given to the Proctor to take the dead and fallen wood from the University lands, did not contemplate the cutting or using any green or living timber; and the practice of using the University teams and hands as has been suggested to furnish wood for the Proctor is improper and ought to be discontinued.

Resolved, That in future the Orators and Essayists for the last day of the session shall be chosen in the following manner; the whole body of Students shall, in the month of November of each year be arranged by the Chairman into nine equal divisions - each division shall name one elector; the nine electors thus chosen shall meet together at such time as may be designated by the Chairman, and by a majority of their voices select the Orators & essayists for the last day of the session, not exceeding six in number, and to be approved by the Faculty.

The Compositions of the Orators & essayists shall, as heretofore, be submitted to the chairman for his approbation, and he may prescribe such limitations of time for their delivery as may be best calculated to promote the good effect of such an exhibition of the talents of the Institution.

The Committee on the Bursar's and Proctor's accounts made their report, and on their recommendation the following resolutions were adopted:

Resolved That Messrs. Randolph & Rives be empowered to employ Opie Norris as the accountant of this board to make any investigation of the Proctor's and Bursar's accounts that they may deem necessary, and report the same to the next meeting of the Board.

Resolved, that hereafter it shall be the duty of the Proctor to exhibit to the Board of Visitors on the first day of their annual meeting a detail'd report of all sums received for rents, fines; assessments, and specify the name of the person from whom received, the date and amount of each payment.

The Committee of Inspection made their report accompanyed by the following resolutions which were adopted.

Resolved, that the philosophical apparatus now in the department of Natural Philosophy belonging to Dr. Patterson, and contained in his scedule endorsed "List and valuation of Dr. Patterson's apparatus, July 3d 1835."- be purchased by the University at the price proposed of $846.90 and that the time and mode of payment be arranged by the Executive Committee.

That the expediency of purchasing from Dr. Patterson, his cabinet of Mineralogical and Geological specimens be referred to the Executive Committee -

That the Executive Committee be authorised to dispose of the balance turning upon agates with its appurtenances in the department of Natural Philosophy, and in their discretion to apply the proceeds of sale in payment, pro tante, to Dr. Patterson.

That it be hereafter the duty of the Janitor under the direction of the Professor of Anatomy and Surgery to clean & refit, at least once in each year, the surgical instruments and apparatus under the care of that professor.

Resolved, That the Executive Committee be authorised to cause a temporary partition to be put up in the Anatomical hall, in such manner as will conduce to the warmth in winter, and greater comfort of that apartment - And in their discretion to order and have placed there an additional stove.

Resolved, That the proctor cause the room upon the ground floor of the Rotunda, near the Chemical Laboratory, now occupied by one of the Negroes of the University to be vacated by that occupant; and those rooms after being properly cleansed, to be locked up, or put to other desirable uses.

Resolved, that the Visitors approve the regulations adopted by the Faculty for the future government of the Library; and entertain the hope that they will be punctually regarded.

Resolved, that hereafter upon the arrival of new books for the Library, that the packages be opened by the Proctor and Librarian together, the books be compared with the invoice accompanying them - the receipt of the Librarian taken for them, and they committed to his custody before they shall be at the disposal of the professors or students.

Resolved, that so much of the report of the Committee of Inspection as relates to their inspection of the buildings, grounds \&c be communicated to the Proctor.

Resolved, That it appears to the Board of Visitors, from the report of their Committee of Inspection, and from information derived from the Professors ( the details of which information have been communicated to the Proctor, and explanations made therein by him ) that his duties as Master of police, have by no means been discharged in the manner contemplated by the Enactments or to the satisfaction of the Visitors.

Resolved-That without enumerating all the instances of ommission of duty in his police department which have been brought to the notice of the Visitors, they cannot refrain from specifying his acknowledged failure to inspect at the times required by law, the Hotels and dormitories, and to report their condition monthly to the Faculty;- or to report to them cases of damage or injury to the buildings by Students or others, in order that the fines should be assessed by the proper authority - If the enactments are not obeyed by the chief officer of police, the discipline and good order of the Institution, will depend upon his private discretion & not upon the efficacy of the Laws.

The Board then adjourned Sine die.

In obedience to the law requiring the Visitors of the University of Virginia to make a report annually to the President and Directors of the Literary Fund to be laid before the Legislature at their next succeeding meeting embracing a full account of disbursements, the funds on hand, and a General Statement of the condition of the University, the Rector & Visitors make the following Report.

In conformity to the provisions of the act of the General Assembly establishing the University of Virginia which requires the Rector & Visitors that they should annually visit the Institution for the purpose of enquiring into the proceedings and practices thereat, and of examining into the progress of the Students they held a stated annual meeting at the University beginning on the 11th and ending on the 18th July 1832.

The investigations instituted by the Board into the state and condition of the University, especially relating to the diligence and progress of the Students resulted in satisfactory evidence of time well employed and application crowned with success. The number of successful candidates for academic distinctions greatly exceeds those of any preceeding Session. These distinctions are the appropriate rewards of merit ascertained by a system of examinations thorough and searching, and which shuts out the idle and dissipated from all hope of attaining to the honors which they confer.

The increased number of Graduates in the several schools gives satisfactory assurance to the Board that the able professors who constitute the Faculty of the University have relaxed nothing of that diligence and Fidelty which the Board have, in their previous reports, had so much reason to commend.

In the Departments of police and discipline the enactments of the Board have been least successful, and the Faculty have had the greatest difficulties to encounter. While the great body of the Students have been orderly and diligent, it has been in the power of a few unworthy and unsound members, occasionally to create confusion & embarrassment. This will always be the case while the dissipated and profligate are shielded in their violations of law & outrages against decency by a vague and unmeaning sense of honor, that "loose principle in the Ethics of schoolboy combinations," which forbids one Student to give evidence against his fellow. The departments of police and discipline in all academical Institutions have everywhere presented a problem of difficult solution. The efforts of the Board to solve it have necessarily been experimental. They have fail'd in the desired success; and they fear that failure must continue to attend their efforts, unless some plan can be adopted by which the false principle of Honor before alluded to, may be either satisfied or subdued. The Faculty must have it in their power to detect offenders and bring them to punishment before offences can be expected to cease. No enactments of the Board have hitherto enabled them to accomplish this- Hence it is that the Board have deemed it expedient to apply to the Legislature for aid to effect it; and with that view they have authorised a committee of their body to urge upon the Legislature of the State a scheme which in their opinion, promises to be successful.

The Board have discontinued the appointment of Demonstrator of Anatomy and Surgery and have erected the Department into a professorship, which they have conferred on Th: Johnson M. D. the former Demonstrator. They have also authorised the Professor of Medicine to deliver lectures on the Philosophy of Natural History - his fee to be $15.

The Separation of the offices of Proctor & Patron, made at the last meeting of the Board, has not been attended by advantages answerable to their expectations, or adequate to the expense of providing a salary for the Proctor. These two offices have therefore again been united in one, and, on the resignation of Mr. Carr, the recent Proctor, have been conferred on Mr. Wm. G. Pendleton of the city of Richmond.

The number of matriculates during the Session which has just ended, exhibits a gradual increase on that of previous sessions, being 139 & were distributed among the several schools as follows.

The reports of the Bursar and Proctor, exhibiting the State of the Funds of the Institution, accompany this report.
