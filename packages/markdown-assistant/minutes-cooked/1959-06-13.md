The Rector read to the Board a resolution which had been adopted by the University of Virginia Chapter of the American Association of University Professors. This resolution was as follows:

RESOLVED, that the University of Virginia Chapter of the American Association of University Professors, believing that it expresses the sentiment of the entire faculty of this University, desires on the eve of Mr. Darden's retirement from the Presidency to convey to him its gratitude for his record of twelve years of scrupulous adherence to the principles of academic freedom and tenure and constructive effort to improve the conditions of academic employment and above all for the sense of security which the academic community has derived from the knowledge that the President is a man who understands that a great university can fulfill its function only if its faculty members are free to pursue the truth without fear or favor.

RESOLVED, FURTHER, that the outgoing and incoming officers of this Chapter present this resolution to Mr. Darden in person and that the Secretary send a copy to the Rector and Visitors for the archives of the University and furnish copies to the press.

May 1, 1959

Expressions of gratitude were voiced by several Visitors as to the fine sentiments expressed in this resolution, and the Secretary was directed to include the resolution in the permanent minutes of the Board.

The Rector announced the receipt of a communication from Dean Lewis M. Hammond, Chairman of the Inaugural Committee, which stated that the Committee had set 6 October 1959 as the date for the inauguration of President Shannon. No objections to this date were heard from any member of the Board.

After full discussion, on motion, duly seconded, the following resolution was unanimously adopted, all members present voting in favor thereof, to-wit:

The President announced that further negotiations had been had with the YMCA Board of Trustees concerning the arrangement of a long-term lease of Madison Hall by the University. A long-term lease was desired, the President stated, because of the necessity of making a rather extensive renovation of Madison Hall in order to convert the facilities for efficient University use. A proposal had been made by the YMCA Board of Trustees that a fifty-year lease be negotiated with an annual rental payment of $7,000. Included in the proposal was an arrangement whereby the annual rental of $7,000 would be adjusted at five-year intervals on the basis of the cost-of-living index prepared by the U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Considerable discussion ensued among the Visitors as to the need for an upper and lower limit to be included in the lease. At the conclusion of this discussion, the following resolution was adopted:

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the President be and he is hereby authorized to continue to negotiate for a long-term lease of Madison Hall by the University and that any agreement which may be reached be subject to the approval of the Executive Committee if that approval be needed before the October meeting of the Board.

The Board adopted the following resolution:

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the new science building nearing completion at Mary Washington College be and it is hereby named the Morgan Combs Science Hall.

The President reported that, following the approval by the Buildings and Grounds Committee of the proposed plans for the North approach to the Rotunda, he had obtained an estimate as to the cost. The estimate was $9,700, which he thought was much too high. He did not feel, in view of other needs, that this amount of money should be spent by the University. He stated, however, that it might be possible to obtain the money from private sources and asked for authority to proceed in the event that his search was a successful one.

The Board adopted the following resolution:

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the President be and he is hereby authorized to proceed with the construction of the North approach to the Rotunda according to the plans heretofore approved by the Buildings and Grounds Committee, provided the funds required can be obtained from non-University sources.

The President raised the question as to an appropriate name for the Northern Virginia Branch College. He noted that one name proposed was "George Mason College of the University of Virginia." Mr. Fenwick pointed out that a name which had been used locally was "University College of the University of Virginia." After discussion, it was decided to defer a decision on this matter until the meeting of the Board in October.

The President presented a revised plan for the remuneration of the clinical staff in the School of Medicine. The plan, which consisted of an amendment to the present plan, was summarized by the Dean of the School of Medicine in his letter to the President of 4 June 1959 and by the Comptroller in his letter to the President of 11 June 1959.

The proposed amendment consisted briefly of the following (1) no change would be made in the present salaries and limits on earnings with the exception of instructors, (2) the University would continue its five percent contribution of the base salary to TIAA, (3) the individual doctor would continue to contribute to TIAA five percent of his salary and earnings, up to a maximum of five percent of $12,500, (4) an increase in the contribution of the clinical department would be made so that this amount combined with the University's contribution would equal 20 percent of the doctor's salary up to a maximum salary of $12,500, (5) the present plan for distributing surplus would remain the same except that the chairmen of major clinical departments would be allowed to participate in surplus distribution, as well as other members of the faculty, (6) since instructors are not eligible for TIAA, these faculty members would receive during the coming year an increase in income of $1,500 instead of the usual increase of $750, and (7) the plan would become effective as of 1 July 1958.

The following resolution was adopted by the Board:

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the amendments to the current salary plan of the clinical staff of the School of Medicine as summarized by the President and as outlined in detail in letters to the President from the Dean of the School of Medicine dated 4 June 1959 and from the Comptroller of the University dated 11 June 1959 be and they are hereby approved.

In response to a request by the President, the Board adopted the following resolution:

The President reported on a request from the University Senate that the School of Engineering be authorized to offer Doctor of Science degrees in Nuclear Engineering and in Electrical Engineering. He pointed out that the Board had previously approved a request authorizing the awarding of the degrees of Doctor of Science in Engineering-Physics and in Chemical Engineering. The President also stated that the Dean of the School of Law had informed him that the prior approval of this proposal by the State Council of Higher Education was not required.

The following resolution was adopted by the Board:

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the School of Engineering be and it is hereby authorized to award the degrees of Doctor of Science in Nuclear Engineering and Doctor of Science in Electrical Engineering.

The President summarized a letter he had received from Mr. Hugh S. Cumming, Jr. offering to the University a portrait of his father, the late Hugh S. Cumming, Surgeon General of the U. S. Public Health Service, which portrait since 1949 had been on loan to the School of Medicine and is now hung in the auditorium of the School. Mr. Darden further noted that the offer was made on behalf of Mrs. Hugh S. Cumming and her son.

The following resolution was adopted by the Board:

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the kind offer of Mrs. Hugh S. Cumming and Mr. Hugh S. Cumming, Jr. to the University of the portrait of Mr. Hugh S. Cumming, the late Surgeon General of the U. S. Public Health Service, be and it is hereby gratefully accepted subject to the approval of the Art Commission.

The President announced the receipt of a letter from Mr. Carlton C. Massey, County Executive of Fairfax County, enclosing a resolution adopted by the Board of County Supervisors of Fairfax County on 3 June 1959 in which resolution the County of Fairfax offered its close cooperation in the development of the Northern Virginia Branch College. Expressions of gratification came from several Visitors for this offer of cooperation and the resolution was ordered to be incorporated in the permanent minutes of the Board.

The resolution is as follows:

At a regular meeting of the Board of County Supervisors of Fairfax County, Virginia, held in the Board Room of the County Office Building at Fairfax, Virginia, on Wednesday, June 3, 1959, at which meeting a quorum was present and voting, the following resolution was adopted:

A Copy - Teste

Now that the Virginia Advisory Legislative Council had made its report on tuition charges in Virginia publicly supported colleges and universities, the President reported that he had recently conferred again with the Governor on a proposed tuition increase to be used to finance a new faculty salary plan. The President recommended that the tuition be increased $50 per year for Virginia students and $100 per year for out-of-state students except for students in the Graduate School of Business Administration and out-of-state students in the School of Law whose tuition charges were increased identical amounts last year. In presenting this recommendation, the President made it clear that the increased tuition, which would amount to approximately $300,000, was to be used for financing the increase in faculty salaries.

The Board adopted the following resolution:

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that, effective September 1959, the tuition charges for Virginia students be increased $50 per year and the tuition for out-of-state students be increased $100 per year, except for students in the Graduate School of Business Administration and out-of-state students in the School of Law, and, be it further resolved, that the President be and he is hereby authorized to prepare and submit for the approval of the Governor a new faculty salary plan to become effective in September 1959.

The President noted that the Garden Club of Virginia might be helpful in further restorations on the Grounds of the University. After some discussion, the President was authorized to communicate with the Garden Club of Virginia and inform them that the University is interested in any arrangements that might be made for the assistance of the Garden Club in further restoration work.

Copies of the proposed budget for 1959-1960 having been previously mailed to the Visitors, the Comptroller of the University, at the request of the Chairman of the Finance Committee, appeared before the Board and presented a Budget Summary, a copy of which was ordered to be filed with the minutes. Mr. Shea pointed out that the estimated revenues for the year 1959-1960 were only $37,000 above the revenues for the current year. The estimated expenditures call for an increase of $422,000. Mr. Shea estimated the total revenues for the fiscal year 1959-1960 at $10,348,917, and expenditures at $10,267,122, with an estimated surplus of $81,795.

After discussion, the Board resolved to approve and adopt the budget for 1959-1960 as presented.

The report of the Student Activities Committee for the session of 1958-1959, copies of which had been previously mailed to all Visitors, was ordered to be incorporated in the minutes as follows:

During the current academic session the Student Activities Committee has met a total of twenty times. The majority of these meetings was held to consider requests for funds from various student organizations. All budgets other than that of the Cavalier Daily were first submitted to the Student Council for investigation and recommendation before being submitted to the Student Activities Committee for action. This session, the Committee on the Cavalier Daily approved the budget for the student newspaper before action by the Student Activities Committee.

The committee followed its previous policy regarding the allocation of funds to student activities. At a meeting of the committee held on May 22, 1959, the following was adopted as a policy to be followed in the future:

"Any student organization or publication to be eligible for financial aid from the Student Activities Committee must meet two requirements - one, that membership in an organization or publication is open to all students, and secondly, that the group performs a service to the entire University."

**Note:** The Student Activities Committee voted on May 22, 1959 to pay from cash on hand at the end of the session $550.00 to the University Artist Series to help defray the large indebtedness of this Student Council sponsored series.

The President pointed out that it was necessary to employ an architectural firm to work on plans for the Northern Virginia Branch College. In arriving at a recommendation to be presented to the Board, the President had consulted the members of the University Long Range Planning Committee. The President recommended that the firm of Joseph H. Saunders, Jr. and Associates of Alexandria, Virginia, be employed.

The following resolution was adopted by the Board:

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the President be authorized to employ the architectural firm of Joseph H. Saunders, Jr. and Associates of Alexandria, Virginia for architectural work on the Northern Virginia Branch College.

Mr. Fenwick, on behalf of the Athletics Committee, presented an account of the work of that committee in recent months. He pointed out that on the previous night the committee had held a meeting with the Director of Athletics, the football coach, the three-three-two group, and others concerned with the athletic program of the University. He stated that, in the opinion of the Committee, a close relationship should be maintained between the Committee and those responsible for the athletic program of the University. He also pointed out the need for strong intramural and physical education programs and noted that substantial progress had been made in building such programs during the past year. For the future, the Committee planned to meet semi-annually with the athletic people. He concluded his report by commenting on the need for a new field house.

Mr. McWane, Chairman of the Finance Committee, introduced to the Board Messrs. L. B. Gunn, D. S. Willcox, and R. B. Hardaway of the State-Planters Bank of Commerce and Trusts of Richmond. Mr. Gunn led a discussion with the Visitors of the investments program of the University's Consolidated Endowment Fund, and presented a twenty-page report entitled "Report and Summary of the University of Virginia Consolidated Endowment Funds Covering the Period January 25, 1958 to January 25, 1959," a copy of which was ordered to be filed.

The President recalled to the attention of the Board the discussion at the meeting on 13 April 1959 concerning the policy as to the use of automobiles by students receiving athletic grants. The President reported that no change in policy was needed since the University policy is to administer grants according to the terms stipulated by the donor. Where the donor does not require need to be shown, no inquiry is made by the University as to automobile ownership and operation.
