The following resignation was accepted by the Board:

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the resignation of Dr. John Linsley, Assistant Professor of Physics, be and it is hereby accepted as of the end of the session of 1951-52. We wish for him the highest success in his new undertaking.

President Darden read a letter from Mr. Perkins in which Mr. Perkins submitted his resignation as Attorney for the University. The Board accepted Mr. Perkins' resignation with regret and requested The Rector to draft a resolution expressing the appreciation of the Board for Mr. Perkins' long service to the University.

The following resolution was adopted by the Board:

**RESOLVED** that Mr. C. Venable Minor be recommended to the Attorney General of the State of Virginia for appointment as Special Counsel for the University of Virginia at the same salary paid his predecessor.

The President pointed out that the hospital continued to run at a deficit and that unless additional funds were provided it would be necessary to close a part of the hospital for the coming biennium. He has requested the Director to make a study to determine how this can be done.

The President said he thought the Board would be interested to know that the President of the University of Missouri and a member of the Board of Trustees, together with the Dean of the Medical School, had spent two days at the University of Virginia Medical School studying its operation. The University of Missouri is expanding its medical school from a two-year to a four-year program. They came here because the costs were lower at the University of Virginia than at any of the other first class medical schools in the United States.

The President reported that bids on the new Physics Building had been received with a total cost of approximately $1,700,000. The President had conferred with Governor Battle and an additional $650,000 has been allocated to enable the University to proceed with the construction of the building. Whereupon, a resolution was adopted empowering the President to execute contracts for the new Physics Building, subject to the approval of the specific contracts by the Governor.

The President stated that the committee to study the organization of business training at the University which he had appointed last year had made its report. The committee recommends that the last two years of study be separated from the college and be given in a separate school.

The President requested the authority of the Board to establish a separate school, effective with the session 1952-53. Whereupon, a resolution was adopted approving the establishment of a separate school of business administration, subject to the same limitations regarding the admission of women students as obtains in the Department of Education.

The following resolution concerning the resignation of Dean Vernon W. Lippard was adopted.

**RESOLVED** THAT WHEREAS the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia has received from the President of the University the resignation of Dean Vernon W. Lippard, and has regretfully accepted it;

AND WHEREAS the Board is not willing to let this occasion pass without a proper recognition of the great and valuable services rendered by Dean Lippard to the Medical School of the University of Virginia, and to the University itself;

NOW THEREFORE, this Board records its gratitude and appreciation for the significant contribution made by Dean Lippard to the effective organization of the Medical School and to the harmony of the Medical Faculty, with the resultant improvement in the general standing of the Medical School, made all the more remarkable because of Dean Lippard's comparatively short service as head of the Medical School, and constituting in itself a tribute to the ability, tact, diplomacy and wisdom of the man.

The Board further desires to evidence by this resolution the hopes of each member of the Board for the success of Dean Lippard in his work at Yale University.

It is ordered that a copy of this resolution be spread on the minutes of the Board, thus making it a permanent record, and that another copy, attested by the Secretary of the Board, be sent to Dean Lippard.

Dr. Emmett, on behalf of the Medical Committee, reported that he and President Darden had met with a specially appointed committee of the Medical Faculty looking for a replacement for Dr. Lippard. At the present time, the committee has three candidates under consideration. The question has come up as to what salary can be offered the dean. A study of salaries of deans of medical schools shows that the average pay is $15,000. Dr. Emmett stated that he realizes that it is difficult to secure a salary of this size from State appropriations but that he feels we could not secure a well qualified man for the position unless we can pay a minimum of $15,000.

Dr. Emmett recommended that we continue to pay $12,000 from State appropriation and utilize one of the following two sources: funds received from the National Committee for Medical Education; and/or, income of the Fluid Research Fund.

Mr. Gay inquired if it would be wise to pay the dean from the Fluid Research Fund as this money is derived from the earnings of clinicians.

Dr. Emmett said that he had discussed this matter with Dean Lippard and that Dean Lippard felt that it would be satisfactory to do so if the matter were agreed upon prior to the selection of a new dean. A resolution was adopted authorizing the President to pay $15,000 for a new dean, of which $3,000 is to be paid from funds received from the National Committee for Medical Education, and/or, the Fluid Research Fund, should the first source not prove sufficient.

President Darden pointed out that it was quite possible that a successor might be found during the summer months and he should like to be in a position to offer the deanship should the right person be found. Whereupon a resolution was adopted empowering the Executive Committee to approve the appointment of a new dean of the Medical School upon the recommendation of the President.

The President stated that at the time the revised plan of compensation for clinicians was adopted, it was proposed to increase the salary of the dean to $15,000 and that he had authorized payment of an additional $3,000 to Dean Lippard from funds received from the National Committee of Medical Education.

The Secretary explained a proposal of the officers of the Class of 1952 to establish a class affiliation fee. The proposal read in part:

> "It is recommended that a class fee be included with a student's regular tuition that would take care of all graduation and finals weekend expenses.
>
> "We fully realize that there is a tendency to place many charges along with a student's tuition but it is felt that the advantages outweigh any objections to the addition of this fee. In order to cover all the expenses of graduation, this fee would have to be approximately ...five ($5.00) dollars per year for each year that a student is in school.... In the event that a student leaves school for any reason before graduating, he will automatically receive a membership in the Alumni Association for one year ($3.00 will be paid the Alumni Association) and the remainder of the fees that he has paid will not be refunded but will be considered as fees for his membership of appropriate graduating class.
>
> "Under this plan, all graduates would be members of the class and be entitled to participate in all of the functions of the finals weekend without being solicited for funds. The student would not leave the University resentful but rather with a feeling of satisfaction that he was able to enjoy a weekend without being worried with financial assessments. Also, the graduate would be a member of the Alumni Association for one year which would enable them to keep in touch with the alumni and to cultivate an interest in the Alumni Association.
>
> "The class officers would not have to worry about whether a representative number would affiliate with the class or whether the funds would be sufficient to take care of the expenses of the weekend, and to give a gift to the University. The officers would know how much money they had to work with and make plans accordingly.
>
> "At the present time, the class organization is a collecting agency for funds to defray the expenses of the weekend, provide for a class gift, and to solicit memberships for the Alumni Association. This arrangement has also led to the anomaly of actually having two organizations among the graduates, the graduates and the affiliates, all being technically members of the same class. It is not necessary for a graduate to affiliate, therefore, the class officers have to sell the idea of the class organization to lure and coerce each graduate into becoming a member. . . ."

A resolution was adopted establishing a five ($5.00) dollar fee to be assessed against each student enrolled in the University, proceeds to be used annually for expenses of graduation and class affiliation.

President Darden read the following from the Superintendent of Albemarle Public Schools:

> "As you perhaps know, the Charlottesville City School Board recently decided not to accept additional County pupils into their elementary schools next year. This fact, in addition to the greatly overcrowded condition at our McIntire School, makes it imperative that we seek additional teaching space for the coming session.
>
> "On behalf of the Albemarle County School Board, I should like to request permission from the University of Virginia for one or two of the old barracks on Copeley Hill to be used as classrooms for the session 1952-53. Our repair force would do the necessary work to make these buildings usable, such as erecting partitions and painting the interiors. . . . . . .
>
> "I shall greatly appreciate your help in this matter, since we are in a most difficult position.
>
> "With many thanks for the fine way you have worked with us in the past and for your consideration of our present problem, I am"

After discussion, the proposal was approved with the proviso that the Albemarle County School Board furnish the University with a statement that it would save the University harmless in the use of University property for this purpose.

President Darden pointed out that Mr. Dumas Malone, distinguished alumnus historian, desired to lease a small piece of the Copeley Hill property, adjacent to the Old Ivy Inn, where he planned to construct a small cottage. After discussion of the matter, the President was asked to request Mr. Malone to prepare a statement setting forth the terms under which he wished to use the land, for presentation to the Board at its September meeting.

President Darden presented two letters from Mr. Perkins concerning this matter. The first, dated June 14, read in part:

> "There is no statute and so far as my search has disclosed there has never been a statute prohibiting the admission of women to our undergraduate departments, but in my opinion the history of the controversy of these admissions, coupled with the fact that Mary Washington College is now a department of the University, conclusively indicates an intention on the part of our legislature that women shall not be admitted to the undergraduate departments at Charlottesville
>
> "The rule against these admissions is at present merely a ruling of the Board acting under its general powers referred to above but it is my considered opinion that if the Board of Visitors in the exercise of that power should decide to admit women to these departments, such action would be directly contrary to the clearly expressed intention of our legislature."

On July 9, Mr. Perkins wrote:

> "After considering the statement of the specific case as set out in the minutes, I feel that my letter of June 14th should be qualified to the following extent:
>
> 1. In view of the increasing difficulty of obtaining or retaining qualified members of our Faculty at the salaries which the University is now able to pay, it seems to me that an exception might be made to the existing rule which will be confined strictly to the daughters of members of the faculty, that is to say, professors, associate professors, and assistant professors.
>
> 2. This exception should apply, however, only in cases where in the opinion of the Board it is necessary or advisable to admit such daughters to the college in order to obtain or retain the services of the professor making the application.
>
> 3. If such admissions are approved by the Board they should be upon the following conditions:
>
> That such daughter or daughters shall during their entire enrollment in the college, live in the home of their parent or parents in the City of Charlottesville or the County of Albemarle; and that such student should be at least \_\_\_\_\_ years of age when admitted.
>
> "While I believe that making such an exception to the existing rule under the conditions above set out is entirely within the power of the Board of Visitors, the question of the advisability of such an exception is, of course, one of policy and not of law."

The President read from a letter from Mr. Roy Armstrong, Director of Admissions, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill:

> "Girls who live in their bona fide homes in the Chapel Hill township are admitted to the University on the same basis as men. Girls are also eligible for admission to the School of Pharmacy and to the School of Nursing as freshmen. All other women students must have completed two years of college work before admission to the University.
>
> "This policy is well accepted and I don't believe we have many complaints. There seems to be no great pressure toward opening the University to all women students directly from high school. I doubt that any problems are present because of the admission of Chapel Hill girls to the University as freshmen. They live in their homes. Thus, there are very few problems for the Dean of Women. . . ."

Mr. Gay stated that, as early as 1912, there was pressure on the Legislature to make the University a coeducational institution. This fight was led by Mrs. Mary Munford. To relieve this pressure, a bill was passed in 1918 directing William and Mary to admit women. In 1920 the General Faculty of the University of Virginia, with the concurrence of the President, approved recommendations of the Alumni Association that women be admitted to the graduate and professional schools of the University under such terms and conditions as The Rector and Visitors may provide. The Board of Visitors adopted these recommendations establishing certain requirements for admission to these schools.

After considerable discussion of the matter, the President and Secretary were asked to draw up an appropriate resolution to be submitted to the Board at its September meeting.

The College Retirement Equities Fund is a new method of providing retirement income for staff members. Policyholders can invest their full annuity premiums with TIAA as in the past or they can invest one-fourth, one-third or one-half in CREF and the rest in TIAA. This decision may be made by the employer for all participants in a retirement plan.

The portion of premium placed in TIAA will provide a guaranteed fixed dollar annuity; the portion placed in CREF will provide a variable, or unit, annuity based upon the performance of common stocks.

After discussion of the matter, the Board adopted the following resolution:

**RESOLVED** that each participant in this retirement plan shall contribute five per cent of his regular monthly compensation; the University of Virginia shall deduct each such contribution from compensation payments, add equal amounts as its contribution, and apply the combined sum to the purchase of retirement benefits for the participant as follows:

(a) At the election of the participant, either 100 per cent or \_\_\_\_\_ percent of such combined sum will be forwarded to Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America as a premium for a retirement annuity contract on the participant's life.

(b) The balance, if any, of such combined sum will be forwarded to the College Retirement Equities Fund as a premium for an Equities Fund annuity certificate on the participant's life.

Mrs. Herbert McK. Smith reported to the Board that the Blue Cross Association would be unable to meet its obligations under the present contract and that it was petitioning the State Corporation Commission for a 33-1/3 per cent increase in rates. The petition is to be presented on July 31, on behalf of the thirty-three (33) participating hospitals.

Mrs. Smith felt that we should support the petition. She was concerned with the lack of representation on the Blue Cross Board of hospitals located outside metropolitan Richmond. It was her feeling that these hospitals should band together and ask for a greater voice in the control of the Blue Cross Association.

Mr. Mears inquired if there was anything that could be done at this time. Mrs. Smith replied that she felt we should support the request of the Blue Cross for an increase in rates and should bring pressure on the Association to widen the representation on the Blue Cross Board.

On motion the meeting was then adjourned.
