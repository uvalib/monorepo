Board of Visitors' minutes, Accession # RG-1/1/, Special Collections Dept., University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Va.

Minutes of meetings of the university's governing body which is the legal owner and operator of the institution. Recorded in the minutes are appointments and other personnel decisions concerning faculty, decisions about construction of facilities, gifts to the university, and all other board actions, decisions and resolutions.

The Board of Visitors met at 8:15 o'clock P. M., on above date, with the following members present:

Rector Gordon, Dr. Drewry, Judge Norton and Messrs. White, Craddock and Michie, also Dr. J. M. Page, acting president.

Dr. Page stated that a request had come to the Board, from the "University Cemetery Association" for an appropriation to supplement the small income now received, in order that the cemetery might be kept in better condition than is now possible.

The matter was referred to the Executive Committee to investigate and report.

The Rector presented to the Board a letter he had received from Mr. Wm. H. Richie, under date of December 2nd, in regard to the condition of the trees on the campus, stating that in his opinion the necessary work of preservation and trimming could be done for $750 to $1,000.

The matter was referred to the Executive Committee with power to act.

The question of holding a public meeting on December 11th, to hear the advocates and opponents of the coordinate College was discussed.

The following offered by Mr. Craddock was adopted:

Resolved: That the hearing to be accorded by the Board of Visitors, for the information of the Board, to the advocates and opponents of the proposed Woman's Coordinate College, be confined to the addresses to be made by those delegated to speak for either side, and that the said meeting be in no sense a public one.

The Rector presented to the Board the following will, which was read, accepted, and ordered spread upon the records:

I, James H. Skinner of the City of Staunton, do make this my holograph will.

I devise and bequeath all my estate, real, personal, and mixed, to my friend Joseph A. Waddell, but upon these trusts:

First: That my sister, Fanny Skinner, shall have and received the income of said estate during her natural life.

Second: That after the death of said Fanny Skinner, the income of said estate shall be applied to the establishment and maintenance at the University of Virginia, of as many Scholarships of Three Hundred dollars per annum each, as such income will provide for: the same to be filled by appointments to be made by "The Trustees of the Protestant Episcopal Education Society in Virginia" of white male persons who purpose to become Ministers of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America, who desire to obtain a liberal education to that end, and who are not otherwise able to obtain such education, my suggestion being, but without restricting the discretion of the Trustees of said Education Society, that the sons of Ministers of said Church, all other things being equal, should be preferred in making appointments to such Scholarships, and in case there shall be a vacancy in any such Scholarship, and "the Trustees of the Protestant Episcopal Education Society in Virginia" shall for six months after notice in writing of such vacancy given by the Chairman of the Faculty of the University of Virginia, fail to fill it, it may be filled by "the Rector and Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia."

Third: That in case any of my investments fall in, and a reinvestment of the principal thereof shall become necessary, or in case the said Trustee shall deem it best to sell my real estate, or to dispose of any securities or investments already made, I request him by such proceeding as he may be advised to be proper, to seek the advice and to act under the decrees and orders of the Circuit Court of Augusta County, or other Court of said County of competent jurisdiction.

Fourth: That the expenses of said Trust shall be defrayed out of the income of my estate; and that the principal thereof shall in no case be diminished, or be subject to any charge of commissions, but in case of a reinvestment or change of investment, or a sale of the real estate as aforesaid, a commission shall be allowed equivalent to that of Trustees and Commissions of sales under the provisions of the Code of 1873, and a commission of five (5) per cent shall be allowed the Trustee on all collections and disbursements of the income of my estate.

Fifth: That in case it should for any reason be held that the aforesaid restrictions and limitations of the power of appointment conferred on "the Trustees of the Protestant Episcopal Society of Virginia" are invalid, then such power of appointment shall vest in said Corporation without limitations or restriction.

Sixth: I do hereby constitute and appoint the aforesaid Joseph A. Waddell executor of this my last will, dispensing with security from him as such, but the Commissions hereinbefore provided for him as Trustee shall be in full of all compensation for his services in both capacities. Witness my signature hereunto attached this 8th day of December 1877.

As a Codicil to my last will and testament, I provide that so far as my personal chattels are concerned, both such as I hold jointly with my sister, and such as I have in my sole right, she (my sister Fanny) shall have the free use, control and disposition of them without being held in any manner accountable therefor; but this provision does not apply, and must not be held applicable to the bonds, stocks, and scrip, which I hold and own either jointly with her or separately, but all such bonds stocks and scrip must be held as subject exclusively to the provisions of my will of December 8th, 1877, to which this is a codicil. Witness my hand this 19th February 1881.

James H. Skinner.

I wish further to provide by way of Codicil to my last will of date Dec. 8th, 1877, that if the commissions therein allowed to him who shall execute its provisions be not, on any account, adequate to the trouble and labor involved, there shall be such enlargement of said Commissions as shall seem right to the Judge of the Circuit or County Court of Augusta County, to whom said question shall be referred.

Witness my hand this 14th day of May 1881.

James H. Skinner.

As a third Codicil to my last will and testament which bears date December 8th, 1877, I provide (on the suggestion that it has not perhaps already been sufficiently done) that the Trustee created by said will shall have power to sell if deemed by him advisable such real estate as I am jointly entitled to with my sister, or as is separately mine, but if sold during the lifetime of my sister, her consent to sell must be first given in writing duly acknowledged for recordation or attested by at least two witnesses.

I further will that at the death of my sister Fanny, or at my death, should I survive her, my said trustee shall convey, transfer and turn over to "the Rector and Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia" all my interests in real estate however held, and in the proceeds of sale of any part thereof, that may have been made, and all my interests in and shares of bonds, stocks, scrip, securities, and choses in action and in all moneys in hand which, may have been received from previously invested funds, to be held, used, and administered by them in the establishment and maintenance of the Scholarships in the University of Virginia hereinbefore created. In the exercise of his power and discretion to sell real estate, to call in investments, to make reinvestments, and to dispose of securities or investments already made, my said Trustee may, if he shall deem it best, at the expense of my estate, seek the advice and act under the decrees and orders of the Circuit Court of Augusta County or other Court of competent jurisdiction, and the Commission or compensation to my said Trustee for conveying, transferring, and turning over my estate to "the Rector and Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia" whenever that shall occur, I desire shall be fixed and determined by said Circuit Court of Augusta County.

And as in my first codicil I give to my sister absolutely all my personal chattels,—;those which are choses in possession—;I wish to exclude from this absolute gift not only the bonds, stocks, and scrip, which are already excluded by said codicil, but also my share in the proceeds of any bonds, stocks, and scrip, which have fallen in and are awaiting investment.

I further fix the Scholarships provided for in said will at Two Hundred and Fifty Dollars per annum, instead of Three Hundred Dollars as named therein. I further provide that should on any account the power of appointment to said Scholarships which I have conferred upon "The Trustees of the Protestant Episcopal Education Society in Virginia," be held invalid or impracticable of execution, which I hope and believe will not be the case, in that event, I do hereby confer and vest said power of appointment to said scholarships in "the Rector and Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia" without limitation or restriction of any kind whatsoever.

By the words "hereinafter created" in the 21st line, page 1st of this Codicil, I mean created by my said will dated Dec. 8th, 1877. Witness my hand this 6th day of August 1886.

James H. Skinner.

As an additional Codicil to my last will and testament bearing date December 8th, 1877, I, James H. Skinner, do will and direct that instead of making Jos. A. Waddell, sole Trustee and executor of my estate, I do hereby appoint said Jos. A. Waddell and Alex. F. Robertson Trustees of my estate during the life of my sister Fanny Skinner, and also executors of this my last will, dispensing with security from them or either of them as trustees and executors.

Witness my hand this 22nd day of August, 1896.

James H. Skinner.

In the Court of Hustings for the City of Staunton, June 11th, 1898.

A writing purporting to be the last will and testament of James H. Skinner, deceased, with four codicils thereto was this day produced in Court by Jos. A. Waddell and Alex. F. Robertson, the executors therein named, and there being no subscribing witnesses thereto, Arista Hoge and George M. Cochran, Jr., were sworn and severally deposed that they were well acquainted with the testator's handwriting, and verily believe that said writing, and the name thereto subscribed, to be wholly written by the testator's own hand.

Whereupon the said writing is ordered to be recorded as the true last will and testament of the said James H. Skinner, deceased.

In connection with the foregoing will, the Rector explained that the Administrator was anxious to turn over the estate to the University as soon as possible, whereupon, the following was offered by Judge Norton and adopted:

Resolved: That the Rector of the University of Virginia be and he is authorized to receive and receipt for, in behalf of the Rector and Visitors of the University, the estate passing to said Rector and Visitors under the will of the late Col. James H. Skinner.

The following communication from President Mitchell of the Medical College of Virginia, was laid before the Board of Visitors by the Rector.

Mr. Eppa Hunton, Jr., has placed before the Executive Committee of the Medical College of Virginia, with the Medical Department of the University of Virginia, as adopted by your Board.

Mr. Hunton in his letter to you date November 14, 1913, explained fully his views based upon our knowledge and experience with the situation here, which led us to believe that it will be impossible for the Dean of the Medical School to efficiently look after the business interests of so large an enterprise, but expressed willingness to omit this clause entirely and leave it to the good judgment of your Board when it has informed itself and action is required of it.

We cannot doubt that your Board will be willing to leave itself free and untrammeled to provide such business management as may by it be deemed best when the time for action arrives, instead of committing itself irrevocably in advance to what we do not deem wisest. If your Board will agree to eliminate the last paragraph of Clause 5, which is as follows:

"The executive management of the proposed school shall, unless and until otherwise determined by said Board of Visitors, be entrusted to a Dean of the Medical Department of the University of Virginia, who shall reside in Richmond, subject to the direction of the Rector & Visitors of the University."

the resolutions adopted by your Board will be entirely satisfactory to the Medical College of Virginia.

After a very full discussion of the foregoing communication, the following was unanimously adopted:

Resolved: That the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia feel constrained to decline the proposition of the Board of the Medical College of Virginia to eliminate the second paragraph of clause 5, and to insist on the retention of the whole of said clause as an integral part of the resolutions governing the proposed merger, as adopted by the Board of Visitors of the University.

The Rector thereupon laid before the Board a resolution which had been forwarded to him by Dr. Mitchell with regard to what should be incorporated in the enabling act to be presented to the legislature, as follows:

Whereas, certain resolutions have recently been adopted by the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, setting out the terms upon which the Medical College of Virginia shall be merged into and become a part of the University of Virginia; and

Whereas, with one modification the said resolutions have been approved by this Committee, and

Whereas, it is desirable that the preparation of the Bill authorizing the proposed merger, should be begun at once; and

Whereas, it is the desire and the wish of the Medical College of Virginia that the Medical Department of the University of Virginia in inaugurating the new institution at Richmond should follow the conditions set out in the said resolutions until they have been fully and fairly tested, but except in the location of said institution, shall be perfectly free and untrammeled, after giving a full and fair test to the plan in said resolutions contained, to act as may be for the best interests of the Medical Department of the University of Virginia,

Therefore, Be it resolved, that the Medical College of Virginia does not insist nor desire any of said resolutions to be incorporated into the Enabling Act save and except the fourth resolution, which is as follows:

"4. The University of Virginia will discontinue the teaching of medicine at Charlottesville, except that instruction in subjects of the first year of the curriculum may be offered there; but the entire medical course will be maintained in Richmond, and the first year of the course may be taken either in Richmond or in Charlottesville, and this provision shall become effective as soon as the transfer from Charlottesville to Richmond shall be completed."

Pursuant with the foregoing, the following was adopted:

Resolved: That it is the sense of this Board, that in the event of the acceptance by the Board of the Medical College of Virginia of the resolutions as adopted by the University Board, that any enabling act submitted to the General Assembly, have incorporated in it the whole of the resolutions as adopted by this Board.

The following was adopted:

Resolved: That the Rector be authorized to communicate to President S. C. Mitchell of the Medical College of Virginia, the action of this Board in the matter of the resolutions with regard to the merger of said Medical College with the Medical Department of the University.

A sketch of the house proposed to be erected by the "Pi Kappa Alpha Fraternity" on Carr's Hill, together with the plans of same, were presented for action of the Board.

A letter was read from Dr. Alderman approving said building and Mr. Michie, Chairman of the Executive Committee, stated that his committee had approved the same.

The Board passed favorably on the matter and the Secretary was authorized to request Mr. Moon, attorney for the University, to prepare the necessary lease.

Dr. Page announced to the Board that the University had received from the sons of Hon. Joseph Bryan, a splendid portrait of their father, whereupon, the following was unanimously adopted:

The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, in acknowledging with grateful thanks the gift of a noble portrait of Joseph Bryan, and Alumnus of this University, and a former member of this Board, desire to put upon record their appreciation both of the gift and of the givers. Be it resolved, therefore,

1. That this University will preserve in perpetual memory the relations of Joseph Bryan to his Alma Mater—; his great affection for her high traditions, his unswerving loyalty to her true interests, his unforgetting generosity toward her needs.

2. That both as Visitor upon her board of government, and as Trustee of her endowment funds, he aided by his counsels and influence to advance her development and to augment her prosperity.

3. That his Alma Mater cherishes with just pride the record of his public services and his private virtues, and counts herself happy to have numbered among her sons a man who so perfectly united the gracious elements of the ancient Virginian culture with the pregnant energies of the modern time.

4. That the Board of Visitors extends to the donors of this portrait, John Stewart, (2) Jonathan, (1) Robert Coalter, J. St. George, and Thomas Pinckney Bryan, the assurance of their sincere and cordial thanks.

The following request was approved:

In accordance with our conversation, I beg that you will request the Board to vote me one hundred dollars, with which to construct a dark room, which is to be placed in the basement of the Observatory.

The following action of the Committee on Entrance Building, was approved:

At a meeting of the Committee on Entrance Building, there were present Messrs. Lambeth, Michie, Newcomb, Forrest. The following resolutions were presented by Mr. Forrest. Moved and seconded by Messrs. Michie and Newcomb that they be adopted. Carried.

The Committee on new Entrance Building recommends the adoption by the Board of Visitors of the following regulations to insure the proper care and management of said building.

The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, in the interests of the appearance of the main entrance to the University enact the following laws for the management of the new Entrance Building and its surroundings:

1. The building shall at all times be kept in good repair under the direction of such person or persons as the Faculty Committee on Religious Exercises shall designate, cost to be met from revenue of the building.

2. The grounds, roads and walks shall be kept in order by the University under the direction of the Superintendent of Grounds and Buildings.

3. No changes or alterations affecting the external appearance of the building or its surroundings shall ever be made except by authority of the Rector and Visitors.

4. Occupants of the building must keep the space at the front and in the rear of their stores free from dirt and litter. No goods or merchandise shall be displayed outside the stores, nor shall packing cases or the like be allowed to remain on the walks or roads.

5. No awnings or like devices will be allowed on the building.

6. No signs or notices, whether of a permanent or temporary nature, shall be placed anywhere on the outside of the building, except that each merchant or other lessee may place one or two signs on the front of each store of such character as that placed by the University upon the front of the Post Office, and each merchant or other lessee may have signs neatly painted in gilt letters upon the glass of his front doors and windows.

7. No chairs, benches, or other seats shall be placed in front of the stores, except such seats as have been provided before certain of the front windows. But this regulation does not forbid the placing of neat tables and chairs in the arcade before the west store room now leased as a tea-room.

8. No show windows shall be constructed in any of the stores except according to the plan furnished by the Architect of the building, and used for the window built in the store leased by Mr. G. W. Olivier.

9. The Faculty Committee on Religious Exercises shall have copies of these regulations printed and shall place a copy in the hands of their representative who has charge of the building, and of the Superintendent of Grounds and Buildings, and of each lessee at the time of renting. All leases shall be made subject to these restrictions and regulations.

The Board of Visitors met on this date at 10:15 o'clock in Madison Hall to hear the advocates and opponents of the Woman's Co-ordinate College matter, with the following members present; Messrs. Gordon, Flood, White, Norton Drewry, Oliver, Irvine, Craddock, Michie and Stearnes. Also Dr. J. M. Page, Acting President.

The following persons, either as individuals or representatives, spoke in behalf of the establishment at the University of a Woman's Co-ordinate College: Hon. Rosewell Page, Mrs. B. B. Munford, Wyndham Meredith, Mrs. Norman Randolph, Mrs. W. C. Stannard, Mrs. Buford, Mrs. Malvern C. Patterson, Mrs. J. B. Spiers and the Rev. W. Russell Bowie, rector of St. Paul's Church, Richmond, Mrs. J. R. Kyle of Lynchburg, representing the Federation of Women's Clubs, Miss M. L. Cobb of Norfolk, representing the University Summer School, A. C. Kountz of Newport News, vice-president of the Federation of Labor, J. B. Clineduist, Labor Inspector, and H. T. Colvin of Alexandria, secretary of the Federation of Labor, D. M. Blankenship of Naruna, representing the Farmer's Union; Miss Maria P. Duval and Miss Timberlake of Staunton; Miss Virginia McKenney of Petersburg, representing College Women, E. H. Russell, of the Fredericksburg Normal School, and Prof. W. M. Thornton and Dr. Albert Lefevre of the University.

Letters were read from many prominent Alumni favoring the scheme, among which were those from President Woodrow Wilson, and Hon. Walton Moore.

Those who spoke in opposition to the woman's college were Mr. Randolph Harrison of Lynchburg, Mr. Henry Taylor, Jr., Hon. Eppa Hunton, Jr., and W. M. McGuire of Richmond, Mr. Robert M. Hughes of Norfolk, and Professor Charles A. Graves of the University of Virginia.

Letters were also read from alumni and others opposing the scheme; among them were the following: A. R. Hoxton, Prin. Episcopal High School, Mr. L. M. Blackford, Jr., Episcopal High School; John P. McGuire, Prin. McGuire's University School; J. Carter Walker, Prin. Woodberry Forest School; and James Mercer Garnett, Jr., representing the Maryland Alumni Association.

At 8:30 P.M., the Board went into executive session at the President's office and a letter from Dr. Alderman to the Rector and Visitors was presented, in which he strongly advocated the establishment of the proposed college. Dr. James M. Page presented and read a paper in advocacy of the matter under consideration, presenting a scheme of operation.

The Board, feeling that the matter was one of great import, and that it should be carefully weighed, and that time should be given for consideration of the points presented by the speakers and representatives, considered it unadvisable to take a vote at this time; whereupon, the following resolution was adopted:

Resolved: That the further consideration of the question of the establishment of a Woman's Co-ordinate College at the University of Virginia, be postponed to Monday, January 5th, 1914 at 12:00 M.

On motion, the Board then adjourned.
