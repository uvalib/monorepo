At a called meeting of the Rector and Visitors on above date in the President's Office, East Lawn,

Present: Rector Gordon, Visitors White, Craddock, Oliver, Randolph, Norton and Stearnes. Also Dr. J. M. Page, Acting President.

The Rector having called the Board to order at 10:30 A. M., The following was adopted:

Resolved: That the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia tender herewith their appreciative thanks to Mrs. Huntington Wilson for her gift of $100.00 to be used for the purpose of securing a lecture at this University on the subject of Eugenics by the most competent authority available.

The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia desire to make grateful acknowledgment to John Thomas Lupton, Esq., of Chattanooga, Tennessee, for the gift of a worthy copy in bronze of Houdon's statue of George Washington.

To erect on the grounds of Alma Mater so noble a memorial to the most heroic figure of our national history is a task not unworthy of the love and devotion of a son of this University, and a native of the state which gave birth to the "Father of his Country."

To feel that through this statue he will impress on the hearts and consciences of uncounted generations of young Americans the most exalted conceptions of civic duty and patriotic love; that the lessons of manliness and courage and unselfishness and truth spoken by those silent lips will beautify and ennoble and enrich innumerable lives—; these things are the donor's true and great reward. To these the Visitors of this University would wish to add their appreciation and their thanks.

Resolved: That the authorities of the United States Military Academy be and are hereby granted permission to have made a copy of the portrait of Professor E. H. Courtenay. This permission is granted subject to condition that the copy shall be made here; and that the portrait, which is the property of the University, shall be properly cared for while the copy is being made.

Whereas, Mr. H. L. Spratt has been registered in the law School for three successive sessions before this one; and has paid the full tuition fee and University fee; and

Whereas, Mr. Spratt has had to leave the University each year about the end of the second term, to go to work, and thus has not received any benefit for the fees which he has paid three different times for the third term of the session, be it

Resolved: That Mr. Spratt be and he is hereby permitted to register for the second and third terms of this session in the Law School of the University on the payment of two-thirds of the University fee.

Whereas, Mr. C. C. Hedges, a student in the Department of Medicine of the University was admitted to the Infirmary several weeks ago, and treated 31 days for scarlet fever, be it

Resolved: That Mr. Hedges be charged for this service at the rate of $4.00 a week for board and room and for one-half of the salary of the trained nurse attending him, the University paying the other half of the salary of the trained nurse.

Resolved: That the Superintendent of Grounds be and he is hereby requested to see that the old Infirmary building is put into a suitable state of repair; and that he act in consultation with the University physician in equipping the building in such manner that patients can be safely and comfortably cared for.

Resolved: That any student admitted to the Infirmary for treatment shall be charged the special student rate of the hospital, as provided in the catalogue.

Resolved: That a sum not to exceed $50.00 be and is hereby appropriated for the purpose of helping to defray expenses incident to the celebration of Washington's Birthday by the Washington Literary Society, to be held on Feb. 22, 1913.

Whereas, the Finance Committee of the classes of 1908 and 1903, have requested financial assistance from the Board of Visitors in the matter of holding reunions of these classes proposed for the Finals of June 1913, be it

Resolved: That the Faculty Committee on Public Celebrations be and is hereby requested to co-operate with the officers of the above mentioned classes with a view to reporting to the Executive Committee of the Board of Visitors the sum which the Visitors should be expected to subscribe to the proposed reunions; and that the Executive Committee of the Board be and are hereby empowered to act upon this matter.

The following letter to the Board, was presented by the Dean,—;and approved in resolution below,—;

I respectfully request that, in the event of the Bursar electing not to occupy the house now occupied by Mr. Moran, at such time as the latter shall cease to occupy it, I be granted the privilege of renting it on the same terms on which Mr. Moran now occupies it.

I do this with the full knowledge that Mr. Carruthers has this privilege if he decides at that time to exercise it, and while I do not wish to force his decision in advance or to prejudice his right, I will state that I make this application not only with his knowledge, but also his consent and approval.

I would point out the fact that it is desirable to have a bonded officer of the Bursar's office always on the grounds within reach at a moment's notice (one who has access to and knowledge of the books and records of the University) and, with the salary which the authorities have so far seen fit to grant me, it would not be possible to secure such quarters, even were they available which is not the case.

Earnestly praying your favorable consideration, I am,

Resolved: That the above application of Mr. C. H. H. Thomas be granted in view of the fact that the house now occupied by Mr. Moran was erected for the Bursar and appertains, in a sense, to the Bursar's office.

Resolved: That for the rest of the current session, the rules governing the rental and occupancy of rooms in the Randall Building and on East Range shall be the same as for the rooms in the other University dormitories, as far as the occupants boarding at the Commons is concerned.

### Resolutions Respecting the Removal and Rebuilding of the Structure known as Temperance Hall.

(3) That the net income remaining in the hands of the Bursar, after meeting all the charges named above, shall be paid over by the Bursar to the Treasurer appointed by the Faculty Committee on Religious Exercises and their successors in office, to be used as said Committee shall direct, for the moral and religious good of the students of the University.

(4) That in the event of the abolishment of the said Committee on Religious Exercises, the said net revenues shall be paid over to such other Committee or University society or organization as shall be entrusted with such functions as now pertain to the said Committee on Religious Exercises, and that the funds thus acquired shall be used as aforesaid.

Resolved: That Dr. Page is hereby authorized and requested to investigate the heating plant for the Chapel, and if found defective, to use his discretion in making such arrangements as will adequately heat said chapel.

On recommendation of Dr. W. A. Lambeth, Superintendent of Buildings and Grounds, it was

Resolved: That the C. A. Ry. Co. be permitted to install, at their own expense, electric fixtures in our power house, in order to test out a proposition they are making us for economy of lighting.

A communication was received from Mr. W. H. Manning, Landscape Architect, stating that his contract with the University expired on January 1, 1913, and making a proposition looking to a contract on a different basis for the future. After some discussion of the matter, it was deemed advisable to defer action until the return of President Alderman.

There being no further business, on motion, the Board adjourned, subject to the call of the Rector.

I respectfully request that, in the event of the Bursar electing not to occupy the house now occupied by Mr. Moran, at such time as the latter shall cease to occupy it, I be granted the privilege of renting it on the same terms on which Mr. Moran now occupies it.

I do this with the full knowledge that Mr. Carruthers has this privilege if he decides at that time to exercise it, and while I do not wish to force his decision in advance or to prejudice his right, I will state that I make this application not only with his knowledge, but also his consent and approval.

I would point out the fact that it is desirable to have a bonded officer of the Bursar's office always on the grounds within reach at a moment's notice (one who has access to and knowledge of the books and records of the University) and, with the salary which the authorities have so far seen fit to grant me, it would not be possible to secure such quarters, even were they available which is not the case.

Earnestly praying your favorable consideration, I am,
