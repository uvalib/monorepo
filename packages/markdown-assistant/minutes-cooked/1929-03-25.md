Harding Walker, and Visitors Buchanan, Carson, Hart, Hull, McIntire, Munford, Rinehart, Scott, and Williams, President Alderman, and Mr. J. L. Newcomb, Assistant to the President.

The Rector presided and presented to the Governor the purpose of the meeting, reciting the action taken at the meeting of the Board on February 1st upon the report of the Special Committee of the Board, and called on Mr. Hull, the chairman of the Special Committee to make the report on behalf of the Board.
