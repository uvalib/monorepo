### The New Buildings Committee submitted the following report with respect to the proposed N. R. O. T. C. building and the creation of a deficit for furnishing the Interns' Quarters, which were adopted:

#### Report of the New Buildings Committee:

I. At a meeting of the New Buildings Committee of the Board held on April 29, 1941, the following resolution was adopted:

RESOLVED, by the New Buildings Committee of the Rector and Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia that the President be and he is hereby directed to make application to the Works Progress Administration for the construction of a teaching building to house the Naval Officers Reserve Training Corps at a cost not to exceed $140,000, $100,000 of which is to be furnished by the Federal Government as a gift and the other $40,000 to be requested as a deficit appropriation authorized by the Governor of the Commonwealth.

It is further Resolved that this building shall be located on the plat of ground between Minor Hall and Dawson's Row, facing the back of the McIntire Theatre.

Pursuant to this resolution, a letter was addressed by the President to the Governor of the Commonwealth, which letter is herewith approved by the Board and ordered to be spread upon the minutes of the Board.

RESOLVED, by the New Buildings Committee of the Board that the President be and he is hereby authorized and directed to request the Governor to authorize a deficit in the sum of $14,000 to furnish the Interns' Quarters.

The Secretary was directed to spread upon the minutes the letter of President Newcomb of April 22, 1941, to the Governor in the matter of the proposed N. R. O. T. C. Building, as follows:

I am authorized and directed by the Rector and Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia to request you to authorize a deficit appropriation of $40,000.00 upon condition that the Works Project Administration spends an additional $100,000.00 on a building for the Naval Officers' Training Corps Unit at the University of Virginia, the estimated cost of which is $140,000.00.

This proposal has been certified by the Secretary of the Navy as necessary for the national defense and the Works Projects Administration has directed us to prepare the necessary plans and specifications upon which to make a detailed estimate of the costs. The building is to be of fire-proof structure and used for classroom purposes.

A real emergency exists here in that we have been unable to properly accommodate the unit for the single course held this session. Next year there will be two courses offered, the following year three courses, and in the third year four courses. We are without proper buildings to instruct the naval students.

Trusting that this will meet with your approval and that you will authorize us to go ahead with this proposal, I am,

### The Special Committee in this matter, composed of Lewis C. Williams and President Newcomb, submitted the following report and recommendation, which were approved and ordered spread upon the minutes.

Mr. Lewis C. Williams and Mr. John L. Newcomb having been appointed by the Board, a Committee to meet with Mr. Henry P. Strause and to discuss with him the possibility of our exhibiting for a one year period his art collection including grandfather clock, furniture, silver, glassware, china and portraits, reported to the Board that they had spent practically a full day with Mr. Strause in going over his collection; that they had requested Mr. Strause to lend to the Art Museum of the University of Virginia four or five of his important tapestries and some of his solid furniture; that they were unwilling to recommend the acceptance of the loan of the rest of his collection because they did not believe that we had the space or the type of temperature humidity controlled buildings in which to safely keep this collection.

### The following resolution, with respect to improvements to the University of Virginia Airport, was adopted:

RESOLVED by the Rector and Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia that the sponsors contributions to the improvements of the University of Virginia Airport, being done by W. P. A., be and the same is hereby increased from $5,000 to $7,000, the Government's contribution remaining at $21,000, thereby making a total expenditure of $28,000. The additional $2,000 is to be paid from the following sources:

The President presented to the Board the unanimous request of the College Topics Board, reinforced by a resolution of the University Student Senate, asking that College Topics be permitted to come out six times a week during the session of 1941-42 and that a $3.00 subscription price be required of all students of the University.

After a thorough discussion of this subject, it was agreed that this is not a favorable time for increasing student charges or for increasing the newspaper services to the student body. However, since some decrease in student attendance was to be expected for the session 1941-42, it was RESOLVED by the Rector and Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia that the College Topics be published for the 1941-42 session three times a week and that the fee charged to each student of the University of Virginia for this paper be fixed at $2.00 per session.

The President presented to the Rector and Visitors two letters from Morrison & Co., Real Estate Brokers of Sterling, Colorado, in which letters an offer was made to purchase the Jobe Land owned by the University in Logan County, Colorado at the sum of $4,800.00, $800.00 of which was to be a down payment, the balance of the principal to be paid at the rate of $400.00 per year over a ten-year period and all remaining principal be subject to a 3% interest rate throughout the ten-year period.

After careful consideration of the receipts and expenditures from this property over the period of the last four years, it was thereupon

RESOLVED by the Rector and Visitors of the University that the offer be and the same is hereby accepted in accordance with the aforesaid terms and conditions.

RESOLVED further that the Rector be and he is hereby requested and directed to execute a proper deed conveying this property to the new purchaser and that E. I. Carruthers, Secretary of the Board be directed to affix the seal of the University to this deed, it being understood and agreed that the deed conveying this property shall be approved by the Attorney for the University before being executed by the Rector and certified by the Secretary.

On motion, the meeting then adjourned.

I am authorized and directed by the Rector and Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia to request you to authorize a deficit appropriation of $40,000.00 upon condition that the Works Project Administration spends an additional $100,000.00 on a building for the Naval Officers' Training Corps Unit at the University of Virginia, the estimated cost of which is $140,000.00.

This proposal has been certified by the Secretary of the Navy as necessary for the national defense and the Works Projects Administration has directed us to prepare the necessary plans and specifications upon which to make a detailed estimate of the costs. The building is to be of fire-proof structure and used for classroom purposes.

A real emergency exists here in that we have been unable to properly accommodate the unit for the single course held this session. Next year there will be two courses offered, the following year three courses, and in the third year four courses. We are without proper buildings to instruct the naval students.
