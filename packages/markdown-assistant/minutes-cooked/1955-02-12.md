The regular monthly meeting of the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia was held on this date in the Office of the President of the University, at Charlottesville, with the following present: The Rector, Barron F. Black, President Colgate W. Darden, Jr., Visitors Barksdale, Coxe, Dunn, Emmett, Gravatt, Howard, McWane, Mrs. Smith, Talbott, and Wheeler. Absent: Visitors Gray, Mears, and Mr. Smith.

The minutes of the January meetings, previously distributed, were approved.

The following resolution was adopted by the Board:

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the resignation of Dr. Leroy S. Pearce, Instructor in Pathology, be and it is hereby accepted as of January 1, 1955.

We wish for him the highest success in his new undertaking.

The Board adopted the following resolution:

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the following persons be and they are hereby elected to the faculty:

* Mr. William Zuk as Associate Professor of Civil Engineering, effective at the beginning of the session of 1955-56, at a session salary of $5,800.00.
* Dr. John E. Deverall as Associate Professor of Mechanical Engineering, effective at the beginning of the session of 1955-56, at a session salary of $5,800.00.
* Dr. Herbert A. Claiborne, Jr. as Instructor in Obstetrics, effective on 1 January 1955, at a salary of $8,000, of which $3,000 shall come from the State budget and $5,000 from departmental earnings.

The following resolution was adopted by the Board:

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the Hospital Accounts Committee be and it is hereby authorized to charge off as uncollectible accounts Schedules 496, 497, 498, 500, 501, 502, 503 and 504, aggregating $57,928.13, as recommended by them.

\[Subsequently corrected. See March 11 minutes under same heading]

The President laid before the Board a letter from the Comptroller of the University, with attached list of funds, as follows:

On the enclosed list we have set forth a number of gifts to the Graduate School of Business which, at the time of receipt, were added to the Consolidated Endowment Fund. Now that a separate fund has been established for the Graduate School, I believe it advisable to transfer these funds from the Consolidated Endowment Fund to the new fund.

If you concur in the above proposal, please present this matter to the Board at its next meeting, as transfers from the Consolidated Endowment Fund must be authorized by the Board.

(Account #5192)

The Board resolved that the Comptroller be authorized to transfer these funds as proposed.

President Darden stated that he would like to travel in Europe with his family from about mid-June until some time in August and requested leave from the Board to be absent from Virginia during this period. The Board resolved unanimously that the request be granted.

Mrs. Smith reported that the Buildings and Grounds Committee had met on February 11th with the Virginia Art Commission, with all members of the Commission present. Professor Frederick D. Nichols of the School of Architecture had attended the joint meeting by invitation and had presented photocopies of Jefferson's original architectural drawings for the Rotunda, with photographs and other documentation on the interior of the Rotunda prior to the fire of 27 October 1895. The Art Commission, impressed with the unusual detail of the documentation, and the beauty and functionalism of the original plans, had thereupon adopted the following resolution:

1. Art Commission approved heartily of the proposal for a restoration of the Rotunda to its original plan and appearance.
2. The data presented indicates that there is ample documentation for a complete and accurate restoration.
3. The Commission's action is based on the understanding that this would be a faithful and complete restoration with furnishings and with no considerable compromises.

Professor Nichols, Mrs. Smith said, had discussed his ideas for the interior restoration work with Mr. Fiske Kimball, the leading living authority on Jefferson's architecture and the neoclassical revival in America. After some hesitation over any tampering with the work of so important an architect as Stanford White, Mr. Kimball had expressed great enthusiasm for Mr. Nichols' proposal. Mr. Kimball had remarked that Jefferson was a greater architect than Stanford White, that the Rotunda was his last great architectural monument, and that Mr. Nichols' functional idea of making the Rotunda the administrative center of the University was strictly in accord with Jefferson's conception of academic architecture.

Mrs. Smith noted that the Art Commission's suggestion that the Rotunda be suitably furnished might be costly, and said that her Committee did not recommend any decision or action by the Board at this time.

The Board resolved that Mrs. Smith's Report be accepted and approved and that the signed Resolution from the Art Commission be filed with the Secretary.

The President laid before the Board the following letter and enclosure from President Morgan L. Combs.

Under authority granted by the Governor on November 12, 1954, Mary Washington College has been authorized to borrow from current funds in the State Treasury $1,356,515.57 with interest at the rate of one per centum per annum, beginning January 20, 1955 until paid.

You will note that the authorities in Richmond agreed to reduce the rate of interest from one and one-half per cent, which we originally agreed upon, to one per cent. You will also observe that interest on this amount will begin on January 20, 1955 and run until paid. I think we are very fortunate indeed in getting this low rate of interest and having it deferred until January 20, 1955, which saves more than a half-year's interest.

I am enclosing herewith the note in the amount and conditions set forth above, and I shall greatly appreciate it if you will present this matter to the Board of Visitors at their next meeting for approval.

$1,356,515.57

On or before July 1, 1956, the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia promises to repay into the State Treasury the sum of $1,356,515.57 with interest at the rate of one per centum per annum, from January 20, 1955, until paid, which has been borrowed from current funds in the State Treasury under authority granted by the Governor on November 12, 1954, for Mary Washington College.

This loan is made pursuant to the provisions of Section 46 and 47, Chapter 708 of the Acts of 1954, and the source approved by the Attorney General in a letter to the Governor under date of April 27, 1944.
