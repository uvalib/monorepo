Board of Visitors' minutes, Accession # RG-1/1/, Special Collections Dept., University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Va.

Minutes of meetings of the university's governing body which is the legal owner and operator of the institution. Recorded in the minutes are appointments and other personnel decisions concerning faculty, decisions about construction of facilities, gifts to the university, and all other board actions, decisions and resolutions.

A Special meeting of the Board of Visitors was held on this date at the residence of the Rector in Richmond, Va., at which were present the Rector and Visitors Corbitt, Garnett, Goolrick, Munford, Rinehart, Stuart, L. C. Williams and R. Gray Williams, and President Newcomb.

The President announced a gift by John Lee Pratt of 300 shares of stock of the General Motors Securities Corporation for the purpose of purchasing and installing a diesel engine in the Engineering Building for teaching purposes, and stated that action by the Board was required to effect surrender of the stock certificate for exchange into common stock of the General Motors Corporation, including agreement of indemnification required by the Company on liquidating the said stock. The following motion, duly made and seconded, was adopted.

**RESOLVED, by the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia That J. L. Newcomb, its President, be and he is hereby authorized and directed to surrender stock certificate No. P-571 for three hundred shares of "Class A" stock of the General Motors Securities Corporation for exchange into common stock of the General Motors Corporation.**

The President is further authorized and directed to execute all papers in connection therewith, including the agreement of indemnification which is required by the Company on liquidation of "Class A" stock of the General Motors Securities Corporation.

The President stated that he had received a proposition to lease a small parcel of land, approximately 40 ft Ã— 110 ft, in the rear of the Entrance Building, for the purpose of erecting a theatre with access thereto through the central room of the Entrance Building, at a monthly rental of $100.00, the lease to run for a term of approximately 20 years at the end of which time the said building would become the property of the University, and that during the term of said lease the University was to have the use of the theatre two nights in each month free of rent. The Board approved of the proposition in general, subject to final approval by the President, the Committee on Buildings and Grounds and the Architectural Commission.

The President stated that the property, formerly occupied by Dean Page, now occupied by Dean Ferguson, was without a garage, and that Dean Ferguson had requested the University to erect a garage at a cost of approximately $300.00 for which he would agree to pay $5.00 per month rent. The Board approved the request.

The President then took up the athletic situation at the University in connection with membership in the Southern Conference and outlined the course he had pursued to ascertain from his Faculty Senate and the athletic officials the course to be followed at the meeting of the Southern Conference on December 11th and 12th, 1936.

Following a very full discussion of the matter, Mr. Goolrick moved, being seconded by Mr. Garnett,

**RESOLVED, That the University resign from the Southern Conference, and that the statement read by the President, with such amendments as he may deem proper, be presented as our reason for the action taken.**

The foregoing motion was adopted by a vote of 5 to 4, as follows Ayes. Corbitt, Garnett, Goolrick, Rinehart, and Scott Noes. Munford, Stuart, L. C. Williams and R. Gray Williams. The meeting then adjourned.
