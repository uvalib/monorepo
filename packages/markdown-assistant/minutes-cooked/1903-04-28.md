At a called meeting of the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia held on April 28th 1903.

Present: The Rector, and Visitors H. H. Downing, A. W. Wallace, R. Walton Moore, D. Harmon, Carter Glass, H. C. Stuart, & R. Tate Irvine.

The Board was called to order by the Rector, & the following resolutions were adopted.

### Be it resolved as follows

1. The Board should proceed, after such advertisement as is required, to appoint a President of the University.

2. The President shall be the chief executive head of the institution, with the powers, duties, and responsibilities ordinarily belonging to such office in the leading American Universities, and shall receive a salary of $5000. per annum.

3. Such powers, duties, and responsibilities shall be defined by the Board, and to that end the Committee already considering the general subject shall report to the Board at its next meeting.

4. The office of Chairman of the Faculty shall cease from the date of the installation of the President, but shall remain unaffected till that time.

5. The appointment of a President shall be made at a meeting of the Board to be held at the University at 12 o'clock, Saturday, June 13th 1903.

6. The Secretary of the Board shall cause notice of the time when and the place where the President will be appointed, as aforesaid, to be given by advertisement printed for four successive weeks in the "Times-Dispatch", a daily newspaper of general circulation published in the City of Richmond.

Resolved that the payment of $40500, made by the Proctor in entertaining the Southern Educational Conference, be approved.

Resolved that the Proctor be directed to investigate and report to the next meeting of the Board the advisability of approving of the sale of the real estate belonging to the Austin Fund in Chelsea and Malden, Massachusetts.

Resolved that the sum of Fifty Dollars be appropriated to provide a debaters' medal to be competed for by the Literary Societies during the present session, the same to be called the "Board of Visitors Medal".

The Board of Visitors respectfully calls the attention of the Legislature to the urgent need for one ward, at least, to be built for the Hospital. The rooms in the administration building are all that are now available for patients, and these are greatly crowded. The number of pay patients seeking admission makes it difficult to provide for Charity patients, for whose accommodation there is a large demand.

The highly satisfactory record of our graduates in medicine in the past makes it a matter of the first importance that the practical clinical instruction should be complete in order to enable us to maintain our standard, which is in advance of any other medical school in the country.

The Proctor is directed to present this matter to the consideration of the Legislature.

Resolved that the Board highly appreciates the valuable services of Mr. E. Reinhold Rogers as adjunct professor of Moral Philosophy during the absence of Professor Davis, who has informed the Board that he is now able to resume his duties.

Whereas the Board is informed that the old pupils of The Norwood High School desire to present to the University a portrait of their former instructor, Mr. Thomas H. Norwood,â€”;

Resolved by this Board that it will accept with pleasure, on behalf of the University, such portrait, to be hung in the Library with distinguished sons of the University.

Visitors Harmon, Moore, and Glass were appointed by the Rector a committee to co-operate with committees of the Alumni & Faculty, respectively, in entertaining the President of the United States, on the occasion of his visit to the University during the next commencement.

On motion, the Board adjourned sine die.
