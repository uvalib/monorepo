The Acting President advised the Board of the great number of telegrams and resolutions of sympathy touching upon the death of President Alderman that had been received, among them resolutions from the Alumni Association, and inquired as to the proper disposal of them. The matter was referred to the Rector and Acting President to consult with the Alumni Association and report to the Board some suggestion as to appropriate form in which said memorials might be assembled.

The special committee appointed at the last meeting of the Board, consisting of Messrs. Walker, Buchanan and Williams, to prepare, on behalf of the Board, resolutions with respect to the death of President Alderman, submitted a draft thereof which was accepted and ordered spread and a copy engrossed and presented to Mrs. Alderman. The Secretary was directed to have a sufficient number of copies printed for distribution to the present and former members of the Board who were associated with President Alderman during his tenure of the office of President of the University of Virginia.

The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia inexpressibly shocked and grieved at the announcement of the sudden death of Dr. Edwin A. Alderman, the President of the University, which occurred on the night of April the 29th while on his way to the University of Illinois to deliver an address at the inauguration of its President, desire to record on their minutes some expression of their sense of the loss which has been sustained in his death by the University, the State of Virginia and the cause of education throughout the country, especially in the South where his life was passed, as well as of their own sense of personal bereavement occasioned by this sad event.

Dr. Alderman's whole life since his early manhood was devoted to educational work. Beginning in his youth in his native State of North Carolina he travelled over the State with his friend and colleague, Dr. Chas. D. McIvor, in an effort to awaken interest in popular education and so successful were these pioneers that their labors marked the beginning of a new era in the educational history of that State, and set in motion influences for good which have continued to this day.

After serving for some years as President of the University of North Carolina he accepted the presidency of Tulane University, whence in 1904 he came to the University of Virginia as its first President, and for twenty-seven years he served it with unsurpassed loyalty, ability and devotion.

His task, especially in the early years of his administration, was one of peculiar difficulty. Owing to the traditions which had grown up around the University since its foundation and the spirit of conservatism which prevailed with reference to everything connected with it, including its courses of study and its method of government, there were not a few among its alumni, in its faculty and its student body who regarded the change involved in the election of a President in the light of a doubtful if not a dangerous innovation, and who feared that as the result of this innovation the University would lose those distinctive characteristics which differentiated it from other institutions and for which it was most highly esteemed and venerated. Under these circumstances the new President, who was progressive as well as conservative, could not, certainly in the beginning of his administration, reasonably anticipate sympathetic and wholehearted co-operation in his plans for the development of the University. The situation in order to be successfully met demanded in an unusual degree wisdom and tact and patience as well as courage and resolution. That it was successfully met and that the expediency of the change from the old order to the new was amply vindicated is now a matter of history. Through a gradual process of growth and development the University of Virginia has become a modern University. Its material advancement during the last twenty-seven years has been very great. Its student enrollment, not including the Summer Quarter and the Extension Schools, has increased from about seven hundred to more than twenty-five hundred, its faculty from fifty-five to more than three hundred; its endowment from three hundred and fifty thousand to ten million dollars, its buildings and material equipment immensely increased, and its annual income from one hundred and sixty thousand to two million, one hundred fifty thousand dollars. But with all the growth and change which has taken place its most precious possessions, the intangible but invaluable things of the spirit which have characterized the University since its foundation, honor and truth and manliness and courtesy, and courage and patriotism and freedom of thought have been cherished and preserved.

Dr. Alderman has been conservatively progressive. He jealously strove to guard and preserve what was best from the past, while eagerly seeking whatever good could be gained from the increasing knowledge and experience of men. Thoroughly in sympathy with the educational ideals of the founder and father of the University he thought of popular education as an unity, a system extending from the primary schools up to the University as its capstone, and he conceived the true function of a University to be that expressed in the motto of the Prince of Wales, to serve, first of all its own students, then as a State University to serve the people of the State in as many ways as possible, then in a broader sense to increase the sum of human knowledge and assist in the discovery of truth for the benefit of all mankind. In conformity with this conception the University under his leadership has been and is progressing in its approach towards the realization of these ideals.

With its Summer Quarter and Extension Schools, its Library extension features, which make available as far as practicable the facilities of the Library for the use of the people of the State and the public schools of the State, the admission of women to its graduate and professional schools, the research and statistical work being done by the School of Rural and Social Economics, its periodic publications, its Institute of Public Affairs, its greatly enlarged hospital facilities permitting the extension of its benefits constantly more widely, not to mention other agencies, the University of Virginia touches the life of the State today more widely and more helpfully than ever before in its history. In addition, a considerable amount of original research work is being done in several departments and its results published.

The Personal and official relations of Dr. Alderman with the members of the Board of Visitors serving with him have always been of the most cordial and pleasant character. His unswerving loyalty and devotion to the interests of the University, his untiring and successful labors in its behalf, his farsighted vision of its ever increasing needs and his efforts to make provision for them, his broad and statesman-like views of its policies, his eloquent and brilliant advocacy of its claims upon the consideration of the representatives of the State as well as upon benevolent agencies and individuals, his ceaseless dreaming and planning for its greater usefulness and influence won for him their unstinted admiration and esteem; while his charming personal qualities, his unfailing courtesy, his sympathetic understanding and consideration of views and opinions which might differ from his own, his warmhearted and generous personal interest in every member of this body gained their affection and made him their friend, so that his death has produced in all his official family a feeling of poignant personal bereavement.

### The meeting then adjourned
