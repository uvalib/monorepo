A called meeting of the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia was held on this date at 10:00 A.M. in the Office of the President of the University, at Charlottesville, with the following present. The Rector, Frank Talbott, Jr., President Colgate W. Darden, Jr., and Visitors Berkeley, Bryan, Coxe, Emmett, Gravatt, Jones, Martin, Pollock, Mr. Smith, and Wheeler. Absent: Visitors Gray, Greear, Hartfield, McWane, Paschall, and Mrs. Smith.

The minutes of the meeting of 14 December 1957, previously distributed, were approved.

In reporting to the Board the unavoidable absence of Mrs. Emily P. Smith, the Rector expressed his keen personal and official regret at the retirement from the Board, as of the close of today's meeting, of Mrs. Smith, Dr. John M. Emmett, and Mr. J. Segar Gravatt. President Darden joined in the appreciation of the Board for their unselfish service for the maximum terms permitted by statute.

The Rector pointed out that the urgent matter of the choice of a permanent site for the Northern Virginia College would require the full time of the Board at today's meeting. In addition to that matter, he intended to present only a resolution from the Faculty of the Clinch Valley College, but would ask the President to present the matter of the bids for the new Hospital construction. He recommended that all other items on today's agenda, as laid before the Board in the President's docket, be referred to the Executive Committee for study and action in detail.

The Board accordingly resolved that the Executive Committee be authorized, pursuant to Section 23-75 Code of Virginia, to act in the name of the Board of Visitors on all matters in today's docket not otherwise disposed of by the full Board, and to act with the same authority upon any matters which the President might see fit to refer to the Committee between today's date and the meeting of the Board scheduled to be held in Fredericksburg on 12 April 1958.

The Secretary was instructed to record all actions of the Executive Committee under this resolution as actions of the Board in the minutes of today's meeting or of the April 12th meeting, as might be appropriate. A signed statement detailing the Committee's decisions was subsequently filed with the Secretary's notes on today's meeting, whereby the Executive Committee approved on behalf of the Board the following matters under the headings "Gifts and Grants", "Elections", "Cancellation of Election", "Appointment", "Leave of Absence", "Resignation", "Military Property Custodian", and "Clinch Valley College Fees", and the resolutions, respectively, pertaining thereto.

The President announced the following gifts and grants

The following resolution was adopted

The following resolution was adopted

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the election of Mr. Albrecht Frölich as Visiting Professor of Mathematics for the second semester of the session of 1957-58 be and it is hereby cancelled. He has been unable to obtain a United States visa.

In accordance with the resolution adopted by the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia on 14 July 1945, authorizing the President to give the proper professorial standing on the faculty to officers of the armed services on duty at the University in the Reserve Officers' Training Corps programs, the following appointment was announced by President Darden

Major Robert A. Maqoon as Associate Professor of Air Science, effective in the summer of 1958, at no salary from the University.

The following resolution was adopted:

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that Mr. Charles Murrah, Assistant Professor of English, be and he is hereby granted leave of absence without pay for the session of 1957-58 to write a book.

The following resolution was adopted:

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the resignation of Mr. Irvin L. Ramsey, Assistant Professor of Elementary Education, be and it is hereby accepted as of the end of the summer of 1958, to take a position at The Ohio State University.

We wish for him the highest success in his new undertaking.

The following resolution was adopted

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that Mr. T. M. Burruss be and he is hereby relieved of his duties as Military Property Custodian of the University.

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that Mr. D. B. Moyer be and he is hereby designated Military Property Custodian of the University with the power to requisition, receive, store, and account for military property and otherwise transact business pertaining thereto, for and in behalf of the University of Virginia.

President Darden reported on the large number of bids received for the new hospital construction work, the closeness of the bidding, and the University's good fortune in getting the primary construction done at a rate of approximately $1.60 a foot, this being substantially below the best estimated figure.

The Board resolved that the President be authorized to accept the low bids, as approved and recommended by the Bureau of the Budget in Richmond, and to proceed with the construction of the building.

President Darden reported on his correspondence with the Governor regarding fees and revenue estimates at the Clinch Valley College, and presented the following memorandum from the Provost

I think we should ask the Board for permission to go ahead with some slight increases in fees at Clinch Valley College to make increases in faculty salaries to bring them in line with proposed increases at Mary Washington, Longwood, etc.

Mr. Smiddy, Mr. Shea, and I have reviewed the situation and think that, by increasing the charge per semester-hour from $8.50 to $9.50 for college and education courses, and from $12.00 to $12.50 for engineering courses, and including $10 for library fees and $10 for activity fees, we feel we can make the necessary increases and promotions which will amount to $7,300. In my judgment, we must make the increases if we are to retain our present staff and attract new people to this rather remote area.

As calculated by Mr. Shea, the financial situation at Clinch Valley looks like this

It was resolved that the fees be increased as set forth above in the Provost's memorandum.

The Rector read to the Board the following resolution, which had been received from Professor Judd W. Lewis, Jr.
