A committee appointed by you to investigate and report upon the pressures in the University water main met today with Mr. Bennet, City Manager, and Messrs. Williamson and Carroll, Engineers.

Pressure gauge connections had been made with the main at Dawson's Row and at the new pump house. At the pump house either filtered water from the new filtration plant or raw water from the reservoir may be turned into the main. Raw water from the reservoir comes to the pump house through the University main, which it is proposed to give to the city if a satisfactory supply of filtered water is assured.

Gauge readings were taken as follows:

* Showing an increase in pressure at this point with filtered water of 12 pounds per square inch.
* Showing an increase in pressure at this point with filtered water of 13 1/2 pounds per square inch.

The increase in pressure at Dawson's Row with filtered water is about 70% of the pressure with raw water.

The increase in volume of water is about 25% to 30% greater with filtered than with raw water.

Filtered water will be available at a height of about 28 to 30 feet greater than raw water.
