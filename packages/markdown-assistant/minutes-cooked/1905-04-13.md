A called meeting of the Board of Visitors was held at the University on the above date.

**Present**: The Rector, and Visitors Moore, Harmon, Hunton, Buchanan, Wallace, Downing, Glass, and White.

The Board was called to order by the Rector at 10:30 a.m.

The report of A. W. Wallace, Chairman of the Finance Committee, was read, and the following resolution adopted;-

**Resolved**: That the report of A. W. Wallace, chairman of the Finance Committee, in regard to the Austin Trust Fund, be accepted and spread on the record; and the Finance Committee are directed to communicate with the Trustees of the Fund, and the counsel for the Board of Visitors in Boston, with a view to the sale of the unsold part of the real estate belonging to the trust Estate, in case a satisfactory price can be secured for the same, with directions to report to the next meeting of the Board.

Report of the Finance Committee of the Board of Visitors of the University, or rather of the Chairman, A. W. Wallace, on the status and condition of the Austin Trust fund, in the hands of William Endicott, Jr., and Bentley W. Warren, Trustees, of Boston, Massachusetts.

The undersigned Chairman of the Finance Committee of the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia respectfully reports to the Board that at the request of the Rector of the University, he visited Boston, Massachusetts, on the 9th, 10th, and 11th days of October 1904, to investigate and report the condition and status of the trust estate under the will of Arthur W. Austin, dec'd, and the assignment of Mary A. Carroll to the University of Virginia dated July 15th, 1901.

The undersigned respectfully returns, as a part of this report, a list of the real estate held for the benefit of the University, under said Trust marked "A", and that the character and location of the several pieces of property is not desirable or liable in the near future to increase in value, said real estate not being an investment of the Trustees, but owned by the estate of Arthur W. Austin under the original trust and the net income from which for the year ending on the thirty-first day of March 1904, was only $1025.46, the assessed value of this estate being $26,420.

The undersigned respectfully reports further that on the 11th day of October 1904, the mortgages listed in Exhibit "B", as part of this report, evidenced by bond and mortgages were held by the Trustees amounting in the aggregate, as carried by the Trustees, to the face value of $48,200. Some of these mortgages are more than twenty years old; but the undersigned was informed by the Trustees that the interest was paid up to date, which prevented any bar of the Statute of Limitations under the law of Massachusetts. The properties, on which all these mortgages are held, are insured and policies duly assigned for the benefit of the Trustees, and while the mortgages are apparently secure, still they are not on the most desirable properties, being on what is known as "out-lying" dwellings on the suburbs of Boston.

The undersigned respectfully returns as part of his report Exhibit "C", herewith filed, showing the assessed values of each piece of real estate held by the Trustees and each piece on which mortgages are held; by which it will appear that the assessments are more than the mortgages, the undersigned reporting however that the assessments are full up to the market value of the properties.

The undersigned also returns on Exhibit "B" a list of all the stocks held by the Trustees carried at the cost value by the Trustees of $302,672.27, on the margin of said exhibit in lead pencil is marked the market value of each stock.

The undersigned reports that by the laws of Massachusetts a Trustee is not required to give bond with security unless required by the "Cestuy-que trust" and that if the University were to require a bond with security of Mr. Endicott he would probably surrender the trust, which in the judgment of the undersigned would be very unfortunate. Mr. Endicott is a member of the firm of Kidder, Peabody & Co., of Boston and is reported to be very wealthy, and in addition his father is estimated to be worth from three to four millions of dollars. The mass of this trust fund is in "Stocks" and his thorough familiarity with the stock market is a great assistance in the safe investment of the fund. By the decisions in Massachusetts, Trustees are allowed to invest in safe interest bearing stocks in which a prudent man would invest his own money. See C. J. Field in Dickinson's Appeal 152nd Massachusetts 184 and Brown vs. French 125th Massachusetts 410. Mr. Endicott has a reputation for the highest integrity.

Mr. Bentley W. Warren, the other Trustee, is a lawyer of reputation and standing in Boston, of the firm of Warren and Garfield, No. 60 State Street, Boston, Mr. Garfield being a son of the late President Garfield. Mr. Warren attends to the settlement of the accounts of the estate which is done annually in the Probate Court of Boston after notice to all parties in interest. The mortgages are in the name of both Trustees and are kept by Mr. Warren. The stocks are kept in the Boston Safe Deposit Co. and were exhibited to the undersigned by Mr. Endicott. Mr. Warren has given bond in the penalty of $50,000 with the Fidelity and Safe Deposit Company of Maryland, as his security.

The undersigned reports that in his judgment all of the stock investments are in first class "Stocks" except the Ogdensburg and Lake Champlain R. R. Co. for $250 which is worthless; for which investment the Trustees are in no way responsible as it came from the original Austin estate at the decease of the testator.

In conclusion the undersigned reports that the Trustees desired him to state to the Board that, at any time, they would be glad to have any suggestions as to the management of the estate which the Board might be pleased to make; and that he was much indebted for assistance to the firm of Messrs. Loring, Cooledge & Logan, who had been counsel for the University, in legal proceedings in Massachusetts, in connection with this trust fund.

All of which is respectfully reported.

### Supplemental report

Since formulating the above report, I have received the letter herewith filed marked Exhibit "G" informing me that the Trustee, Mr. Endicott, has given bond with two individual sureties, his father, Mr. W. C. Endicott, and Mr. Henry Endicott, "both well known citizens of ample financial responsibility."

(signed) A. W. Wallace, October 27, 1904.

### Exhibit "C"

Boston, Mass., October 10, 1904.

Hon. A. W. Wallace,\
14 Essex Hotel,\
Opposite South Terminal Station, Boston, Mass.

Dear Sir,

In regard to your inquiries of this morning, relative to the real estate owned by or mortgaged to the Austin Estate, I submit the following.

In regard to the Elizabeth C. Blackbird mortgage, 112 Highland ave., Somerville, I have written to the Assessors to get the value of the property.

Relative to the value of the East Middlesex and Winnisimmet St. Ry. Cos. stock, Mr. Warren is probably as qualified as any one to inform you of their value, and as he anticipates making an appointment with you, I think you could do no better than to get your information from him.

Yours very truly,\
(signed) Irvin McDowell Garfield.

P.S. The Trustees have been trying for some time to get the taxes on the Chelsea property reduced, and we are to have a hearing this week before the Assessors for that purpose, and anticipate that our efforts will be successful. If so this will reduce the taxes upon that property.

Yours, etc., J. McD. G. (signed.)

The Financial Report of the Proctor was then read, and after due consideration, the following preamble and resolution was adopted:

**Whereas**, it appears from the Report of the Proctor, that there will be a deficit in the current expenses for the year, for which it is necessary to make immediate provision, and

**Whereas**, a doubt has been raised as to the authority of this Board under the law, to borrow money for the purpose of meeting such deficit, It is agreed that the individual members of this Board will execute such contract as may be required to be spread upon the records of this Board, binding themselves jointly for the payment of such sum not exceeding $11,000.00, as may be required from time to time, to meet such deficit; on the credit of which, the Proctor, with the approval of the Executive Committee, is directed to borrow the funds to the limit above mentioned, necessary, to meet immediate requirements, and the Proctor is directed to repay the amounts borrowed, out of the current income of the University, as the same comes into his hands.

The following letter was presented to the Board by the President:

In response to your letter of the 10th inst. I am authorized by Mr. John D. Rockefeller to say that he will take pleasure in contributing one hundred thousand dollars toward the completion of the million dollar fund. Mr. Rockefeller would be gratified if it should conform to the policy of the Board of Visitors to make this $100,000 a memorial to his friend the late Hon. J. L. M. Curry. Perhaps it may be possible for you to found with this fund a school of Education to be called the Curry Memorial School of Education of the University of Virginia, in commemoration of Dr. Curry's great and distinguished services to popular education in the South.

**Whereupon the following was adopted:**

**Resolved**: This Board has received with satisfaction, the letter addressed to the President by Mr. F. T. Gates, communicating the fact of Mr. John D. Rockefeller's offer to contribute the sum of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00) to the Million Dollar fund now being raised by the Alumni; that this Board records its deep appreciation of the generous action of Mr. Rockefeller whose gift which is hereby accepted will materially assist in advancing the interests of the University; that the Board is in entire sympathy with the expressed wish of Mr. Rockefeller that his gift shall be used to establish a memorial to the late and distinguished Dr. J. L. M. Curry, and that no reason is now apparent to the Board why such memorial make not take the form of a school of Education, to bear Dr. Curry's name, and that the Rector be requested to acknowledge Mr. Gates' letter, and forward him a copy of this resolution.

**Whereas**, it has come to the knowledge of this Board, that it is the desire of Dr. Alderman, that upon his formal installation as President, some form of oath be taken by him; therefore be it resolved that the following oath be administered to President Alderman:

"I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully discharge and perform all the duties incumbent on me as President of the University of Virginia according to the best of my ability; so help me God."

On motion the Board adjourned.
