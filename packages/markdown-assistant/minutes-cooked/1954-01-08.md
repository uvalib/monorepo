The regular monthly meeting of the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia was held on this date in the Office of the President of the University, at Charlottesville, with the following present: The Rector, Barron F. Black, President Colgate W. Darden, Jr., Visitors Barksdale, Carrington, Coxe, Emmett, Gay, Gravatt, Mears, Mrs. Smith, Mr. Smith, Talbott, Wailes, and Wheeler. Absent: Visitor Howard and President Combs.

The minutes of the meeting of 11 December 1953, previously distributed, were approved.

The Rector spoke of his personal regret over the forthcoming retirement from the Board, subject to the present statute, of Mr. Richard A. Carrington, Jr., Mr. Thomas B. Gay, and Mrs. Bertha Wailes, and expressed the gratitude of the State for these three Visitors' self-sacrificing and devoted service to the University.

To provide for needed continuity in the work of the Board's committees, the Rector then announced the following appointments:

* Committee on Mary Washington College: Mr. Gravatt
* Committee on Buildings and Grounds: Mr. Barksdale

Upon the Rector's nomination, the Board made the following election:

* Executive Committee: Mr. Talbott

The President reported the following gifts and grants:

The Board adopted the following resolutions.

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that Dr. Philip Williams, Jr., be and he is hereby elected Associate Professor of English, effective at the beginning of the session of 1954-55, at a session salary of $5,400 (or at the second level of the proposed scale - $5,500 - if it is enacted.)

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that Dr. Edwin P. Lehman be and he is hereby elected Visiting Professor of Surgery, effective for the second semester of the 1953-54 session, at a salary of $1,000.

The following resolution was adopted by the Board:

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the Hospital Accounts Committee be and it is hereby authorized to charge off as uncollectible hospital accounts Schedules 409, 412, and 413, aggregating $19,540.47, recommended by them for cancellation.

President Darden presented to the Board a letter from Mr. and Mrs. William H. White, requesting that the Mary Stamps Suhling Cancer Fund be transferred to Charlottesville, and a memorandum from the Comptroller explaining the management of the Fund. The following resolution was thereupon adopted by the Board:

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the Comptroller of the University be and he is hereby authorized and directed to transfer all monies and securities of the Mary Stamps Suhling Cancer Fund from the State Planters Bank and Trust Company of Richmond to the Bursar to be administered by him as a special fund subject to the conditions of the original gift.

Upon recommendation of the President, the Board adopted the following resolution:

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that it is the sense of this Board that the roadway known as Lambeth Lane, lying between the Faculty Apartments and the residence of Mrs. Speed, should be dedicated to street purposes and transferred to the City of Charlottesville, that the Comptroller of the University be and he is hereby authorized and directed, in consultation with the University's Special Counsel, to execute a legal instrument in the name of the Rector and Visitors of the University granting to the City of Charlottesville an easement for a public street through Lambeth Lane.

The President laid before the Board the following proposed Schedule of Summer Session fees, submitted through the Comptroller by Dr. Lindley J. Stiles, Director of the Summer Session.

The Board thereupon resolved that the Schedule be adopted as submitted.

President Darden presented to the Board a letter from Albert H. Case, as follows:

"In order that you might better understand our present desire to perpetuate the memory of our son who attended the University of Virginia, I am making the following written request for the use of the funds donated under contract of May 12, 1950, which funds become available for use to the University of Virginia after the death of both Mrs. Case and myself.

We would like very much to have one-half of this fund designated for the Alderman Library, the income from which to be used for the purchase of books for the Alderman Library of the University of Virginia. The books purchased with this fund are to be selected in the area of the humanities, and more specifically, in the fields of ancient and modern languages, English and Philosophy. We wish that to each book purchased from this fund there be affixed a suitable book plate indicating that it derived from funds donated by Mr. and Mrs. Albert H. Case in the memory of their son, Albert Vaughan Case.

The other half of this fund we would be pleased to have used to establish scholarships in the Law School in memory of our son and to be designated as Albert Vaughan Case Scholarship. These scholarships are to be awarded annually from the income of this fund to students in the Law School who, in the judgment of the Faculty give promise of making outstanding contribution to the service of our country and its people. In making the appointments, the Faculty is directed to consider diligence and ability in professional studies and high moral character evidencing broad Christian idealism.

We would appreciate your advising us whether or not such designations can be made of the funds donated under the contract referred to above."

The Board adopted the following resolution:

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the funds donated to the University by Mr. and Mrs. Albert H. Case under contract dated May 12, 1950 shall be known as the Albert Vaughan Case Memorial Fund, that when the income from this Fund shall become available for use by the University after the death of both Mr. and Mrs, Case, such income shall (1) Be divided equally between the Alderman Library and the School of Law, and (2) Be expended for the purposes and in the manner set forth by Albert H. Case in his letter of November 25, 1953, addressed to President Colgate W. Darden and spread upon the minutes of this Board.

The President laid before the Board letters from Professor Thomas K. Fitz Patrick, Chairman of the Division of Architecture in the McIntire School of Fine Arts, and from Professor George O. Ferguson, Jr., Acting Dean of the College, as follows:

After carefully reviewing the history of the development of the teaching of Architecture at the University of Virginia, the following facts appear to be of special significance:

a. The original gift from Mr. Paul G. McIntire was to establish "A School of Fine Arts to comprise first a School of Art and Architecture and second a School of Music".

b. In 1919 A School of Art, Architecture, and Music was established and designated as the McIntire School of Fine Arts. Under the leadership of Professors Kimball, Hudnut, Kocher, and Campbell, a strong program in architectural teaching was developed as well as an introductory art program. Music remained under a separate leadership. From 1948 on greater attention was devoted to individual fields in Art under the guidance of Professor Charles Smith, and in 1951 Art was established as a separate division of the McIntire Department of Fine Arts.

The Division of Architecture currently enjoys a certain autonomy in fact which is not apparent in title, nor in catalogue description. It is urgently recommended that the identity of the architectural program be established by designating it The McIntire School of Architecture with a chairman or director, for the following reasons:

1. A Specific degree is granted by the Division, separate from the degree of the College of Arts and Sciences.

2. The admission of candidates to Architecture is processed by the Division of Architecture, separate from the College of Arts and Sciences.

3. The Bachelor of Science in Architecture is a professional degree under the requirement of a five-session program similar to the professional degrees in Engineering, Law, and Medicine. It is so recognized by the State Examining Boards operating under statute law in Virginia.

4. Establishing a School of Architecture would give the program in Architecture necessary and useful stature not only in this State but throughout the country.

In requesting the above there still exists a dominant conviction that the academic courses offered by the College of Arts and Sciences would continue to remain a strong element in the curriculum in Architecture. This can even be enlarged in scope so that a more complete development of the individual may be realized during his academic training.

It is earnestly hoped that sincere consideration will be given to this request. I enclose herewith a recommendation from Professor Fitz Patrick that the Division of Architecture of the McIntire Department of Fine Arts be changed in status in the University to the McIntire School of Architecture. I have discussed the matter with him and I heartily recommend that the change be made.

I also recommend that the status of Professor Fitz Patrick be changed from Chairman of the Division of Architecture to Chairman or Director of the School of Architecture. At the same time the Division of Art of the Department of Fine Arts should be changed to the McIntire Department of Art in the College of Arts and Sciences, with Professor Smith as its Chairman.

A number of considerations prompt me to make these recommendations, and I should be glad to discuss them with you if you wish.

I may mention here that for a considerable number of years the Division of Architecture has been nearly autonomous in its operation in so far as its admissions, degrees and academic discipline are concerned, although it has nominally functioned as a part of the College. Its work is so technical and specialized in nature that few academic officials understand it or are competent to deal with it intelligently.

A dozen years or more ago I predicted in an article on the College in the Alumni News that both commerce and architecture would eventually be set up as separate "Departments" of the University, as they were then called. Commerce has been so set up, and I do not believe we should wait longer in the case of architecture. Indeed, the pressure is doubtless greater for architecture than for commerce, in so far as accrediting agencies and state examining boards are concerned.

### Report of Committee on Award of Bayly-Tiffany Funds

In accordance with a request of the Rector dated September 12, 1953, the undersigned have met and considered the questions propounded by the University Committee on Scholarships, Loans and Employment with respect to the will of Mrs. Evelyn May Bayly Tiffany and the award of the funds given the University of Virginia under Paragraph Seventh thereof.

This Committee does not understand that any further legal study or opinion with respect to this will is desired or necessary but has proceeded upon the assumption that this Board has both the discretionary power and duty to determine the conditions upon which the award of these funds should be made.

We believe that the following paragraph concluding a letter of opinion upon this will, written in November 1930 by Mr. Allan W. Perkins, then Attorney for the Rector and Visitors, aptly defines our legal and moral obligation in this matter:

"Our duty in this whole matter is primarily to carry out Mrs. Tiffany's wishes, as we understand them, as fully and completely as is possible. She has given the University of Virginia a large sum of money and works of art, the value of which cannot be estimated. I have endeavored to call the attention of the Committee to as many phases of the situation presented by Mrs. Tiffany's will as seem to me to confront us, so that whatever conditions may arise in future we may have a record which will show that we have conscientiously endeavored by investigation and analysis to adopt a course which is in conformity with law, reasonable in all of its details, and which we believe will most nearly conform to what we conceive Mrs. Tiffany's wishes to have been."

This Committee believes that Mrs. Tiffany in making the bequest in Paragraph Seventh of her will was moved by a deep devotion to both the University of Virginia and to the Eastern Shore of Virginia and its people. We believe she intended and hoped that by means of Paragraph Seventh of her will as many young people as possible from the Eastern Shore of Virginia would be brought under the influence of the University and that thereby both would be benefited.

Having in mind our obligation to give effect to this intention of our benefactor, your Committee answers the inquiries propounded as follows:

**May any criteria other than residence requirements be attached to the award of Bayly-Tiffany Scholarships?**

Yes.

### I. Criteria for Applicants from Accomac and Northampton Counties

(a) **Need as a criteria**

As to awards to applicants from the Eastern Shore of Virginia, we are of the opinion that it is consistent with the purpose of the testatrix that need should be considered in making these awards.

This may be done either (1) by fixing the amount of the award according to the need in each case within fixed minimum and maximum limits, or if this procedure is not administratively practical, (2) by making need (according to fixed and uniform standards) a prerequisite condition for any award.

(b) **Scholastic attainment as a criteria**

Your Committee is of the opinion that if high scholastic attainment either before or after admission to the University were made a prerequisite condition for the award of these funds to persons from the Eastern Shore of Virginia, the purpose of the testatrix, with respect to bringing as many young people as possible from the Eastern Shore of Virginia to the University, would be greatly impaired. We therefore recommend that as to the Eastern Shore of Virginia these awards be made to students qualified for admission who maintain after admission the scholastic requirements necessary to remain in good standing in the University. In those cases where the Committee believes a student on probation is making a reasonable effort to overcome his difficulties, a grant may be made or continued.

### II. Criteria for Applicants from Other Parts of the State of Virginia and Maryland

(a) None of these funds should be awarded to applicants from other parts of Virginia or from Maryland if there is an applicant from Accomac or Northampton Counties meeting the qualifications set forth under No. I hereof.

(b) We do not believe that the intent and purpose of the Testatrix will be, in any wise, impaired by requiring that applicants from Maryland and other parts of Virginia meet, as a prerequisite condition for these awards, the usual requirements as to scholarship and need, applicable generally to the award of scholarships by the University.

**May Bayly-Tiffany scholarships be awarded to students entering or enrolled in the schools of Education, Engineering, and Business Administration?**

Your Committee, being of the opinion that it is consistent with the purpose of the Testatrix, recommends that these funds be awarded to applicants from the Eastern Shore of Virginia for admission to any schools and departments of the University (subject, of course, to the conditions heretofore set forth under No. I hereof).

It has been suggested in conference with the Scholarship Committee of the University that the standards recommended herein are not consistent with established standards for awards designated "Scholarships." It is, therefore, recommended that the Scholarship Committee of the University be authorized to designate awards from the Bayly-Tiffany fund as "grants in aid" or such other designation as the Committee may think appropriate.
