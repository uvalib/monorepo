The President reported that the University has been directed by the Governor to return to the State certain funds already appropriated, and to cut its expenditures.

The University will reduce expenditures in a variety of ways including not filling faculty and classified position vacancies, (except when the need is critical), reducing out-of-State travel, cutting back overtime, enlarging energy conservation methods, shortening the time certain buildings are open, and deferring maintenance and renovation of facilities.
