## UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA Weekly Class Report

At a meeting of the Visitors of the University of Virginia, held at the University on Tuesday, December 5th 1826, at which were present James Madison Rector, James Monroe, John H. Cocke, and Joseph C. Cabell.

The board being occupied in attending the first public examination at the University, which began on Monday the 4th of Decr, had private meetings only occasionally during the intervals between the hours of examination, and for conference merely. No other business was transacted until

Friday, Decr. 8th. When, during one of those intervals, the board having taken up the case of Robert Yeates—;—;the consideration of which was postponed at the meeting in Oct. last—;—;made thereon the following order.

The following will be communicated by the Secretary, in answer to the reference made to this board by the faculty, of the case of R. Yeates.

The faculty, on the suggestion of Mr Professor Long, having referred to the board of Visitors certain matters of complaint against mr Robert Yeates a student of the University—;—;the board have taken the said reference into their consideration, and would thereupon —;—;remark—;—;That they feel the duty a most painful one, of deciding in a controversy of so delicate a character as that which has been referred to them,—;—;but though that duty might be painful, they would not omit to discharge it, if it were absolutely necessary that it should be done to preserve the order and enforce the discipline of the —;—;institution—;—;They hope however, that no such necessity exists on the present occasion—;—;they cannot but believe that the subject of complaint alluded to, may have arisen in some mistake—;—;in some infirmity of memory—;—;and would greatly prefer that the whole merits of the question should be left to this charitable construction than that they should be examined and decided upon by a severer judgment. Without casting any imputation upon Mr Yeates, the Board would suggest to Mr Long that it would relieve them from a very painful duty, if he would consent that the enquiry which has been urged upon them should not be prosecuted—;—;and that the board have a strong wish, with the consent of the Faculty and Mr Long, to postpone indefinitely the consideration of the matters which have been referred to them.

Saturday, Decr. 9th. The board attended as heretofore, on the examination; with a short private meeting only, for conference.

Monday, Decr. 11th. In addition to the four members present on tuesday last, Mr Chapman Johnson this day joined the board. No other business than attendance on the examination was done, until

**The following resolutions, adopted on Tuesday, Decr. 12th, being omitted in their proper place, are here inserted.** Resolved, that in future, the assent of the board of Visitors or a committee thereof be essential to the appointment of the Hotel-keepers at the University: and in all such appointments, application in the first instance, shall be made heretofore, to the Proctor, who shall report the names of the applicants together with his opinion as to the preference to be given, and such information as he may possess, to the Board of Visitors, or to such committee of the board as may be appointed for the purpose. Resolved that the secretary do forthwith communicate the foregoing to the Proctor. Thursday, Decr. 14th: present James Madison Rector, James Monroe, John H. Cocke, Joseph C. Cabell and Chapman Johnson.

The following resolutions, adopted on Tuesday, Decr. 12th, being omitted in their proper place, are here inserted.

Resolved, that in future, the assent of the board of Visitors or a committee thereof be essential to the appointment of the Hotel-keepers at the University: and in all such appointments, application in the first instance, shall be made heretofore, to the Proctor, who shall report the names of the applicants together with his opinion as to the preference to be given, and such information as he may possess, to the Board of Visitors, or to such committee of the board as may be appointed for the purpose.

Resolved that the secretary do forthwith communicate the foregoing to the Proctor.

Resolved that enactment 24 does preclude the professors from such pursuits as that contemplated in one of the suggestions lately submitted to the board by the Professor of Medicine: but, in consideration of the peculiar condition of the Medical school, the special consent of the board is, for the present, granted to Dr Dunglison, to take private pupils from among the students.

Resolved that the offer of the professor of Medicine to sell some of his books to the University is accepted; and that he is authorised to transfer them to the library of the institution, at the English prices, to be adjusted between Dr Dunglison & the executive committee, and to be paid whenever the funds of the University will, in the opinion of the executive committee, justify it.

Resolved as follows: The faculty shall annually elect one of their body to be chairman, who shall receive for the services hereby required of him, five hundred dollars per annum, to be paid quarterly, out of the annuity of the University: Provided that they shall not, at any time, elect to the office of Chairman, any one who shall have served therein, for the year next preceding.

The Chairman shall be the chief executive officer of the University; and, as such, charged with superintending the execution of all laws made for its government—;—;A faithful and vigilant execution of this duty is solemnly enjoined upon, as indispensable to discipline & good police.

The proctor & all subordinate agents shall be subject to his control in the execution of their respective duties.

He shall convene the faculty whenever he thinks the interests of the institution require it, and whenever else it shall be requested by any two professors.

He shall preside at all the meetings of the faculty when present; and, having a vote as professor, he shall have a casting vote as chairman, when the votes of the professors pro and con are equal.

In his absence from the meetings of the faculty, a chairman pro tempore shall be appointed to preside. In his absence from the University, and in case of his disability from sickness or otherwise, the faculty may appoint a chairman pro tempore, charged with the performance of all his duties.

When the Chairman shall believe that a student has committed any offence which should be tried before the faculty, he shall have power to suspend such student; and, in case of emergency, forbid him access within the precincts, till a board can be convened for his trial: provided that no such suspension or restraint shall be for a longer time than two weeks, if a board can be convened within that time.

The chairman, when he shall deem any offence committed by a student deserving only a minor punishment or suspension and interdiction from the precincts not exceeding two weeks; may of his own authority, inflict such punishment, without convening the faculty, or consulting them in relation thereto.

Any student violating any lawful order of the chairman, or insubordinate to any lawful sentence pronounced by him, shall be deemed guilty of contumacy, and punished accordingly.

The board adjourned to tomorrow.

Friday, Decr. 15th. The board met: present J. Madison, Rector, J. Monroe, J. H. Cocke and J. C. Cabell.

A note was received from Mr Johnson, stating that some draughts of enactments which he had been charged with preparing, were not completed; and asking leave of absence until tomorrow. This leave was granted; and the board, after a long conference, adjourned to tomorrow.

Saturday, Decr. 16th. The board met: Present the same as yesterday, with the addition of Mr Johnson.

Resolved that the Proctor do pay the accounts against the University contracted by the secretary to the board of Visitors, amounting to seven dollars & seventy five cents.

Resolved that the precincts of the University are to be regarded as coextensive with the lands owned by the University, being one entire tract consisting of several parcels, whereon the buildings are erected.

Resolved that Students heretofore at the University, who have provided themselves with any furniture for their dormitories, hereafter returning and desiring to use such furniture, rather than depend on the hotel-keeper for a supply, shall be allowed a reasonable deduction from their board on that account, to be ascertained by the proctor, subject to the control of the faculty.

Resolved that the enactment respecting the establishment of a court, passed in October of this year, be amended in that clause which provides for grand-juries, by inserting after the word "years", the following: "and all hotel keepers of the University."

Resolved that the resolution respecting the sessions of the University, passed in October last, shall be amended by striking out from the word "fourth" in the second line, to the word "fourth" in the third line, both words inclusive; and inserting the following in lieu thereof "twentieth of July, and all future sessions shall commence on the first of September in each year, and terminate on the twentieth."

Resolved that There shall be two public examinations of all the students, in each session—;—;The one to precede the winter recess, and the other to precede the summer vacation. The former to commence on such day as the professors shall appoint, & the latter to commence on the tenth of July.

From these examinations no student shall absent himself without leave of the faculty, under pain of any punishment not exceeding dismission from the University.
