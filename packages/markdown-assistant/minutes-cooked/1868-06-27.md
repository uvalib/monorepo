"The Committee on Grounds & Buildings ask leave to make the following report.

House E of the Dawson buildings requires new floors in the upper story and the outside steps of nearly all those houses require repairs-

A wooden structure near Massie's Hotel used as a wood house and for other purposes should be removed without delay-and put up at the expense of the University at some other place.

All the roofs of the Rotunda Buildings are said to be in a leaky condition-

The Balustrades on either side of the Portico of the Rotunda require repairs.

The roofs of the Professors Houses, the Hotels and dormitories are said to nearly all leak more or less.

The Gutters are generally in bad condition. The Water tanks in the Rotunda are exerting an injurious influence on the building and should be no longer used for such purposes.

The walls of the new building attached to the Rotunda seem to be giving away and should be looked after.

## The Board met at 9 oclock A.M. Present the same members as on yesterday.

Resolved That with the exception of Dawson's Row and such large rooms on Carr's Hill as the Chairman may direct, it shall be allowed to any student to occupy a Dormitory alone by paying the full rent and if it shall be found that this change works serious injury to the Hotel Keepers the Executive Committee shall have power to make such rateable deduction from the rent as to them may seem reasonable.

Resolved That in receiving the report of Drs. Cabell and Davis, the Board of Visitors decline to take any further action except to declare their entire dissent from the conclusion that the Infirmary fund should not be charged with the cost of repairs and improvements- believing on the contrary that such charge is perfectly legitimate and should be adhered to.
