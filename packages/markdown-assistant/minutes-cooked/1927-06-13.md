The annual meeting of the Rector and Visitors was held on this date at 10 o'clock A. M., lasting until 6 P. M., with intermission for lunch, followed by a session on the morning of the 14th which convened at 10 o'clock.

There were present Visitors Buchanan, Hall, Hart, Hull, McIntire, Mrs. Munford, Rinehart and Williams, and President Alderman. In the absence of the Rector, Mr. Hart was appointed Rector pro tempore for the morning session, and Mr. Rinehart for the afternoon and morning session of the 14th, as Mr. Hart was unable to remain.

The minutes of the meeting of April 22, which had been copied and sent to the members for examination, were approved.

The President presented his docket for the meeting with the following items:

Total enrollment for the session 1926-27, 2173 students.

An appropriation by the General Education Board of $156,000, for the purposes and under the conditions as set out in the following preamble and resolution, was, on motion, duly made and seconded, unanimously adopted:

WHEREAS, The President of the University of Virginia and the Dean of the Medical School of the University, in letters dated April 5, 6, and 14, 1927, outline a plan for the development of the departments of medicine, surgery, and hygiene, involving an increased expenditure of Thirty-eight thousand Dollars ($38,000), per annum, and

WHEREAS, it is suggested that the General Education Board appropriated biennially on a diminishing scale, for the purpose herein indicated, sums aggregating One Hundred Fifty-Six Thousand Dollars ($156,000), tentatively apportioned as follows:

it being the expectation that the University authorities will provide on a biennially increasing scale sums which, together with the Board's grants, will total Thirty-eight thousand Dollars ($38,000) per annum:

THEREFORE, BE IT

RESOLVED, That the executive officers of the General Education Board be, and they hereby are, authorized in their discretion to commit the Board to an appropriation to the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia, of a sum not to exceed One hundred fifty-six thousand Dollars ($156,000) for the development of the departments of medicine, surgery, and hygiene, in general conformity with the plan outlined in correspondence with the University authorities, said sum to be available over a period of approximately six years, the date when the appropriation shall commence and the sum to be made available annually to be determined by the executive officers of the Board after consultation with the authorities of the University, the appropriation to be charged to current income.

The following gifts were announced, and the President was requested to prepare suitable resolutions of thanks in each case:

From the Cadillac Motor Company to the Engineering Department, for instruction in Automobile Engineering, a cutaway demonstration chassis which the Company built for exhibition purposes at a cost of $11,000.

To the Institute of Public Affairs, as follows:

From the Law Class of 1902 a portrait of the late Raleigh C. Minor, Professor of Law in the University, done by Prince Troubetzkoy.

From Mr. John Powell recent published score of "In Old Virginia" with his original manuscript.

Receipt of the John Alexander Muir bequest, total appraised value of which amounts to $64,263.68.

I beg to report that the John Alexander Muir bequest has been received and delivered to the State-Planters Bank & Trust Company, of Richmond, Va., in accordance with resolution adopted at the meeting of the Board April 22, and that formal contract for the care of same, similar to those now in existence with the Virginia Trust Company and the Peoples National Bank, has been executed. The estate was forwarded by the First National Bank of Alexandria, Va., Trustees, to their representative in Richmond, being delivered to the depository upon official receipt for same.

The estate consists of:

The bonds have a market value of approximately $43,435.00 bringing the value of the estate up to approximately $66,000.00. Mr. Scott has been advised of its receipt with list of cash and securities. As there is no provision for special disposition of the watch and chain I take it that it sill be proper to dispose of same and add the proceeds to the estate.

The following motion, duly made and seconded, was adopted:

RESOLVED, That the Rector and Visitors accept from Dr. P. B. Barringer, W. M. Lile, and E. I. Carruthers, Trustees, the gift of a fund now in their possession amounting to approximately $9,000.00 which, when it shall have reached the sum of $10,000.00 by the accretion of income to be added to the present principal fund, shall become a permanent endowment fund, the income therefrom to be used as a transportation fund to bring pedagogically valuable material to the medical students of the University from the city, county of Albemarle, and contiguous counties within Virginia; but any income not used for the aforesaid purpose within the fiscal year shall be turned over to the hospital for the care of patients in the charity wards and Outside Patients Department.

The said fund is to be known as the "Dr. P. B. Barringer Fund."

The President announced the resignation of Asst. Prof. Joseph R. Branham, in the school of Chemistry, which was accepted in the following resolution:

RESOLVED, That the Rector and Visitors of the University accept the resignation of Dr. Joseph R. Branham, Assistant Professor of Chemistry Dr. Branham has carried forward his work with ability and energy at this University, and the Rector and Visitors wish him continued success in his new field.

The President presented the following for admission to the faculty, as set forth in the several resolutions, being unanimously adopted:

RESOLVED, by the Rector and Visitors, That the President of the University, in consultation with the Dean and Committee appointed by the President from the staff of the Department of Medicine be empowered during the summer to make such adjustments and employ such professors within budgetary limits as may be necessary to provide properly for the services in Surgery, Internal Medicine, and Public Health.

Tate Irvine and Supt. J. J. Kelly, Jr., President Virginia Education Association, who submitted the following resolutions of the said association:

RESOLVED: 1- That this Association do donate and pay to the University of Virginia $40,000.00 for the purpose of providing and maintaining a Preventorium or hospital service and attention required by the members of said association from time to time, and to that end the said University shall set apart and use, so far as may be necessary or desirable, for that purpose the whole of a floor of the south wing of the new hospital building in essential conformity with the plans submitted by Coolidge, Shepley, Bulfinch and Abbott, the same to be known as the Ennion G. Williams Preventorium.

2. That space for twenty patients with the necessary bath and service room facilities shall be provided and shall, in all respects, be in keeping with the present hospital; and that the University shall maintain and control the said rooms as a Preventorium, or teachers pavilion, in exactly the same manner as it maintains the regular University hospital.

It is understood that if it be found that $40,000.00 will not be sufficient for the purposes named, further negotiations will be entered into by the parties concerned before construction shall be begun. And if $40,000.00 should be more than the amount required for said purposes the excess shall be used so far as necessary to furnish the said Preventorium, after which any unexpended balance shall revert to the Virginia Education Association.

3. That the professional services which shall be rendered shall include such examinations and treatment as is provided at the regular University hospital and shall also include any additional service or treatment of any kind or nature which may hereafter be established and maintained as a part of the hospital facilities of the University. Such services shall include all examinations, diagnoses, laboratory tests, X-ray examinations, prescriptions, operations, board, of any kind or nature which may be rendered as a part of the regular University Hospital.

4. That the professional services offered and rendered to the patients assigned pursuant hereto shall be made by the regular physicians and surgeons who ordinarily perform such services or operations in the regular University hospital and are given to pay patients.

A charge of $4.00 per day shall be made for each teacher entering hereunder for each day confined in said hospital or suing the Preventorium. A minimum for any teacher shall be $15.00 even if the charge of $4.00 per day shall not be equal to that sum. Should, at any time after one year expiration, the cost of service to occupants of the Preventorium be more or less on the average than $4.00 per day, then the University shall fix the per diem charges so as to conform with such costs.

5. That this Association and the teachers entering the Preventorium or pavilion, in pursuance hereof, shall be under no expense for any equipment, repairs, maintenance, janitor's service or any expense of any kind in connection with the operation of such Preventorium, or pavilion. No patient shall be admitted by the University to the facilities provided for under these resolutions except through the approval and certification for admission by this Association acting through its executive committee, or other proper committee regularly assigned for that purpose. It is understood, however, that no certification for admission shall be given except to member of the Virginia Education Association.

All occupants of the proposed Preventorium shall be subject to the same rules and regulations that apply to regular patients of the University of Virginia Hospital. The Hospital reserve the right to decide upon the medical suitability of applicants for admission and the proper time of discharge of patients from the Preventorium. If any rooms so set apart as a Preventorium are not needed for any purposes of the Association, then the University may for such time use them for general hospital purposes.

6. The terms and conditions set out by these resolutions shall continue in force for one year and thereafter from year to year unless changed by the University and this Association acting by its regularly constituted authorities.

Virginia Education Association By J. J. Kelly, Jr., President William R. Smithey, Chairman of Preventorium Committee.

Following a general discussion of the matter, the question was disposed of in the following motion, duly made and seconded, being unanimously adopted:

This Board has received from the Virginia Education Association a proposal to donate to the University $40,000.00 upon condition that the University of Virginia shall provide and maintain a Preventorium for the sue of the members of the Association and to that end the said University shall set apart and use, so far as may be necessary or desirable for that purpose, the whole of a floor of the south wing of the new hospital building as it is now designed. And since it is understood that this building is to be used particularly for the prevention of those diseases causing disability and invalidism, in accepting this money the Rector and Visitors feel that they are aligning the University with the general policy of the State to promote the health and well being of its citizens through the fostering of preventive medicine and hygiene.

The Virginia Education Association has furnished this Board with a copy of the Resolutions passed by the said Association, numbering from one to six, both inclusive, which sets forth the terms and conditions upon which the said sum of $40,000.00 is donated, after consideration of which by this Board it is,

RESOLVED: 1- That this Board accepts the offer of the $40,000.00 tendered to it by the said Virginia Education Association upon the terms and conditions specified and set out in said resolutions.

It is understood that if it be found that $40,000.00 will not be sufficient for the purposes named, further negotiations will be entered into by the parties concerned before construction shall be begun. And if $40,000.00 should be more than the amount required for said purposes the excess shall be used so far as necessary to furnish the said Preventorium, after which any unexpended balance shall revert to the Virginia Education Association.

2. That this Board hereby sets apart all the rooms and space on a floor of the south wing of one of the proposed additional hospital buildings to accommodate a maximum of twenty patients, and will maintain and manage that part of the said proposed additional hospital buildings so designated in exactly the same manner as the general University hospital, of which the said facilities will be a part.

3. The professional services to be rendered hereunder shall include all examinations, operations, diagnosis, laboratory tests, X-ray examinations, prescriptions and medical treatment of any kind and nature that may be offered as a part of the regular hospital facilities and shall be made by the regular physicians and surgeons who ordinarily perform such surgical operations and render other services in the regular University hospital.

4. The charge per day per patient shall be $4.00 with a minimum charge of $15.00 to any patient. Such charge shall include all operation, medical attention, X-Ray examinations, prescriptions and bandages connected with the examination and treatment of such patient, and also board, room service, ordinary nursing attention, and all and any other service rendered as a part of the regular University hospital, but the said charge per day per patient shall be subject to be changed from time to time in accordance with resolution No. 4 adopted by the said Association, a copy of which resolutions is to be recorded in the minute book of this Board along with these resolutions.

5. All and each part of the said resolutions numbering from one to six, both inclusive, of the said Virginia Education Association are hereby agreed to and adopted by this Board as fully and effectively as if set out at length in these resolutions.

The President stated that it was proposed to remove the Geological Survey and Forestry Service from the University to Richmond. Following a general discussion of the question, the following motion, duly made and seconded, was unanimously adopted:

RESOLVED, That the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia desire to record their judgment that the best interests of the Commonwealth will be served by the retention of the State Forest Service and the State Geological Survey at the University of Virginia. These are scientific bureaus engaged in the discovery, collection and dissemination of information of the highest scientific importance, as well as of commercial value, and as such, these bureaus should be properly connected with the leading educational establishment maintained by the State. These State Services have been connected with the University of Virginia since their establishment, and the scientific character of their publications has received national recognition.

On motion, a committee consisting of the President, Senator Buchanan and Mr. Williams was appointed to interview the Governor in the matters referred to in the foregoing resolution and also to appear before the Commission having the said matters in charge.

Mr. Rinehart, Chairman of the Buildings and Grounds Committee, stated that the question of the quantity of water to be furnished to the University by the City, under an existing contract, has been raised by the Superintendent of Buildings and Grounds, which should be adjusted to the satisfaction of the parties at interest. The matter was referred to the Buildings and Grounds Committee for investigation and report.

The question of the disposition of the houses formerly occupied by Prof. Charles A. Graves, retiring from the Faculty, and Mr. Chas. H. H. Thomas, Asst. Bursar, deceased was referred to the Buildings and Grounds Committee and the President with power to act.

The President announced that the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching had accepted Prof. Charles A. Graves, of the Law Department, and Mr. John S. Patton, Librarian, for retirement, with an annual grant of $2,650 to Prof. Graves, and $2,100 to Mr. Patton.

The President presented the following letter from the Governor approving the schedule of salary increases as made in the annual budget, adopted at the April 22nd meeting:

The schedule of proposed salary increases for certain members of the teaching staff and other employees of the University of Virginia for the session 1927-28, as approved by the Rector and Visitors of the University on April 22nd, 1927, has been received.

Under the standard salary scale heretofore agreed to governing rates of pay of the teaching staff at the University of Virginia, the maximum allowance for a full time professor at this institution is $4,500, for an associate professor is $3,500, for assistant professor is $2,500, and for instructor is $1,800.

The salary increases recommended by the Rector and Board of Visitors for the ensuing year are approved in so far as such increases do not exceed the maximum allowances set forth above.

You have submitted to me a copy of your letter to the Rector and Visitors, under date of April 22nd, in which you report having received certain securities and monies to be held by the University under will of Arthur W. Austin, deceased.

You also submitted to me a copy of Resolution and preamble thereto, under which the Rector and Visitors direct the sum of $5000.00 to be paid to the Executors of Mrs. Mary C. McLaughlin, the daughter of said Arthur W. Austin, in consideration of the facts set out fully in the preamble to said resolution.

You have advised me that the Board of Visitors, being in doubt as to their authority to direct the payment of this sum, have requested that I give an opinion as to such right on their part.

You have also turned over to me a copy of the will of Arthur W. Austin and a copy of a contract, dated July 15th, 1901, between Mr. Austin's said daughter, who was then Mrs. Mary Austin Carroll, and the Rector and Visitors of the University, which is the contract referred to in the first paragraph of the preamble to the aforesaid Resolution. I have carefully examined all of the papers above referred to, and my conclusions are as follows:

First. Although the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia is a Corporation, and as such is expressly given, by special statute, all rights and powers which may be exercised by Corporations generally, I have always been of the opinion that it was never the intention of our Legislature to vest in the Rector and Visitors of the University the right to divest itself of title to any property, real or personal, held by it.

Second. This is certainly true as to the real property of the University. It is equally true as to all monies appropriated to the uses of the University by the State. It is also true as to my funds of property which the University has received by way of gift or devise. Such property must be held by the Rector and Visitors upon the trust or trusts expressed in the instrument creating the Estate, and under no conditions can such property be diverted from the uses to which it has been dedicated.

Third. The situation which you have now presented to me, however, differs materially in my opinion from the instances cited above.

In the first place, Mr. Austin's will does not attach any conditions or limitations to his bequest, except that he gives his daughter a life estate in all the property. Upon her death it passed to the University in fee, with no trusts of any sort imposed upon it. When his daughter surrendered to the University all of her interest in said life estate, with the exception of an annuity to her of $5000.00 a year, there were no conditions of any sort imposed.

I understand that all of the income of said Estate has been budgeted for the period of 1926-28, with the exception of the annuity of $5000.00 which would have been paid to Mrs. McLaughlin had she lived through the year 1927. We are, therefore, in position of having the sum of $5000.00 from this Estate available for the purpose of complying in part with the dying request of Mrs. McLaughlin.

It is, of course, possible that the argument may be advanced that every dollar of money given to the University becomes at once impressed with a trust for educational purposes. It is of course unusual for money to come into our hands without conditions of some kind being attached to the gift, but when a gift without conditions of any kind is made, and this is the exact condition we are here dealing with, I am positive that The Rector and Visitors have full and ample authority to use it in any way they may deem right and proper.

I am therefore of opinion that the Board would in no way exceed its authority should it direct the payment of the $5000.00 in question, to be made to Timothy J. McLaughlin, husband of said Mary A. McLaughlin.

I am further of opinion that the Board will not exceed its authority should it appropriate the sum of $500.00 for the purpose of erecting a suitable marker over Mrs. McLaughlin's grave.

I think the resolution you have prepared is proper in all respects and may be passed by said Board without fear that its authority is being exceeded in any way.
