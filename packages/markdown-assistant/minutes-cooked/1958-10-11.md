**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the Committee on Student Accounts be and it is hereby authorized to charge off as uncollectible accounts Schedules 14 and 15, aggregating $11,725.99, as recommended by it.

Dr. Martin, on behalf of the Medical Committee, submitted to the Visitors copies of a report entitled "General Analysis of Reports of the Accounts Committee, University of Virginia Hospital, Calendar Year 1957." The Report contained an analysis of the policy followed in charging off uncollectible hospital accounts. A copy of the Report was ordered to be placed in the files of the Board.

The following resolution was adopted by the Board:

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the Hospital Accounts Committee be and it is hereby authorized to charge off as uncollectible accounts Schedules 778, 781, 782, 785, 788 and 789, aggregating $68,763.10, as recommended by it.

The Rector reported briefly on the work of the Committee on Nomination of President. More than 150 names had been suggested to the Committee and these names had been screened by the special faculty committee appointed by the University Senate. Three meetings of the Committee have been held since June and the number of names being given serious consideration has been reduced to 20. Discreet inquiries concerning these 20 people are being made in order to supplement the written material available to the Committee. The Rector emphasized that the Committee was not yet close to a decision but that it might have something to report by the time of the December meeting.

The President reported on the case of Mr. F. E. Kirby, Visiting Assistant Professor of Music, who had requested that the University make the regular contribution matching his personal contribution. When the Board of Visitors set up the TIAA program in 1936, faculty members with temporary appointments were exempted from coverage. Mr. Kirby's case is the first one where a person has come to the University on a temporary appointment, and is already a member of TIAA, but is not a permanent member of the faculty of another institution. Since the University contributes to the TIAA program of temporary faculty members who are permanent members of the faculties of other institutions with TIAA programs, the President believed that Mr. Kirby's request should be granted.

The Board adopted the following resolution:

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the University make the regular contribution to the TIAA program of Mr. F. E. Kirby, Visiting Assistant Professor of Music, for the year 1958-59 with the understanding that no precedent is to be established.

The President reported on a study being made of the possibility of increasing tuition charges for the purpose of financing increased faculty salaries. He observed that the Virginia Advisory Legislative Council was also making a State-wide study of the possibilities of making tuition charges cover a larger portion of the costs of maintenance and operation of institutions of higher learning. During the discussion, it was pointed out that the University's current tuition charges are second highest among the state universities for out-of-State students and sixth highest for in-State students. It was also brought out that a possible alternative to a salary increase was made available in a recent Federal act which permitted institutions to provide a supplement up to 20 percent of an individual's salary in the form of retirement annuities which are nontaxable at the time of payment. The President concluded the discussion with the statement that he might be prepared to come to the December meeting of the Board with a specific proposal.

The President reported on the space released in the YMCA Building as a result of the move of the various student offices to Newcomb Hall. He proposed that he be authorized to enter into negotiations with the YMCA Board for the purpose of arranging a long-term lease for use of the building by the Division of Extension and General Studies now housed in Cabell Hall in space shortly to be needed by the College of Arts and Sciences. The cost of renovation was estimated to be approximately $100,000.

After a discussion of both the possibility of purchase of the property and the arrangement of a long-term lease, the Board adopted the following resolution:

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the President be and he is hereby authorized to enter into negotiations with the YMCA Board as to the costs involved of either a long-term lease or purchase of the YMCA property and, further, that the President be authorized to take final action on the matter with the approval of the Executive Committee.

The President reported to the Board that certain property owned by the University in Naples, Florida, could be sold with considerable profit to the University. After some discussion, the Board adopted the following resolution:

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the President be and he is hereby authorized to sell the property owned by the University in Naples, Florida, with the approval of the Executive Committee.

The President reported that the Governor in a letter dated October 1, 1958, had turned down the University's request for authority to proceed with the construction of an addition to the Law School, seven dormitories, and apartments for married students. The Governor's view was that these projects were of such magnitude that they should be submitted to the General Assembly for approval.

The proposed Law School addition, a second floor over the library, was designed to provide additional space. In the event that this addition could not be made, the only other usable space available would be in the JAG Building, the lease of which expires next year. The President was especially loath, however, to face the prospect of losing the JAG School which is a valuable asset to the Law School and which would be quickly welcomed by other law schools in the country. The President expressed his intention of approaching the Governor again. The Board encouraged the President to pursue the matter further.

Mr. Fenwick, as Chairman of the Athletics Committee, laid before the Board copies of "Intercollegiate Athletics Report of Receipts and Disbursements for the Period July 1, 1957 to June 30, 1958." Summarizing the contents of the Report, Mr. Fenwick invited inspection by the Visitors and requested the Secretary to submit the Report in triplicate to the Director of the Budget and to hold one copy in the files of the Board.

President Darden called to the attention of the Board certain option agreements contained in a deed from Annie E. Purkey and C. M. Purkey, her husband, dated July 25, 1957, recorded July 31, 1957 in the Clerk's Office of the Circuit Court of Wise County, Virginia, in D. B. 338 p. 367, under which the Rector and Visitors had acquired title to a tract of 33.96 acres needed in the development of Clinch Valley College, which option agreements provided as follows:

"It is understood and agreed that the second parties contemplate the construction of a road through the property hereby conveyed leading to the Clinch Valley College of the University of Virginia. Within sixty days after this proposed road has been located on the ground by survey and a map of same presented to the first parties, or either of them, the said first parties, or either of them, shall have the option to elect to keep their dwelling house, located on the said land hereby conveyed, and in which they now reside, together with the lot on which said dwelling house is located which said lot shall face on the Old Hurricane Road 100 feet and run back from the Old Hurricane Road between parallel lines at right angles to the said Old Hurricane Road a distance of 150 feet. Should the first parties so elect to retain said dwelling house then the second parties agree to reconvey said dwelling house and lot for a consideration of Five Thousand ($5,000.00) Dollars, which amount shall be credited upon the deferred purchase money notes above described Should the first parties, or either of them, elect not to take said dwelling house and lot, or fail to make election within said sixty day period, then the title of the second parties to said dwelling house and lot shall become absolute, and the option shall be at an end."

It was pointed out that when the entrance road into Clinch Valley College was located through the Purkey tract there remained a small triangular lot lying between the dwelling house lot covered by the option and the entrance road which lot was useless to the College and which should in reality be included with the dwelling house lot, that, subject to the approval of the Board, it had been agreed to so include it at the price of $150.00, and that Annie E. Purkey having died, C. M. Purkey, individually, had elected to exercise the option granted him under the deed of July 25, 1957, and desired a deed.

The President then submitted to the Board for its consideration a draft of the deed conveying the dwelling house lot containing 0.42 acres, more or less, to C. M. Purkey, which draft had been prepared by C. Venable Minor, Special Counsel for The Rector and Visitors.

The Board was reminded that the conveyance must receive the approval of the Governor, and it was pointed out that the deed as drafted provided for the signature of the Governor thereto as evidence of his approval of the conveyance.

After discussion, upon motion duly made and seconded, it was

**RESOLVED** by The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, that the reconveyance to C. M. Purkey of the tract of 0.42 acres, more or less, being a portion of a tract of 33.96 acres situated in Gladeville Magisterial District of Wise County, Virginia, acquired by deed from Annie E. and C. M. Purkey, dated July 25, 1957, recorded July 31, 1957, in the Clerk's Office of the Circuit Court of Wise County, Virginia, in D. B. 338 p. 367, upon the terms and conditions hereinabove outlined in the minutes of this meeting, be, and the same is hereby sanctioned and approved, and that the President and Secretary be, and they hereby are, authorized, empowered and directed, the approval of the Governor of the State of Virginia, as required by Section 23-77.1 of the Code of Virginia, 1950, as amended, having first been obtained thereto, to execute, on behalf of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, a deed, substantially in the form of the draft submitted to this meeting, conveying with Special Warranty of Title, to C. M. Purkey, said tract of 0.42 acres, more or less, and that the President be, and he is hereby, authorized, empowered and directed to deliver said deed to said C. M. Purkey or his authorized representative.

The Rector called attention to the Governor's letter of June 18, 1958, in which the Governor requested that the Board's selection of the Sunset Hills site for the Northern Virginia Branch College be reconsidered. Mr. Fenwick reported on the offer of a site by the Town of Fairfax. This site consists of 150 acres adjacent to the corporate limits of the Town of Fairfax now owned by the Farr family.

Considerable discussion ensued in which the question was raised as to the propriety of admitting the Farr site to the list of suitable locations for the branch college without reopening the question and giving other possible donors an opportunity to be heard. The President suggested the desirability of obtaining a site close enough to the center of population to permit a single facility to serve the needs of both the branch college for day instruction and the extension courses which are offered in the evening. Attention was also directed to the fact that the offer by the Bowmans of the Sunset Hills site would expire on October 15, 1958.

After a lengthy discussion, the Board adopted the following resolution:

**WHEREAS**, the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia has previously approved the following properties as suitable sites for a Branch College in Northern Virginia:

1. Childs
2. Brenizer
3. Bowman

**AND WHEREAS**, His Excellency the Governor of Virginia, under date of June 18, 1958, addressed a communication to Honorable Colgate W. Darden, Jr., President, University of Virginia, suggesting that the Board of Visitors of the University take another look at and reevaluate the situation relating to the Northern Branch College of the University of Virginia in the light of such matters and things as may have transpired since the Board's action relative to the Bowman site; and

**AND WHEREAS**, the Town of Fairfax has secured options on 150 acres of land near the Town of Fairfax, owned by the Farr family, which is located on Route 125 immediately adjoining the southern boundary of the Town, and has offered the same free of any cost to the University of Virginia as a site for a Branch College; and

**AND WHEREAS**, such a site is deemed by the Site Committee of the Board to be in every way suitable for the establishment of a Northern Virginia Branch College:

**NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED**, by the Board of Visitors that the so-called "Farr Site" be added to the list of properties approved as suitable for the Northern Virginia Branch College, and that the Site Committee be continued to consider any other site that might be offered.

The Secretary was instructed to write a letter to the Messrs. Bowman informing them that the Board for reasons beyond its control could not take final action on their offer of the Sunset Hills site before October 15, 1958.

The Board adopted the following resolution:

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the following persons be and they are hereby elected to the faculty of Mary Washington College:

Mr. Joseph Aposhyan as Assistant Professor of Psychology for the session 1958-59, at a salary of $5,000.

Miss Anna Mae Harris as Assistant Professor of Mathematics for the session 1958-59, at a salary of $5,200. (Second step approved by Personnel Office)

Mr. Charles Alfred Sletten, as Assistant Professor in Sociology for the session 1958-59, at a salary of $5,000.

Mrs. Lydia (Boyce) Fauls as Instructor in Psychology (one-half time) for the session 1958-59, at a salary of $2,200.

The Board adopted the following resolution:

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the resignation of Mr. Jack Bruce Thomas as Instructor in Sociology, effective September 1, 1958, be and it is hereby accepted.

We wish for him the highest success in his new undertaking.

The Chancellor reported that the College indebtedness to the State Treasury had been paid in full. The note in the original amount of $1,356,515.57, dated 1 December 1954 with interest at 1 percent, had been reduced by 30 June 1958 to $639,259.49 through payments from the operating funds of the College. Since 30 June, the debt to the State has been completely retired through the following payments.

This appropriation is in lieu of College surplus reverted to the general fund of the State at June 30, 1956.

The Chancellor expressed the hope that the debt to the National Bank of Fredericksburg could be paid in the Spring of 1959.

The members of the Board expressed their jubilation over the achievement of a debt-free status by the College.

The Chancellor reported that during the Spring of 1958, because of leaks in the water lines in Betty Lewis Dormitory and Virginia Hall, certain students' personal property was damaged. These students entered claims for the extent of the damage through the Director of Dormitories totaling approximately $450.00.

The Bursar, apprehensive as to the extent of the College's authority to make any settlement of these claims, wrote to the Attorney General on June 11 for his opinion. He replied to the effect that we could not make settlement since we had no specific appropriation of this nature. Because the claims are all of a relatively minor amount, he suggested an alternative procedure for making settlement. His letter is shown as follows:

"This is in reply to your letter of June 11, 1958, in which you state that in the past college year there was a water pipe break in some of the dormitories of the College which resulted in water damage to luggage and clothing belonging to students. You state that you have been presented with claims from the students suffering these damages in the amount of $275.00. You ask my advice as to whether or not these claims should be paid.

As you know, the Commonwealth of Virginia and its institutions and agencies are not subject to suit for tort claims, however, if damage is caused to some innocent person as a result of negligence of the Commonwealth of Virginia or one of its institutions, then there is a certain moral responsibility to compensate this innocent person for the damage. The only way that this ordinarily can be done is through the enactment of a relief bill by the General Assembly of Virginia, as there is no appropriation to my knowledge to any State institution from which they may pay tort claims.

The amount of the claims in this instance is so minor that I question the advisability of a relief bill for this purpose. There is a practice in some institutions where a person suffers minor damages as the result of negligence on the part of the institution to adjust the claims for the damage by giving the person affected credit on tuition charges or room rent or laundry charges, or some other such charges. This might be desirable in the case which you present if there was negligence on the part of Mary Washington College."

After a discussion, the following resolution was adopted by the Board:

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that Mary Washington College be and it is hereby authorized to refund or credit that portion of the College general fees to the students whose personal property was damaged in an amount not to exceed the estimate of the damage, subject to the approval of the Special Counsel of the University and the Attorney General.

The Chancellor reported that in August 1958, the Virginia Electric and Power Company requested a right-of-way on the Brompton property in order to supply current to a swimming pool sponsored by residents in the community. The swimming pool is located on the Spratt property which joins Brompton property in the vicinity of the property deeded to the City of Fredericksburg for the construction of an armory.

The location of the right-of-way is from the vicinity of the armory constructed by the City, running west to the sixty foot easement granted by W. C. Spratt, thence south on the west side of the W. C. Spratt easement to an intersection with the property owned by W. C. Spratt.

After a discussion, the following resolution was adopted by the Board:

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that Mary Washington College be and is hereby authorized to grant an easement to the Virginia Electric and Power Company for the erection of power service lines in accordance with the plat identified as Number M-6115, revised, by EJW, from a point in the vicinity of the present armory building east, to the west side of an easement granted by W. C. Spratt, and running south along this easement to the intersection of the property owned by W. C. Spratt, and it is agreed by the power company that this electric service will be relocated at the expense of the power company at any time, to a mutually agreed location, within sixty days after receipt of written notice to do so from the College.

The Chancellor reported another request by the Virginia Electric and Power Company that they be granted a right-of-way on the Brompton property, located on the west side of U.S. Highway Number 1. Their letter is shown as follows:

"The Virginia Electric and Power Company has been requested to provide electric service to the individual property owners of Westmont Subdivision, located in the southwest section of the City of Fredericksburg. In order to provide the electric facilities it is desirable, for the protection and safe operation of the line, to secure guying and tree clearing rights along the west edge of the University of Virginia's property adjoining Beverly Drive, in Westmont Subdivision. A plat of this area showing the desired right-of-way privileges is attached for further identification.

Inasmuch as there will not be any poles or extension of line conductors placed upon or over the University's property, written authority will suffice for our needs in lieu of an easement grant.

Should you desire any further information, please feel free to contact us."

(Signed by Wadsworth Bugg, Jr., District Superintendent)

The area in the vicinity of the College property west of U.S. Highway No. 1 is being developed. In order for this area to obtain electric service, it is necessary that the Virginia Electric and Power Company be permitted to cross College property.

After discussion, the Board adopted the following resolution:

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that Mary Washington College be and is hereby authorized to grant an easement to the Virginia Electric and Power Company in accordance with the plat dated September 30, 1958, initialed WJC, from a point at the intersection of Greenway Drive. It is agreed by the power company that this electric service will be relocated at the expense of the power company at any time it is mutually agreed, within sixty days after receipt of written notice from the College.

On motion the meeting was then adjourned.
