Resolved that Thomas Towles, who is under 16 years of age, be permitted to enter the University and attend the academic schools, on the same terms as students who are over 16 years; that he shall not be required for next session to pay any fees in the academic department. This is done out of our appreciation for the valuable services of his father, the late Dr. W. B. Towles who died while a professor of this University.

At this time, shortly after noon, Mr. H. H. Downing arrived and joined in the deliberations of the Board.

21. Resolved that, Dr. Barringer having withdrawn his resignation of the Chairmanship, there be paid him as his compensation for the ensuing year the sum of $500.00 in addition to the regular salary provided by section 104 of the laws in consideration of the extent and importance of the work that unusual conditions will impose on the Chairman in the near future; this arrangement to be regarded as temporary and not as permanently increasing the salary fixed by said section.

22. Resolved that Professors John Staige Davis and Raleigh C. Minor shall each hereafter receive the salary and have the use of a residence or the commutation in lieu thereof attached to a full professorship by sections 82 & 83 of the Laws,- and that Professor J.

26. Resolved that the action of the Miller Board in the appropriation of Three Hundred Dollars for an additional scholarship for the ensuing year, in accordance with the resolution of the Faculty which this Board has approved and the nomination of Mr. Peyton H. Bragg to fill said scholarship, be and the same is hereby approved by this Board.

27. The report of H. H. Downing and others, Committee appointed at the last November meeting to consider the propriety of permitting the Charlottesville City & Suburban Street Railway Co. to enter the grounds of the University, filed their report adverse to such privilege being granted, which report was adopted and ordered to be filed.

28. Your Committee appointed at the November, 1900, meeting of the Board to consider the application of the Charlottesville City and Suburban Street Railway Co. for permission to enter the University grounds, begs leave to report that, since your Committee was appointed, considerable opposition has developed to the application of the said Street Railway Co., both by the Faculty and the student body of the University, and your Committee deems it inexpedient to allow said Street Railway Co. any other or further rights in the grounds of the University than those now enjoyed.

29. In response to your request for a statement of my views regarding the essentials of agricultural education, I would respectfully submit the following:

Agriculture, as I understand it, is primarily the art of cultivating the soil with a view to profit: in its usual sense it includes the successful raising and marketing of crops alike of plants and of animals, or of their products.

Its theory is based upon the sciences of Chemistry, Botany, and Zoology, and its intelligent practice involves the application of their facts and principles, and those of other allied but less definitely fundamental sciences, such as Geology, Physics, and Mechanics. Agricultural education demands, therefore, at the outset, instruction in these fundamental sciences in their relation to the art in question, and subsequently the discussion of its principles and processes as based upon them.

Instruction in these fundamental sciences in their relation to agriculture might properly include in the case of Chemistry not only the leading facts and laws of the science but also its methods and its technique, as applied alike to analysis and to synthesis: the chemical (and associated physical) structure of soils the composition of vegetable and animal substances and the chemical processes involved in the lives of plants and animals: the composition and intelligent compounding of fertilizers in relation to various crops of plants, and of foodstuffs in their relation to stock-feeding: the composition and characteristics of vegetable and animal products in relation to their preservation and storage: and other subjects of a kindred nature.

In the case of Botany such instruction might properly include the discussion of the structure of the various types of plants, and their systematic classification as based thereon: the principles of vegetable physiology in general, and in particular the laws of nutrition, growth, and multiplication, special attention being given on one hand to the higher groups from which the leading crop-plants are derived, and to the lower groups which compose the greater number of forms injurious to the plants and animals in which the agriculturist is interested; in connection with the former might be pursued the study of the origin, history and modes of production of cultivated varieties, and with the latter the study of the diseases and parasites of crop-plants which form in a number of cases the most serious obstacle to crop-raising, as well as the relation of the organisms in question to the infectious diseases of live-stock with other allied topics. In the case of Zoology such instruction would include a similar consideration of the fundamental facts and laws of animal life, the structure and classification of animals, and the study of their vital processes, especially of the anatomy and physiology of the highest types of animals, which includes nearly all the species involved in stock-farming: the habits and life-histories of insects, particularly those that are either injurious or beneficial: the nature and treatment of external and internal animal parasites: and the like.

A discussion of the general theory or principles of Agriculture based upon such fundamental knowledge of the most important sciences as is indicated above may properly include the consideration of soils as regards their composition, situation, and exposure: the methods of reclaiming waste lands: the principles of drainage; tillage and the management of crops in such a manner as to obtain profitable returns without diminution of fertility the choice and rotation of crops; the principles of husbandry, as applied to the storage and care of crop-products and food supplies: the housing and care of stock the hygiene of the farm, and the best methods of protection against the insect pests and fungous or bacterial plagues to which staple crops are subject: the specific care and culture of particular crops the methods and value of intensive farming the conduct and significance of agricultural experimentation: and many other similar subjects.

This discussion may perhaps be summarized as follows:

**Agricultural Education involves the study of**

A. The sciences upon which the art of crop-raising is directly based, namely

* Chemistry, including
  * General Chemistry as a science;
  * Chemistry as related to agriculture.

* Botany, including
  * Botany as a science;
  * Botany as related to agriculture.

* Zoology, including
  * Zoology as a science;
  * Zoology as related to agriculture.

B. The Principles of Agriculture as based upon these sciences, and the rationale and economics of the various processes involved.
