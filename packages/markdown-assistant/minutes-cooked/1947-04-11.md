Concerning a petition for an extension of time for completion of the Physics Experimental Laboratory, the following resolution was adopted:

"WHEREAS, as a result of our inspection of the Experimental Laboratory NOrd (f) 1436 on December 15, 1946, it was found that the contract was substantially completed, and the installation of laboratory equipment was begun at that time; and,

WHEREAS, as a result of an inspection of the Experimental Laboratory on March 29, 1947, it was found that the building was completed except for the installation of certain minor items of hardware and electrical material; and,

WHEREAS, the contractor estimated that, due to uncertain weather conditions, grading of the grounds and construction of outside roads and walks would take until April 30, 1947, to complete, therefore,

**BE IT RESOLVED**, that, subject to the approval of the Navy, the contractor's time for completion be extended to April 30, 1947.

An application from the Alpha Epsilon Pi Fraternity for a lot on Carr Hill was presented, which application was disapproved by the Board. The Board did not concur in a blanket resolution denying Fraternities to build on University property. They insisted, however, that each application for a lot, when submitted hereafter to the Board, should carry the request for a specified lot.

Mr. Thomas B. Gay, Chairman of the Committee for selection of a successor to Mr. Newcomb, as President, presented a written report and the motion was duly made to spread this report in full on the minutes of the Board meeting of March 31st. The matter of its publication was discussed at considerable length and a motion was duly adopted that if Mr. Gay could get the permission of persons quoted in the body of his report, a copy should be given to the Alumni News for publication in their next issue.

It was arranged for the May 9th meeting of the Board of Visitors to be held at Mary Washington College, Fredericksburg, Virginia.

The following Committee, who is requested to report back to the Board within sixty days' time, is appointed by the Rector, Edward R. Stettinius:

* Mr. Thomas B. Gay, Chairman;
* Mr. Barron F. Black;
* Mrs. Bertha P. Wailes

Mrs. Bertha Wailes, Chairman of the Committee on Mary Washington, presented the following matters for consideration. Action was taken on several items as shown:

The Committee on Mary Washington recommends to the Board that Dean Alvey's request for leave this summer from June 30 to August 23 be granted. He is to teach a graduate course in education at the University of Virginia Summer School. The Mary Washington summer school session will have been started when he takes up his duties at the University, and he plans to spend one day weekly in his office at Mary Washington during this period. President Newcomb reports that after consultation, the leave for Dean Alvey was granted.

The city of Fredericksburg asked permission to erect radio antenna on the water tank located on Mary Washington grounds. The Committee recommends that this be granted, provided that the college shall be relieved of responsibility or liability for any accident resulting from the use of the tower by the city, and that the city shall make such installations as will protect the tower from lightning, and shall give the college written assurance that the necessary examination as to adequate protection has been made by competent authority. Approved.

With authorization from the Board, the Committee in turn authorized President Combs to ask Governor Tuck to approve the expense of installing wainscoting in the downstairs rooms of Brompton as originally planned (estimate **$6,000**). Approved.

President Combs brought up the matter of three professors who have reached retirement age but who wish to continue teaching. (Professors Faulkner, Haensel, and Tanner). The Committee approved the recommendation of President Combs for their reappointment if at the beginning of the session their physical condition permits carrying the load assigned them. Approved.

The question of investing the gift of **$7,000** received from Mrs. DuPont was discussed, the indenture having been made to the Rector and Board of Visitors of the University. The Committee recommends to the Board that it ask the Finance Committee to invest the above amount in DuPont stock, if possible, and that any Mary Washington funds be kept in separate trust accounts. This matter was referred to the Finance Committee.

The meeting then adjourned.
