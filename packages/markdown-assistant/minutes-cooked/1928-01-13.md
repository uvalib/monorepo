RESOLVED, by the Rector and Visitors, that a leave of absence, with salary, be granted Dr. James C.

### Special Appropriations:

An appropriation for the library for the following purposes:

Upon the recommendation of the Building Committee the appointment of an architect for the proposed dormitories was deferred until the April meeting of the Board.

The Buildings and Grounds Committee reported that several fraternities had filed applications for building sites on the grounds of the University, but, in view of the necessity of securing a suitable location for the proposed dormitories, it was deemed expedient to defer making allocations to them at this time and also to withdraw those previously made until further action, whereupon the following motion, duly made and seconded, was adopted:

RESOLVED, That the applications for fraternity house sites be deferred until a survey for dormitories can be made, and that those sites heretofore granted be withdrawn until the dormitory sites are selected.

The following motion, duly made and seconded, was adopted:

RESOLVED, That it is the sense of this Board that when an architect is selected for the dormitories, a landscape architect be associated with him for the purpose of presenting to the Board a plan for future location of dormitories and fraternity houses.

On motion, duly made and seconded, the following resolution creating the office of Business manager was adopted:

RESOLVED, That the position of Business Manager of the University be and is hereby created. The President is instructed to bring to the attention of the Rector and Visitors the name or names of suitable persons for this position, with recommendation of such salary as may be required for this post. This Business Manager shall have general charge of all business affairs of the University, subject to the authority of the Rector and Visitors and of the President. It is desired that this office shall become operative beginning with the session of 1928-29.

The Hopkins Society of the Sigma Nu Fraternity made application for a loan of $21,000 on its chapter house now being erected on Carr's Hill. The loan was granted in the following motion, duly made and seconded, being adopted:

RESOLVED, That the Rector and Visitors approve the application of the Hopkins Society of the Sigma Nu Fraternity for a loan on its chapter house, now in course of construction on Carr's Hill, not to exceed $21,000, and in no case over 50% of the cost of the house, and the Finance Committee is requested to make said loan from funds available from the endowment funds, on terms and conditions agreeable to said Committee.

The General Athletic Association made application for a site on the property of the University located on Towles Road on which to erect a football stadium, and the following action was taken thereon, the motion being duly made and seconded, was adopted:

The Board heartily approves of the proposed football stadium to be located on the grounds of the University, but the exact location and plans cannot be approved by this Board without reference to the proposed Committee on sites for dormitories and fraternity houses.

On motion the meeting then adjourned.
