Board of Visitors' minutes, Accession # RG-1/1/, Special Collections Dept., University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Va.

Minutes of meetings of the university's governing body which is the legal owner and operator of the institution. Recorded in the minutes are appointments and other personnel decisions concerning faculty, decisions about construction of facilities, gifts to the university, and all other board actions, decisions and resolutions.

A special meeting of the Board of Visitors of the University having been called by the Rector, in consequence of the death of Professor Edward H. Courtnay the following members attended viz Andrew Stevenson, Wm J. Robertson, and Harrison B. Tomlin, who not constitating a quorum they deemed it proper to wait another day, in the hope and expectation that a quorum of the Board might be able to attend, and accordingly they adjourned over to meet again tomorrow morning at 10 oclock.-

### January 6th 1854

The same members were present on today as on yesterday with the addition of Mr McDonald and not constituting a quorum they did not feel themselves authorized to take any definite action, in relation to the appointment of a Professor to the Chair of Mathematics, made vacant by the death of the late lamented Prof. Edward H. Courtney.

They however find a state of things existing in the University, which seemed to them to require and justify their prompt and immediate action upon the subject of the vacancy, as individual members of the Board of Visitors-

After a full and free communication with the Faculty, they derived the following information;- That, at the time of Mr Courtney's death, he had just accomplished a work of great labor in the preparation of his printed sheets, embracing his full and entire course of Mathematics, for the whole of the session; and that since his death, these sheets had been placed at the disposal of the Faculty. That under the authority given him, he had employed Mr Alexr L. Nelson as an assistant instructor who has discharged the duties assigned him in the School of Mathematics in a diligent and satisfactory manner,-

It was also stated to the undersigned by several members of the Faculty, that, Mr Courtney, had repeatedly expressed to them his entire satisfaction with Mr Nelson, as an Assistant Instructor, had spoken in high commendation of his ability and qualification as a Mathematician and Teacher, and had intended recommending him for the Chair of Mathematics in Washington College.

It was also stated as the unanimous opinion of the Faculty that Mr Nelson (with the aid of Mr Dinwiddie now in the University) was fully qualified and competent to complete the Mathematical course during the present session, and was perhaps better qualified, than any individual who could be obtained out of the University, for carrying out the plan and design of instruction and lectures introduced by Mr Courtney and indicated in the sheets before referred to-

That Mr Nelson and Mr Dinwiddie were willing to act, and that the Faculty were unanimous that this course should be adopted-

The subscribers therefore, deeming it the best course now attainable & essentially necessary to the best interests of the University, recommend (as individual members of the Board of Visitors) to the Faculty to carry out their recommendation by continuing the services of Mr Nelson, & engaging those of Mr Dinwiddie of the School of Mathematics & to do so upon the terms indicated by them in their resolutions submitted to us this day.
