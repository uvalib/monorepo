Wm. Wertenbaker Secretary

B. Johnson Barbour Rector of U. of Va.

The Board met pursuant to adjournment. Present the same members as on yesterday.

The Committee appointed yesterday to confer with the Trustees of the Miller Fund and report a plan of organization of a School of Experimental & Practical Agriculture- submitted the following report.

### Plan for Organizing the Agricultural Department of the University of Virginia.

Whereas some two years since the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia with an eye mainly to the advancement of the cause of Agriculture and of the practical arts congenial thereto, established the Schools of Applied Chemistry & Mathematics for the purposes and objects more fully set forth in the Advertisement of these Schools as set forth in the Catalogue and whereas since the Donation of Samuel Miller for the teaching and promoting of the Science of Agriculture at the University, it has become important that these Schools should be enlarged and devoted more strictly to such ends and purposes as will bring them fairly & legitimately within the scope and purposes of the Donator- Therefore be it Resolved

1. That the Schools of Analytical & Agricultural Chemistry and of Applied Mathematics so far as it is connected with and congenial with Agriculture- together with a prospective Professorship of Natural History, and such additional professorships as the advance and elaboration of the plan may require shall hereafter be known and regarded as the Agricultural Department of the University of Virginia.

2. That all due expedition shall be used in establishing and rendering practical and useful the Experimental Farm projected at the last meeting of the Board- and that this farm in general shall be under the control of the Agricultural Department of the University for the testing of manures, the exhibition of various systems of culture and crops and for every class of experiment which may seem to be desirable for the advancement of the cause of Agriculture.

3. That in view of the successful inauguration of the proposed system by the present Professors, Messrs. Mallett & Boeck that they be respectfully but cordially recommended to the favourable consideration of the Trustees of the Miller Fund.

4. That if the aforesaid Trustees determine to turn over the accrued or accruing interest to the University, the Board of Visitors will endeavour in every way to vindicate the confidence thus manifested- and to that end will instruct their Proctor to open a separate and special Account with the monies thus received wherein every item of expenditure shall be fully and clearly set forth- and that the Trustees shall be invited at each Annual Meeting of the Board to meet in conference for the examination of this account with the vouchers belonging thereto and for consultation on the plans & purposes of the Agricultural Department.

5. That whilst the Board does not deem it proper to bind itself closely to the plan set forth in the report of the Faculty- yet they should here express their general concurrence in its recommendations- promising to make such modifications alterations or additions as time & experience may dictate.

6. That the Board of Visitors in soliciting immediate aid from the Trustees, and in asking a large discretion in the distribution of the funds turned over, would respectfully call attention to the fact as set forth in the above mentioned Report that the University has already expended a large amount in providing a magnificent Laboratory and in equipping two schools without which the objects of Mr. Miller's Trust could not have been possibly carried out, and which could not have been provided directly from the annual income of the Fund itself except by its total absorption for several years to come.

In view of all these facts- and especially that the University presents a broad basis for the establishment of this Agricultural School- alike in its buildings, its rich & valuable specimens, its admirable equipment and provision for experiments, its competent Professors and its well established and high reputation throughout the Country- together with the pledge on the part of the Board of Visitors in all things and at all times, strictly, persistently and conscientiously to carry out the full purpose of the Donator in its truest and best spirit —; the Trustees of the Miller Fund are earnestly requested to put the Board of Visitors in possession of such funds as will enable it to carry out promptly and satisfactorily the great purposes contemplated in this combined movement.

All of which is respectfully submitted

A motion to adopt the foregoing report was carried in the affirmative by the following vote.

The following proceedings of the Board of Trustees of the Miller Fund was laid before the Board.

"Resolved that the Trustees of the Miller Fund, leaving to the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia- the organization of a `School of Agriculture' to which alone the Trustees can appropriate their income according to the terms of Mr. Miller's Deed, would state for the information of the Visitors that the state of the fund is such as to allow them to pledge to this School when organized according to the design of said deed the sum of $3000 for instruction in the School of `Experimental & Practical Agriculture' for the ensuing session- But the Trustees reserve to themselves the right to withhold the Miller Fund from this School when such School is established, if they under the circumstances then existing should consider it as their duty under the provisions of the Deed, so to do

Trustees Miller Fund

At a meeting of the Trustees of the "Miller Fund" held at the University of Virginia on the 16th & 17th days of Sept 1869 the following proceedings were had.

1. Resolved- (see preceding page)

2. That the Board of Trustees of the "Miller Fund" are not satisfied that they have the power to appropriate their income to the payment of interest on an antecedent debt though contracted for the purposes of this School, but are yet willing that a sum not exceeding the sum of $1000 be used for the rent of the Laboratory for the present year, provided this shall not be considered as a precedent for the future.

That the Deed of Samuel Miller giving to J. F. Slaughter, T. J. Randolph, W. J. Robertson, B. W. Ficklin, W. W. Minor, Alex. Rives & V. W. Southall and their successors in office certain funds in trust to be applied to a School of "Experimental & Practical Agriculture" at the University of Virginia, imposes on those Trustees the duty of preserving those funds, and to that end, to retain them under their control and to appropriate annually the net income for that purpose, or so much thereof as may be necessary.

That it is the duty of the Trustees to see that these funds are in accordance with the spirit and intent of the donor applied exclusively to the School indicated and that the appropriations should be annual and an account should be required annually from the Authorities of the University of Virginia detailing specifically the expenditure of the fund, in order that the Trustees may determine whether the expenditure has been in accordance with the true intent and meaning of the Deed.

That to the authorities of the University of Virginia belong exclusively the organization and entire control of said School, with the exception of the right and duty of the Trustees to nominate the Professors to be employed in said school.

That the Trustees meet annually the Board of Visitors at the University of Va. to receive the account required and to determine the propriety of renewing the appropriation.

Resolved, that the Treasurer pay over to the proper Officer of the University $1500 of the income now in hand, and that he shall also pay over to the same Officer, all the income which may accrue prior to the 1st of July 1870.

The Trustees of the "Miller Fund" unanimously nominated Prof. J. W. Mallet to fill the Chair of Applied Chemistry in the School of Agriculture and Prof. L. J. Boeck to fill the Chair of Applied Mathematics so far as the same may be connected with the School of Agriculture.

Resolved, that in the opinion of the Trustees it would be equitable and proper for the Board of Visitors to charge the income of the "Miller Fund" with one half of a reasonable rent for dwellings for the two Professors now appointed and that they may in like manner charge said fund with a reasonable rent for any buildings erected on the grounds of the University for the use of the Superintendent & hands employed upon the "Experimental Farm".

Resolved that the foregoing resolutions be communicated by the Secretary to the Board of Visitors of the University of Va.

A copy Test.

R. T. W. Duke Secretary to the Board of Trustees

Ordered That that portion of land belonging to the University lying West of the Professors' gardens adjoining the lands of Jesse L. Maury be set apart and used for Experimental Agriculture farm under the direction of the Professors in the Department of Agriculture if the said location and additional land be desirable in the opinion of the Executive Committee.

The nominations by the Board of Trustees of the "Miller Fund" of J. W. Mallet Professor of Analytical & Agricultural Chemistry and of L. J. Boeck Professor of Applied Mathematics, as Professors in the "Agricultural Department" of the University of Virginia were unanimously approved & confirmed by the Board.

Resolved that in receiving money from the "Miller Fund" it shall be done by a draft from the Proctor payable either to his own order, or to the order of the Bank used as a depository for the University funds, countersigned in all cases by the Rector.

Resolved that the Proctor be instructed to open a separate account with the "Agricultural Fund" and that all monies received on account thereof be kept separate & distinct, and that none of these funds shall be used except under special order from the Board of Visitors or of the Rector and the Executive Committee acting under instructions therefrom.

Resolved that the Executive Committee is hereby authorized to consult the interests of the University, and the Agricultural Department now organized and in the absence of the Board to do & perform whatever may be necessary to put in successful operation said Department.

The Committee appointed yesterday on the subject of the Infirmary submitted the following Report.

### Report of the Special Committee on the Infirmary to the Board of Visitors.

Your Committee have not the data on which to base a full report of the history of the Infirmary and the condition of its finances- time has not sufficed since yesterday to obtain them.

They find that the University owes to the fund of the Infirmary, for loans made from that source anterior to the war, the sum of $1625.90. They find that of the surplus existing previously to the war, the sum of $\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ was invested by the Health Officers in a bond of the state of Virginia of $ in amount-

They find that the salaries which have been paid by the fund of the Infirmary for two years past have been in detail and aggregate, as follows

They believe that other incidental expenses will average each year at least $40 making the amount of the expense of the institution not less than $2500. This scale of expense pursued for two years past has exceeded the income of the Infirmary. This income is derived from a tax of $5 each from the students of the University, and from the board of the students transferred while patients, to the Infirmary-This income during the last Academic year seems to have been $2095, and that may be assumed to have been an average year as to the amount of income- In the academic year \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, the income of the Infirmary proper seems to have been only $1692.93.

It will thus be seen that the income of the two years has fallen short of the receipts by a considerable amount. To meet the deficiency, the Health Officers of the University have sold the state bond which they held, realizing therefrom principal and interest, the sum of $823.14. The Report of these affairs at the close of the Session 1868-69 represents a balance in hand of $142.30.

The deficiency in the income of the Infirmary, compared with expenses, seems to have arisen from the fact that a third Physician, at a salary of $500, has been added to those previously ministering at the Infirmary- which additions, for two years past, has cost the account of the Infirmary $1000.

Your Committee upon examining the records and minutes of the Visitors touching the Infirmary are clearly of opinion that the original intention was, and the constant intention has been, to make the Infirmary a self-sustaining Institution.

During the prosperous years just preceding the war, the receipts were unusually large, in so much that the University seems to have borrowed from this source $1625.90 and the Health Officers were authorized to invest the further sum of $\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ in a state bond, but the years succeeding the war have not been so prosperous. The Infirmary has exceeded its income so far, that nothing is left of the fund accumulated, except the sum of $1625.90 borrowed by the University before the war. Your Committee see nothing in the records of the Visitors to justify the inference that repairs to the Infirmary building were not to be included in those expenses of the Infirmary which were intended to be defrayed from its regular income.

Unless there be a considerable increase in the number of students during the approaching session, the Infirmary fee of $5 will not suffice to pay the current expenses of that institution.

If the fee be increased to $7.50, the authorization should be accompanied by a reiteration of the intention of the Visitors that the Infirmary shall be self-sustaining in respect to all expenses including repairs to the building.

Your Committee recommend the repeal of the order of the Board of Visitors adopted on the 3rd of December 1867 by which unlimited control over the Infirmary fund was transferred by the Board from itself to Drs. Cabell, Davis and Harrison, your Committee being of opinion that the Board of Visitors have no right to delegate its trusts to any other body or set of individuals even though as worthy of their entire confidence as the gentlemen named.

Your Committee further recommend that the Infirmary fee to be charged after the expiration of the forthcoming session of 1869-70 be fixed at $7.50 this being about the currency equivalent of $5 in specie. All of which is respectfully submitted.

R. W. Hughes

Th. L. Preston

W. E. M. Word

Ordered That the fee to be charged each student after the Session of 1869-70 on account of the Infirmary be fixed at $7.50; and it is the intention of the Board that the Infirmary shall be self-sustaining, including repairs to the building.

Ordered that the resolution of the Board of Visitors of 3rd December 1867 giving control of the Infirmary fund to Drs. Cabell, Davis and Harrison, is hereby rescinded and repealed.

On motion the foregoing Report and Resolutions were adopted.

Resolved that nurses and servants be employed and supplies furnished the Infirmary by the Board of Health as heretofore.

Resolved that the present financial condition of the Infirmary requires a spirit of sacrifice on the part of all who feel an interest in the Institution; and that the Proctor, out of the fees collected therefor, for the approaching academic session, after paying all the expenses incident thereto, divide the surplus, not exceeding five hundred dollars to each, among the three attending Physicians- and that the Proctor also keep and make to this Board a separate account and report of all receipts, disbursements and transactions of the Infirmary.

The Board then adjourned to meet again tomorrow morning at 10 O'Clock.

Wm. Wertenbaker Secretary

B. Johnson Barbour Rector of U. of Virginia

The Board met pursuant to adjournment. Present Th. L. Preston, W. E. M. Word, John R. Woods, Thomas J. Pretlow and Samuel Watts.

On motion Col Preston was requested to take the Chair.

Resolved that the Proctor, under the advice of the Executive Committee put such repairs on the House, recently occupied by Professor Peters as may be necessary, not exceeding three hundred dollars.

Absent Messrs Pretlow & Watts- B. Johnson Barbour Rector & R. W. Hughes appeared and took their seats.

Ordered that the House recently occupied by Professor Peters and which he has vacated, be assigned to Professor Harrison.

Resolved that the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia having made a full inspection of the Laboratory and its equipment desire promptly to express their hearty thanks to Robert Mallet Esq of London for the alacrity and zeal he has exhibited in the collection of Technological Specimens-a collection which they fully believe is unsurpassed by any other in general excellence, whilst in particulars it is unequalled- And they are persuaded that this superiority is due mainly to the scientific knowledge which guided and the disinterested sympathy which animated Mr. Mallet in making it.

The Secretary is instructed to forward a copy of this Resolution to Mr. Mallet.

Resolved That Professor Mallet and Boeck shall receive $1000 each as heretofore from the sum of $2000 furnished by the Faculty- and that Prof. Boeck shall receive $300 from the "Miller Fund" in lieu of the commutation fee from the University.

Resolved That the Executive Committee be instructed to take all necessary steps towards the proper changes & modification in the lecture Room of the Professor of Applied Mathematics.

Resolved That in view of the unprecedented Drought with which the country has been afflicted, and the consequent scarcity and advanced prices of all kinds of provision, the Board of Visitors are constrained to believe that justice demands an increase in the charge for Board at the University—; Insomuch, however, as the rates have been announced in advance, good faith would seem to require that it should be left optional with the students after a full statement of facts to decide for themselves whether they will pay the present rate of $20 per month or what we consider a more equitable price of $22.25.

Resolved—;as the opinion of the Board, that students entering any of the classes in both Departments of the School of Law, shall be regarded as entering two schools—;and if they enter another school, the fee in the additional school shall be $25 instead of $30 as heretofore.

The Board then on motion adjourned sine die.
