### UNIVERSITY POLICY ON CAMPAIGNING FOR AND SERVING IN AN ELECTED PUBLIC OFFICE

#### POLICY ON CAMPAIGNING FOR AND SERVING IN AN ELECTED PUBLIC OFFICE

##### FACULTY

##### CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES

Members of the faculty are in no way precluded by their relationship with the University from normal political activities but while they are in full-time status, it is understood that the activities related to their academic appointments will have first claim on their time and energy. It should at all times be made clear that political positions assumed by members of the faculty are personal, and do not necessarily, or even inferentially, reflect any position taken by the University of Virginia.

Members of the faculty may from time to time be invited to perform public service in an appointive capacity, at the national state, or local level. The University encourages them to render this type of service, believing that it is in its own interest that they should do so. It shall be the responsibility of the individual's Dean and of the Provost to determine whether the performance of this service will make sufficient demands on his time and energy to require a modification of his duty status, and, if some form of leave of absence is indicated, to determine whether any portion of this leave should be with pay. Leave will ordinarily be taken if the individual's outside activities may reasonably be expected to require either more of his time than would customarily be allowed for consulting activity or protracted absences from Charlottesville.

The Attorney General ruled in 1971 that faculty members do not hold office under the government of the Commonwealth.

The Constitution of Virginia, however, in Article IV, section 4, sets a standard: No person holding a salaried office under the government of the Commonwealth, and no judge of any court, attorney for the Commonwealth, sheriff, treasurer, assessor of taxes, commissioner of the revenue, collector of taxes, or clerk of any court shall be a member of either house of the General Assembly during his continuance in office; and his qualification as a member shall vacate any such office held by him. which may be useful as a guide for faculty and staff in considering the level of permissible participation in public affairs. The current provision of the Constitution is carried over from the earlier constitutional provision and was the subject of serious and informed consideration by the Commission on Constitutional Revision, which consisted of distinguished public officials and educators. The problems of interpretation are manifold; interested persons are referred to pages 128-130 of the summary of the deliberations of the Commission on Constitutional Revision, and to pages 479-485 of Mr. A. E. Dick Howard's treatise on the 1971 Constitution of Virginia. Still, the constitutional rule amplified by these discussions represents the best available statement of the principles which should guide both the administration and the faculty and staff members in determining, in individual cases, the proper level of participation in public affairs.

Faculty members who choose to become candidates for elective public office on the state or national level will be expected to take leave of absence without pay for the period of their campaigns, in both primary and general elections. If elected, they will be expected to take leave of absence without pay for any semester during which the performance of their duties will require them to be absent from Charlottesville for substantial periods. If the duties or activities associated with his office can be performed in Charlottesville, but may reasonably be expected to require more of his time than is customarily allowed for consulting Activities, a faculty member must assume part-time status at the University, at a level to be determined by his Dean and the Provost of the University.

In contrast with candidacy for state and national offices, candidacy for local offices, such as membership on a City Council or a County Board of Supervisors, is ordinarily less time consuming, as is service on either of these bodies. If campaigning and service time can be limited to what would customarily be allowed for consulting activity, the faculty member may remain in full-time status with the University. If his political activities require more of his time than that, it shall be the responsibility of his Dean and of the Provost to determine whether he should be required to take leave of absence or to accept a reduced teaching and/or research load, with corresponding adjustment in the level of his compensation.

A faculty member who receives a salary supplement for the performance of administrative duties must take leave of absence from his administrative position during any election campaign in which he is a candidate, and, if elected, must resign his administrative position when his term in the elected office begins. In other respects, such persons will be governed by the same policies which have been defined above.

Classified employees of the University are free to engage in all forms of political activity which do not interfere with the performance of the duties of their positions. If they choose to become candidates for elective office (e.g., membership in the General Assembly, the City Council, or the County Board of Supervisors), they will be expected to limit campaigning to off-duty hours, and any campaign activity in which they may engage during working hours will be chargeable to annual leave or leave without pay. Supervisors are encouraged to apply as liberal a policy as is consistent with maintaining the efficiency of the unit's operations toward the granting of annual leave or leave without pay and the adjustment of work schedules to enable the employee to conduct his campaign, and to serve in the office, if elected.

If a classified employee becomes a member of the General Assembly, he must assume leave status (either annual leave or leave without pay) during the time while the Assembly is in session. If he is called upon to perform duties or to exercise the functions of a member of the General Assembly at times when the Assembly is not in session, he must limit these activities to time outside University duty hours, or to time made available for them by his supervisor either by the granting of annual leave or leave without pay or by adjustment of work schedules.

If a classified employee becomes a member of a City Council or of a County Board of Supervisors, he may ordinarily continue in his employment at the University, provided that the duties of the office to which he has been elected can normally be performed outside regular University duty hours. Duty time spent on any activities incident to his Council or Board membership will be charged to annual leave or leave without pay, unless adjustments in his work schedule can be made which, in the judgment of his supervisor, will not impair the efficiency of his unit's operations.

### REVISED UNIVERSITY AFFIRMATIVE ACTION PLAN FOR EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY

### GIFTS, GRANTS, AND CONTRACTS

The President distributed a list of gifts received by the University during the period March 1, 1978, through April 30, 1978. These gifts totaled $827,900. Of this sum, $196,100 was contributed by individual donors, $202,300 by corporations, $67,400 by other donors, and $362,100 by University related Foundations. The Board accepted these gifts with grateful appreciation to the donors.

Also reported was the sum of $5,331,000 to support sponsored programs at the University of Virginia. These awards were received during the period of March 1, 1978, through April 30, 1978.

### REPORT FROM THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE TO IMPROVE COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN THE BOARD AND THE STUDENT BODY

Mr. George Palmer, Chairman of the Special Committee, reported that the Committee has completed its study of a letter to the Board from Mr. Stefan Underhill and Miss Mary Pat Morrissey, dated January 4, 1978. The Board referred the requests to the Special Committee at its regular meeting held January 28, 1978.

In this letter, it was requested that a written copy of the tentative agenda of the Student Affairs and Athletics Committee be furnished to the Student Council President one week prior to each meeting, it being understood that last minute items may be added before the meeting. The Board, upon recommendation of the Special Committee agreed to furnish a copy of the tentative agenda of the Student Affairs and Athletics Committee meeting to the Student Council President one week before each meeting as requested.

The letter of January 4 further requested that the Student Council officers be permitted to discuss specific items of the agenda with the Student Council as a whole. With respect to this request, the Board, on recommendation of the Special Committee, determined that the policies now in effect with respect to the discussion of agenda items be continued. The discussion revealed that substantial student input has been considered in most of these matters well before they are brought for final action to the Board, and that there is extensive and effective student participation in the administrative committee structure of the University.

### DISCUSSION OF THE HONOR SYSTEM

The Board continued a discussion of the Honor System begun at the Student Affairs and Athletics Committee meeting on June 1. At the Committee meeting, incoming Honor Committee Chairman John Richardson had distributed an analysis of a poll of faculty opinion on certain aspects of the system.

Mrs. Holton raised a question about the effectiveness of the procedures in use for the honor orientation of teaching assistants, since Mr. Richardson had reported that problems for the Honor Committee were being generated by some inadequately oriented teaching assistants. She suggested that these procedures might be looked into by the administration.

The President gave assurance that the administration will cooperate fully with the Honor Committee, but he said that the Honor system is a student system, and he is reluctant to take any action which might make it appear that honor procedures are being imposed by the faculty or administration.

### ANNOUNCEMENT WITH RESPECT TO THE GRAVES MOUNTAIN LODGE CONFERENCE, SEPTEMBER 12 and 13, 1978

Mr. George Palmer reminded the Board that on May 28, 1976, the Board approved guidelines that include "Members of the Board will, insofar as is possible, attend the annual fall conference customarily held at Graves Mountain Lodge." He advised that the conference will be held this year on Tuesday and Wednesday, September 12 and 13, 1978, at Graves Mountain Lodge.

It should be understood that no objective established in this plan shall in any way constitute a quota and that it shall not be treated as such. Moreover, it shall not be interpreted to require the hiring of a person who is not qualified or the hiring of a less qualified person in preference to a person who is more qualified.

The commitment to attempt to increase the number of female, minority and black employees in the University of Virginia is just that--a pledge to action. As such, the University's commitment means only that a good faith effort will be undertaken to meet these objectives.

The University, through its Board of Visitors, shall retain sole authority and responsibility for the employment policies of the University, subject to the limitations of applicable law.

The University of Virginia shall continue actively to seek, hire, and retain qualified female, minority and black employees. Specific action oriented programs now being carried out by the University and relating to all aspects of personnel management are contained in the Procedures for Implementing Executive Order Number One (Appendix A). These procedures, including the action oriented programs, were approved by the Board of Visitors of the University by resolution dated April 1, 1978. They are applicable to recruitment, selection, placement, training, promotion and terminations.
