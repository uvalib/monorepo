The President stated to the meeting that the University of Virginia has been requested by the Naval Research Laboratory, of Washington, to conduct certain experiments in connection with the studies of separated uranium isotopes; that he sees no reason why the work should not be done in accordance with the request of the Naval Laboratory. The Navy authorities propose to defray the cost of the necessary experiments, and will pay the sum of $13,000.00 to the University for the work, when it is completed.

Mr. Perkins then submitted to the meeting the following documents heretofore prepared by the Naval Research Laboratory and which have been submitted to the University for execution-

Mr. Perkins also presented to the Board copy of a letter written by him, under date of July 23, 1940, to Lieutenant Joel D. Parks, Navy Research Laboratory, Anacostia Station, Washington, together with a copy of Lieutenant Park's reply thereto, dated July 24, 1940, and copies of both of these letters were filed as a part of the minutes of this meeting.

I. Carruthers, Secretary of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, is hereby authorized and directed to affix the corporate seal of this Corporation to this contract, and to execute the certificate with reference to authority of the President, which appears on Page 4 of said contract.

And be it further Resolved, That Corporate Surety shall be given upon the performance bond which will be executed as a part of said contract.

The following resolution was adopted authorizing the Rector to sign applications for permits with the Alcohol Tax Unit of the Internal Revenue Service on behalf of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia:
