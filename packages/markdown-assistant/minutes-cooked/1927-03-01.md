Copy of a letter from Dr. Bean:

Your committee on the New Medical Buildings recommends to the President that the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia authorize their Buildings Committee to enter into an agreement to carry forward the construction of the Central Heating Plant for the New Medical Building in accordance with the proposals submitted by Mr. J. A. Almirall, hereto attached. The proposals include one boiler for the University and a building for the whole former plant to inclose another boiler and electrical equipment for lighting the University, therefore the University is to pay $35,000 and the Medical Building Fund is to pay $50,000. The Medical Building Fund will loan $35,000 to the University to be repaid later.

RESOLVED, That the Board approves the location and general plans of the New Medical School Building as submitted by Messrs. Coolidge, Shepley, Bulfinch and Abbott, and gives it approval to the changes in the Hospital and "Post Office" buildings necessitated by the location and arrangement as well as to the specific plans of the Medical School Building insofar as they have developed at this time.

RESOLVED, by the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, That the committee on Medical Buildings is hereby authorized to secure bids and let contract for the erection of a new laundry building according to location and plans therefor submitted by Messrs. Coolidge, Shepley, Bulfinch and Abbott, architects, at a cost not exceeding $15,000.

RESOLVED, by the Rector and Visitors, That the Medical Buildings Committee be authorized to enter into a contract with Messrs. Almirall and Company for additions to power plant at the approximate price of $85,000, upon terms and conditions satisfactory to the Medical Buildings Committee.

The Rector and Visitors being of opinion that it will be more economical and satisfactory to have provision made for additional light, heat and power facilities for the University at large, when additions are being made to the Power Plant for the Medical unit as suggested by the report of Dr. Bean submitting the proposal of Almirall & Co.

Therefore be it resolved that the entire cost of the additions to the Power Plant be paid out of the fund known as the Medical Buildings Fund, with the understanding that as soon as an appropriation for the power plant is available, that the Medical Building Fund shall be reimbursed for the amount expended in excess of $50,000.

RESOLVED, That the Committee on Medical Buildings is authorized to secure bids for the erection of a fireproof construction medical kitchen and dining room building according to plans therefor prepared by Coolidge, Shepley, Bulfinch and Abbott, architects, and submitted for the Board's inspection, on the location south of the McIntire Wing, recommended by said architects, and report to the next meeting of the Board.

We, the undersigned Committee, after discussion with Mr. J. A. Almirall desire to submit our approval of his plan for the Central Power Plant to take care of the needs of the New Medical Buildings as outlined in his letter to Dr. R. Bennett Bean dated March 1, 1927, which letter is hereto attached.

R. Bennett Bean, Chairman of Faculty Medical Building Committee acting for the Committee.

W. A. Lambeth, Sup't of Buildings and Grounds.

J. L. Newcomb, Assistant to President.

March 1, 1927.

At the meeting which the writer had with you yesterday morning, relative to the installation of new boiler at Central Power Plant, he left with you the two letters dated February 9th and February 11th which had previously been written concerning this subject.

The writer went into further details with you yesterday as to the practical impossibility of going ahead on the basis of installing at the present time only one unit of water tube boilers.

Such boilers, different from horizontal tubular boilers, must be thoroughly cleaned not less often than every two months and preferably every month and to do so there must always be one spare unit which absolutely necessitates the installation at this time of 300 horse power boiler units.

The writer also went into some further details of the loss there would be in spending such a considerable sum for temporary work which would have to be thrown out and discarded as useless within the next year or eighteen months.

Supplementing the letter which was handed you yesterday setting forth a budget for the installation of one 300 H. P. water tube boiler with various temporary appurtenances, we are submitting herewith a close approximate budget for the installation of two such boiler units, with permanent brick stack, completion of permanent Power House Building and sundry other items detailed below.

Trusting that we may have your approval to proceed along the above lines, we are,

Your committee on the New Medical Buildings recommends to the President that the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia authorize their Buildings Committee to enter into an agreement to carry forward the construction of the Central Heating Plant for the New Medical Building in accordance with the proposals submitted by Mr. J.
