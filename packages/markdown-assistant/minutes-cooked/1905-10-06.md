#### Committee under above resolution:

From Board,-Messrs. Harmon & Hunton, from Faculty, Drs. Whitehead & Barringer.

Resolved:- That, whereas on the 13th day of April 1905, an order was entered by the Board of Visitors, reciting that there would be a deficit in the current expenses for the year, for which it was necessary to make immediate provision, and whereas, it was made a matter of record that the individual members of the Board would execute such contract as might be required, binding themselves jointly for the payment of such sum, not exceeding Eleven Thousand Dollars, and whereas, such contract was executed by the individual members of the Board, and on the security of the same, the Proctor borrowed the sum of Eleven Thousand Dollars from the "Fidelity Savings & Trust Co." of Charlottesville; which amount has now been fully paid, and discharged, and said contract returned to the Bursar, it is ordered that the same be cancelled by the Finance Committee.

Resolved: That the Board hereby confirms the report of the Finance Committee this day made and directs a list of the bonds purchased with the One Hundred Thousand Dollars, known as the "Rockefeller Donation"; which said list is filed with said report together with a receipt of the "Virginia Trust Co." of Richmond, for said bonds; to be recorded by the Secretary.

Resolved: That the Board also confirms the action of the Finance Committee in making an arrangement with the "Virginia Trust Company" of Richmond for the sale of the bonds held for the Sinking Fund, consisting of sixty-eight Thousand and eight hundred Virginia three per cent bonds and Two Thousand "Georgia Pacific" six per cent bonds, and for the redemption of the bonds of the University, maturing Oct. 15th, 1905, which will amount in principal and interest to $72,085.; said Trust Company to be paid one tenth of one per cent on the amount of bonds sold, and to be allowed any commission that the said Company may be required to pay to a broker for the sale of said bonds, not to exceed one quarter of one per cent if any of said bonds are sold through a broker.

And it appearing from the report of the Finance Committee, that the proceeds of the sale of the Sinking Fund bonds will not pay off the entire maturing indebtedness, the Finance Committee is directed to leave unpaid to the extent of such shortage, six per cent bonds held for the benefit of the "McCormick Observatory Fund," and of the Library Fund of the University of Virginia.

And the Finance Committee is instructed to invest the proceeds of the maturing bonds held for the benefit of the McCormick Observatory Fund and the Library fund in some interest bearing investment, and make report of the same to the next meeting of the Board.

Resolved: That the Trustees of the Jefferson Memorial Fund are requested to authorize their Treasurer to invest the fund in his hands, and to come into his hands, in securities deemed safe by him, so as to provide as large an income as practicable for the benefit of the University.

Resolved: That the report of Messrs. Harmon and Echols as to the water supply of the University, this day made in writing, be approved and confirmed; and in accordance with the conclusions of said report, that the Bursar do pay to the City of Charlottesville, the amount fixed by the contract of May 17th, 1900 for the share of the University for operating the pumping-plant, and continue as heretofore to make the other payments provided for in said contract; and that the Superintendent of Grounds and Buildings do investigate whether there is any wasteful or extravagant use of water on the University grounds, and if there is, to take the necessary steps to prevent the same. The said report and accompanying documents shall be recorded on the minutes of the Board.

#### The Report follows,-

The undersigned to whom was referred at your last meeting the duty of considering and reporting what is best to be done in regard to the the water supply of the City of Charlottesville and the University, respectfully report:-

The water supply has proven deficient and the city has had to incur some extraordinary expense in connection with the supplemental water plant, and also proposes to make permanent additions to the system at a cost estimated at $135,000.00.

A claim has been presented against the University for a proportion of these extraordinary expenses, and we are also requested to contribute a proportion of the cost of the permanent improvement.

The consideration of the subject was first taken up in the correspondence between the members of your committee, which is herewith returned.

Copies of the contracts between the City of Charlottesville and the University are also returned herewith. These show the legal rights of the parties.

The first contract is dated January 20, 1885, and under it the water-works were built. By this contract the aggregate cost of the works was put at $90,000., of which the University was to contribute $15,800., and the City $74,200. and any additional sum needed to complete the work was to be contributed by the parties in the same proportion. The works referred to were to be constructed in accordance with the plans of Earnest W. Bowditch, the engineer selected by the parties, and when completed were to be owned by the parties in proportion to the amounts they had respectively contributed towards their construction. The University's interest was therefore 17-56/100 per cent, and the interest of the City therein was 82-44/100 per cent, making the University's interest a little less than one-fifth of the whole.

The contract provided with respect to the use of the water by the parties, that the University should have the free and exclusive use of so much of the water as should be drawn into its pipes from the main pipe on its grounds, so as to supply all the grounds which it then owned or might thereafter acquire up to the line of the C. & O. Railway; and after passing through the grounds of the University, then the City was to have the free and exclusive use of the water with the unrestricted right to dispose of the same as it pleased; but neither party was to use the water so as to prevent its free and proper enjoyment by the other.

The works were constructed under this contract and in pursuance of the plans of the Engineer therein referred to; and a ten inch main was laid from the reservoir through the University grounds and down to the City, which was then the town of Charlottesville, the municipality having become a City at a subsequent date. The system thus inaugurated, worked by gravity, and the grounds of the University were higher than those of the city. The result was that the use of the water in course of three or four years increased with the increasing number of the city's customers the pressure in the main in the University's grounds was diminished by the draft of the water flowing out at the lower level of the city, and the supply of the University became insufficient for its needs. To remedy this and give the University the supply which would be free from a draft or suction upon it caused by the out-flowing water on the lower levels of the city, the contract of January 7th, 1892, was entered into, under which the University constructed at its own expense, its own separate six-inch water-main, connecting its grounds with the reservoir, and having no connection with the city main, or pipes; by this contract the University sold and released to the city all its interest in the ten-inch water main, first put in. By this release and contract, the University was given the right to connect its six-inch main with the Reservoir, provided such connection could be made through "Dam Tunnel" or otherwise without injury to the dam or gate-house, and without detriment to the water supply of the City, to be governed by the concurrent opinion of an hydraulic engineer to be selected by the parties; and provided further, that the University should indemnify and protect the City against injury and damages which might sustain or be liable for by reason of such connection notwithstanding the parties or engineer had been of opinion that such connection would be without injury or detriment aforesaid.

Said contract also provided that nothing therein contained should be so construed as to alter the ratio of ownership of the reservoir and water supply on the part of the city and the University as fixed by their former contract of January 20, 1885.

This six-inch main was accordingly put in by the University in the year 1892, at a cost of $16,600.76, and no injury resulted therefrom to the "Dam Tunnel" or gate-house, nor has any detriment resulted to the water supply of the City. This has been the concurrent opinion of both parties as shown by their long acquiescence therein without objection.

Prior to putting in this six-inch main the University got its supply of water from the ten-inch main, thereby diminishing to that extent the supply passing on through that main to the City. The construction of the six-inch main, however, by preventing this drain upon the main supply of the city, has increased to that extent the city's supply; and in this way has been and is a benefit instead of a detriment to the supply received by the City. In the year 1896 a deficiency in the water supply in the Reservoir being feared, the City put in certain supplemental water-works to be operated by steam, whereby water was to be pumped from a stream called Reservoir Creek, into the ten-inch main of the City. These waterworks are situated near this ten-inch main some two or three miles from the reservoir. Their cost was $14,576.48, and the University agreed to contribute one-seventh of this sum and was to own a one-seventh interest in the works.

In order to show the interest of the University in these supplemental works and to settle other matters between the parties, a third contract dated May 17, 1900, was entered into between the City and the University which was duly admitted to record in the Clerk's Office of the County Court of Albemarle County.

The contract further contained the agreement between the parties as to the terms on which the supplemental works should be maintained and operated, and the reservoir and the University water-main should be kept in order. These stipulations are as follows:- "The City shall have the control of the aforesaid supplemental water-works and the operation of the same, and the University shall pay the city the sum of $30.00 per annum towards the maintenance, caring for, and keeping in order of the said supplemental water-works, and shall further pay the city the sum of $12.50 per month for each month during which the same shall be in operation for the benefit of the parties; as the University's proportion of the expenses of such operation, maintenance and the keeping in order." "The University shall begin on and after the first day of July next to again pay to the City the sum of $150.00 per annum, in consideration of which the City shall keep in order the said reservoir and shall also blow out and keep clean of obstruction the said water-main of the University, and keep the same in order, and allow a free flow of water through the same, but this shall not bind the city to renew or replace the said main or any part thereof where, without default on the part of the City, it may be necessary to do so.

During the year 1894, the City installed a sewerage system which added a considerable per centage to the amount of water it used, and was very probably the cause of the threatened deficiency of the water supply in 1896. The larger portion of the City's water however, is sold by it to persons residing in the city limits or near thereto. Its charter gives it practically a monopoly of the water supply within its limits and within one mile thereof.

The amount derived by the City from the water sold its customers is an index in part of the increased and increasing use of water by the City. The water works appear to have been gotten into full operation during the year 1888, and we find from the City records that its revenue from water for the year ending March 31, 1889, was $4,173.28, as shown by the quarterly reports of the City Treasurer and the Water Committee of the City Council, while for the fiscal year ending June 1900, we find from the Treasurer's report (p. 336) the City's revenue from water was $11,545.88, an increase of nearly three hundred per cent. And figures just obtained from the City Treasurer's office show that for the year ending Sept. 1, 1905, the receipts from sale of water were $17,675.99 which was stated to be about $2000.00 in excess of the previous year. This does not take into consideration such water as is used without charge, nor does it include delinquents. In contrast to the above figures showing the greatly increased draft, by the city, put upon the reservoir and the original main, the use of the water by the University has not increased to any substantial extent since they were first installed. The new buildings erected in consequence of the fire of 1895 take a little more water to supply them than those destroyed. Likewise the supply of the boiler-house has been added. The Randall building and hospital also increase our demands with these exceptions the population on the University grounds, and use of water remain about the same as in the year 1888.

There has been some increase of the student population, but none in the number living upon the University grounds, except in the comparatively small number lodged in the Randall Building. A very large proportion of the students live outside of the grounds and are within the territory from which the city receives its water revenue. It was not contemplated by the city when the supplemental pumping plant was put in that it would be necessary to operate it except on rare occasions, but for some months past it has been found necessary to operate it almost continually, day and night, and it has been necessary also to put in an additional Engine and to make connection with Moore's Creek a larger watercourse. This pumping plant has been almost the sole dependence of the City while the University supply has come from the Reservoir. It is claimed that the University should pay more than the amount fixed in the contract of March 17, 1900 for operating expenses of the pumping plant, that we should pay a part of the expense necessary to clean out the accumulation of mud in the pumping plant dam; should pay a proportion of the cost of the new boiler and of the expense of making connection with Moore's Creek, and should contribute a part of the costs of the permanent addition to the water works.

The first two items are plainly covered by the contract of March 1900, and no good reason is seen why its terms should be departed from, while the expenditures in all four of the items are rendered necessary only by reason of the increased demand of the City for water. The University is entitled certainly to 17-56/100 per cent of the water accumulated in the reservoir, which it seems evident it has not received, while the city derives a large profit by reason of taking more than its share, the University would not therefore be justified in contributing to the cost rendered necessary by the increased and increasing requirements of the City, unless it is to participate in the revenues. Moreover unless the present plan on which it is proposed to make the improvement is modified, by increasing the height of the new dam, there would be no increase in the pressure at the University, unless this is done, we ought not to contribute at all. The University's interest in the water works has already cost it $32,283.11, while there is a fixed annual charge upon us to the City of $180. and an additional charge at the rate of $150. per annum while the pump is in operation for our benefit. This seems to be quite as much if not more than the University ought to pay for its water supply. If the City should desire to buy out the interest of the University, making satisfactory arrangements for supplying us with water, it might be wise to consider such a contract.

It is recommended that the Bursar be directed to pay to the City of Charlottesville the amounts fixed by the contract of May 17, 1900 for the share of the University for operating the pumping plant and continue as heretofore to make the other payments provided for in said contract.

It is further suggested that the Superintendent of Grounds and Buildings be directed to investigate whether there is any wasteful or extravagant use of water on the University grounds, and if there is to take the necessary steps to prevent the same.

This does not take into consideration such water as is used without charge, nor does it include delinquents. In contrast to the above figures showing the greatly increased draft, by the city, put upon the reservoir and the original main, the use of the water by the University has not increased to any substantial extent since they were first installed. The new buildings erected in consequence of the fire of 1895 take a little more water to supply them than those destroyed. Likewise the supply of the boiler-house has been added. The Randall building and hospital also increase our demands with these exceptions the population on the University grounds, and use of water remain about the same as in the year 1888.

There has been some increase of the student population, but none in the number living upon the University grounds, except in the comparatively small number lodged in the Randall Building. A very large proportion of the students live outside of the grounds and are within the territory from which the city receives its water revenue. It was not contemplated by the city when the supplemental pumping plant was put in that it would be necessary to operate it except on rare occasions, but for some months past it has been found necessary to operate it almost continually, day and night, and it has been necessary also to put in an additional Engine and to make connection with Moore's Creek a larger watercourse. This pumping plant has been almost the sole dependence of the City while the University supply has come from the Reservoir. It is claimed that the University should pay more than the amount fixed in the contract of March 17, 1900 for operating expenses of the pumping plant, that we should pay a part of the expense necessary to clean out the accumulation of mud in the pumping plant dam; should pay a proportion of the cost of the new boiler and of the expense of making connection with Moore's Creek, and should contribute a part of the costs of the permanent addition to the water works.

The first two items are plainly covered by the contract of March 1900, and no good reason is seen why its terms should be departed from, while the expenditures in all four of the items are rendered necessary only by reason of the increased demand of the City for water. The University is entitled certainly to 17-56/100 per cent of the water accumulated in the reservoir, which it seems evident it has not received, while the city derives a large profit by reason of taking more than its share, the University would not therefore be justified in contributing to the cost rendered necessary by the increased and increasing requirements of the City, unless it is to participate in the revenues. Moreover unless the present plan on which it is proposed to make the improvement is modified, by increasing the height of the new dam, there would be no increase in the pressure at the University, unless this is done, we ought not to contribute at all. The University's interest in the water works has already cost it $32,283.11, while there is a fixed annual charge upon us to the City of $180. and an additional charge at the rate of $150. per annum while the pump is in operation for our benefit. This seems to be quite as much if not more than the University ought to pay for its water supply. If the City should desire to buy out the interest of the University, making satisfactory arrangements for supplying us with water, it might be wise to consider such a contract.

It is recommended that the Bursar be directed to pay to the City of Charlottesville the amounts fixed by the contract of May 17, 1900 for the share of the University for operating the pumping plant and continue as heretofore to make the other payments provided for in said contract.

It is further suggested that the Superintendent of Grounds and Buildings be directed to investigate whether there is any wasteful or extravagant use of water on the University grounds, and if there is to take the necessary steps to prevent the same.
