A special meeting of the Board was held on this date with the Rector, Frederic W. Scott, and Visitors Corbitt, Garnett, L. C. Williams and R. Gray Williams, and President Newcomb present.

Minutes of the previous meeting, which had been copied and mailed to the members, were approved.

The following report from the New Buildings Committee with respect to bids for certain items in connection with the erection of the New Library Building was received, discussed and approved:

The New Buildings Committee of the Board of Visitors met on this date at 11 o'clock in the office of President Newcomb to receive bids for screens, weatherstripping, venetian blinds, shades, walls, roads, drains, landscaping and yard wall, in accordance with advertisement therefor, in connection with PWA Project 1075-D University of Virginia Library.

There were present Lewis C. Williams and C. O'Conor Goolrick of the New Buildings Committee. President Newcomb, and E. B. Hazelgrove representing the Public Works Administration.

Twenty-seven bids complying with the requirements set forth in the advertisement were submitted for one or more items of the schedule, and the following were found to be the low bidder under each schedule.

The President presented the matter of providing for supplementary retiring allowances for certain members of the faculty and explained, at some length, the Majority and Minority reports of the special Committee of the Board on Supplementary Retiring Allowances presented at the January meeting at which action was deferred for further study, and the study and consideration that had been given it in the interim by himself and the Faculty Committee which had been considering the matter. He presented the following preambles and resolution which was offered by Lewis C. Williams and seconded by R. Gray Williams and adopted:

WHEREAS, the 24 members of the Administration and Teaching Staff whose respective names and ages are listed below were not permitted to participate in the University's Retirement Annuity Plan which was set up as of July 1, 1928, having been excluded therefrom on account of their expectation of benefits from the Carnegie Foundation, which expectations it was subsequently found would be in large part unrealized; and

WHEREAS, if said members had been permitted to participate in the Plan the University would, under the Plan, have contributed amounts which would have provided for said members annuities commencing on the first day of July after their respective seventieth birthdays in the following respective amounts:

and would also have provided after the respective deaths of said persons one-half of the above listed amounts for their respective widows;

WHEREAS, the Rector and Visitors of the University has received a communication from certain members of the professorial and administrative staff which reads as follows:

"We the undersigned members of the Professorial Staff of the University of Virginia who will be affected by the system of retiring annuities at age seventy now under consideration by the Board of Visitors, are unanimously of the opinion that the system to be inaugurated should be that which would produce a uniformity of annual retiring allowance for the twenty-four individuals involved. This group is constituted of those who would by such a system receive somewhat lower retiring allowances than would be offered by the allowances sponsored by the majority of the sub-committee of the Board of Visitors."
