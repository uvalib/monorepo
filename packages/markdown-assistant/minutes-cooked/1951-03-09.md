The regular monthly meeting of the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia was held on this date in the Office of the President of the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia, with the following present: The Rector, Barron F. Black; President Colgate W. Darden, Jr., of the University of Virginia; Dr. M. L. Combs, President of Mary Washington College; Visitors Anderson, Barksdale, Carrington, Emmett, Garnett, Gay, Gravatt, Mears, Smith, Talbott and Wailes. Absent: Visitors Howard and Willis.

The minutes of the meeting of February 9, 1951, which had been copied and mailed to the members, were approved.

The President reported receipt of the following gifts.

Upon recommendation of the President, the following election and continuation of appointment were approved.

Mr. Edwin W. Pullen as Instructor in Anatomy in the Department of Medicine, effective September 1, 1951, at a session salary of $3,600.

Dr. Jacques Rappaport continued as Acting Associate Professor of Biology for the session of 1951-52, part of his salary to come from the unexpended salary of Professor O. E. White, who is on leave of absence, and the balance to come from a grant from the General Education Board.

Mr. Darden reported to the Board that the Lizzie B. Miller Farm at Elkton, Virginia had become the property of the University of Virginia upon the death in February of Mr. T. Ferdinand Bowen, who held a life interest in the property. The property was left to the University for benefit of charity patients at the University of Virginia Hospital. The question of its disposal was referred to the University attorney in the following resolution:

**RESOLVED** that Mr. W. Allan Perkins, Attorney for the University, be given full authority to employ a real estate broker to assist the University in disposing of this property, and that that the following information be secured from the broker: (1) a determination of the fair rental value of the property; (2) a determination of the sale value; (3) when it would be advisable to sell the property; (4) whether it should be sold by private sale or by public auction.

The following resolution was adopted.

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the Hospital Accounts Committee be and it is hereby authorized to charge off as uncollectible accounts schedules 192, 193, 194 and 195, aggregating $11,837.07, recommended by them for cancellation.

President Darden presented the following proposal concerning the University's contribution to the restoration work being done in the area between West Lawn and West Range, by the Garden Club of Virginia.

**Memo: To The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia:**

Consultation with officers of the Garden Club of Virginia has resulted in an agreement as to the University's contribution to the work being done on the gardens in the area between West Lawn and West Range. We agree that the University should assume the following obligations:

The University will continue to remove the North-South road lying between West Lawn and West Range as is required by the garden work. It will rebuild the East-West roads, providing a shallow gutter and using stabilized gravel for the roads. The University will grade and construct an appropriate walk, using light crushed stone, to run just outside and along the western edge of the gardens providing passageway for students and visitors desiring to see the gardens. These improvements are conditioned upon funds becoming available. It is hoped that circumstances will permit these to go hand in hand with the work on the gardens.

The University is to see that the gardens, when completed, are maintained in an appropriate manner and that, more particularly, it is to see:

1. That the brick and woodwork is kept in good condition and that the lawn, plants and walks are well kept and, should it be necessary to replace any of the plants, that only plants known as of the year 1826 be used.

2. That the original design of the gardens is followed, due allowance being made for the occupant of the pavilion to have a cutting garden.

3. That when repairs are made in the walks, walls, gates and garden ornaments, like materials shall be secured for replacements and in those cases where a change in design or material is deemed necessary, the officials of the Garden Club of Virginia or a landscape architect employed by them shall be consulted.

I recommend to the Rector and Visitors that the University obligate itself as suggested by the above tentative agreement.

Whereupon a resolution was adopted approving the proposal and authorizing the President to sign such an agreement with the Garden Club.

The following rates proposed by the administration for student rooms were approved, effective September 1951.

President Darden presented a proposal to set the tuition charge for graduate work in all departments at a uniform figure, Virginians to pay $150 per session and non-Virginians $300. These rates would be established for graduate instruction in all professional departments, as well as for programs under the direction of the Department of Graduate Studies. The President's proposal was approved.

President Darden stated that for the last eight years the University had used parchment diplomas. Graduates, particularly in the professional departments, desire genuine sheepskin. Mr. Black inquired whether the State would purchase sheepskin, or whether we were compelled to buy the parchment diplomas. President Darden proposed that a graduation fee be established to pay for a sheepskin diploma and also to cover the cost of cap and gown at graduation. He stated that a number of institutions assess such a fee. It was the sense of the Board that if the State would agree, the University should purchase sheepskins and give them to the students. Whereupon a resolution was adopted requesting the President to investigate the matter and report to the Board at its next meeting, determining: (1) whether or not the State would pay for sheepskins; (2) if it would not, what fee should be established; and (3) should a graduation fee be desirable, what institutions were now assessing such a fee and the amount so charged.

The matter of naming the Women's Dormitory now under construction was referred to a special committee composed of Mrs. Smith, Mrs. Wailes and Mrs. Willis.

The following resolution, prepared by Judge Garnett, was unanimously adopted.

### Resolution upon the death of Dudley Crofford Smith, M. D., a member of the faculty of the Medical Department of the University of Virginia

Dr. Dudley Crofford Smith, who was born on December 15, 1892, at Lafayette Springs, Mississippi, departed this life on August 30, 1950.

After receiving his bachelor's degree at the University of Mississippi in 1914 he entered the Medical Department of the University of Virginia and graduated in 1916. He became an instructor in the Medical Department of this University in 1919, and became successively assistant professor, associate professor and finally professor of dermatology and syphilology in 1934, and founded the Department of Dermatology and Syphilology at the University.

He became a member of A O A; Raven Society; Sigma Xi; ODK; Kappa Sigma; Phi Beta Pi and Tilka. He served as President of the Rotary Club of Charlottesville.

Dr. Smith was the author of many scientific articles and his work at the University was a reflex of his desire to serve his fellowmen. A few months before his death he was honored by the chairmanship of his section of the American Medical Association.

Messrs. Gunn and Wilkinson, representing the State-Planters Bank and Trust Company, appeared before the Board of Visitors and presented a report on the operation of the Consolidated Endowment Fund for the period January 25, 1950 to January 25, 1951, a copy of which is filed in the Secretary's office.

Mr. Gunn stated that the objectives established by the Finance Committee at the time the fund was turned over to the State-Planters Bank and Trust Company had been in large part met. He stated that sales, redemptions and conversions of securities during the year aggregated $839,453.92 with a net capital gain to the fund of $53,469.39. In the reinvestment of these funds an increase in yield from 4.20% to 4.35% had been obtained. In general the program of sales and purchases made during the year reflected a continuation of the policy of gradually increasing the percentage of common stocks in the fund. As of January 25, 1951 the assets were diversified according to their book values as follows:

On the above assets net income after paying expenses for the year ending January 25, 1951 amounted to $252,575.71. The gross income on the average book value during 1950 was 4.77%. In 1949 this figure was 4.26%.

Mr. Black inquired why the State-Planters Bank had recommended purchases of insurance stock and such heavy acquisitions of utility stocks. Mr. Wilkinson stated that the tremendous needs of the utilities for capital for expansion had held down the price of utility common stocks so that a yield of 6% to 7% could be obtained. He believed that after the financing period was over the price would increase so that the yield would become stable at from 4.25% to 4.75%. It was the feeling of the Bank that the University should take advantage of this opportunity to buy top-grade utility common stocks.

Since the start of the Korean War the Bank had recommended the sale of some of our fire and casualty insurance stocks because inflation would increase their settlement costs and hence reduce their profits. However, the Bank was still continuing to recommend the purchase of Life Insurance Company of Virginia stock because they believed that this stock was an excellent value. It is selling today at about the same price as in 1929, at which time the book value of each share was about one-third of the market value. Today the book value is approximately the same as the market value.

Mr. Mears inquired why the Bank had not recommended the purchase of any steel stocks in view of the high earnings of this industry. Mr. Wilkinson stated that the proposed expansion of the steel industry will require approximately $2,000,000,000. It is estimated that of this amount $500,000,000 will have to be provided by the issuance of additional common stock. It is hoped that the floating of these common stock issues will depress the price of steel stocks so that they will become more attractive to the investor at market prices. Should this condition obtain, the Bank would recommend to the University the addition of certain selected steel stocks to its portfolio.

President Darden pointed out that the Student Legal Forum had been bringing distinguished speakers to the University throughout the year. These meetings are largely attended by students in the Law School but are open to the public.

The chairman of the group had been to see President Darden concerning the appearance on this program of Dr. Ralph Bunche. The President stated that he feels the best thing to do is to treat Dr. Bunche as any other lecturer. He believes the Supreme Court decision opens such meetings to mixed groups without segregation.

Mr. Gay stated that he did not think we should change the present policy for this lecture. However, the Board might wish to establish some general policy for the future concerning the handling of public lectures at the University. No formal resolution was adopted but it was the sense of the Board that Mr. Gay's suggestion concerning this lecture should be followed.

Mr. Edward Anderson stated that Mr. John Powell had spoken to him on several occasions about the possibility of establishing a chair of folk music at the University, and he had suggested that Mr. Powell discuss the matter with President Darden and Dean Lawis. President Darden stated that he thought such a professorship would be highly desirable, but that the University had no funds for the purpose. Mr. Anderson suggested that the John Powell Foundation might become interested in the matter and provide the funds.

President Darden reported that this Center had grown very rapidly and that there was a great deal of interest in that area for expansion of the work to provide additional facilities. He stated that a study was under way and that at a later date he would make a report to the Board.

Mr. Darden reported that he had discussed with the Governor the procedure of charging off uncollectible hospital accounts; that the Governor was familiar with the procedure and approved the method being followed by the Board of Visitors. The President stated that he was following up their conversation with a letter to the Governor setting forth the procedures now being followed.

Mrs. Wailes, speaking for the Committee, made the following report.

The present program of courses leading to the degree of Bachelor of Science in Home Economics does not qualify a student to teach home economics. The Virginia State Department of Education has notified the College to this effect and has also informed prospective students who have inquired about the home economics courses at the College. It is suggested that students majoring in home economics be permitted to take, as electives, the courses that would qualify them to teach home economics if they so desire. In order to make this possible the following courses would have to be made available:

* Home Management Residence. Coordination of the various phases of home economics education through training and experience in the many activities involved in home management. Residence in the Home Management House required. Six credits.
* Principles of Teaching Home Economics. Procedures and problems in the teaching of home economics are given extensive consideration. Various types of home economics courses are evaluated. Three credits.
* Supervised Teaching in Home Economics. In the senior year students will teach under the supervision of an approved specialist in home economics. Six credits.

These courses will be available only to students who are working for the degree of B. S. in Home Economics. Thus students who receive this specialized degree will be able to qualify to teach the subject if they wish. The inclusion of these courses as electives does not change essentially the program for the B. S. in Home Economics degree approved by the Rector and Visitors.

The College already has a home management house. It is merely a question of making this course available to the students. The course in the Teaching of Home Economics would give the students in this field similar opportunities that students in Secondary Education now have who wish to teach in high school in academic fields.

A college offering the specialized degree of Bachelor of Science in Home Economics should make it possible for students to teach this subject if they wish to do so, especially in view of the urgent need for teachers with a thorough academic background such as that now a part of the required curriculum of every student at Mary Washington. The Committee from the Board on Mary Washington unanimously approved this recommendation at its meeting on February 27, 1951.

Whereupon the following resolution was adopted:

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that Mary Washington College be and is hereby authorized to make available Home Management Residence, Principles of Teaching Home Economics, and Supervised Teaching in Home Economics, on an elective basis for students working for the special B. S. degree in Home Economics.

Students at Mary Washington who wish to teach in high school may take as electives the courses necessary to qualify for the Collegiate Professional Certificate. Their major, of course, is in some academic subject, such as English, history, French, etc. They take a course in Secondary Education and one in Supervised Teaching if they wish to qualify for the teaching certificate.

Students majoring in psychology have requested that we make available a six-hour elective course in Elementary Education similar to the one in Secondary Education now offered. In this way, students interested in working with children of elementary school age would be able to take an elective course in this field similar to the one now offered prospective teachers in high school.

The offering of such a course would not affect the cooperative program in education now in operation by which the student takes her first two years at Mary Washington and the junior and senior years in the Department of Education at the University of Virginia. This program is a major in Education and leads to the degree of B. S. in Education. The six-hour course in Elementary Education that is proposed for Mary Washington will be offered as on elective for students majoring in psychology. Many of these students are now going into positions in which some acquaintance with the principles and procedures of elementary education is highly desirable.

The offering of the courses mentioned above will not in any way affect the college as a liberal arts institution, and as stated above, the Committee of the Board of Mary Washington College unanimously approved both of these recommendations on February 27, 1951.

The following resolution was adopted.

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that Mary Washington College be and is hereby authorized to make available to students majoring in psychology a six-hour elective course in Elementary Education similar to the one in Secondary Education now being offered.

Dr. Combs stated that both he and the staff of the student newspaper at Mary Washington College were very much disturbed by an article appearing in "The Cavalier Daily" stating that the administration at Mary Washington College exercised censorship over the student newspaper. President Combs stated that the editorial staff of the paper had been to see him concerning the matter. He stated that for many years there had been a faculty sponsor to assist the girls in establishing standards of literature, etc. He stated that there had never been the slightest censorship of the paper by the administration.

Dr. Combs added that he had told the young ladies to forget about the matter. Mr. Black suggested that if "The Cavalier Daily" had made an error in its editorial about censorship at Mary Washington College, that the error should be corrected, and that the young ladies should write the editor of "The Cavalier Daily" and call his attention to the error.

On motion the meeting was then adjourned.
