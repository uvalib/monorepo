At a called meeting of the Board of Visitors held at the University on above date.

Present: The Rector, and Visitors Harmon, Moore, Wallace, White, and Hunton.

The Board having been called to order at 10:30 o'clock A. M., the following resolutions were adopted:

Resolved: That Mr. I. K. Moran be elected Secretary of the Board, at a salary of $100.00 per annum.

The official bond of the Proctor, Thomas H. Carter, with the "Virginia Trust Company" of Richmond as his security, and the renewals thereof up to the 23rd day of April, 1905, having been delivered to the Board, it is ordered that the said bond and renewals thereof be deposited with the President of the University of Virginia for safe keeping, which is accordingly done.

The following resolutions, relative to the powers and duties of the President, were adopted;

The President of the University shall be the executive head of the University of Virginia, with the powers, duties, and responsibilities ordinarily belonging to such officer in the leading American Universities, and shall receive a salary of five thousand dollars per annum and residence.

Such powers, duties, and responsibilities shall be defined by the Board.

Now therefore, in order to define the powers, duties, and responsibilities of the President;

Be it resolved as follows:

1. The President of the University of Virginia shall be the authorized means of communication between the Board of Visitors and the various officers of instruction and administration employed in the University.

2. He shall have the immediate care and government of the students admitted into the institution for instruction and education.

3. The professors, assistant professors, and other members of teaching staff and the proctor, shall aid the President in the care and government of the institution.

4. The President shall be charged with the general supervision of the interests of University, and shall have special oversight of the several departments and schools of instruction of the University. It shall be his duty to consult with the professors with respect to the development of their various departments, and the general interest of the University. The professors shall have liberty in the development and administration of their own departments, subject to the recommendations of the faculty as a whole, and to the decisions of the Board.

5. The President shall preside on all public occasions and represent the University before the public. He shall fix and announce the dates of meetings, both regular and called of the general, and of each departmental faculty and he shall preside over the meetings of the faculties. It shall be his duty to determine the general nature of the duties and responsibilities of each faculty.

6. It shall be the duty of the President of the University to recommend to the Board all appointments for positions upon the teaching staff of the University, and to exercise such superintendence over the building properties, books and other properties as will insure their protection and appropriate use.

7. The President is hereby constituted ex officio, a member of the executive committee of the Board of Visitors, and also a member ex officio, of the Board of Visitors without vote.

8. Purchases, alterations, repairs, expenditures, and other incidental expenses must not be ordered by any of the officers of the University without his previous assent or the expressed authority of the Board.

9. It shall be the duty of the President to determine and define the appropriate duties of all instructors, fellowship and scholarship students.

10. The President shall have power to appoint for ratification by the Board of Visitors, a Dean of each department, the powers and duties of the Dean of the Academic Department to be determined by the President in consultation with the professor appointed to that office.

11. The President shall have the power to suspend or remove from the University any student, for any cause deemed by the former to be sufficientâ€”;reserving, however, to such student the right to appeal from the decision of the President to the Board of Visitors. And, if he deems it wise, he shall constitute a Board of Deans of all the departments to assist him in the exercise of these powers.

12. In case the President considers that he has just cause of complaint against a professor on account of inefficient conduct of his school, or any other reason, he shall in writing notify the professor of the grounds of complaint, coupled with an intimation that his case will be brought to the attention of the Board of Visitors for their decision and action.

13. All the laws of the University inconsistent with the foregoing are hereby repealed.

Resolved: That the foregoing resolutions relative to the powers and duties of the President be announced and published in such manner as the President may think fit.

The President recommended the following as Deans of the various departments for the current session:

* Dr. James M. Page of the Academic Department,
* Dr. W. G. Christian of the Medical Department,
* Prof. W. M. Lile of the Law Department,
* Prof. W. M. Thornton of the Engineering Department, and such recommendations were approved by the Board, and the nominations confirmed.

Whereas, the duties of the Dean of the Academic Department will be largely in excess of those attaching to the other Departments, it is hereby resolved that the salary of two hundred dollars per annum be and the same is hereby voted to that Deanship.

Resolved: That suggestions presented to the Board respecting Alumni scholarships, be referred to the Executive Committee, with power to act.

Pursuant to the recommendation of the President, on motion, the President is hereby authorized to adopt such measures as he may deem proper to inaugurate and maintain the Mess Hall on Carr's Hill, to be hereafter known as the "Commons."

Resolved: That the recommendation of Mr. Patton in his letter to the President, relating to additional shelving and the location of the Poe bust, in the Library, and his recommendation in a report heretofore made relative to the heating arrangement in the Library, be referred to the Executive Committee to take such action as may be thought advisable, limiting the expenditure as far as possible.

Resolved: That the compensation of Miss Tuttle for the work she is doing in the Library be increased from $30.00 to $40.00 per month.

It being represented to the Board that the appropriation of $31,000.00 heretofore made for building a wing to the Hospital, in consequence of a mistake in the estimates, is insufficient to complete and equip the structure, and that unless the appropriation is enlarged, loss will ensue, it is resolved that those entrusted with the expenditure of said amount, be authorized to spend an additional amount, not exceeding the sum of $2,300.00.

Resolved: That the thirteenth day of April, 1905, is selected as the date for the formal inauguration of Dr. Alderman as President of the University; that it is advisable there should be committees representing the Board, the Faculty, and the Alumni, to arrange for the ceremonies for that occasion, and that the entire matter be referred to the Executive Committee for consideration of details, with power to take such steps as may be deemed proper.

Resolved: That, in consideration of his services as Assistant Demonstrator of Anatomy, last year, and on condition that he serves in the same capacity during the current session, the indebtedness of Dr. Norford to the University be remitted.

The President having submitted to the Board, the resignation of Mr. Fitz-Hugh as Professor of Latin, and Mr. FitzHugh having at the request of the Board appeared before it, the Board hereby testifies its confidence in Prof. Fitz-Hugh, and requests that he withdraw his resignation.

On motion, the Board adjourned, subject to the call of the Rector.
