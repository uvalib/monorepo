The President stated that the time was at hand when it was necessary to provide names for the seven new dormitories now under construction along the west side of Alderman Road. To aid him in preparing a recommendation on this matter, the President reported that he had appointed a committee consisting of Mr. R. K. Gooch, Chairman, and Professors Emeriti Atcheson L. Hench, Charles Henderson, and Tipton R. Snavely. This Committee had proposed the continuation of the practice of naming dormitories for former members of the faculty and had recommended the names of Edward Henry Courtenay, Robley Dunglison, Francis Perry Dunnington, Thomas Fitz Hugh, William Minor Lile, Socrates Maupin, and Albert Henry Tuttle. The President summarized the distinguished careers of each of these seven former professors as follows:

**Edward Henry Courtenay** (1803-1853), mathematician, author, and engineer, succeeded Charles Bonnycastle in the Chair of Mathematics at the University of Virginia in 1842 and held it until his death. A native of Baltimore and a graduate of West Point, where he stood first in his class in 1821, he undertook important construction projects for both the Army and Navy and was briefly a Division Engineer of the Erie Railroad Company. He held professorships at West Point and at the University of Pennsylvania before coming to Virginia. He was a teacher of extraordinary gifts, and his works were long used as texts at West Point and Charlottesville.

**Robley Dunglison** (1798-1869), one of the greatest physicians and teachers of the 19th century, was appointed by Thomas Jefferson as the University of Virginia's first Professor of Medicine, a post which he held from 1825 to 1833. He was the first Secretary of the Faculty and its second Chairman. A native of Keswick, England, and a graduate of English and German universities, he was a prolific editor and author of medical works published in Europe and America. Subsequent to 1833 he taught at the University of Maryland, and from 1836 until his death was Professor of Medicine at the Jefferson Medical College of Philadelphia, where he was also Dean of the Faculty. Among his many honors was the vice presidency of the American Philosophical Society. He was personal physician to President Jefferson, President Madison, and President Monroe, and attended the three statesmen in their terminal illnesses.

**Francis Perry Dunnington** (1851-1944), analytical chemist and widely-loved teacher, was born in Baltimore and came to the University of Virginia in 1868, receiving three degrees and remaining there as student, teacher, and public-spirited citizen for the remaining years of his life. He was awarded the Herty Medal for his services to industrial chemistry in the South, and he influenced the agricultural and industrial chemistry of his time through his numerous generations of students. He was long active in the temperance movement in Virginia and in the Y.M.C.A. and the religious life of the University and the community.

**Thomas Fitz Hugh** (1862-1957), Professor of Latin at the University of Virginia for the first quarter of the 20th century, was a native Virginian and received the "Old M. A." degree of the University in 1883. He was subsequently a student at Rome and for three years at the University of Berlin. He was a teacher in Virginia, North Carolina, and Kentucky, and then for 10 years at the University of Texas, before succeeding Colonel William E. Peters in the University of Virginia's Chair of Latin in 1902.

**William Minor Lile** (1859-1935), lawyer, teacher, and Dean of Law, was a native of Alabama. He was educated at private schools and at the University of Virginia, where he received the B.L. degree in 1882, subsequently practicing law in Lynchburg, Virginia with the firm of Kirkpatrick and Blackford and in partnership with Col. R. G. H. Kean. Returning to his alma mater in 1893, he became Professor of Law and later was Dean of Law. In partnership with Charles A. Graves and Judge E. C. Burks of the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals, he was a founder, and long the sole editor, of the Virginia Law Register. He was active in the drafting of the Virginia Constitution of 1902 and was the editor and author of legal works, chiefly in the field of equity procedure.

**Socrates Maupin** (1808-1871), physician, chemist, and teacher, was a native of Virginia and an early graduate of the University of Virginia, where he received the M.D. degree in 1830 and the M.A. in 1833. From 1838 to 1853 he was Professor of Chemistry at the Medical College of Virginia. In 1854 he was appointed Professor at the University of Virginia, becoming Chairman of the Faculty in 1855 and holding both positions until his death. His chairmanship was the longest in the University's history.

**Albert Henry Tuttle** (1844-1927), biologist and teacher, was born in Connecticut, and received his secondary education in the schools of Cleveland, Ohio. He received a B.S. degree at Pennsylvania State College in 1868 before undertaking advanced studies at Harvard, where he was later Instructor in Microscopy, 1872-1874. From 1874 to 1888 he was Professor of Zoology and Comparative Anatomy at Ohio State University. He held the Chair in Biology at the University of Virginia from 1888 until he retired in 1913. He was a fellow and officer of British and American scientific societies, his published books and articles being in the field of bacteriology and histology.

Following his presentation, the President proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution:

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the seven new dormitories now under construction on Alderman Road be and they are hereby named for the following former members of the faculty: Edward Henry Courtenay, Robley Dunglison, Francis Perry Dunnington, Thomas Fitz Hugh, William Minor Lile, Socrates Maupin, and Albert Henry Tuttle.

The President reported that he had also asked the Committee headed by Mr. Gooch, referred to in the preceding entry, to propose a name for the Life Sciences Building which is to house the Departments of Biology and Psychology. The Committee had recommended that the building be named in honor of Francis Walker Gilmer. The President summarized the accomplishments of Mr. Gilmer in the following manner:

**Francis Walker Gilmer** (1790-1826), author, lawyer, and educational diplomatist, is best remembered as the "Father of the Faculty" of the University of Virginia. A native of Albemarle County, Virginia, he took a degree at William and Mary, where he was regarded as a prodigy in learning, before studying law under William Wirt. Thomas Jefferson described him as the "best educated subject we have raised since the Revolution" and predicted he would hold any office he pleased in the State or Federal government. Gilmer's feeble health broke completely during his arduous mission to England to procure the first professors, as well as books and equipment, for the University, in which he was appointed Professor of Law, but died before he could occupy the post. He had a genius for friendship, extraordinary personal charm, and was widely known as an incomparable conversationalist. Aside from legal works, he left two brilliant published volumes, his sparkling Sketches of American Orators and his posthumously published Sketches, Essays and Translations.

Following his presentation, the President proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution:

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the building now under construction to house the Department of Biology and Psychology at the intersection of McCormick Road and Alderman Road be and it is hereby named Gilmer Hall in honor of Francis Walker Gilmer, who was Mr. Jefferson's close associate in the formative period of the University of Virginia and was commissioned by Mr. Jefferson to visit England to engage the first members of the faculty.

The President stated that the Committee headed by Mr. Gooch had also advised him at his request on the naming of the married student housing project now under construction at Copeley Hill. The Committee had notified the President of their belief that the name of Copeley Hill should be preserved and suggested that it be included in the designation. The President therefore proposed to the Board that the name of Copeley Hill Apartments be given to the married student housing buildings.

The following resolution was adopted:

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the buildings to be used for married student housing, the first 14 of which are now under construction at Copeley Hill, be and they are hereby named the Copeley Hill Apartments.

The President reminded the Board of the recent purchase of the property known as Old Ivy Inn and proposed that the main house and the associated structures be named for the late William Faulkner.

The following resolution was adopted:

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the main house and the associated structures previously known as Old Ivy Inn be and they are hereby named William Faulkner House in honor of the late William Faulkner, former Writer-in-Residence and former Balch Lecturer in American Literature at the University.

Upon the unanimous recommendation of the Finance Committee made at its meeting on 19 April 1963, the President presented a proposal to provide a supplementary retirement annuity for the Comptroller, Mr. Vincent Shea, following his retirement under University regulations at the age of 65.

After full discussion, the following resolution was adopted:

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that a supplementary retirement annuity for the Comptroller of the University, Mr. Vincent Shea, be and it is hereby established, effective 1 July 1963, to be administered according to the following provisions: (1) the amount of the annual supplementary retirement benefit shall be $5,000 payable in monthly installments for the remainder of the life of the Comptroller after he retires at the age of 65, (2) upon the death of the Comptroller after retirement, one-half of the annual annuity shall be paid in monthly installments to his widow for the remainder of her life, and (3) if the Comptroller should die prior to retirement at the age of 65, the widow of the Comptroller shall be paid the full annual amount of the annuity in monthly installments until she reaches the age of 65, and, thereafter, she shall receive one-half the annual amount of the annuity in monthly installments for the remainder of her life.

**RESOLVED** that the monies for this purpose shall be paid from the endowment funds of the University, and

**RESOLVED FURTHER** that should the Comptroller leave the employment of the University voluntarily for any reason other than health or incapacity prior to his retirement at the age of 65, the above resolutions shall be null and void and the University shall have no obligation thereunder.

The Rector called to the attention of the Board the recent death of President A. Whitney Griswold of Yale University, an institution with which the University of Virginia has had many close ties as fellow members of the Association of American Universities and in many other happy relationships. He proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution:

**RESOLVED** by The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that in the untimely death of A. Whitney Griswold the world's scholars and the cause of scholarship everywhere have lost a brave and eloquent spokesman. Dedicated to free inquiry, he vigorously supported the dignities of teachers, and boldly defended the right of students to uncensored access to ideas. Selfless in his devotion to Yale University, Mr. Griswold placed all universities in his debt by his reassertion of the meaning of academic freedom. The death of Mr. Griswold deprives us of his counsel but cannot dim the wide and salutary influence he has exerted as a vigilant defender of the search for truth.

It was ordered that copies of the foregoing resolution be sent to Mrs. Griswold and to the Corporation of Yale University.
