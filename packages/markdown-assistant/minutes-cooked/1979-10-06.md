## ATTACHMENT A INTERNAL AUDIT POLICY STATEMENT

### Organizational Responsibilities

### Independence

### Authorities and Limitations

### Systems Planning and Development

### Security Investigations

### Coordination with External Auditing Agencies

### Reporting

### Distribution of Reports

Audits directed to financial accountability will include a review of all records, source data, fiscal procedures and control.

To perform operational audits for the purpose of assuring that University operations are conducted efficiently and in accordance with appropriate and adequately documented policies, plans, and procedures. Operational audits will encompass a review of the policies, plans, procedures, organizational structure, staffing, and output of the audited unit. These audits will be conducted in accordance with the "Guide to Operational Auditing."

To provide senior management with an independent, fair and objective appraisal of the effectiveness of the University's financial accountability systems and operational performance in accordance with the priorities established by the Director of Audits in coordination with the Vice President for Business and Finance and approved by the President and The Board of Visitors.

To provide management with constructive criticism and positive recommendations designed to strengthen and improve performance results and cost effectiveness of their operations.

The following policies identify the responsibilities of the Audit Department and provide guidelines for its interaction with all University departments and activities.

The Director of Audits will coordinate the department's activities with the Vice President for Business and Finance. The Director will have unrestricted access and be responsible to the President and The Board of Visitors. He is responsible for the direction of the audit function and for seeing that the results of examinations and actions taken are communicated to appropriate levels of University management and, as appropriate, the President and The Board of Visitors.

The Director of Audits, with participation by the Vice President for Business and Finance, will draft an annual audit plan. The plan will be submitted to the President and The Board of Visitors for review and suggested changes in scope.

The Audit Department will give full consideration to scheduling special audit requests made by any department or activity. All requests should be in writing to the Director of Audits and state the purpose and scope of the audit.

The Audit Department will be organizationally and functionally independent from all University operations and will have no responsibility for the departments and activities being audited while being responsive to their needs and requirements.

Because the Audit Department must be independent in carrying out its responsibility to monitor and evaluate control procedures instituted by management, the extent of audit work to be performed with respect to those procedures is limited to the assessment of such procedures.

The Audit Department normally performs tests of underlying records and documentary support for transactions. Accordingly, objectivity would be lost if the Audit Department participated in accumulating data or reconstructing records.

The Audit Department personnel will have complete, free, and unrestricted access to all University departments, activities, records, properties, and personnel, and is not to be restricted in their activities. Where appropriate, special arrangements will be made for the examination of confidential information.

The Audit Department will participate in the planning, development, implementation, and modification of major computer-based and manual systems to insure that (a) adequate controls are incorporated in the system; (b) thorough system testing is performed at appropriate stages; (c) system documentation is complete and accurate; and (d) the resultant system is a complete and accurate implementation of the system specifications.

The Audit Department will conduct post installation evaluations of major data processing systems to assure that these systems meet their intended purpose and objectives. The department will also review computer operations supporting such systems to assure that generally accepted standards for systems integrity and security, as well as system-specific controls, are being observed.

The Audit and University Police Departments are to be notified if assets have been lost through defalcation or other security breaches. The Audit Department will perform sufficient tests and investigations to identify the weaknesses in procedures which permitted the defalcation to occur. However, the investigation of the specific event with the objective of recovery and/or prosecution is the responsibility of the University Police Department, with the decision to prosecute being the responsibility of the appropriate Commonwealth's Attorney.

The Director of Audits will coordinate the department's audit efforts with those of the University's independent public accountants or other external auditing agencies by participating in the planning and definition of the scope of proposed audits so the work of all auditing groups is complementary, and their combined efforts provide comprehensive, cost-effective audit coverage for the University. Duplication of work will be avoided as much as possible.

Prior to the completion of a formal report, an exit conference will be conducted with the department or activity head. The conference will be a review of all findings, conclusions, and recommendations.

A formal report will be issued at the conclusion of every audit which will present a concise, clear and factual review of the conditions found, together with recommendations for improvement.

A memorandum shall be issued to the Director of Audits within 60 days responding to each finding, recommendation, and exception included in the audit report. This memorandum will include the department's or activity's plan for implementing the recommendations or a presentation of significant disagreement with the findings and/or recommendations.

A follow-up review will be made by the Audit Department to establish that agreed-to recommendations have been adopted. A memorandum will be issued on the follow-up review to the President and Vice President for Business and Finance.

Audit reports will be issued to the Vice President responsible for the department or activity involved. In addition, copies of all such reports will be distributed to the President, the Vice President for Business and Finance, and the senior fiscal administrator having a functional interest in the subject matter.

All audit reports will be available for review by The Board of Visitors.

A summary of significant audit findings will be prepared annually and submitted to The Board of Visitors, the President, and the Vice President for Business and Finance.
