Lieutenant Walter R. Luoma appointed Associate Professor of Naval Science, effective in August, 1952, at no salary from the University. This is a replacement for Lt. Comdr. J. B. Burnett, who is being transferred.

The Board approved an increase in the charge for "The Cavalier Daily" from $4 per session to $5 per session, effective in September, 1952.

Mr. Gay, Chairman of the Finance Committee, presented a letter which he had addressed to the Bursar, proposing a procedure for handling endowment funds under the act of the Legislature of 1952 freeing from the State's budgetary control the principal and income of all donations to State educational institutions received after January 1, 1952. The text of the letter is as follows:

I have delayed answering your letter of the 5th, the contents of which I discussed with you and Messrs. Mears and Talbott after the last meeting of the Board, until I could obtain copies of Regulation F promulgated by the Federal Reserve System for the guidance of national banks administering "common trust" funds. I have now obtained a copy of the pamphlet containing this regulation and enclose it herewith.

You will find this subject treated as Section 17 page 12 et seq. and I believe you will find the pertinent provisions embodied in subparagraph (c)(4) at page 15, dealing with the periodic determination of the value of assets in such a fund.

I have also discussed this matter at some length with Mr. Burrell Gunn, Vice President and Trust Officer of the State-Planters Bank and Trust Company, who is conversant with the provisions of Regulation F and the method of its application and operation. He gives me the following very simple illustration:

Assume there are two original participants who put in $10,000 each.

So long as the common fund continues in this status the income is divided by 20 units to determine the amount to be distributed to the owner of each unit. But assume that a year later, or on some quarterly period when a valuation is had, the investments in the common trust fund are at market worth $25,000. Each unit is therefore then worth $1,250, but there are still only 20 units.

At this point C contributes $10,000 to the common fund. If he were issued 10 units, the interest of A and B, the original participants, would be diluted as follows:

To state it a little differently, C will immediately realize a profit of $166.66 upon each $1,000 contribution made by him and A and B, the old members, will suffer a proportionate reduction in their unit values.

To correct such an inequity, the provisions of Section (c)(4) of the Regulation contemplate quarterly valuations, or, more specifically, at the time any new funds are admitted, by dividing the number of units then outstanding into the then established market value, and in this manner determine the then value of each unit.

Using the above illustration, we had a $1,250 valuation for each of the original 20 units contributed by A and B - reflecting their value of the total fund value of $25,000 on the date of the valuation. When C contributes his $10,000 as of the valuation date, we have a fund of $35,000, and as a simple matter of arithmetic the $10,000 which he contributes would represent 8 units of valuation of $1,250 each. So that thereafter the respective contributors would own units and receive proportionate distributions of income as follows.

I take it from your letter that you can and will set up such a system of accounting, and it might be well to determine in advance that all new funds received after January 1, 1952, would be held and turned over quarterly to the Bank for investment in the common fund - you making, with the Bank's assistance, a valuation of the fund as of each quarterly date, and thereby determining the periodic value of each unit and the participating value on a unit basis of the new funds currently contributed.

From the December 25, 1951 statement of the Bank, the aggregate market value of the Consolidated Fund was $6,444,134.27. If we employ $10,000 as a suitable unit value, there existed in the Fund at that time approximately 645 units of the value of $10,000 each, and all future contributions of funds in units of, say $10,000 each, would acquire a participating unit value on the basis of the aggregate market value of the fund at the time of their contribution in the manner heretofore outlined.

Our Committee has no doubt of the authority of the Board to merge all funds and treat them as a common trust fund, and to segregate income between (1) units represented in the value of the fund as of December 25, 1951, and (2) the units contributed to the common fund subsequent to that date, on a unit basis.

"The formal courses now offered carry out the intent of the Board. More, however, needs to be done to attain the end of giving general enrichment to the cultural life of the University community. In order to do this two things are necessary.

First, there are needed as professors artists who not only know the techniques of their profession but who also have a sound academic background and a wide knowledge and critical appreciation of the place of art in western civilization. It is not enough to be merely a professional painter or sculptor.

The teaching of the various courses can and should be improved. The opportunity to achieve this end is at hand by the selection of men to replace Messrs. Carter and Johnson.

Second, opportunity must be given the Division of Art to extend its influence to the student body. This can be done by seminars and discussions open to the public, by exhibitions and demonstrations by members of the staff, by exhibitions of student work, by talks by visiting artists, and by movies illustrating working methods employed by well-known artists. Such materials are all available either free or at a moderate rental.

This program is not possible under present lack of suitable space and equipment. With the completion of the new Academic Building, space should be provided in Cocke Hall or elsewhere to furnish the adequate quarters without which a good program cannot succeed.

The committees which have been studying the whole matter have aimed at carrying out the wishes of the Board to provide (a) elementary art courses to undergraduate students in the College for elective credit, and (b) advanced courses in art to art majors. Both objectives have been attained.

In order to set up conditions under which work on art would develop, the committee recommended to the Faculty and the Faculty accepted the division of the McIntire School of Fine Arts (excluding Music, which has an independent status) into two divisions, each with its own chairman and its own program of studies. The Division of Architecture is currently under the chairmanship of Mr. Disque, and the Division of Art under Mr. Smith.

The courses in Art are given as listed in the Catalogue with two modifications. Art 1-2. General Art, has been reorganized in such a way that the course is given not by Mr. Smith alone but by members of the staff. It is divided into three studio groups, one of painting, one of sculpture, and one of graphic arts including drawing. This course is intended for students without previous training and serves in addition as instruction to help the student select the field in which he wishes to concentrate. The other change is merely introductory to a new course on Architecture and Arts in the Far East for which there has been considerable demand.

The slowness of Art to develop a program more widely selected by students is due to two factors: first, the reorganization carrying out the wishes of the Board has been so recent that there has been not yet time to build up a good body of students taking these courses. The second handicap has been inadequate quarters, aggravated by the fact, as pointed out by Mr. Johnson, that at least one of the studios was so cold that classes frequently could not be held there at all. The chief trouble came with the studio of sculpture.

It is my opinion that Mr. Smith should be continued in the chairmanship until he has a better opportunity to prove himself. It was remarked to him by a former member of the staff that he was beginning with two strikes against him, the strikes being Messrs. Carter and Johnson, both capable artists but lacking in the background which is absolutely necessary for good work at the college level. Mr. Smith realizes what fine possibilities there are and I believe that he is the man to get ahead with the program.

Mr. Smith is a well-known artist in his own right in more than one field, he has had successful teaching experience elsewhere and knows thoroughly what can be done with art as a cultural college subject.

The criticism raised by Mr. Johnson is, in my opinion, absolutely unwarranted. It is true that Mr. Smith, although he has worked in the modern fields, has a deep appreciation and a good knowledge of classic art. In my opinion, it would be a primary error to have anyone head the Division of Art who knows and values only the modern techniques and the modern approach. The students certainly should know the different brands of bizarre and tortured art about which there is so much stir in the Richmond papers. If the chairman of the department, however, should confine himself to the modern movements such as cubism, surrealism, abstractionism and all the rest and to regard as outdated and of no consequence the work of Michelangelo, Rembrandt, Raphael, Da Vinci and the great masters of the past, it would be simply silly. It would be like having the School of Music devoted to jungle music and the blues, ignoring Bach, Beethoven, Mozart and the great masters of music. Mr. Smith, while a modernist himself, has a deep appreciation of the classical tradition. This is as it should be.

I have been very much pleased with the way Mr. Smith has taken hold. I have already mentioned some handicaps and would add to this the fact that he has taken over the directorship of the Press to the detriment of his major function. I think we ought to give him the opportunity to develop Art as a college subject with such space and facilities as the University can afford. I feel that he has already proved himself and I respect his judgment in moving to replace the gentlemen whose training he considers to be inadequate while admitting their technical skill.

I recommend that Mr. Smith be continued at least for the present in the chairmanship.
