Upon being informed by the Rector of the death on 23 February 1957 of Dowell Jennings Howard, State Superintendent of Public Instruction and a member of this Board since 1949, the Board resolved by unanimous vote that a special committee be appointed to draft a resolution in his memory. The Rector accordingly appointed the following committee: Mr. Berkeley, Mr. Darden, Mr. Smith, Chairman.

President Darden announced to the Board the deaths of Fredrick Charles Disque, former Professor of Architecture, on February 23rd, and of Duncan Clark Hyde, Professor of Economics, on February 26th. Mr. Hyde had served on the faculty since 1929 and Mr. Disque had served, with some interruptions, from 1930 until he retired in 1956.

There were expressions of the affection and esteem in which Professors Disque and Hyde were held, and the Secretary was directed to record in the permanent minutes the deep sense of loss felt by the Board, and the gratitude of the Visitors for their devoted and valuable services to the University.

The Rector reminded the Board that the next meeting, which would normally fall on April 13th, is to be held in Fredericksburg on April 27th.

President Darden read to the Board the following letter and displayed to the Visitors an enclosed plat:

At our regular Council meeting held on January 7, 1957 I presented the plan which I discussed with you on December 24, for the widening of Jefferson Park Avenue from its intersection with Main Street back to the Hospital entrance.

The Council unanimously agreed that the project was needed to help take care of the very heavy flow of traffic at that intersection. They appropriated $20,000.00 for this work and instructed me to request the University's permission to go ahead with the widening of the street on the West side as shown on the attached plan.

As explained to you the City will construct a rock retaining wall from Main Street to the C\&O bridge and will remove only those trees which are absolutely necessary and as were pointed out to you on the ground. The curb and gutter will be replaced South of the bridge and the bank sloped and reseeded. A new sidewalk will be constructed on the East side of Jefferson Park Avenue opposite where the widening takes place.

Please note that we show on the plan a small amount of widening South of the Hospital entrance. We feel this would make the street safer at this point and we feel that this should be done at the same time if you agree.

We will appreciate very much your securing the approval of the Board on the project which will be very beneficial to both the City and the University.

With kindest regards, I am

***

Enclosed is a copy of the proposal of the Committee on Private Practice of the Clinical Staff of the Medical School. This proposal has been reviewed by the Dean and approved by him, and I went over it yesterday with Dr. Vest.

The basic change in the proposal is a lift of the maximum compensation by 12 1/2%. Hence, a doctor receiving $20,000 would go to $22,500 and one receiving $15,000 would go to $16,875.

There is one further change in the distribution of surplus. At the present time, this is divided 40% to the doctors, 40% to the Research and Development Fund, and 20% to departmental reserve. They are proposing that this split be 50 - 30 - 20, subject to the reservation that under no circumstances will the Research and Development Fund be less than $40,000 per year.

With the increase in limits of 12 1/2%, I do not believe the change from 40 to 50 in the distribution will result in any increase above the amount these men are now receiving from the distribution of surplus.

If you approve of this plan, and it seems quite reasonable to me, it will require the approval of the Board before it can be put into effect.

You will recall that before you left for your trip around the world I mentioned that the Committee on Contractual Relations was considering a new type of insurance provided by the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association.

Very briefly, this program would be added to the present Blue Cross-Blue Shield coverage. There would be a $100 amount which the individual would have to pay, similar to that provided in automobile collision policies, after which the major medical insurance would pay 80% of all costs up to $15,000 per illness, with the subscriber paying the other 20%. The sharing of cost is deliberate in the program to prevent excessive charges.

Should the Board be willing to pay one-half the cost, an individual faculty member, unmarried, would have to pay 82¢ per month, a married faculty member, with or without children, would pay $2.12 per month or roughly $25 a year.

The cost to the University, should all faculty members and administrators of grade 8 or above participate, (the same group covered by our group insurance program) would amount to $8,820 per year.

I should like to recommend very strongly that the Board underwrite one-half the cost of this program. Should the Board approve, it would still require participation by 75% of those eligible.
