A motion was made and passed that the August meeting of the Board be omitted.

Mr. W. Allan Perkins, Attorney for the University, appeared before the Board and presented a form of receipt and release prepared by Bankers Trust Company of New York as Trustee under an indenture of trust executed by Christopher Gustavus Memminger, dated June 2, 1927, as amended by an instrument dated May 26, 1928.

Attached to this receipt and release is a statement showing the account of Bankers Trust Company as such Trustee, covering the period from June 2, 1927, date of trust, through February 4, 1949.

Mr. Perkins stated that this account had been sent to the Finance Committee of this Board on or about April 4, 1949, had been referred by Mr. Barron F. Black, then chairman of the Finance Committee, to him for advice as to whether the account was in proper shape, and that he had then, with the approval and consent of Mr. Black and Mr. Darden as President of the University, referred the account to Mr. J. Gordon Bennett, Auditor of Public Accounts. Mr. Bennett either went to New York himself or sent representatives there, made a thorough audit of Bankers Trust Company as Trustee of this trust, and on June 24, 1949, made a report on said audit, copy of which is herewith presented to this Board for filing in the office of the Bursar.

Attached to this report is a letter from Mr. Bennett as Auditor, addressed to Mr. Perkins as Attorney for the University, dated July 1, 1949, stating that in his opinion the receipt and release in form submitted by Bankers Trust Company is in proper form for execution on behalf of the University.

Upon motion of Mrs. Willis, seconded by Mr. Mears, it was, thereupon,

**RESOLVED** that Barron F. Black, Rector of the University, be and is hereby authorized and directed to execute this receipt and release in the name of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, in the form submitted to this meeting by Mr. Perkins, and that Vincent Shea, Secretary of this Board, shall affix the corporate seal thereto and attest the same, and when said receipt and release is properly executed that it shall be delivered to Mr. Perkins and sent by him to Bankers Trust Company for attention of J. D. McLanahan, Trust Officer of that Company.

The Board established a policy of recording in its minutes the resolution passed by the faculty upon the retirement or death of a faculty member, which resolution would be transmitted to the retiring faculty member or to his family upon his death.

Further consideration was had of the location of the Women's Dormitory. The matter was referred to the Buildings and Grounds Committee with the request that prompt action be taken.

The President presented a resolution which had been adopted by the Medical Faculty on the retirement of Dr. Harvey Ernest Jordan. The Board noted approval of the resolution.

The Board approved relocation of the Men's Dormitories, lowering the level of the site and moving the dormitories so as to preserve the trees. Plans for the Physics Buildings, Cancer Building, and Kitchen Wing of the Hospital were approved.

The Rector reported that the Executive Committee of the Development Fund had been unable to meet prior to this date, but that the Committee would meet about July 20. A financial report to June 30, 1949 was presented to the Board.

The President reported that meetings held on this subject by Virginia institutions had resulted in no decisions. To date William and Mary, the University of Richmond, and Washington and Lee have agreed to comply.

A motion was passed calling for a special meeting of the Board to discuss the matter, to be held at 2 p.m. on Thursday, July 21, in Mr. Gay's office in Richmond.

The Board considered a proposal to sell a portion of the Seward Forest holdings known as the William Gillis place. President Darden advised the Board that Mr. W. Allan Perkins, Attorney for the University, had ruled that such sale would be legal, stating that similar sales had been made in the past, as had purchases of additional land to better consolidate the holdings of the Seward Forest. The following resolution was adopted.

**RESOLVED** that the President be and is hereby authorized to sign a contract selling to the highest bidder a part of the Seward Forest holdings in Brunswick County, known as the William Gillis tract, consisting of fifty-four (54) acres fronting on Halifax Road.

Dr. Combs said that he regretted to report the sudden death of Dr. Roy S. Cook, Professor of Chemistry and Head of the Department. Dr. Cook joined the faculty in 1916 and had the longest tenure of anyone on the faculty. He was an excellent teacher, a loyal and devoted member of the faculty and the College has sustained an irreparable loss in his death.

On recommendation of Dr. Combs, the Board approved the following promotion

Dr. Earl G. Insley from Associate Professor to Professor of Chemistry and head of the Department of Chemistry, at a session salary of $5,200.

The following resolution was adopted.

**RESOLVED** that the College be and is hereby authorized, subject to the approval of the Governor, to purchase the Beck property, located at the West entrance of the campus, consisting of a modern residence and three lots, to be paid for from operating funds of the institution at a price not to exceed $35,000.

The budget for the year 1949-50 was approved as presented by President Combs.

The Mary Washington Committee was asked to make an investigation at Mary Washington College, looking into (a) the quality of the faculty; (b) the teaching load of the faculty, (c) the housing facilities and food service provided students at the College.

On motion the meeting then adjourned.
