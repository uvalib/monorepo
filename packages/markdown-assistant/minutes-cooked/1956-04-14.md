RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the election of Dr. Walter Henry Puterbaugh, Jr., as Assistant Professor of Chemistry, acted on at the February 4, 1956, meeting of the Board, be and it is hereby cancelled since Mr. Puterbaugh has decided not to accept the position.

President Darden laid before the Board Uncollectible Accounts Schedule #5 as compiled by the Assistant Bursar and reviewed and approved by the Accounts Committee. The President pointed out that these accounts consist largely of theoretical balances accruing as excess charges against Virginia students under a liberal arrangement set up by the Veterans Administration. After discussion the Board adopted the following resolution:

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the Committee on Student Accounts be and it is hereby authorized to charge off as uncollectible Accounts Schedule #5, aggregating $30,351.38, as recommended by it.

The President laid before the Board and discussed the following letter:

As an admirer of Senator Harry Flood Byrd of Virginia, I should like to see a fund or endowment established at the University of Virginia in recognition of his conspicuous service to our country, especially in the field of public finance.

In order to inaugurate such a fund, and in consideration of its acceptance, I submit the following proposal:

I will personally give to the University, or cause to be given through a corporation of which I am president, a sum of not less than $2,500.00 nor more than $5,000.00 a year for the next five years, the first payment to be made immediately upon approval by you of the following conditions and subsequent annual payments to be made between November 1st and January 31st, next ensuing.

(a) The fund shall be used presently as a student loan fund for the Graduate School of Business Administration and shall be known as "The Harry Flood Byrd Loan Fund"

(b) The fund shall be handled and administered by such agencies of the University as the Board of Visitors may from time to time designate.

(c) The fund shall be open for additional contributions from other admirers of Senator Byrd and of the University of Virginia.

(d) If and when a Chair of Public Finance should be endowed in your School of Business Administration in honor of Senator Byrd, my contributions may be transferred to that endowment fund.

This proposal has been submitted to President Darden and I am advised it meets with his approval. Senator Byrd has also expressed his approval and has consented that his name may be used for the fund.

The Board thereupon resolved (1) that there be created the Harry Flood Byrd Loan Fund in the Graduate School of Business Administration in accordance with the terms set forth above in Mr. Rubin's letter, and (2) that the Secretary be directed to convey to Mr. Rubin the warm thanks of the Visitors for his generous initiative in inaugurating the Fund and his proposed gifts for its development.

On the recommendation of President Darden, the Board resolved to confirm its decision of 11 May 1951 not to oppose a proposed petition to Charlottesville City Council by Mr. E. R. Porter for the re-zoning of his property near Venable Lane, south of Jefferson Park Avenue, to permit his construction of a combination drug store and grocery store, it being understood that Mr. Porter would provide adequate off-street parking space and make his building conform architecturally to University construction.

President Darden presented the following letter from the University Comptroller on behalf of the Scholarship Committee:

We now have one hundred (100) Regional Scholarships for Virginians, which the Scholarship Committee feels is quite adequate. However, funds for out-of-state regionals have been very limited and the Scholarship Committee has been most anxious to find ways of increasing the number of these awards, for the following reasons

1. The duPont funds came from a nonresident of the State, and
2. The committee feels that the student body will be strengthened by a sprinkling of outstanding boys from other states who would not otherwise be able to attend the University.

Last year and again this year we have received a substantial extra dividend from the duPont Trust. While this money could be spent over a period of years, the committee would like to be assured of a more permanent income for these awards.

If you agree, I would appreciate your bringing to the Board the proposal that the present accumulation of approximately $200,000 be reinvested.

It is contemplated that we would ask the Alumni in various cities to help us in selecting the recipients. We are experimenting this year in Charleston, West Virginia and in Birmingham, Alabama, and the plan has been greeted with considerable enthusiasm by Alumni chapters in these cities.

During the discussion that followed, Colonel Hartfield and Mr. Pollock suggested that the Scholarship Committee give consideration to permitting Virginia students an opportunity to compete for the proposed additional out-of-state scholarships, President Darden said that he would bring this proposal to the attention of the Scholarship Committee for consideration.

The Board thereupon resolved that the Comptroller be authorized to reinvest the accumulation of approximately $200,000, the income to be used for the purposes set forth above in the Comptroller's letter of March 5th.

The President presented the following letter from Mr. Shea:

Mr. Runk and I have discussed various ways of operating the Cavalier Daily. It is our opinion that it would be unwise to discontinue the current support of the Daily by an assessment against the student body. The reason the fee was initially instituted was because student subscriptions were limited largely to entering students and one or two subscriptions per fraternity house. The older boys just would not subscribe sufficiently to cover the operating cost.

It is our recommendation, if you agree, that the Board of Visitors be asked to discontinue the practice of earmarking $4.00 of the $5.00 student publication fee for the Daily and place the entire $5.00 under the control of the Student Activities Committee, which you have recently appointed.

Under such a plan the Cavalier Daily, like any other student activity, would have to justify the amount needed to run the Daily by submitting to the committee a budget of salaries and expenditures, and the amount allocated would be limited to that actually needed. The committee could thus disapprove expensive parties, and large salaries and bonuses to staff members of the Daily. Any saving from the $4.00 per student being currently allocated to the Daily would, thus, be available to support other worthwhile student activities.

After discussion the Board resolved: (1) that the present practice of earmarking $4.00 of the publication fee for the Cavalier Daily and the remaining $1.00 for other student activities be discontinued, and (2) that the entire fee of $5.00 be allocated to the Cavalier Daily and to other student activities by the Student Activities Committee, which shall be charged with authority and responsibility, under the President, to review and approve budgets submitted by the Cavalier Daily and other student activities.

President Darden reported an application from a Negro student, Alphonso Edward Nichols, Jr., of Newport News, Virginia, for admission as a Pre-Medical student in the College of Arts and Sciences. The President said that Mr. Nichols ranks ninth in his class of 192 at Huntington High School and is well qualified for admission.

Mr. Darden pointed out that all of the twenty-two Negro students who are at present enrolled in the University are in graduate and professional schools pursuing specialized studies for which no provision is made in State-supported Virginia institutions for Negroes. The recent decision of the Courts relative to the University of North Carolina, Mr. Darden noted, appeared to make Mr. Nichols' admission legally obligatory on him; but he was bringing this case before the Board because Mr. Nichols, if admitted, would be the first Negro student in the College.

During the extensive discussion that followed, President Darden observed that a case could be made that adequate pre-medical education is not provided by Virginia in a Negro institution, and that he was prepared to admit Mr. Nichols on this ground, thus putting his admission in the same status as that of other Negro students now in the University. Several Visitors argued, however, that this technicality should be avoided, and that, in view of the present concern of the government of Virginia with the related problem in the public schools, the Board ought not to act hastily without consulting higher authority in Richmond. Others felt that the position of the University higher education and the clarity of the legal precedents demanded a prompt decision.

On motion of Judge Smith, seconded by Mr. Gravatt, the Board resolved that action on Mr. Nichols' application be deferred until the Annual Meeting on June 16th, that the President shall in the meantime consult with the Governor and the Attorney General, and that the Rector appoint a special committee of Visitors to participate with the President in this conference.

Judge Bryan and Mr. Pollock asked that their negative votes be recorded.

Mr. McWane noted that he had voted for the resolution out of deference to the present related problems of the Governor, but that he wanted to make clear his opinion that the Board ought to take a definite stand on this matter no later than June.

President Darden and Judge Smith led a discussion of the two-year college in Northern Virginia provided for by the General Assembly of Virginia in contemplation of its becoming a part of the University as proposed by the Board of Visitors' resolution of 14 January 1955.

On motion of Miss Wheeler, seconded by Mrs. Jones, the Board resolved: (1) that the President be authorized to proceed with the planning and preparatory work for the operation of the two-year college on Northern Virginia as a branch of the University of Virginia, and (2) that the President be assisted on the choice of a site for the college by a special committee of Visitors to be named by the Rector.

The President laid before the Board the following letter:

Confirming our conversation of this morning, we welcome the opportunity to advise that the layout and design of the proposed Children's Rehabilitation Center has been approved without qualification by representatives of the Clinical Departments most concerned with the project, the Departments of Nursing Service, Occupational Therapy, Physical Therapy, Dietary, and the Hospital Administration. It is the impression of all concerned that the building as designed is adequate and admirably suited for the contemplated Children's Rehabilitation Program. Functionally, it will provide for efficient operation both from a clinical and administrative standpoint. The plans have also received favorable review by informed individuals not connected with the University who have had extensive experience in Children's Rehabilitation in the various specialized areas such as clinical care, therapy, nursing and administration.

Mr. Darden reported that the Art Commission had been critical of the proximity of the proposed building to a bank, but said that this was one of the results of the functional requirement of a one-story building: there had also, he said, been criticisms of the modern design of the plans (already approved by the Board) though he felt personally that the distance from the University prevented a discordant effect.

The Board resolved that the President be authorized to proceed with the construction of the building on the proposed site as presently planned.

The President laid before the Board University Hospital accounts Schedules 578, 581, 582, 587, 590, 591, 595, 598, and 599, aggregating $93,146.05, as submitted by the Credit Manager and reviewed and certified by the Hospital Accounts Committee to the President with a recommendation for charging off.

After discussion and questions by new members of the Board, it was ordered that a decision be deferred until June, the Rector in the meantime to appoint a special committee to consult with the Hospital Accounts Committee and obtain detailed information on the problem for the information of the Board.

The following letter was laid before the Board by President Darden:

The University Sports Club would like for you to request permission of the Board for the Club to conduct sports car trials on Observatory Mountain sometime early next fall.

The officers assured me that all precautions for safety were required by the Sports Car Club of America, of which the University Club is a member, such as the wearing of safety belts, helmets and the placing of bales of straw on the curves. No races would be conducted by only time trials by individual cars. Participants must be 21 years of age before being eligible to compete, which would eliminate the majority of our students.

After discussion the Board resolved that the University Sports Club be authorized to proceed with the trials, it being understood that the Club would observe the precautions set forth in Mr. Shea's letter.
