The Board having received an oral communication from the Faculty through Prof Holcombe in reference to the instruction given last year to the Faculty to employ a competent Bibliographer to prepare a Catalogue of such books as are needed to make the Library worthy of the University, and understanding from this communication that each Professor is prepared to report such a list in his own department, it is

**Resolved** that the several Professors be requested to prepare such lists to be first approved by the Faculty & then reported to the Board at its next meeting and that the former resolution be rescinded.

1. **Resolved** that any person of unexceptionable character & habits, upon producing to the Faculty satisfactory evidence of suitable capacity & attainments shall be licensed by the Faculty to form classes for private instruction in any school of the University in aid of, & conformity to, the public teaching of the professor upon any subject taught therein.

3. **Resolved** The resolutions adopted on this subject on the 28th June 1856 are rescinded.

A letter from Wm. C. Rives Esqr to the Rector, & a letter from Philip St. G. Cocke Esqr to Mr. Rives and relating to Mr Cocke's proposed donation of twenty thousand dollars for the establishment of a School of Agriculture having been laid before the Board, the following resolutions were adopted:

1. **Resolved** unanimously that the Board inferring from the letters of Mr Rives & Mr Cocke that the resolutions adopted by the Board on the 11th day of February, 1857, have been understood as expressing the opinion that the proposition then before them was not liable to any other objection than that indicated in said resolutions, think it proper to declare that the Board did not intend to be understood as expressing any opinion on that subject, deeming it sufficient to confine themselves to the ground then mentioned as conclusive in their opinion against the acceptance of said proposition.

2. **Resolved** that while the Board are still disposed as declared in the resolutions above referred to, to cooperate in the establishment of a school of Agriculture in the University upon a liberal deal, they do not think proper to recommend to the Legislature such a change in the existing laws as to authorize the acceptance of the proposed donation upon the conditions attached,,& the Board being themselves called upon by the letters of Mr. Rives & Mr Cocke to express a more definite opinion upon the subject declare their opinion to be that such a change would materially impair the unity of government established over the University, the maintenance of which they regard as essential to its best interests, & that the acceptance of said donation upon the conditions proposed would be inexpedient if the laws were so changed as to authorize it.

A memorial from the Faculty in relation to the compensation of the Professors having been read, on motion of Mr Robertson , the following Resolution was adopted

**Resolved** That each member of the Faculty be requested to state whether or not he concurs in all the views & opinions expressed in their memorial in reference to salaries, & if he does not in what respect, & to what extent, he differs from those views & opinions, or any of them.

**Noes**, Messrs. Robertson, Garnett, Baldwin, Joynes, & Randolph

Mr. Garnett then moved to fill the blank with $2000, the question being put, upon Mr. Garnett's motion, it was determined in the Affirmative.

Mr. Joynes offered the following preamble & resolution:

**Resolved** Professor Harrison, having appeared before the Board, & having informed the Board, in reply to inquiries propounded to him, that he understands the arrangement made with him at the meeting in May, 1856, has the effect of a Contract between himself & the University & as to deprive the Board of the right without the violation of good faith to change the compensation, provided by said arrangement, & yet that he is at liberty at any time to leave the University upon the terms prescribed by the enactments without being restrained to any extent by the terms of the said arrangement. And this Board being unwilling to acquiesce in any construction of their relations with any Professor of the University, which would limit or impair the right of the Board, at its discretion to regulate his compensation, but being disposed to assert this right, without injustice or surprise to Professor Harrison, it is therefore declared That the Board considers itself at liberty at any future meeting to make such changes in the Compensation of Professor Harrison, or of any other Professor, as in its judgment the interests of the University may require. The Ayes & Noes being required on the foregoing Preamble & resolution, the vote resulted as follows:

**Resolved** That the Executive Committee be authorized to fill any vacancy in the office of Librarian by an appointment to continue until the meeting of the Board next after such appointment.

On motion of Mr. Robertson it was

**Resolved** That the salary of the Proctor be fixed for the present at the rate of two thousand dollars per annum.

**Resolved** That an additional assistant be appointed in the school of Mathematics - with the declaration that the Board expects the Professor to lecture to each class in his school, & has assistants to be employed in the examination & exercising of his classes.

Francis Cabell of Nelson County, with the request that he discharge the trust confided to Mr. Holcombe, in reference to said papers.

On motion of Mr. Baldwin, it was

The Rector laid before the Board a communication from Professor Harrison in response to the resolution of the Board adopted at the present meeting in relation to his Compensation, which Communication was ordered to be spread upon the Journal & thereupon it was

**Resolved** That the Board take pleasure in assuring Professor Harrison that they had not the least intention in the adoption of the said resolutions to wound his feelings, or to do, or say anything inconsistent with the high respect to which he is entitled, & which they fully accord to him.

2. **Resolved** That it was not the purpose of the Board to imply (for it would have been contrary to the fact) that Professor Harrison had in any respect volunteered to come before them, or to assert any construction of the arrangement referred to in the said resolutions.

3. **Resolved** That while the Board feel bound in justice to Dr. Harrison to make the foregoing declarations, they deem it proper at the same time to repeat the assertion of the right & duty of the Board to regulate the compensation of Dr. Harrison, as well as that of any Professor, according to their own views of policy & justice. But the Board do not wish to be understood, as implying any purpose, to change or not to change the compensation of Dr. Harrison, or any other Professor; their exclusive object being to declare the principle asserted in their former resolutions.

The following is copy of Professor Harrison's communication referred to in the foregoing resolutions.

> *After carefully considering the Preamble & Resolution of the Board adopted in regard to my relations to the University in the matter of Compensation, I am obliged to say that they have caused me very great pain, & have left me in serious doubt as to the purposes of the Board, so far as they may be gathered from the Preamble & Resolution themselves. They seem to me to be at least strongly suggestive of a future too uncertain to be relied on, while the preamble places me in the most unenviable aspect before the Board, as coming voluntarily before them to assert rights, on my part, & deny rights on theirs, & in a way that disconnected from the circumstances & qualifications does hardly do me justice. Having these views & feeling, I have considered it right, & a duty to myself respectfully to request the Board to say if they should think fit whether it is their purpose to give me warning of the insecurity of the provision made for any compensation, & of the revocation of the arrangement with me to the effect of denying the instance of any fair right on my part to expect it to continue substantially in existence, or whether I may understand that apart from all technical interpretations, I may look for the continuance of the arrangement so long as the policy of the University, or the Conduct of the Professor shall not demand a change.*

On motion of Mr Robertson it was

**Resolved** That the Executive Committee be authorized to cause to be constructed on a plan to be suggested by Mr. J. D'Alfonce, & Mr. Pratt, & approved by the Executive Committee a winter gymnasium at a cost not exceeding fifteen hundred dollars.

On motion of Mr. Joynes it was

**Resolved** That the sum of one hundred dollars be paid to Mr. Duke, the secretary of the Board, for extra services during the last twelve months, but this is not to be understood as embracing his services in revising the enactments.

On motion of Mr. Robertson it was

**Resolved** That the Executive Committee be authorized to pay to Mr. Pratt a reasonable compensation for the services which have been rendered by him under the request of the Executive Committee to submit a plan for the enlargement of the University.

**Resolved** that a sum not exceeding four hundred dollars be appropriated to the enlargement & repair of the Kitchen attached to the pavilion of Professor Minor, & a sum not exceeding two hundred dollars to the renewal of the porch in the rear of the same pavilion, to be expended under the direction of the Executive Committee.

Messrs. Robertson, Baldwin & Randolph are appointed the Executive Committee.

On motion of Mr. Baldwin, it was

**Resolved** That in the opinion of this Board it is inexpedient for the University to undertake the building of additional dormitories, or boarding houses for the accommodation of students, unless & until it shall appear that suitable & sufficient accommodations will not be afforded by private enterprise on reasonable terms, & that it is the true policy of the University to confine its operations in building to such edifices as shall be required for the accommodation of its Professors, or for public purposes.

On motion of Mr. Robertson, it was

**Resolved** That the Executive Committee be authorized to cause a lightning rod & a Venetian door to be put to the pavilion occupied by Professor Davis.

**Resolved** That the Proctor be instructed to take steps at once to enforce a Compliance in all respects with the Contract for the building of the addition to the pavilion, occupied by Professor Davis.

The Board having dispatched all the business before it, at one o'clock A.M. adjourned sine die.
