Mr Garnett submitted the following resolution in relation to the resignation of Dr Harrison which was adopted.

The Board of Visitors has received Dr. Harrison's resignation with sincere regret at the severance of his connection with the University which he has faithfully served for more than 30 years of ever-increasing usefulness. To the highest moral worth, he has added a profound scholarship which has done honor to the University of which he was an Alumnus and Professor, and has cultivated the taste for classical learning, revolutionized methods of instruction, and raised the standard of attainments.

The Secretary of the Board is instructed to communicate to Dr Harrison this expression of their respect and regard, with their best wishes for his future prosperity.

Resolved that it is entirely agreeable to the Board that Dr Harrison should continue to use his present House, until such time as it may suit his convenience to move.

Resolved that the Pavilion recently occupied by the Professor of Latin be and is hereby allotted to the Professor of Natural Philosophy - and that Pavilion now occupied by the Professor of Natural Philosophy be allotted to the Professor of Latin to be elected at this meeting of the Board.

Resolved that Professors Davis & Cabell be authorized to employ Mr Scharff for the next Session as heretofore.

Col. Baldwin offered the following resolution.

There shall be and is hereby established in the University a School of Physical Geography and Agricultural Science.

In this School shall be taught Physical Geography, Meteorology and Climatology, with their relations and applications to Agricultural Science and Rural Economy and also such other kindred subjects as in the judgment and experience of the Professor may be found expedient and in harmony with the courses of instruction in the other schools of the University.

The instructions in Agricultural science and Rural economy shall include as far as practicable, the branches of learning not taught in the other schools of the University best calculated to prepare the Farmer & Planter for the business of his profession.

To enable the Students in this School to enjoy the benefit of instruction in the auxiliary branches of science which are taught in the University the other professors will be called upon by the Board of Visitors as experience may indicate to be proper, to give special courses of lectures, so arranged as to present the opportunity of pursuing at the University a complete course of professional instruction in agricultural science.

Resolved that the Board, disclaiming any purpose to induce the establishment of such seminaries near the University, though well disposed to see them established as well because consistent with the original purpose of the friends of this Institution as because it is desirable, do establish the following rules and which subject to the entire power of the Board to abrogate or modify the same, the Students of all such seminaries may attend the lectures of the University said rules to remain in full force until otherwise ordered.

1. The Students of Such seminaries shall be permitted to attend any and all of the Lectures delivered at the University, and use the books in its Library, subject to the rules and regulations of the University.
2. Such students shall not be required to matriculate nor to pay any fees for tuition nor for public rooms Library or infirmary, nor shall they be compelled to attend such lectures, nor shall the Professors of any School examine the exercises of such students.
3. While in the University such students shall be subject to its laws and the authority of its proper officers - but elsewhere shall be exempt therefrom.

Mr. Carr moved to amend the resolution of Mr Tucker by striking out the words "for public rooms library or infirmary" and by inserting "any other fees except a fee of $15 for the use of Library and public rooms."

Mr Joynes moved as a substitute for Mr Carr's proposition to strike out all after the word "matriculate" so as to require the students of Theological Seminaries to pay the usual fees for instruction and for the use of the Library and public rooms.
