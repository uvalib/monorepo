### REPORT OF THE STUDENT ACTIVITIES COMMITTEE FOR THE SESSION 1957-58

During the current academic session, the Student Activities Committee has met a total of nineteen times. The majority of these meetings was held to consider requests for funds from various student organizations. All budgets and requests were first submitted to the Student Council for investigation and recommendation before being submitted to the Student Activities Committee for action.

The committee felt itself charged to provide financial support, upon request, to those student activities which were organized to provide a service to the University as a whole and which could not properly expect departmental support.

At the Annual meeting of the Trustees of McGregor Fund, careful consideration was given to your letter of April 28 and to a continuation of support of the Tracy W. McGregor Library at the University. I am pleased to report that the Trustees appropriated $12,000 a year for each of the five years commencing July 1, 1958, for accessions to the McGregor Library, and checks will be forthcoming quarterly as in the past, commencing around July 1.

In making this five-year appropriation, the Trustees expressed their keen satisfaction with the excellent conduct of the Library over the past twenty years. Its capable staff has long had the reputation throughout the country of giving friendly help and cooperation to visiting scholars.

We look forward with pleasure to our continuing association with the University of Virginia.

I wish to submit herewith my resignation as President of the University, to be effective as soon as the Board has selected a new President and he is prepared to take over the duties of this office.

I shall always be grateful for the Board's unfailing kindness and its generous support. I have a deep and warm feeling for the Board members with whom I have worked since coming to the University, and I shall remember with much pleasure an association which has been for me a most happy and interesting one.

On May 8 you requested me to find out from the local committee at Wise about what suggestions they had on the location of the auditorium authorized by the Assembly last winter. The committee at Wise has two recommendations first, that Mr. Charles B. McElroy be employed as architect on the gymnasium-auditorium, second, that the gymnasium-auditorium be located on the site between the Coeburn Road and the building now used for faculty apartments (the Old Detention Home).

I am attaching a copy of the Advisory Committee's Resolutions of March 31, 1958. It is my understanding that the Resolutions were presented to you and a carbon sent me.

In addition, I am attaching a letter of June 3 in which Mr. Smiddy reports the Advisory Committee reaffirms its position of March 31.

I should like to recommend two changes in the present TIAA-CREF annuity program, which should be presented to the Board if you approve.

1. The present maximum basis for determining contributions is $10,000. This figure was set in 1936. I should like to recommend that it be increased to $12,500, the present maximum salary for regular session faculty members. In addition, it might be well to tie the maximum to the maximum session salary so that future increases in the faculty salary scale will be automatically reflected in the annuity program.

2. For clinical professors in the Medical School, I should like to recommend the same ceiling apply in so far as compulsory matching is concerned. In addition, should a faculty member wish to contribute 5% of his salary up to a total of $20,000, that such amount be matched from the departmental funds derived from private practice.

The Student Council wishes to submit the following traffic control recommendations for your consideration:

1. The area known as the Dell and the present Engineering School parking lot should be converted into improved parking lots. Chief Houchens of the University Police has approximate figures pertaining to the cost of improving the two lots and to the capacity of the lots.

2. Student parking in the Cabell Hall lot and on the roadway beside the Residence Halls shall be prohibited from 8:30 a. m. to 3:00 p. m. MONDAY through SATURDAY.

3. The present fine system for violations of Student Motor Vehicle Rules and Regulations should be abandoned. The new system should incorporate the following:

4. A student on probation of any kind shall have his driving privileges suspended.

5. Upon registration of a motor vehicle, the applicant must show proof of being able to meet the motor vehicle insurance requirements of the State of Virginia.

I would be happy to discuss these recommendations with you at your convenience if you so desire.

I am enclosing a revised copy of the regulations governing the use of motor vehicles by students in the undergraduate schools of the University as approved unanimously by the Committee on Undergraduates at its meeting on Friday, May 30, 1958. This meeting was also attended by Miss Tyson from the School of Nursing and Mr. Nichols from the School of Architecture. I strongly recommend adoption of these regulations by the Board of Visitors and propose that they take effect with students entering in September 1958. I feel that those sections dealing with warning, probation, and conviction of drunken and/or reckless driving should become effective for all undergraduate students in September 1958.

As University Adviser to Students, I strongly urge that the stipulations regarding drunken and/or reckless driving should apply to all students in the University. The Committee on Undergraduates is also of this opinion but has no jurisdiction in the matter. I urge that the Board of Visitors consider the advisability of this rule applying to all students.

May I call your attention to paragraphs 2 and 3 of my letter of May 20, 1958, regarding my reactions to the recommendations made by the Student Council?

The Student Council at its meeting on May 19, 1958, unanimously passed the following motion: To recommend that all students who register cars have compulsory insurance.

This has just come to the attention of the Subcommittee of the Committee on Undergraduates. We approve this motion and propose the following be made a part of our previous recommendations.

Before any student may register his vehicle, he must present the following documents:

1. State registration
2. State driver's license
3. Certificate of insurance from a recognized insurance company evidencing coverage for public liability for a minimum of $10,000 and $20,000 bodily injury and $5,000 property damage
4. Statement signed by the student's parent or guardian (if the student is under 21) indicating the parent's or guardian's knowledge and understanding of the regulations at the University of Virginia and granting the student permission to operate a motor vehicle at the University.

As you know, Prof. Vyssotsky is retiring this June. Approximately 25 years ago he requested permission from the University to build a home near the observatory. President Newcomb advised him that he would bring the matter to the Board of Visitors and secure a lease for him. Mr. Vyssotsky said that he checked several times with Mr. Carruthers, who was then Secretary of the Board, to see if any action had been taken. He was assured that it would be forthcoming and to proceed with the construction of his residence.

Mr. Vyssotsky stated further that he was concerned and talked to Mr. Allan Perkins, then University Attorney, about the matter, who assured him that if Mr. Newcomb had verbally authorized it, not to worry about it. I telephoned Mr. Perkins, who does not recall Prof. Vyssotsky discussing the matter with him, although he said he might well have for it is difficult for him to remember conversations which took place 25 years ago.

Prof. Vyssotsky would like for the University to purchase his house and Dr. Alden of the observatory would very much like to have it for a residence for Dr. Vyssotsky's replacement.

Mr. O'Grince has been over the property and feels that it would probably be worth $15,000. I enclose a letter from Mr. Vyssotsky stating that he has spent $10,000 on the property and, with the present depreciated dollar, it is worth $15,000.

If the Board thinks well of purchasing the property, I believe we should have appraisals made as a basis for payment.

The Board adopted the following resolution:
RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the resignation of Dr. William Edward Montague as Assistant Professor of Psychology, effective June 1, 1958, be and it is hereby accepted.

We wish for him the highest success in his new undertaking.

The Board adopted the following resolution:
RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the following promotions of members of the faculty of Mary Washington College be and they are hereby made, effective as of September 1, 1958.

* Mrs. Mildred M. Bolling, Associate Professor and Chairman of the French Department to Professor of French and Chairman of the Department of Modern Foreign Languages, at an annual salary of $6500
* Miss Margery E. Arnold, Assistant Professor to Associate Professor of Health, Physical Education and Recreation, at an annual salary of $5750
* Dr. Stanley F. Bulley, Assistant Professor to Associate Professor of Music, at an annual salary of $5750
* Miss Mildred Cates, Instructor to Assistant Professor of Home Economics, at an annual salary of $5000
* Mr. Sidney H. Mitchell, Instructor to Assistant Professor of English, at an annual salary of $5000
* Dr. Mary Jo Parrish, Instructor to Assistant Professor of Biology, at an annual salary of $5000
* Mr. W. J. Pitman, Instructor to Assistant Professor of Biology, at an annual salary of $5000

The Chancellor reported that after consultation with Mr. Darden, it has been decided to consolidate the academic work in the several modern foreign languages into one department. Persons who previously held separate chairmanships have been so notified of this change in the administrative structure of the College. The purpose of this change is to make possible a more consistent and effective program of instruction in modern languages throughout the College. The former chairman of the French Department has agreed to serve as the new chairman of the Department of Modern Foreign Languages.

The Chancellor reported to the Board regarding the status of the indebtedness to the State Treasury which had amounted, at the time of the last meeting of the Board, to $844,606.33. Since the last meeting, the Governor has authorized the application of surplus for the 1956-58 biennium to the indebtedness.

On May 29, 1958, Mr. Simpson said, the Comptroller informed the College that the surplus at June 30, 1957, in the amount of $205,346.84 had been applied to the debt, leaving a balance of $639,259.49. It is hoped to reduce this amount by $200,000.00 from the surplus at June 30, 1958. You will recall the appropriation of $351,390.00 in the 1958-60 budget. However, before this amount can be applied, the remaining balance of the debt must be paid from funds other than the general fund of the State.

Mr. Darden supported Mr. Simpson's proposal for a bond issue or short-term loan to be arranged following the application of the 1957-58 surplus to the debt, in order to cover the balance of debt then remaining in excess of $351,000. Mr. Darden estimated this balance as falling in the range of $75,000 to $85,000, and requested the Board's authority to negotiate (with the Governor's approval) a loan for the necessary amount.

The Board resolved that the President be and he is hereby authorized to negotiate the loan as proposed.

The following resolution was adopted:
RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the administrative officers of Mary Washington College be and they are hereby authorized to charge off as uncollectible the old student accounts, for the years 1930-56, in the sum of $9,895.06, found by them to be uncollectible and recommended by them for charging off.

Mr. Simpson reported a communication from Governor Almond authorizing holidays as follows and stating further that:

"If the nature of the services of any agency or institution requires that it be in full operation on certain of the days listed above as holidays and be closed on other days, an alternative schedule providing an equal number of holidays may be authorized by the governing board with the approval of the Governor."

Since Mary Washington College is in session when many of the holidays occur, Mr. Simpson requested that the employees of the College be granted permission to use such holidays at times when the college is not in session, preferably during the period that the College is closed for the Christmas holidays.

The Board adopted the following resolution:
RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the Chancellor of Mary Washington College, subject to the approval of the Governor, be and is hereby authorized to permit time off for employees, in lieu of legal holidays not observed at the time of occurrence, during the period that the College is closed for the Christmas holidays.

Copies of the proposed Budget for 1958-59 having been laid before the Board by the Bursar of the College, Mr. Woodward, he and Chancellor Simpson reviewed the highlights. Although total revenues are estimated by Mr. Woodward at $2,090,660, an increase of $53,940, proposed expenditures of $2,086,511 are expected to leave a surplus of only $4,149. Adjustment to the new Faculty salary scale accounts for a large portion of the heavier expenditures, and the increased revenue of $79,000 from higher student fees is offset in part by a $25,000 reduction in State appropriation from the General Fund.

The Board resolved after discussion to approve and adopt the Budget for 1958-59 as presented.

The Rector laid before the Board copies of letters from Mr. Simpson and Mr. Goolrick in which, as he noted, both the Chancellor and the Founder of the College had expressed appreciation for the Board's Resolutions of last April on the occasion of the College's fiftieth anniversary.

The Chancellor presented a memorandum from Mr. Michael Houston, Director of Admissions, showing present admissions of 1482 residential students for the 1958-59 session. This leaves 31 vacancies, Mr. Simpson reported, to be filled by future admissions, with 108 applications for admission still pending.

On motion the meeting was then adjourned.
