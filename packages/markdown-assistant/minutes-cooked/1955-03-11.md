The regular monthly meeting of the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia was held on this date at 10:00 a.m. in the Office of the President of the University, at Charlottesville, with the following present. The Rector, Barron F. Black, President Colgate W. Darden, Jr., Visitors Barksdale, Coxe, Dunn, Emmett, Gravatt, McWane, Mears, Pollock, Mrs. Smith, Mr. Smith, Talbott, and Wheeler. Absent: Visitors Berkeley, Gray, Hartfield, and Howard.

The minutes of the meeting of 12 February 1955, previously distributed, were approved, subject to a correction in Hospital accounts charged off, as noted below.

The Rector introduced and welcomed to the Board Dr. Herbert Chermside Pollock, one of three Visitors appointed by the Governor on February 28th for the four-year term ending 28 February 1959. A certified copy of Mr. Pollock's oath of office, taken before the Clerk of the Circuit Court of Albemarle County on March 11th, was handed to the Secretary and ordered to be filed.

The Rector also announced to the Visitors the appointment to the Board on the same date of Mr. Norborne Berkeley and Col. Joseph Manuel Hartfield, who, like Mr. Pollock, were named by Governor Stanley as a result of the Act of the General Assembly, approved on 2 April 1954, amending Sections 23-70 and 23-71 of the Code of Virginia so as to increase the membership of the Board from fourteen to seventeen Visitors, no more than three of whom may be Alumni of the University resident outside of Virginia. Letters from Mr. Berkeley and Mr. Hartfield which were read aloud to the Board expressed the hope of both to be present at the April 8th meeting, but Mr. Berkeley said it would not be possible for him to attend every month, and he thought it would be better for him to withdraw acceptance of his appointment than to miss a large proportion of the meetings.

President Darden and various members of the Board expressed a strong desire to have Mr. Berkeley on the Board, and the Rector was requested to write to Mr. Berkeley and urge him to delay his proposed withdrawal. A trial period of fewer meetings was proposed, and in the discussion that followed it was pointed out that the May and November meetings are usually held in Fredericksburg, and that it has been customary to hold in June the Annual meeting required by law.

On motion of Mr. Talbott, duly seconded, the Board resolved to hold the meetings as now scheduled for April 8th, June 10th, and September 9th, to omit the meetings scheduled for May, October, and December, 1955, and so on alternately, to refer to the Executive Committee matters of importance arising between meetings, and to have the full Board called by the Rector when an emergency need should require it.

The President announced the following gifts and grants.

The following resolution was adopted by the Board:

**RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the resignations of the following faculty members be and they are hereby accepted**

Dr. Harold F. Chase, Associate Professor of Anesthesiology, as of July 1, 1955

Dr. Woodbury Perkins, Clinical Instructor in Internal Medicine, as of January 1, 1955.

We wish for them the highest success in their new undertakings.

The following resolution was adopted by the Board:

**RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the following persons be and they are hereby elected to the faculty:**

Dr. Joseph L. Blotner as Assistant Professor of English, effective in September, at a session salary of **$4,450.00**.

Dr. Frederick L. Gwynn as Associate Professor of English, effective in September, at a session salary of **$5,800.00**.

Dr. Floyd Stovall as Edgar Allan Poe Professor of English, effective in September, at a session salary of **$9,500.00**.

Dr. Philip Y. Paterson as Assistant Professor of Microbiology, effective July 1, 1955, at an annual salary of **$6,000**, to be paid from a grant of the American Heart Association.

Dr. Kenneth Boyd Grim as Instructor in Pathology, effective April 1, 1955, at an annual salary of **$5,700.00**, **$3,800** of which is to be paid from the University budget and **$1,900** from departmental funds.

Dr. W. Ralph Singleton as Miller Professor of Biology and Director of the Blandy Experimental Farm, at an annual salary of **$10,000.00**, effective in September.

Mr. A. W. Patrick as Assistant Professor in the McIntire Undergraduate School of Commerce, effective in September, at a session salary of **$4,950.00**.

Dr. Walter Aron as Assistant Professor of Physics beginning in September at a salary of **$4,950.00**.

Copies of a summary of enrollment in College and Graduate School courses and the distribution of College grades for the first semester of the 1954-55 session were laid before the Board.

President Darden invited the Board's attention to the possible confusion resulting from the name of the Graduate School now that various professional schools in the University have independent programs of graduate study. The Board adopted the following resolution:

**RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the name of the School of Graduate Studies be and it is hereby changed to Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.**

The Board adopted the following resolution:

**RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the Hospital Accounts Committee be and they are hereby authorized to charge off as uncollectible accounts Schedules 508, 508-a, 511, and 512, aggregating **$65,448.54**, as recommended by them.**

President Darden noted a clerical error in the numbers and total sum of the Schedules charged off in February and requested correction. The Board thereupon adopted the following resolutions:

**RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the section of the minutes for the meeting of the Board held on 12 February 1955 entitled UNCOLLECTIBLE HOSPITAL ACCOUNTS be and it is hereby cancelled.**

**RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the Hospital Accounts Committee be and they are hereby authorized to charge off as uncollectible accounts Schedules 498, 502 and 503, aggregating **$38,307.11**, as recommended by them.**

Mr. Mears, Chairman of the Finance Committee, read to the Board the following report:

The undersigned members of the Finance Committee of the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia, submit herewith a copy of a report and summary of the Consolidated Endowment Funds of the University of Virginia, compiled by the State-Planters Bank and Trust Company, covering the period from January 25, 1954 to January 25, 1955.

As will be observed, the fund had a book value as of January 25, 1955, of **$7,026,021.09**, whereas the original book value of the General Endowment Fund at the time the State-Planters Bank and Trust Company took over the handling of this fund under an agreement with the Board, was **$4,566,051.82**, or an increase of **$2,459,969.27**.

The amount of sales, redemptions and conversions of securities during the year, covering thirty-five (35) separate issues, aggregated the sum of **$663,962.95**. The sales, redemptions and conversions resulted in a net capital gain to the fund of **$93,964.80**, which is reflected in the adjusted book value of **$7,026,021.09**. Purchases of, conversions of and subscriptions to securities, covering twenty-eight (28) issues during the year, amounted to **$1,190,522.29**.

The gross adjusted income for the twelve month period amounted to **$335,501.38**, which, when related to the average book value during 1954 (weighted average by months), represented a yield of **5.17%**, which compares to the average yield for the year 1953 of **4.89%**, and for the year 1952 of **4.87%**. The current yield on investments which now constitute the fund, is approximately **4.85%** of the present book value of **$7,026,021.09**, or **3.54%** of the current market value of **$9,618,670.80**.

The Agent turned over to the Comptroller of the University during the year, a sum in the aggregate of **$319,668.45**, representing net income after all deductions and expenses. The expenses to the University of having the Agent to handle the fund, (together with the four subsidiary accounts), was approximately **24/100ths of 1%** of its average book value, and covered supervision and review of investments, as well as custody of the securities and collection of income. The Agent also furnished monthly statements and lists of assets to the Comptroller, the Auditor of Public Accounts, and to the members of the Finance Committee.

We desire to call your attention to page 9 of the report, showing the units of investment, whose market value indicate a book loss of **$5,000.00** or more, and those showing book gains of **$50,000.00** or more. It is interesting to note that the total losses under this schedule aggregated only **$39,149.26**; whereas the total gains aggregated **$1,818,264.81**.

It is also interesting to note on page 8 of the report, statistics with respect to the performance of the account over the past five (5) years. As of January 25, 1951, the book value of the account was **$5,653,535.84**, which has increased annually to January 25, 1955, in the amount of **$7,026,021.09**, and the market value as of January 25, 1951 was **$6,215,282.30**, which has annually increased to **$9,618,670.80**, as of January 25, 1955.
