* Mr. Mears, Chairman
* Dr. Emmett
* Mrs. Smith

The President reported the following gifts and grants

The Board adopted the following resolution:

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the resignations of the following faculty members be and they are hereby accepted:

* Miss Louise Bryant, Assistant Professor of Nursing, as of January 1, 1954

We wish for them the highest success in their new undertakings.

The following resolution was adopted by the Board:

* Mr. John Edward Kusik, as Visiting Lecturer in the Graduate School of Business Administration, effective December 1, 1954, at no salary from the University
* Miss Margaret Gould Tyson, as Assistant Professor of Nursing, effective February 1, 1955.

The Board adopted the following resolution

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the Hospital Accounts Committee be and they are hereby authorized to charge off as uncollectible accounts Schedules 493 and 494, aggregating $21,490.10, as recommended by them.

President Darden presented to the Board an anonymous proposal (conveyed to Mr. Minor, the University's Special Counsel, via Mr. Meredith P. Wiswell, counsel for the Trustee and the Washington Loan and Trust Co., via Mr. Jackson N. Huddleston, Huntington, West Virginia, attorney) to purchase Parcel No. 20, a 90-acre tract and the last remaining real property in the William J. Humphreys Estate, for the sum of $2,650. President Darden, pointing out that the Board had previously set a valuation of $3,000 on this property, questioned the wisdom of accepting a lesser sum. The Board resolved that the proposal be referred to Mr. Gray, Chairman of the special Committee on Outlying Real Estate.

President Darden laid before the Board a letter of 17 November 1954 from Mr. C. Venable Minor suggesting that the University consider purchasing for an estimated price of $125,000 the "Locust Grange" property, a 28-acre tract between St. Anne's School and the Rucker Home fronting on the south side of U. S. Highway 250, west of the University. After some discussion of the University's expansion needs, the Board resolved that the purchase should not be attempted.

Correspondence and other papers relating to Mr. Bernard Chamberlain's request for an easement for a right of way, which had been discussed by the Board on October 8th, having been laid before the Board, President Darden invited attention to the Comptroller's letter of November 15th pointing out that the University cannot sell land acquired before 1900 without specific permission from the General Assembly, but that the Board is authorized to grant easements The Board resolved that Mr. Chamberlain's proposal be referred back to the President with authority to act.

The Rector referred to the Board's discussion on November 12th of Mr. Warner Wood's request, repeated since that date in letters to members of the Board, for guarantees of future protection from interference in his proposed private classes for tutoring University students. The Board resolved that the President write to Mr. Wood expressing the Visitors' interest in his proposal, but explaining that the Board cannot bind the action of a future Board in such a matter.

Mrs. Smith reminded the Board of Mr. Gravatt's remarks at the November 12th meeting on the heavy executive responsibilities of the President, and on President Darden's reluctance to seek or to accept assistance in carrying the enormous and increasing load of administrative detail. Asked for comment, President Darden said that he had nothing to add to his former statement of reluctance to spend additional funds on the general administration of the University in view of departmental needs. The discussion that followed called attention, in the light of the President's need for time for consideration of policy matters, to the increased demands made on the President's time by Mary Washington College, by the new Schools and Departments at Charlottesville, by expansion of Extension work, and by the current and anticipated rise in enrollment.

The Board resolved that a committee be appointed to consider and make recommendations on the administrative structure of the University. The Rector appointed a special committee for the purpose as noted above.

In discussing the dinner meeting held on December 9th with representatives of the Medical School, members praised the attitude and policies of Dean Hunter and his associates in regard to the University's primary responsibility for training professional men for service to Virginia communities. Attention was called to the vital need for a closer relationship to Virginia's public school system, to the ways in which the University and Virginia's communities can mutually strengthen each other, and to the necessity for the University's professional schools in Medicine, Law, and other fields to look to the future in maintaining a suitable balance in training both Virginians and non-Virginians so as to equip them for professional usefulness within Virginia as well as in other regions of the country.

The Board resolved that on the evening preceding the January Board meeting a dinner be held to which the Dean of the School of Law and other representatives of the Law School be invited for an informal discussion of the current progress, problems, and plans of the Law School.

The Rector referred to the contention made at the meeting on November 11th by representatives of the Senate that the Board's action on intercollegiate athletics in June 1953 had abrogated former faculty rulings and stripped the Faculty of its proper authority in this field. In response to the Rector's proposal that an answer to this assertion ought to be made by the Board, President Darden requested a delay until he could hold a deferred conference on the subject with Professor Gooch, from whom this argument came. Mr. Darden said that he disagreed with Mr. Gooch's interpretation and thought that a discussion between them might reconcile the two points of view. Consideration of a reply was accordingly deferred.

Referring to the Board meeting of November 11th with representatives of the University Senate, and to his own projected exploration, through other presidents, of institutional attitudes in the Atlantic Coast Conference area toward a greater stress on the amateur spirit in football and a reduction in recruitment, President Darden said that he had found President Gordon Gray, of the University of North Carolina, receptive to a discussion, and they were planning to hold one. Mr. Darden reminded the Board of his statement on November 11th that this exploration would take not less than two or three years, and said he wanted it understood that he could only undertake this task as a long-term effort. He added that he was now in conference with the Senate on the subject, if the Senate desired more immediate action, he would have to refer the project to the Senate itself for prosecution by a Senate Committee.

The Rector announced that in response to the Board's resolution of November 12th, he had invited Professors Allan Gwathmey and B. F. D. Runk to appear before the Board today. Having learned that Mr. Gwathmey had an important conflicting engagement for today, he had then proposed to Messrs. Gwathmey and Runk that they attend the January 14th meeting of the Board. There were expressions of approval from the Visitors, and it was suggested that an hour be set for the interview that would permit the Board to complete its routine business prior to the arrival of Mr. Gwathmey and Mr. Runk.

President Darden reminded the Board of the action taken by the Budget and Personnel officers in Richmond approving faculty salary increases within certain limits to all the institutions of higher learning in Virginia, except the University at Charlottesville, provided that the necessary funds could be found within the institutional budget. Mr. Darden exhibited a schedule of increases, worked out by Mr. Woodward in conference with Dean Alvey and a special committee, to take effect in February 1955.

The Board resolved that the proposed increases, as approved by President Darden, should be made effective as of 1 February 1955.

The President reported that, pursuant to the Board's resolution of November 12th, he had adjusted the laboratory fees and the laundry and rental charges at the College in accordance with recommendations of the Faculty Committee. As a result of consultation since then with Dean Alvey and Mr. Woodward, he now wished authority to increase the library fee.

The Board resolved that the library fee shall be increased from $5.00 to $10.00 per semester effective at the beginning of the 1955-56 session.

Mr. Howard, Chairman, laid before the Board the following report, which upon request he read aloud to the Board as follows

The Mary Washington Committee met at Mary Washington College at 10:00 a.m., December 9th, with all members present, with President Darden of the University.

Prior to Dr. Combs' appearance with the Committee, President Darden outlined the situation as he saw it at the present time, pointing out that there had, in his opinion, been an improvement in the general morale of students and faculty. He also stated that through the functioning of several committees he felt that definite progress was being made in the improvement of academic standards, both as they relate to admissions and retentions in college. He related plans to purchase a patrol car to provide more adequate policing of the grounds; the functioning of the joint University and Mary Washington College Faculty Committee, giving consideration to improvement of present faculty and faculty additions, and to the effectiveness of faculty members serving as hostesses not only in the dormitories, but in classes as well.

Dr. Combs appeared before the Committee and was requested to bring attention to any matters he considered pertinent and desired to discuss. He spent some time in telling of capital outlay needs as presented to the Legislative Committee, and of a plan worked out with Mr. Bradford for a loan for capital outlay at an interest rate of 1½%. He responded to several questions from members of the Committee regarding enrollment and future plans for expansion.

After rather general discussions, Dr. Combs expressed a desire to present to the Committee his point of view regarding the treatment he had received during the past year. The Committee listened intently to a long discussion, giving Dr. Combs complete freedom and extending to him every courtesy, interrupting occasionally to raise questions for clarification.

No attempt was made to record the details presented —; for summary, it is stated that Dr. Combs feels that he has been badly treated, that while he agreed to the plan proposed by his attorney, he did so under stress and tension; that he had complete and documented statements to refute statements made by his accusers and it appeared that he had been convicted primarily for talking four hours to the students who were involved in the instances fomenting the difficulty. He spoke at length concerning what he considered conspiracy to remove him from the office of President. Members of the Committee interrupted to state that they knew nothing of any such plan and felt that he had drawn the wrong conclusion.

When asked how he obtained the quotations given from numerous letters, he replied that a complete record of all correspondence and other materials incident to the case, about which he knew nothing, had been left at the college following a meeting of the Board.

Dr. Combs left with the Committee statements which he considered to be his side of the case and urged consideration by the Board. He requested reconsideration of the entire case. Dr. Combs' statement is made a part of the record.

Dean Alvey was invited to discuss his problems with the Committee.

He reviewed in more detail a number of the matters presented by President Darden reemphasizing the improvement in academic standards, effectiveness of committees, and general improvement of faculty and student morale. He directed attention to the improved salary schedule approved by the Governor, stating that effective February 1, 1955, Professors and Associate Professors would move to a schedule providing a $200.00 increase, Assistant Professors, a $180.00 increase. No increase in schedule was approved for instructors, but they would be advanced one step in the present schedule.

Dr. Alvey presented a tentative statement from the Academic Standards Committee for consideration by the faculty at a meeting scheduled for Monday, December 13th. The Committee was unanimous in their approval of the idea, but felt it inappropriate to take definite action before consideration by the faculty.

Dr. Alvey presented a statement outlining briefly an archeological study being contemplated by the Smithsonian Institute in connection with a discovery of an old Colonial Town of Marlboro and vicinity in Stafford County on the Potomac Neck. Dr. Oscar H. Darter of the Mary Washington faculty has worked with the Institute and requested, through Dr. Alvey, that his work be given status by the Board of Visitors.

Dr. Alvey was requested to tell the Committee his feelings regarding the relationships in administration. He stated briefly the situation as he saw it, pointing out that certain conflicts remained, but that it was his judgment that the college was showing gradual but positive improvement.

Mr. Woodward was given the same privilege as Dr. Combs and Dr. Alvey. He told of the details involved in putting the new salary schedule in effect, recommended an increase in library fees and reported tuition changes as follows

Dr. Alvey requested that the City of Fredericksburg be permitted to take over the maintenance of that portion of Highway 1-A at Hazel Run and maintain the Mary Washington Wayside as it is after the Highway Department no longer has jurisdiction, due to annexation of property by the City, effective January 1, 1955.

As in the case of Dr. Alvey, Mr. Woodward was requested to express himself regarding his judgment of the effectiveness of the present plan of administration. He expressed some concern about certain apparent misunderstandings regarding certain strained relationships, but indicated a complete desire, as did Dr. Alvey, to cooperate fully.

The Committee was impressed by the spirit of cooperation manifested by Dr. Alvey and Mr. Woodward, and with the manner in which they are carrying out their responsibilities.

The Committee makes the following recommendations for approval of the Board

1. That, effective beginning session 1955-56, the library fee be increased from $5.00 to $10.00 per semester, making a total yearly library fee of $20.00.
2. That the Board expresses interest in the archeological study contemplated by the Smithsonian Institute, offers their cooperation, and expresses pleasure in having the college represented in the study by Dr. Oscar H. Darter.
3. That the following request from Mr. F. Freeman Funk, Assistant City Manager of Fredericksburg (see letter dated December 6, 1954, from R. E. Greene, State Highway Department) be approved -\
   "When the City of Fredericksburg takes over the maintenance of that portion of Highway 1-A at Hazel Run we would like to maintain the Mary Washington Wayside in place, as is, if a suitable agreement can be reached with the owners of the land."
4. That the Board give consideration to and act on the request of Dr. Combs to review the case as he presented it in the communication to the Committee
5. That effective February 1, 1955, salaries of Professors, Associate Professors, and Assistant Professors be increased in accordance with the Schedule approved by President Darden, and that it be requested that instructors be advanced one step on their present salary schedule

The Committee desires to express the belief that the time spent from 10:00 A.M. to 4:15 P.M. at Mary Washington College on Thursday, December 9th, was beneficial to them in their efforts to better understand the problems presented by the existing situation.

The Committee recognized the difficulties presented to Mr. Darden, Dr. Alvey and Mr. Woodward and commends them for the spirit with which they are assuming their responsibilities.

After a brief discussion of the foregoing Report, the following Resolution, duly seconded, was unanimously adopted

**RESOLVED** that the Report of the Mary Washington College Committee of this date with respect to Dr. Combs be accepted and spread on the minutes of the Board and that the Rector be requested to prepare and spread on the minutes a statement of the facts concerning the matter of the Board's action with respect to Dr. Combs and that a copy of the letter of February 12, 1954, from Dr. Combs to the Board and a copy of the Resolution of the Board accepting Dr. Combs' proposal be appended thereto.

Mr. Howard read aloud and distributed to the Board copies of the following letter which Dr. Combs had handed to the Committee (mimeographed in multiple copies) at the close of its meeting held in Fredericksburg on December 9th

### A STATEMENT MADE BY PRESIDENT MORGAN L. COMBS TO THE MARY WASHINGTON COLLEGE COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF VISITORS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA AT ITS MEETING IN FREDERICKSBURG, December 9, 1954.

Since this is the first time that I have had an opportunity to appear before the Mary Washington Committee in over a year, and I feel that the present members of this Committee are unbiased and would not under any circumstances knowingly and willingly condone an injustice or aid or abet any attempt to discredit anyone, I feel compelled, with your indulgence, to make the following statement

Twenty-six years ago, on December 8, 1928, I was elected President of this institution. I believe that most of you are familiar in general with the status of the institution at that time, the changes which have come about since that date, and the prestige of the College today as compared with the small, poverty-stricken teachers college of twenty-six years ago.

Until a year ago, the College was noted not only for its wonderful and efficient plant and equipment and its high scholastic standards, but for the splendid spirit which prevailed on the campus and the high morale among students, faculty and staff. As far as I know, there had never been the slightest intimation that the administration did not have the full approval and confidence of the Board or had failed in any way to carry out the policies of the Board, or that the College was not being administered in accordance with the provisions of the Act of the Legislature in 1944 making this institution a liberal arts college.

During the latter part of 1953, I became the victim of what appeared to be a "conspiracy" resulting in a tragic miscarriage of justice. We now know that this "conspiracy" was participated in by five members of the Mary Washington College staff and faculty—;Edward Alvey, Jr., Dean of the College, Edgar E. Woodward, Bursar, Mary Ellen Stephenson, Associate Professor of Spanish and former Acting Dean of Women, Margaret S. Russell, Assistant Professor of Home Economics, and Mrs. Zella Jacobus, a housemother who had been questioned in regard to her alleged attempt to foment a riot among student waitresses in the dining halls. Evidence shows that this group was given encouragement and sympathetic support by Mrs. Bertha P. Wailes, chairman of the Mary Washington Committee for approximately ten years, and who on many occasions appeared antagonistic toward the President of Mary Washington.

As a result of the efforts of this group, and Mrs. Wailes' activities in her effort to condemn me, a series of secret meetings were held and also at least one meeting of the full Board to consider these charges while I was going about my duties as usual absolutely unaware that anything of this kind was going on. It seems strange that, during this time, she did not contact the President of the college, and I was completely taken by surprise when a newspaper reporter called me from Richmond about four o'clock on Friday afternoon, December 11, 1953, and asked me if the Board had been in communication with me and whether or not I was aware that at the meeting of the Board in Charlottesville that day charges were being made against me.

The transcripts of the testimony at these meetings show that no witnesses were sworn, and the charges constitute an amazing distortion of facts, including personal opinions, contradictions, innuendoes, half-truths, and outright falsehoods, and I have in my possession ample material to substantiate my statement. It was absolutely impossible for me to refute these charges at the time they were made since I had heard none of the evidence, and Rector Black failed to give me copies of any of the testimony except garbled statements made by the housemother, Mrs. Jacobus, false and contradictory statements made by the four waitresses; and some remarks made by Ann Lewis Payne, President of Student Government, consisting of rumors, personal opinion, and brazen falsehoods.

At the meeting of the Board on December 22, 1953, at Fredericksburg, the one and only time I was ever permitted to meet with the Board after these charges were made, in my written statement addressed to the members of the Board I said that I was greatly embarrassed and handicapped because I did not have all of the complaints or full information in regard to the specific charges or what members of the faculty and staff had made them. On January 15, 1954, I wrote the Rector as follows

"My lack of knowledge as to the real reasons for the investigation placed me in a rather embarrassing position in my efforts to defend myself before the Board at its meeting at Mary Washington College on December 22. I hope, therefore, that you will be good enough to send me a list of all the complaints against the administration of Mary Washington College being considered by the Board. It would be very helpful to me if these complaints could be stated in definite detailed and objective form, accompanied by the names of the people who made each specific complaint, and a transcript of their statements if they are available. In order for me to be in a position to defend myself, it is absolutely necessary to have all of the complaints in tangible form and that I be given the names of the people who made the complaints."

"We can assure you that the only use that would be made of the names and transcripts would be in an effort to establish a motive and to answer the charges. I do not desire vengeance, but simply want justice."

Rector Black replied to my letter of January 21, 195, in which letter he stated:

"Neither you, nor the Board members who were not committee members, have actually heard the witnesses who appeared before the committee. However, it is our full intention to have these witnesses appear before the Board. As a matter of fact, each of them has been so requested, and each has consented to appear."

"The following appeared before the committee. Dean Alvey, Mrs. Jacobus, Miss Ann Lewis Payne, Miss Stephenson, Mrs. Russell and Mr. Woodward."

"We kept no stenographic question and answer record of statements made before the committee, as we have of those made before the Board. All we have as to the committee meetings are Mr. Berkeley's notes written from a brief record and from his memory of what was said, and making no pretense of being entirely complete or in question and answer form It would not be fair to these witnesses to publish any such record, or to attribute definite statements to any particular witness. The omission of a single remark might distort the actual meaning intended to be conveyed by the witness. And in view of the coming appearance of the same witnesses before the Board, at which time each of them will be questioned as to the matters and things discussed before the committee, it seems that no injustice will be done by not publishing these notes. You will, of course, have the opportunity of listening to these witnesses and of telling us your side of each incident."

As you no doubt know, neither the full Board nor myself was ever given the promised opportunity of listening to these witnesses, nor was I ever given an opportunity of telling my side of each incident. Instead, when the Board adjourned its meeting here on February 12, 1954, after handing down its devastating decision, I still did not know the full charges and the motives and implications involved.

I had also expected the Board to take ample time to hear numerous witnesses who were ready and anxious to testify in my behalf. Instead of that, they either proposed to my attorney or he proposed to them, without my permission, a humiliating compromise which I accepted under duress because of my ignorance in regard to the charges or the factors involved and my desire to avoid undesirable publicity and hurt the College.

In spite of my efforts to avoid publicity by submitting to an unprecedented decision by the Board, immediately I was subjected to the most horrible public humiliation through the newspapers covering a period of several weeks as a result of information given out by the Board consisting of innuendoes, insinuations, baseless rumors and implications, which indicate that they had been misled by false rumors and statements in regard to my physical and mental health.

Not only, as stated before, was information withheld from me, but it was not until three weeks ago that we were able to secure the minutes of the Board meetings of December 11, 1953, January 8, 1954, and February 12, 1954. My wife and I were shocked to see that at the meeting of the Board on December 11, before I even knew that any charges had been made against me, Thomas B. Gay, a member of the Board at that time, stated that I should be suspended immediately and implied that it was dangerous for me to remain here. The implications were that I was a monster and a threat to the peace and safety of the people at Mary Washington College.

The records show and the witnesses who appeared before the Board on December 22, 1953, have stated that some of the members of the Board were hostile and apparently were interested only in information that would convict me, and yet the Rector refers to this procedure as a "careful investigation". It would appear from all of the information and records that it was more like an inquisition. It is evident now that even before I appeared before the Board for the first and only time on December 22, 1953, some, if not all of the members of the Board had been informed of my alleged "mental condition" and that my fate was already sealed. It was not until six days after the Board met at Mary Washington the last time on February 12, 1954, that we accidentally were given access to full information in regard to the charges, transcripts of statements made by the staff and faculty members of Mary Washington referred to before, the astounding and false statements in connection with my health and mental condition, and the real reasons back of the whole thing, which I do not believe were known by many members of the Board.

As a result of this comprehensive information showing that the housemother and the waitress affair were not the real reasons back of the so-called investigation, many leading citizens, alumnae, and friends of Mary Washington College, as well as my personal friends, became alarmed that such a thing could happen in the State of Virginia. A movement was started, which spread rapidly, to inform the Board of the fact that it had been misled. Many efforts have been made by many different people to have this case re-opened, in view of the fact that we now have both documentary evidence and witnesses to refute all of these charges beyond the peradventure of a doubt. In general, these appeals have fallen on deaf ears. For instance, one prominent citizen received the impression, after talking to the Rector, "that the Board, right or wrong" would not change its decision. Can any Board or Body representing the public afford to take such an attitude?

Regardless of anything else, I am sure you must realize that this whole unfortunate affair has been a long and dreadful nightmare to my wife and myself. With each passing day, it becomes more and more evident that the decision of the Board on February 12, 1954, was based upon false and prejudiced information, and motives which I did not understand at that time, and that, as stated before, I was induced to agree to this compromise without the slightest knowledge of what crime I was supposed to have committed except talking to a housemother and attempting to discipline four insolent students.

I feel sure that when these charges were made, had the Board sent a small committee to Mary Washington College, and that committee had stayed here long enough to ascertain the facts and make a first-hand investigation, and had been able to talk to the approximately ninety per cent of the faculty and staff who were absolutely loyal to the administration, I would have been completely exonerated.

I now appeal to you in the name of American standards of justice and fair play to use your influence as members of the Mary Washington College Committee to have this case reopened and arrange a public hearing, at which time the witnesses on both sides are sworn, or to have the Board authorize the Mary Washington Committee to make a thorough first-hand investigation of everything pertaining to my record as President of Mary Washington College and report back to the full Board.

On Friday at the meeting of the Board of Visitors, Mr. Dowell Howard read to the Board members your statement made to the Mary Washington College Committee when it met in Fredericksburg on December 9, 1954. I was asked to reply to this statement.

I shall not attempt to answer each and every assertion made in your statement for the reason that to do so would merely involve a repetition of what already appears in my correspondence, or in other parts of the record.

However, I should, at the outset, deny most emphatically the charge you make of conspiracy. No conspiracy existed. When you state that Mrs. Bertha P. Wailes "appeared antagonistic towards the President of Mary Washington" you are merely saying that Mrs. Wailes did not always agree with your ideas as to how Mary Washington should be run - nothing more. The College never had a more unselfish or devoted friend than Mrs. Wailes.

The matter of the unrest and disturbances at Mary Washington first came to my attention by way of a phone call on or about November 25, 1953, from Mrs. Wailes, who was then Chairman of the Mary Washington Committee. I had no details of the matter. Nor did I know whether there was any substance to it. I suggested to Mrs. Wailes that she collect whatever data there was regarding the situation and that the Committee assemble at Richmond, talk to whoever could give us any information in regard to the matter. This was done. Later, on December 10th at Charlottesville, the Committee interviewed Dean Alvey and Mr. Woodward. Up to this point, our proceedings had been merely to develop the facts on the question as to whether any charges should be filed. The Committee reported to the Board on December 11, 1953. It was then decided by the Board that the situation was such as to require that charges should be filed and that you be notified at once, and given a full opportunity to explain them. Upon my return to Norfolk, I carried out the Board's instructions in my letter to you of December 12, 1953. The only element of secrecy in regard to these Committee meetings was our quite natural desire to keep the matter out of the press. That we failed in this was certainly no fault of the Committee.

I think, however, that a brief review of this case might be helpful, because it appears that some of what has transpired is not now clearly before you.

What you seem to have completely overlooked is that the present position which you occupy at Mary Washington was your own proposal, initiated by your own attorney.

During the early part of February, 1954, and after your appearance before the Board on December 22, 1953, but before the Board's meeting on February 12, 1954, I received a phone call from Mr. Jere Willis, your attorney. He requested that I confer with him in Richmond. I acquiesced in this, and it was agreed that we would meet on February 10, 1954, at the office of Mr. Thomas B. Gay.

We did meet at the appointed place and on the agreed date.

Mr. Willis was accompanied by his law partner, Mr. Garnett. Mr. Gay was also present. Mr. Willis proposed that in the interest of Mary Washington College the investigation of the charges against you be abandoned, that, if this were done, you would be willing to relinquish the burden of administrative duties at the College, providing you could continue in charge of new construction, fund raising and related matters, and could retain the title of President. He dwelt at length upon your demonstrated ability in the two latter categories and I expressed my hearty agreement with him on this point. But neither Mr. Gay nor I thought it wise or proper that you retain the title of President. We thought that you could retire and assume the position of Vice Chancellor, or some other position of dignity, and that it would be less pointed and less humiliating to you. The meeting ended in disagreement on this one point.

I gave some thought to the matter in the interval before the meeting on February 12, 1954, at Fredericksburg. I came to the obvious conclusion that I had a duty to lay Mr. Willis' proposal before the Board. I told Mr. Willis that I was going to do this, and asked him if the proposal was still an open one. His reply was in the affirmative.

Meanwhile, I had reached my own conclusion that I would urge the Board to accept the proposal of your attorney, you to retain the title of President, and that I would take the step for two reasons, first, because of my concern for the damage being done to Mary Washington College by the unfortunate publicity, and second, and I am quite sure you will question this, because of my concern for you. I was firmly convinced then, and still am, that had all of the details of the session in your office with the four girls become public property, that the result would have been catastrophic for you as a man. Despite the evident bitter feeling which your statement indicates you hold towards me, I did not then, and do not now reciprocate that feeling.

As you know, the Board agreed to the compromise proposed by your attorney. Messrs. Talbott, Gay and I conferred with Mr. Willis as to the wording of the resolution of the Board carrying out the compromise agreement, and the letter to be signed by you. As to the letter, there was little or no disagreement. As to the resolution, there were several changes made at Mr. Willis' suggestion, and after he had again conferred with you. I am not sure that we ever reached exactly the language desired by you and Mr. Willis regarding the resolution, but I am sure that the content of the resolution was satisfactory to everyone.

The letter and resolution were presented to you by your own attorney, and not in the presence of any member of the Board. Mr. Willis returned to us with the letter signed by you and the statement that the resolution of the Board in its final form was acceptable to you.

In the letter signed by you, it was stated that the resolution adopted by the Board, had "my full approval and the implementation of it will have my full cooperation". You further agreed to give "my full and complete cooperation to the person or persons who are selected by President Darden to function in the manner contemplated by the resolution and will so state publicly to the faculty, student body, and alumnae of Mary Washington College."

In accordance with your agreement, you wrote a letter, composed by you, to the large number of people who had written the Board regarding this matter, the closing paragraph of which read as follows

"I want you to know that the administrative changes were made with my knowledge and consent, after they had been discussed at some length, and I hope in spite of unfortunate newspaper speculation, that they will work out to the satisfaction of all parties concerned." (Excerpt from your letter of March 22, 1954, five weeks after the compromise decision.)

In your statement you waive all of this aside upon the ground that when you made this agreement, and did the things I have mentioned above, you acted under duress.

Since no member of the Board had dealings with you when you signed the agreement, the duress could hardly have emanated from the Board.

I have reviewed the matter with your attorney, Mr. Willis, and have read to him the paragraph in your statement in which you state.

"I had also expected the Board to take ample time to hear numerous witnesses who were ready and anxious to testify in my behalf. Instead of that, they either proposed to my attorney or he proposed to them, without my permission, a humiliating compromise which I accepted under duress because of my ignorance in regard to the charges or the factors involved and my desire to avoid undesirable publicity and hurt the College."

Mr. Willis indignantly denies that he or anyone else subjected you to duress or coercion of any kind, or that he proposed a compromise without your full permission and knowledge. He says that in his conversations with you he was accompanied by his law partner, Mr. Alfred Garnett, and that the latter will fully support his statements.

In view of what I have said above, the other points in your statement have little or no significance.

It is quite easy to pick out of one letter an isolated excerpt, and rest your case on that alone. But you and I exchanged a total of nine letters and telegrams, all relating to the matter of charges against you. On December 12, 1953, I summarized the general charges against you. On December 15th, you asked that the hearings be held at Fredericksburg rather than Charlottesville. On December 16th, I told you I was circularizing the Board members as to this request. On December 17th, I wired you and acquiesced in this request, and offered to send you the statements of the waitresses. On the same day you replied, requesting that I send these statements. On December 18th, I sent them. I also in the same letter outlined what Mrs. Jacobus and Miss Payne had said. On January 11, 1954, I wrote you, outlining the procedure to be followed at our meeting on February 12, 1954, and stating that the Board would give you a full opportunity to present your side of the matter, suggesting to you that you might wish to be represented by an attorney, and offering to obtain for you a copy of the stenographic record of the hearing on December 22, 1953. On January 15, 1954, you wrote me and stated that you did not have sufficient information as to the charges against you, and that you desired the stenographic record of the December 22nd hearing. You received this record either from me or the public stenographer, Mr. Craig. I replied on January 21, 1954, gave you the names of those who appeared before the Committee, and summarized the incidents which they had discussed, sent you a letter I had received from the Rev. Leslie E. Grace, the father of one of the girls reprimanded in your office, and promised to you that each of the persons who had made statements to the Committee would be present before the Board to state what they knew about the matter on February 12, 1954, and that you would be given full opportunity to question these persons and to refute their statements. As you know, these persons were present, as well as the girls who had been reprimanded in your office, and the sole reason why they did not appear before the Board was because of the compromise. I am at a loss to understand why you blame me for the fact that these persons did not make their statements before the Board, when the reason they did not do so was because of the compromise initiated by your attorney and agreed to by you.

One of the reasons given by you for entering this compromise was the avoidance of publicity which would surely have developed had the hearing proceeded. But it is hard for me to understand how in one breath you can maintain that you were attempting to avoid publicity, and in the next complain that the witnesses did not testify.

On January 23, 1954, I was informed that you had engaged Mr. Willis to represent you. I replied to his letter on January 29, 1954, writing in part as follows

"I had told Dr. Combs that we would hear his witnesses and listen to his statement on the 12th of February. However, in view of the exchange of correspondence between him and myself, this does not now seem feasible because he should have the opportunity of listening to and answering these witnesses who appeared before the Committee and who will now appear before the Board. Of course, I am very anxious to expedite the matter, and I had hoped that we could conclude the whole matter on February 12th, and have our regular meeting on February 13th However, it does not now seem to me that this will be possible, and I am wondering if you could have your witnesses ready to go on late in the afternoon of the 12th or the morning of the 13th - all in accordance with the time that is taken in hearing the witnesses produced by the Mary Washington Committee."

On February 8th, I wrote Mr. Willis as follows

"I think you are entitled to know every detail of the charges. Do not hesitate to ask any questions you desire, and if I can answer them, it will be done. It is for this reason that I am arranging to have those witnesses who appeared before the Mary Washington Committee appear before the Board so that you may listen to their statements and question them."

I received no further letters from Mr. Willis before the hearing on February 12, 1954, and it appears quite clear that I was justified in believing that you had all of the information you desired.

I did not turn over to you Mr. Berkeley's notes of our meeting in Richmond and Charlottesville in which we were attempting to find out if there were any substance to the charges against you. Mr. Berkeley is not a skilled shorthand reporter. He does not get all of the questions and answers in the order in which they are given, nor does he get the questions and answers in verbatim form in which they are made. What he is able to transcribe is his own idea of the substance of the questions and answers. In other words, he is not a court reporter. As you know, the omission of a single sentence may unconsciously distort the whole meaning. Mr. Woodward was most emphatic in saying that Mr. Berkeley's notes did not clearly represent what he had said. It seemed to me, after consultation with the Board members, that the fairest thing I could do with due regard to those with whom the Committee had conferred, and to you, was to require that the same people who had appeared before the Committee (when it was deliberating solely on the question as to whether there was any substance in the reports) again appear before the Board to tell their stories in your presence, and that of your attorney, with the full opportunity on your part to question these parties and to refute their statements. Had you desired a continuance after hearing these witnesses, I have not the slightest doubt that the Board would have agreed to this. I wrote you to this effect, and arranged to have those parties present, as well as the students whose statements you already had. It was upon the incidents which occurred in your office when you reprimanded these students that the Board's action was largely predicated.

On February 8, 1954, I wrote Mr. Willis, and in response to his inquiry, told him that the gravamen of the charges rested on the office conference with the students, explaining to him that in my opinion this was a serious incident, and discussing the statements of Miss Stephenson, Mrs. Russell and Mrs. Jacobus, as well as Mrs. Dameron's statements.

You complain that you did not secure the minutes of the Board meetings of December 11, 1953, January 8, 1954, and February 12, 1954, until "three weeks ago". I had thought that you had received these minutes in the natural course. But you certainly did receive them promptly when you asked for them. As far as I know, neither you nor your attorney had requested copies of these minutes until very recently. I had received requests for them from Mr. Walter Chinn, who said he was a friend of yours, but who also stated that he did not represent you. It did not seem to me proper to surrender these minutes to him without your permission and request. They contained matter which you might have objected to my placing in the hands of a stranger. So, I took the position that if you would request in writing that copies be sent Mr. Chinn, and he would state his purpose in desiring them, I would acquiesce. If I had surrendered these minutes to him without your consent, I have no doubt you might have reproached me for so doing. I am confirmed in this view because you did not give your permission.

You refer to the motion made by Mr. Gay on December 11, 1953, to suspend your administrative responsibilities pending further proceedings. All that he was suggesting was that during the period of investigation the administration of the school be placed in other hands, with the thought that a man who is under fire cannot effectively administer the affairs of the college. I do not believe that the implications which you draw from this motion that you were "a monster and a threat to the peace and safety of Mary Washington" are at all justified. At any rate, the attitude of the Board was pretty well shown by its rejection of Mr. Gay's motion by an almost unanimous vote, and its passage of a motion to afford to you a full opportunity to explain your position, and to allow you to remain in control during the investigation.

Your contribution to education has been such a magnificent one that the attitude shown in your statement to the Mary Washington Committee deeply stirs and troubles me. It seems a pity that you cannot round out your career in a spirit of unselfish cooperation.

I certainly did not knowingly convey the impression to anyone that "the Board, right or wrong" would not change its decision. In the first place, the decision was one concurred in by you. In the second place, I think the decision was a just one.

Your request that the matter be reopened was considered by the Board at length. It was decided not to reopen it. However, in your statement there appear references to what may be after-discovered facts or evidence not previously considered by the Board. With this thought in mind, the Board passed the following resolution

"That the Rector shall reply to the letter which Dr. Combs addressed to the Mary Washington Committee on December 9, 1954, and request that he submit to the Board a specific written statement of any new evidence that has become available to him since February 12, 1954, which was not available to the Board on that date, or prior thereto, his statement to include at least a brief summary of the purport of the new evidence, together with the names of any new witnesses."

Please submit this statement to the Chairman of the Mary Washington Committee, Dr. Dowell J. Howard. I am sure it will receive the careful attention of that Committee, and a report will be made by it to the Board. Any future action of the Board will be predicated on its consideration of the Committee report. I would appreciate your sending a copy of this statement to me.

The Rector reported that he had been requested last Monday by Messrs. Jere M. H. Willis and Alfred W. Garnett, attorneys for Dr. Combs to confer with them. At a conference in Richmond on February 10th they had advised him that Dr. Combs would be willing to relinquish the burden of administrative authority and responsibility at the College, providing he could continue in charge of new construction, fund raising, and related matters, and could retain the title of President. The Rector had stipulated that suitable letters be written by Dr. Combs to the parents of the four young ladies he had interviewed on November 19th and to the authors of letters received by the Board.

Following a recess, the committee reported back to the Board the following resolution, incorporating minor changes proposed by President Combs, and thereupon agreed to by him

**WHEREAS**, for several months past, the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia has been engaged in a careful investigation of substantial complaints concerning the administration of Mary Washington College by Dr. Morgan L. Combs in a manner adversely affecting student discipline and morale and proper faculty relations, and,

**WHEREAS**, the Rector and Visitors is of opinion that a rearrangement of responsibilities for the administration of Mary Washington College is both necessary and desirable, and,

**WHEREAS**, the Board's investigations have demonstrated the fact that administrative responsibilities heretofore assigned to President Combs are presently more than he is physically able to discharge in justice to himself and to the best interests of the College;

**NOW**, **THEREFORE**, **BE IT RESOLVED**:\
(1) That in the discharge of his duties as the principal administrative officer of Mary Washington College, the President of the University of Virginia shall have and exercise in respect to Mary Washington College supreme administrative authority,\
(2) That in pursuance of this authority the President of the University of Virginia be and he hereby is authorized to delegate the performance of such duties in respect to construction and development, solicitation of funds, and related matters as he in his discretion shall determine, to Morgan L. Combs, who shall retain the title of President of Mary Washington College until his retirement or so long as his performance of such duties is satisfactory to the Rector and Visitors,\
(3) That the President of the University of Virginia is further authorized to delegate all other administrative functions of Mary Washington College, including faculty relations, student relations, curriculum, internal budget, and control to such other administrative official or officials as shall be designated by him with the approval of the Rector and Visitors.

The resolution was adopted by the Board, and the Rector was authorized to issue copies of it to the press, with the statement that it had been read by President Combs, who was satisfied with its terms and resolved to cooperate fully in its execution.

It was further resolved as being the sense of the Board, subject to the State budget and conditioned on the establishment of satisfactory relationships at the College, that President Combs' salary be continued at its present rate.

The following letter, signed by Dr. Morgan L. Combs, was received by the Board on 12 February 1954, read aloud to the Board by the Rector, and ordered to be filed

I have read the resolution today adopted by the Board. It has my full approval and the implementation of it will have my full cooperation. In so doing I will:

1. Give my full and complete cooperation to any person or persons who are selected by President Darden to function in the manner contemplated by the resolution, and will so state publicly to the faculty, student body, and alumnae of Mary Washington College.
2. I will address suitable letters, in form to be agreed upon between my attorney, Jere Willis, and representatives of the Board, to all persons who wrote the Board regarding the recent investigation (a list of which will be furnished me by the Rector), stating that I agree with the action this day taken by the Board and that I am satisfied with the Board's disposition of the matter and its consideration and treatment of me.
3. That I will write suitable letters of apology to the parents of those young ladies who appeared in my office for disciplinary action in regard to the disturbances in the dining hall, in form to be approved by my attorney, Jere Willis, and representatives of the Board.

It is understood that the administrative dean or other officer of officers designated by the President would require and occupy the office facilities now occupied by me.

I further understand that at some time prior to my retirement, the Board will expect to pursue the matter of securing a suitable successor as President of the College.
