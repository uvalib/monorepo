The President presented a summary of the biennial budget request to the Governor and General Assembly for 1962-1964. Following the report by the President, a discussion ensued which was joined in by members of the Board and the Comptroller.

The President presented, and with the assistance of the Comptroller, explained in detail a new medical compensation plan which had been developed by the Clinical Staff Standing Committee for Remuneration and Contracts and approved by the Dean of the School of Medicine. A number of questions were raised concerning the plan and a general discussion followed.

At the conclusion of this discussion, the following resolution was adopted:

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that, effective 1 July 1961, the following compensation plan, as proposed by the Clinical Staff Standing Committee for Remuneration and Contracts and as approved by the Dean of the School of Medicine, shall govern the financial arrangements for the geographical full-time members of the Clinical Departments of the School of Medicine.

1. The proposed plan entails
   * (a) The establishment of a "Pool Fund" derived from a contribution from each Clinical Department of ten percent (10%) of its gross earnings.
   * (b) A percentage increase in total income of clinicians over the 1959-1960 or 1960-1961 income, whichever is the higher. (Physicians whose salaries are derived from grants and similar fixed income sources are not included.) The Bursar will determine the highest per cent financially feasible. The Bursar's calculations will provide the maximum raise possible for individuals and this raise will be in lieu of the Merit Raise for 1961-1962 (for 1961-1962 the Bursar's recommendation is 12%). A Departmental Chairman may, within the limits of his own departmental income, recommend to the Dean reasonable adjustments for income inequities in his Department. No individual shall be raised over a $27,500 ceiling.
   * (c) Provided experience in 1961-1962 indicates the plan to be a financially sound one, there will be a further increase in the income limits to the maximum permitted by the State of Virginia (the limits each year to be calculated by the Bursar).

2. Believing that the "Pool Fund" should be very clearly defined, the Committee (Clinical Staff Standing Committee for Remuneration and Contracts) offers the following specifications:
   * (a) The Pool Fund is to be derived solely from the contributions from each Clinical Department of only ten percent (10%) of its gross earnings exclusively from private practice and laboratory services.
   * (b) Contributions are to be made each month to the Pool Fund which will be held by the Bursar of the University of Virginia for appropriate distribution at or near the end of each fiscal year.
   * (c) The sole control of the Pool Fund shall rest in the hands of the Clinical Staff and the Dean of the School of Medicine. The Clinical Staff shall be represented by a committee of the Chairman of all Clinical Departments. The Bursar, as custodian of the Pool Fund, shall recommend disbursements from the Fund which must be first approved by the Dean and the Committee of the Chairmen of all Clinical Departments.
   * (d) Disbursements from the Pool Fund are to be made by the Bursar to the proper Clinical Departments and, in turn, the Clinical Departments will through the Bursar, distribute the money to the accounts of individuals.
   * (e) The Pool Fund cannot be used for Hospital, Medical School, or University purposes. It is to be used only for redistribution to Clinical Departments and as further specified in paragraph (3).
   * (f) The Clinical Departments are to use the Pool Fund first for assuring TIAA contributions of its practicing clinicians and the Dean of the School of Medicine and, second, for assuring, as far as possible, the attainment of their allowed income ceilings by practicing clinicians.
   * (g) If the Pool Fund should exceed its needs, it shall be returned to the Clinical Departments that contributed it on a prorata basis. Once returned to Clinical Departments it will be used as specified in paragraph (3).

3. Any money remaining in a Clinical Department account after its contribution to the Pool Fund, paying its general expenses, paying TIAA contributions for its members, and paying its members their collections up to allowed income ceiling shall be distributed as follows. One-third to its Reserve Fund, one-third to the Research and Development Fund, and one-third to the Pool Fund. Provided the Pool Fund does not need it, the money will be divided equally between the Departmental Reserve Fund and the Research and Development Fund, up to its proportionate share in a Research and Development Fund which may accumulate annually a sum of $25,000. If the Research and Development Fund does not realize $10,000 the first year, the deficit shall be made up by assessment of the Pool Fund. In subsequent years, if deficits occur, it is understood that the Pool Fund Committee must provide for them.

4. A Departmental Chairman wishing to fill a temporarily vacated position, or to establish a new position shall, as in the past, get the approval of the Dean and necessary money will automatically become a general departmental expense as specified in paragraph (3), exclusive of anticipated income from the Pool Fund.

5. The so-called $750 "Merit Raise" shall be, as in the past, a matter for the decision of the Departmental Chairman and the Dean and will automatically become a general departmental expense as specified in paragraph (3).

6. Prolonged illness of a clinician with consequent cessation of his earnings may be, at the discretion of the Departmental Chairman and the Dean, compensated for as a general departmental expense up to 100% of the clinician's ceiling for the first six months and thereafter the Departmental Chairman and the Dean are to make some suitable arrangement.

7. Clinicians who have retired from Departmental Chairmanships because of age (65) or other reasons, but remain as members of Clinical Departments until age 70 shall receive their earnings up to their allowed ceilings, less the usual deductions (Pool Fund, 10%, Departmental Expenses, 20%, Withholding Tax). Retired Chairmen who do not reach their allowed earned income ceiling must have the Dean's permission to have their income supplemented by their Department.

8. The estate of a clinician who dies while still a member of a Department shall retain indefinitely his rights to his earnings up to the time of his death. As a courtesy, however, money collected on his accounts shall be paid monthly to his heir without deductions for either the Pool Fund or Departmental expenses. Resigned or retired clinicians likewise shall retain indefinitely their rights in their earnings up to the time of separation from the Department. Money collected on their accounts shall be paid to them monthly after deducting ten percent (10%) for the Pool Fund and twenty percent (20%) for Departmental expenses.

9. Any question as to the interpretation of the provisions of this plan which shall arise during the time it is in force shall be adjudicated by the Clinical Staff Standing Committee for Remuneration and Contracts and the Dean of the School of Medicine, subject to the final approval of the President.

The President reported on athletic finances for the fiscal year 1960-1961 and on the current budget situation for the fiscal year 1961-1962. Copies of a summary report for these two years were distributed to each member of the Board.

The President presented a detailed report on the construction program at the University. Included in the presentation was a full report on the site plan and the design of University Hall.

The President reported on the enrollment for 1961-1962. He noted that the total enrollment as of the preceding day, 13 October, was 4,930, an increase of approximately 280 over the same period last year. He stated that the principal increase had come in the College of Arts and Sciences, although there had been a heartening increase in the enrollment in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.

The President presented for the Board's consideration a set of University regulations which would apply to all students in the schools at Charlottesville and would be published each year in the catalogues of these schools. He stated that the principal purpose was to make clear the authority of the University in certain respects and to eliminate any ambiguities which had developed over the years.

After full discussion, the following resolution was adopted:

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that, effective 1 September 1962, the following University Regulations shall apply to all students in the schools at Charlottesville and shall be published each year in the catalogues of these schools.

The information contained herein and any other information conveyed to students or to prospective students is subject to change at any time by the appropriate authority.

* **Registration** - Applicants seeking membership in the University, having been accepted for admission by proper admitting authority, should present themselves to the Dean or his representative of the school to which matriculation is sought, on the date specified in the Announcements of that School.

* **Delayed Registration** - Any student who fails to present himself at the times specified for registration will not be permitted to matriculate unless he can explain his delay to the satisfaction of the Dean of his School. If admitted after explanation, the student will be charged a delayed registration fee of fifteen dollars, ten dollars of which may be waived by the Dean of the School for proper cause.

* **Health Regulations** - Transfer and graduate students must furnish a health transcript from their former college prior to acceptance. Entering students are required to furnish statements of recent immunization against smallpox and tetanus as part of their applications. Physical examinations given at the University are required of all students enrolling in the regular session for the first time.

* **Withholding Academic Credit** - Grades and transcripts will be withheld for students and former students who have failed to meet their official financial obligations.

* The University reserves the right to suspend, enforce the withdrawal of, or expel a student whose academic standing or conduct is in its judgment unsatisfactory.

* The University further automatically will enforce the dismissal of a student certified to be guilty of a breach of the Honor System by the Honor Committee.

* **Attendance** - Students are required to attend classes throughout the session, with the exception of University holidays, and of absences authorized by the Student Health Service for illness or injury, unless permission to be absent temporarily or to withdraw has been first granted by the Dean of the School concerned. While in residence, students are required to attend lectures and other prescribed exercises of the courses for which they are registered, subject to penalties which the various Schools may impose for non-attendance.

* **Change of Address** - Each student is required to notify the University Registrar of any change of home address, change of the name or address of parent or guardian, or change of his or her legal name. When a student's legal name is changed, the student must provide the Registrar with a certified copy of applicable documents authorizing such change.

* All students not living in University Housing are required to notify the Registrar of any change of local address within 48 hours of such change.

* **Voluntary Withdrawal** - An official application to withdraw must be obtained from the Dean of the School in which the student is registered, and must be approved in writing by the Dean, with a statement of the reason for the withdrawal. A student under 21 years of age must have parental approval for such withdrawal. To clear the student's record, the application must then be endorsed by the Dean of the University, the University Librarian, the Bursar, the Student Health Service, the Housing Division (if living in University Housing), and a representative of the Honor Committee and the Judiciary Committee. A woman student must further obtain the endorsement of the Dean of Women. When complete, the withdrawal form must be deposited with the University Registrar. Student identification cards are to be deposited with the Registrar at the time of withdrawal.

* A student who withdraws from the University for reasons of ill health must obtain permission from the Department of Student Health, and subsequent medical clearance from the Department of Student Health is among the requirements for re-admission of all students.

* Failure to comply with the above regulations will subject the student to suspension from the University by the Dean of the University.

* **Enforced Withdrawal** - The several faculties of the Schools may impose enforced withdrawal as a penalty for habitual delinquency in class, habitual idleness, or any other fault which prevents the student from fulfilling the purposes implied by registration in the University.

* Enforced withdrawal may also be imposed for failure to take the physical examination of the University Student Health Service (required of all entering students), for failure to comply with the University's Tuberculosis Control Program, for failure to obtain Medical Leave or Medical Withdrawal from the Health Service in the case of repeated or prolonged absence from class, as a result of illness.

* Students of the University are expected to conduct themselves as ladies and gentlemen, both within the University and elsewhere. For student conduct which is outside the jurisdiction of the Honor Committee but which tends to discredit or injure the University, the President is authorized by the Board of Visitors to impose such penalty as he may deem appropriate, including expulsion from the University. This authority has been delegated by the President to the Student Judiciary Committee, subject to review by the President or his delegated representative. When the penalty for bad conduct is expulsion, the student may appeal the decision to the Board of Visitors.

* **Motor vehicle regulations** of the University apply to any vehicle which requires a state license. Any student who maintains or operates a motor vehicle and is not eligible to have motor vehicle privileges becomes subject to suspension.

* No first-year student in the undergraduate schools of the University shall be permitted to maintain or operate a motor vehicle at any time. Other students should write the Traffic Control Office, University of Virginia, for detailed information regarding motor vehicle privileges.

* Holders of University Scholarships are not permitted to own or operate motor-driven vehicles without consent of the Committee on Scholarships.

* The possession, storage, and use of any kind of ammunition, firearms, fireworks, explosives, air rifles, and air pistols is prohibited on University property, in fraternity houses, and on fraternity property.

* The University reserves the right to approve the housing arrangements of all students.

* All students entering one of the undergraduate schools directly from high or preparatory school, or as transfers from other colleges, are required to live in one of the Residence Houses during their first two regular semesters at the University and may be required to live in University accommodations during one additional session thereafter, prior to graduation. Other students may live in University accommodations on the Grounds, or in approved fraternity or rooming houses.

* The Director of Housing, upon request to him in writing, may authorize exceptions to these residence requirements in cases of those students who will live at home with their families. Married students who will establish their homes at the University do not require special permission.

* All rooms in University facilities are rented subject to the University Housing Terms and Conditions of Occupancy.

* All women students, regardless of school or status, are required to secure the approval for their living accommodations from the Dean of Women, and all correspondence about housing for women should be directed to that office.

* An active social program is conducted by the University Union, the Y.M.C.A., and other organizations approved by the University. Organizations or groups of students wishing to present a dance or other public social event must, however, obtain the permission of the Dean of the University. The names of the chaperones and members of the Floor Committee or Committee in Charge must be approved by the Dean of the University.

* Students who wish to publish, distribute, or sell any publication must first obtain the approval of the Student Council. The issuance, distribution, or sale of anonymous publications is forbidden, and is punishable by expulsion from the University.

* Solicitors and salesmen, except those on official business with the University, are not permitted on the Grounds of the University without permission of the Director of Housing and the Director of Student Aid and Placement.

* **Classification as a Virginia Student** - In order to be considered a Virginia student for any given semester, it is necessary that the applicant shall have been domiciled in the State of Virginia for at least one year immediately preceding the beginning of that semester, and the applicant or his parents must have been bona fide taxpayers to the State of Virginia for the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year of registration.

* Residence in the State for the purpose of securing an education does not qualify an individual for classification as a Virginia student.

* **Payment of Fees** - All fees and room rent are payable at the office of the Bursar. No student is permitted to complete registration or to attend classes until all fees are paid. Fees for each semester are due and payable at the time of registration.

In exceptional cases, the student may sign a contract for semester charges permitting payments as follows:

* **First Semester** - After applying required deposits, one-third of the balance at the time of registration, one-third on 3 November, one-third on 3 December.
* **Second Semester** - one-third at the time of registration, one-third on 3 March, one-third on 3 April.

A student who fails to meet payments when due, but who pays his fees on or before the fifteenth of the month in which payment is due, is charged a service fee of $1.00. A student who fails to meet payments by the fifteenth of the month in which payment is due will be automatically suspended and may not attend classes until he has been officially reinstated and has paid all accrued fees and a reinstatement fee of $5.00.

A student suspended for failure to meet payments when due may not be reinstated for the semester after two weeks from the date of suspension. Applications for reinstatement are to be made at the office of the Bursar.

* **Return of Fees** - A student withdrawing within five days after registration shall have his tuition and fees refunded in full except for the medical fee, which is not refundable, and the sum of $10 to cover cost of registration. If he withdraws voluntarily after the fifth day of the semester and before the middle thereof, his fees other than the medical fee shall be refunded pro rata. No refund of room rent shall be made. If the student is required to withdraw from the University at any time during the semester, or if he withdraws voluntarily after the middle thereof, no refund of tuition and fees for that semester shall be made.

* **Part-time Fees** - Students taking only one subject pay one-third of the regular tuition fee, plus the library building, medical, University Union, and student activities fees. Students taking only two subjects pay one-half of the regular tuition fee, plus all additional fees. Students taking more than two courses are considered full-time students and pay all tuition and auxiliary fees.

* Students not in residence at the University who wish to return to take an examination or receive a degree pay a $5.00 tuition fee for that semester and are exempt from all other fees.

* **Transcript Fee** - A fee of $1.00 is charged for each transcript of record.

* **ROTC Deposit and Fee** - Students enrolled in Army and Air Force ROTC programs are required to make a deposit of $20 on their uniforms and textbooks. At the end of each session, when uniforms and books are returned to the Supply Room, the deposit will be refunded if all items are turned in.

A ROTC Unit Student Activity Fee not exceeding $5.00 may be collected at the discretion of the Unit Commander.

* **Replacement of Diploma** - Candidates for degrees who fail to complete requirements at the specified time and for whom a new diploma must be engrossed for a later graduation will pay a fee of $10 for such diploma.

The cost of replacing a lost or destroyed diploma is $10.

By his Will dated 10 June 1892, probated 12 November 1894, in the Circuit Court of the City of Lynchburg, Edward J. Folkes devised and bequeathed certain improved real property, known as 620-622 Main Street, Lynchburg, Virginia, together with certain specified personal property to Randolph Harrison, in trust upon the expiration of a preceding life estate, the income to be paid to the University of Virginia for the purpose of scholarships. Upon the death of Randolph Harrison, Mr. Long was appointed as Trustee in his place and stead. Upon Mr. Long's death, Samuel H. Williams was appointed Trustee by order of the Circuit Court of Lynchburg entered 3 March 1934.

Mr. Williams now desires to resign as Trustee and has suggested that Mr. Douglas A. Robertson, of Lynchburg, Virginia, be appointed to succeed him.

After discussion of the matter upon motion duly seconded, it was unanimously,

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the Judge of the Circuit Court of Lynchburg, upon his acceptance of the resignation of Samuel H. Williams as Trustee u/w of Edward J. Folkes, be requested to appoint Douglas A. Robertson, as Trustee, in his place and stead, and that counsel acting in the matter on behalf of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia be authorized to move the court for such appointment.

**RESOLVED, FURTHER**, that the appreciation and gratitude of this Board be extended to Mr. Williams for the faithful and devoted services he has rendered as such Trustee to the University of Virginia over the period of more than 26 years.

The President proposed and the Board adopted the following resolutions:

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that Mr. David B. Moyer be and he is hereby relieved of his duties as Military Property Custodian of the University.

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that Mr. Bernard McGinty be and he is hereby designated Military Property Custodian of the University with the power to requisition, receive, store, and account for military property and otherwise transact business pertaining thereto, for and in behalf of the University of Virginia.

The President reported on the requests received from the Covington-Clifton Forge and Lynchburg communities for the establishment of a community college of the University in each of those locations. In this regard he noted that he had restated the policy of the Board of Visitors with respect to the establishment of community colleges at a teachers' meeting which he had addressed in Arlington in August. This policy is to the effect that a request for a community college, following the experience at Clinch Valley College and George Mason College, would be instituted by the establishment of an off-campus branch in which the first two years of college work would be offered. If the response to this program met the minimum standards for enrollment as established by the State Council of Higher Education, then steps could be taken to ask the Governor and the General Assembly for capital outlay funds to construct a permanent building to house a community college.

The President reported that he had communicated this policy to the Covington-Clifton Forge group and had included in the University's biennial budget request an item for the establishment of an off-campus branch in which two years of college work would be offered beginning in September 1962. The Covington-Clifton Forge group had notified the University, however, that they desired a permanent building to house a community college and had therefore withdrawn their request for affiliation in order to approach another institution.

On the other hand, the President had received an enthusiastic response from the Lynchburg group and, therefore, the request for the establishment of an off-campus branch there would be retained in the University's biennial budget.

The President concluded his remarks by noting that this policy offered the best means for obtaining a correct answer to the question as to the actual need for a two-year college program in those areas seeking affiliation with the University.

The President proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the Hospital Accounts Committee be and it is hereby authorized to charge off as uncollectible accounts Schedules 987, 988, 991, 992, 1002, 1003, 1006, 1007, 1009, 1010, 1013, 1014, 1016, 1017, 1020, 1021, 1023, 1024, 1027, and 1028, aggregating $287,228.87, as recommended by it, consisting of the following.

The President recalled to the Board that under the provisions of Article 8 of the Charter of The Mariners' Museum, as amended, in the event any attempt shall be made to merge said corporation with any other institution or institutions, or otherwise, or to alter or change the character of said corporation, the property of said corporation and the title thereto shall immediately pass to and vest in the University of Virginia. Because of this remote interest The Mariners' Museum has felt it incumbent to consult the University and obtain its approval of its actions from time to time.

He further stated that on 12 March 1959, The Mariners' Museum entered into a lease with the Newport News General and Non-Sectarian Hospital Association, Inc. covering a portion of the real estate owned by the Museum to which lease the University had given its approval.

To enable the Hospital Association to borrow from the Federal Housing and Home Finance Agency the sum of $420,000.00, the Museum has now agreed to convey to the Hospital Association a tract of 1.95 acres of its land, being a portion of the land under lease dated 12 March 1959, the tract of 1.95 acres in turn to be conveyed by the Hospital Association as security for the proposed loan. The deed from the Museum to the Hospital Association contains an express provision that upon the proposed debt of $420,000.00 being paid and released, title to the 1.95 acres of land shall revert to the Museum. The University is requested to unite in the contemplated deed as evidence of its approval of the terms and conditions thereof.

The President further stated that Mr. Minor, the University's Special Counsel, had given it as his opinion that the University could unite in the proposed deed without first obtaining the approval of the Governor, inasmuch as the University was not conveying any interest in property by so uniting.

The proposed deed was then submitted to the meeting.

After discussion and careful consideration, upon motion duly made, seconded and passed, it was

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the President and Secretary be and they hereby are authorized, directed and empowered to unite, in the name and on behalf of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, in the deed from The Mariners' Museum to Newport News General and Non-Sectarian Hospital Association, Inc. dated 14 October 1961, conveying a tract of 1.95 acres of land in the City of Newport News, Virginia, therein more fully described, for the sole purpose of evidencing its approval of the terms and conditions of such deed, and to affix the corporate seal of the Rector and Visitors thereto, and further to acknowledge and deliver the same to The Mariners' Museum.

The President called the Board's attention to the resolution it had passed on 2 June 1961 establishing an application fee of $10 for all applications for admission to the schools of the University with the exception of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the effective date of which for that school was left to the discretion of the President. The President stated, however, that some misunderstanding had resulted with respect to the effect of this fee on graduate students in the other schools at the University. He desired, therefore, to present a new resolution which would empower him to establish the effective date of the application fee for graduate students in these schools.

The President proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the resolution adopted on 2 June 1961 imposing an application fee for admissions be and it is hereby amended and re-enacted to read as follows:

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that, effective 1 September 1961, each person applying for admission to a degree program in any college of the University shall pay an application fee of $10 which shall be non-refundable, provided, however, that the effective date of this resolution for all students applying for admission to degree programs beyond the baccalaureate degree in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, School of Education, School of Engineering, and School of Law shall be set by the President.

The President asked for comments on the preliminary meeting of the Board held the preceding day on 13 October 1961, which was devoted to a review of the work of the College of Arts and Sciences. There was a unanimous reaction of approval of the meeting and of the plan to hold similar meetings in the future. The consensus was that the planning of future meetings should be left in the hands of the President and that these meetings should allow more time for a question-and-answer period among members of the Board and the faculty.

The President announced the following gifts and grants:

The Chancellor proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution:

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the following persons be and they are hereby elected to the faculty of Mary Washington College:

* Mrs. Cartha Jean Bragg as Instructor in Art, part-time, for one year, effective 1 September 1961, at a salary of $2,400.
* Miss Mary Eleanor Montgomery as Instructor in Mathematics, for one year, effective 1 September 1961, at a salary of $4,800.
* Mr. Tetsuo Ochikubo as Visiting Professor of Art, for one year, effective 1 September 1961, at a salary of $8,000.

The Chancellor proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution:

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the following person be and she is hereby re-elected to the faculty of Mary Washington College:

* Mrs. Helen R. Luntz as Visiting Associate Professor of Modern Foreign Languages, half-time, for one year, effective 1 September 1961, at a salary of $3,100.

The Chancellor proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution:

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the following person shall receive the salary indicated:

* Mrs. Jean Slater Edson, Assistant Professor of Music, from three-fifths to four-fifths time, for one year, effective 1 September 1961, at a salary of $5,120.

The Chancellor announced the following resignations:

* Mr. Joseph Aposhyan, Assistant Professor of Psychology, effective 30 June 1961, to accept a position at Richmond Professional Institute.
* Mr. W. J. Pitman, Assistant Professor of Biology, effective 30 June 1961, to accept a position at Murray State College, Kentucky.

The Chancellor called to the attention of the Board a resolution it had passed some years ago barring males from pursuing courses for credit at Mary Washington College. He noted that this applied to the faculty as well as to regular students and that some discrimination was evident because female members of the faculty could take courses for credit while male members could not. He stated further that Mr. John T. Fauls, a member of the Mary Washington College faculty, had been permitted to enroll in courses during the past summer in order to pursue work to assist him in becoming qualified in a certain field. He asked for the Board's approval of this action.

The Chancellor proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution:

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that, effective 1 June 1961, Mary Washington College be and it is hereby authorized to register and record in its files the grades of Mr. John T. Fauls, Associate Professor of Psychology at Mary Washington College, earned or to be earned in academic courses approved by the Chancellor.

The Chancellor stated that there is a parcel of property at the intersection of College Avenue and U. S. Alternate Route 1, triangular in shape, which forms the south entrance to College Avenue from U. S. Alternate Route 1. The Chancellor noted that the property was divided in ownership between two persons. From one of these persons, the Chancellor was unable to get a commitment as to a price. The owners of the other parcel had indicated their willingness to accept an offer of $7,500. The Chancellor noted further that the property is undeveloped, creates an unsightly entrance to the College area, and presents a traffic hazard for students entering the highway from this point. The College would plan to landscape the property in order to improve this entrance to the College area.

The Chancellor stated that the proposal had been approved by the President, the Mary Washington College Committee, the Buildings and Grounds Committee, and the Executive Committee. The need for approval by the Executive Committee was in order to conclude the purchase prior to the meeting of the Board, since the Governor had indicated his approval of the proposal.

The Chancellor proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution:

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the action of the Executive Committee on 15 September 1961 authorizing the purchase of a parcel of property adjacent to Mary Washington College, being made up of portions of Lots 7, 8, and 10, Block 48, on Plat of Fredericksburg Development Company, the approval of the Governor having been first obtained, be and it is hereby ratified and approved.

The Chancellor reported on the biennial budget request to the Governor and the General Assembly for 1962-1964.
