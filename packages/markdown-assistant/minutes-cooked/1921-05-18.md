President Alderman, chairman of the special committee on new gymnasium site, reported that arrangements had been made with the Y. M. C.

M. C. A. Board and make such terms as necessary.

The President was authorized to make interim appointments of assistants, student assistants, scholarship and fellowship holders and report at the fall meeting of the Board.
