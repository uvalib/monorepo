This meeting was devoted to a consideration of the report of the Special Committee which the Senate had appointed on 27 May 1958 to assist the Board of Visitors in its search for a successor to President Darden. The University Senate's Special Committee, at this meeting, unanimously addressed a statement to the Board's Committee on the Nomination of a President which reads as follows:

"WHEREAS: The Board of Visitors of the University sincerely sought the advice and counsel of the University Senate during its search for a successor to Mr. Darden;

The President submitted to the Board copies of a sketch showing the plan for rearranging the north entrance to the Rotunda between University Avenue and the new construction recently completed. He stated that, while he would submit the plan for final approval at the June meeting of the Board, he would like to have informal authorization from the Board to present the plan to Mr. Coxe, Chairman of the Buildings and Grounds Committee who was unavoidably absent from the meeting, and the Art Commission. After consideration of the sketch, the President was authorized to seek the tentative approval of Mr. Coxe and to present the proposal to the Art Commission for its approval.

The President reported that Professor Quincy Wright, who had been previously elected as a member of the faculty of the Woodrow Wilson Department of Foreign Affairs, had arrived in Charlottesville and had taken over his classes on 1 November 1958. The President pointed out further that Professor Wright's delay in arriving in Charlottesville was by agreement with the Department of Foreign Affairs and was for the purpose of permitting him to visit universities and international law centers in Southeast Asia and the Far East from which the University draws students. In view of these arrangements, the President recommended that Professor Wright be paid his salary for the month preceding 1 November.

The Board adopted the following resolution:

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that Professor Quincy Wright of the Woodrow Wilson Department of Foreign Affairs be paid his regular salary for the month of October 1958 in view of the fact that during that month he was visiting institutions in Southeast Asia and the Far East at the request of the Woodrow Wilson Department of Foreign Affairs.

The President reported that Mr. Stanley H. Botts of the faculty of Clinch Valley College had been recommended for promotion from Instructor to Assistant Professor of Commerce in September 1958. Because of a clerical error, Mr. Botts' proposed promotion had not been submitted to the Board of Visitors for action. Because of another error, however, Mr. Botts has been paid the salary of an assistant professor at Clinch Valley College since September 1958. The President recommended that Mr. Botts receive his promotion effective retroactive to September 1958 in order that the clerical errors which had been committed might not cause him to lose a portion of his salary for reasons over which he had no control.

The following resolution was adopted by the Board:

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that Mr. Stanley H. Botts be and he is hereby promoted from Instructor to Assistant Professor of Commerce at Clinch Valley College effective 1 September 1958.

The President stated that certain difficulties had arisen in connection with the protection of property owned by the University in Naples, Florida. These difficulties arose out of the fact that the property, which is located within the city limits of Naples, was not posted and hence the police department of the City of Naples was not authorized to prosecute trespassers. The President had received a letter from the Chief of Police in Naples in which he stated that if the property was posted, the police would be pleased to prosecute any trespassers found on the property.

The Board adopted the following resolution:

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the President be and he is hereby authorized to post the property of the University owned in Naples, Florida and to inform the Chief of Police of Naples that the property is posted and that he has authority to prosecute any trespassers found on the property.

The President presented to the Board copies of proposed changes in the regulations governing student eligibility for the operation of motor vehicles. These proposals were designed as amendments to the regulations which the Board had adopted at its meeting on 14 June 1958. The President pointed out that the regulations had been originally presented to him by the Committee on Undergraduates and that they had been revised in cooperation with the Dean of the University and the Student Council. He concluded by stating that the regulations as submitted bore his approval and that of the Dean of the University and the Student Council.

After considerable discussion, the Board adopted the following resolution:

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the changes in the regulations governing student eligibility for the operation of motor vehicles, proposed jointly by the President, the Dean of the University, and the Student Council, be and they are hereby adopted as set forth below.

With certain exceptions, hereinafter set forth, the following are recommended to become effective with the entering class of 1958-1959. These regulations apply to the regular academic session, including all special occasions, and are intended to remain in effect until the Spring of 1963, at which time they may be reviewed.

General Montague, Chairman of the special committee appointed by the Rector at the meeting of the Board on 14 February 1959 to consider proposed changes in the regulations governing the determination of student domicile for tuition purposes, reported to the Board on behalf of himself and his fellow committee members, Visitors Fenwick and Greear. The committee proposed the deletion of the second paragraph of the regulations adopted by the Board at its meeting on 10 September 1954.

The following resolution was adopted by the Board:

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the rules governing the determination of student domicile for tuition purposes as adopted on 10 September 1954 be and they are hereby amended to read as follows:

In order to be considered a Virginia student for any given semester, it is necessary that the applicant shall have been domiciled in the State of Virginia for at least one year immediately preceding the beginning of that semester, and the applicant or his parents must have been bona fide taxpayers to the State of Virginia for the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year of registration.

Residence in the State for the purpose of securing an education does not qualify an individual for classification as a Virginia student.

The President reported that the Athletics Committee, to which had been referred with power to act a proposal at the meeting on 14 February 1959 that the contract of Mr. Richard Voris as Head Football Coach be extended for an additional year until February 1962 with no change in salary, had approved the proposal.

The President called to the attention of the Board the action taken at the meeting on 14 February 1959 in referring to the Athletics Committee the proposal of the Department of Athletics that each member of the teaching and administrative staff of the University be permitted to buy two season football tickets at one-half the regular price. This proposal, which the Board had referred to the Athletics Committee with power to take final action, had received the unanimous approval of the Athletics Committee.

The Chancellor presented the proposed biennial budget for Mary Washington College for 1960-1962 which he stated had received the approval of the Mary Washington College Committee at its meeting on the previous evening.

After discussion, the Board adopted the following resolution:

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the proposed biennial budget for Mary Washington College of the University of Virginia for the biennium beginning on 1 July 1960 and ending on 30 June 1962, as laid before the Board and as previously approved by the Mary Washington College Committee, be and it is hereby approved.

On motion the meeting was then adjourned.
