On motion, it was resolved,- That the resignation of Mr. McKergow be accepted by the Board, and that the President be authorized to convey the regrets of the Board to Mr. McKergow.

On motion, it was resolved That Mr. Charles Hancock be elected Adjunct Professor of Mechanical Engineering in the University of Virginia, at a salary of $1,500.00 per annum, to enter upon his duties September 10, 1908.

Resolved: (a) That a sum not exceeding $2,000.00 be appropriated for the purchase and installation of a mechanical refrigeration plant for the University Dining-Hall, which is made necessary in order to reduce the cost of supplies.

(Memo: It will be recalled that this money will have to be taken from the general appropriation of $65,000.00 made by the last legislature.)

Resolved: That the filling of the full professorships in Chemistry and Physics be postponed until the session of 1908-'9.

(Memo The Rector will recall the reasons given by the President, setting forth the impossibility of supplying these places, or of finding suitable men for recommendation to the Board.

The following resolution presented by the President and adopted by the General Faculty, May 23rd, 1908, was at this time, adopted by the Board,-

"The General Faculty and the President recommend to the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the various existing schools of science and such schools of science as may hereafter be created, including the Department of Agriculture, be organized into a Department of Science, either as a separate department, or in a relation to some other department now existing in the University. The recent large expansion of several of these schools suggests this organization, and the needs of our society for trained teachers of science, for scientific experts, and for scientific-minded men in industrial life demand it. The nature of the organization of this department, as well as the scope and content of its curriculum, are now before the faculties involved, and a definite recommendation concerning these matters will be hereafter submitted to the Rector and Visitors for final action.

Resolved: That the Board adopts the above recommendation of the General Faculty and President and postpones further and more definite action until the final recommendation framed by the Faculty and President has been received.

The letter of the Miller Board follows

> I am directed by the Miller Board of Trustees of the University of Virginia to transmit to you to be laid before your Board, the following resolutions of the Miller Board of Trustees of the Agricultural School of the University of Virginia, adopted at their meeting held on Saturday, June 13th, 1908:-
>
> "The Trustees of the Miller Fund earnestly desiring the widest efficiency of the instruction provided for the University under the terms of the deed of trust have carefully considered the proposal to change the name of the Department of Agriculture to that of the Department of Science and to enlarge its scope. They cordially approve the proposed change of name, with the express understanding that the School of Agriculture called for by the terms of Mr. Miller's deed of trust be made an integral part of the proposed department and the hope that provision will be made for instruction in the important subject of Forestry."
