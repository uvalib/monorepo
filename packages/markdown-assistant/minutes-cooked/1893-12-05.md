Board of Visitors' minutes, Accession # RG-1/1/, Special Collections Dept., University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Va.

Minutes of meetings of the university's governing body which is the legal owner and operator of the institution. Recorded in the minutes are appointments and other personnel decisions concerning faculty, decisions about construction of facilities, gifts to the university, and all other board actions, decisions and resolutions.

At a called meeting of the Board of Visitors held here this day, called by the Rector and held in pursuance of notice.

Present, The Rector, Dr Randolph, and Messrs Kean, Parrish, McCabe and Patteson, of the Visitors.

The Chairman of the Faculty presented the Faculty's report and other documents, for the consideration of the Board.

Resolved, that the dormitory on the West Lawn now occupied by Profr W. M. Lile as an office be and the same is hereby assigned to him for that use.

A petition of the students attending the School of Modern Languages asking that French and German shall be regarded each, as a Separate School for the M. A. degree was read and on motion referred to the Committee on the Conduct Schools etc. for consideration and report to the Board.

The Committee on the Conduct of Schools etc submitted the following report, which, together with its recommendations, was approved and adopted by a unanimous vote:

In answer to the petition of a number of Students in the "School of Modern Languages" that French & German should be regarded each as a separate school for the M. A. degree, resolved, that, after mature consideration, the petition be denied, it being the sense of the Board that, while it is proper that French & German should count each as a separate course for the B. A. degree, it is important that the applicant for the higher, (M.A.), degree, should have successfully passed examination in the "School of Modern Languages" (both French & German), should he elect Modern Languages as one of his subjects for that degree.

The Board after considering the recommendation of the Faculty to authorize the building of a Hospital at the University unanimously adopted the following resolutions in regard thereto:

Resolved I. That in the opinion of the Board the funds of the University are not in condition to authorize the building of a Hospital as suggested by the Faculty.

II. That it is the sense of the Board that the interests of the University will not be promoted by taking it into the controversy in which the two Medical Schools in Richmond are now engaged before the Legislature in relation to establishing a State Hospital.

Resolved that in the place of appropriating $1275.00 for the purpose of making card catalogues of the Library, this amount is hereby appropriated to be expended in making purchases of periodicals and books.

Resolved that the sum of $500.00 be appropriated as a guarantee fund for the purpose of establishing a quarterly University Bulletin to be edited under the Supervision of the Faculty of the University of Virginia.

Resolved that the application of Morton W. Baker for appointment to the "John Y. Mason Fellowship" to begin with the session of 1894-5, to enable him to pursue a graduate course in Latin, & Greek, be granted.

Mr Charles H. Read, Jr, Architect who was engaged to make an examination of the Medical Hall which was thought to be unsafe, appeared before the Board and submitted his report in regard to its condition, which report is in the following words and figures, to wit:

In response to a call from the Superintendent of Grounds & Buildings, Profr W. H. Echols, I have today visited and inspected the Medical Building on West Range, regarding which some questions have been raised as to its stability & safety; & would hereby make my report as to the condition I found the Building in, and submit as the result my opinion on the points in question.

With the assistance of Mr Echols, two lines of levels were run around the Building with an accurate field instrument about Eight ft apart & through that part of the building to which attention had been called as showing weakness in the external walls. Sight lines were also taken on brick courses at lower levels, & in both cases by both instruments & Eye the walls were found to be exceptionally true for a building of this character, & no indications whatever were found either in the exterior, or interior basement walls of settling. No cracks were discovered that seemed to indicate that the walls were not abundantly able to safely carry all floor & roof weights that it is probable they will ever be called upon to bear.

The front, rear, & side walls are practically plumb, as well as absolutely level on joint beds, up to the offset from an 18 inch to a 13 inch wall on the level of the second story floor. Above the point on the Front (or East side) of the Building, the wall dishes inward towards the top, & had done so when the roof was put on, as is shown by the thickening of the wood casing at the center & bottom of the Freize.

At the rear (or west side) of the building, there is an outward bulge about the level of the Third story floor, but both of these deflections from vertical planes have been known to exist for some time, the former Superintendent Maj. Peyton having noticed them twenty five years ago & had a careful examination by competent experts made, which resulted in a favorable report as to their stability and strength, though not exactly true in their lines.

The present Supt Mr Echols, on having his attention called to these deflections about a year ago, took accurate observations with a plumb bob & has recently repeated them without being able to find that the slightest change had taken place.

The face of the north wall shows also some departure from a true vertical, but there is no sign that this is of recent date.

The above stated facts would seem therefore to agree that the upper part of the building was not built to true lines when originally constructed about sixty years ago, & the fact that there are no interior brick walls above the Basement, nor any pilasters on the outside or inside to stiffen the long reaches of about forty ft.& help to keep them true; would itself account for the present condition the walls are in. As there are no external signs of any changes in the position of the walls since it was erected that can be detected, I am of the opinion that the Building is as safe now as it has ever been, & that with the proper amount of care & looking after needful to the preservation of all building property; can be kept so for an indefinite number of years.

I would recommend the pointing of the joints that have come out, & the filling & grading at north rear corner so as to divert all surface water away from the foundation walls.

Having found no just cause for any apprehension from an external examination of the building, attention was next turned to the interior construction with the following result.

Above the basement floor the entire interior of the Building is of frame construction, the middle portion of the floors being carried by joists resting on strong girders of short spans, which are supported by stout wooden columns, the lowest series of which rest on brick partition walls in the Basement.

These columns were tested and found to be in true vertical lines over each other, thereby answering any questions as to the shifting of floor timbers and floor \[wads?] from their proper supports so as to have had any part in producing the departures from plumb lines in the brick walls heretofore referred to.

The Girders running north and south, & carrying the floor joists were found to rest square on their beds, nor was any "twisting" found to exist except that of some light ¾ inch warped casing, which on being taken off exposed the girder in good order & proper position.

The roof construction is a simple deck and hipped roof sufficiently tied together to keep from spreading. Four stout posts resting almost directly on the line of column & girder construction below act as auxiliary supports for the deck portion of the roof. I advise that these four posts be braced & trussed together as a stile from their protection against any unusual wind pressure or snow load.

The chimney that has been built for the Furnace flue from the Basement up through the roof, was built independent of the rear wall. The footings of this chimney rest partly on the heel course of the rear wall of the building.

When it began to settle, as all new brick work may be expected to do, it parted away from the rear wall, cracking the plaster in the corners where it adjoined the rear wall through each of the three upper stories & shows a settlement on these floors of from 1/4 to 3/8 of an inch.

In the basement a rotation & sliding away from the rear wall shows itself until the chimney & rear wall have become entirely separated. The rear wall of the building does not appear to have suffered in any way from the settling of \_\_\_\_\_ Chimney.

This chimney should be taken down & rebuilt on a foundation entirely independent of the walls of the building.

The foundation should be of concrete of sufficient size to carry, not more than two to two & one half tons to sq. ft bearing surface.

The bricks now in this chimney are of inferior quality & should be replaced with first class hard brick, laid in strong cement mortar and well hammered down with close joints to reduce any settling to a minimum.

The cracks shown in the joints between stud & brick walls (as shown in the plastering), are nothing more than what might be expected at the unions of old well settled brick walls & new frame stud partitions. These cracks should be pointed up, as they have in all probability by this time reached their extreme limit.

In closing my report, it is, I think, proper that I should call your attention to the fact that—; "The Life of a Building"—; is prolonged in proportion to the care taken of it. This applies not only to replacing from time to time what is worn out on the inside by use of it.

The elements are always on the watch to get in their work of disintegration on the outside of some neglected opening or crevices from the highest coping to the lowest foundation stone, & a careful supervision that will foresee & prevent it will not only lessen the "Expense of Repairs", but tend also to preserve & prolong the Life, Safety & Stability of the old University Buildings.

All of which is respectfully submitted.

On motion it was ordered that the report be received and recorded.

Mr Read having stated that in his opinion the sum of $150. would cover the expense of the improvements suggested in his report, to the Medical Hall. On motion it was,

Resolved that a sum not exceeding $150.00 be appropriated to be expended for the purpose of repairing the Medical Hall, in the particulars set forth in the report of Mr Chas H. Read, Jr, which has been submitted to the Board and filed.

At this stage of the proceedings Mr Parrish was called away by a business engagement in the City of Richmond, leaving the Board without a quorum. Business was suspended for a very short time, when Dr Martin arrived and took his seat in the Board thus restoring the quorum.

On motion of Mr Patteson, Resolved, that the sum of three hundred dollars be appropriated as the annual salary of the Secretary of the Board and of the Executive Committee of the Board and that this resolution is take effect from June 1893, the date of the annual meeting of the Board.

Resolved, that in accordance with the recommendation of the Faculty, Mr E. L. Woodward be awarded his M. A. degree upon the conditions named in his letter of Sep 11th, submitted this day to the Board, the conditions being that he is released from passing the examinations in B. A. Greek, the lectures of which he has already attended.

Resolved, that the consideration of so much of the Faculty's report as relates to Fellowships be postponed until the adjourned meeting on January 5th 1894 and that the Faculty, in accordance with a previous resolution passed by the Board on July 20th 1893 submit to the Board a scheme of awarding Fellowships as a reward & encouragement for work done in the Academic Schools of the University.

Resolved, that the sum of ($11000) One hundred and ten dollars is hereby appropriated to procure specimens of chemical products from Germany, as recommended by the Faculty in their report.

Resolved, that the Proctor be charged with the duty of looking after the safety, and collection of all legacies, or other funds given to the University in any form of donation, and whether payable at once, or after an intermediate estate or interest, and that he communicate the state of each such donation to the Board, in his annual report.

Resolved, that the consideration of so much of the Faculty's Report as relates to the appropriations for necessary extension of the Mess Hall, for examination of the installation of Electric wires, for addition to salary of Instructor in Mechanical Engineering, for repairs to arcade roofs, for additional public lights, & for increase in the number of Miller Scholarships, & for the readjustment of the fees in the Medical Department, be postponed until the adjourned meeting on January 5th 1894.

Mr Camm Patteson moved to reconsider the action of the Board taken to-day in relation to the establishment of a hospital at the University, and that the Chairman of the Faculty, and the Medical Faculty, who had notification of the action of the Board and had expressed a wish to appear before the Board and be allowed a hearing on the question. Whereupon the Board decided to accord to these gentlemen the opportunity they desired, and they were invited and came before the Board and were heard at length. After which the following was adopted.

On the motion of Mr Patteson to reconsider the action of this Board taken this day relative to the erection and establishment of a hospital at this place the Board doth entertain the same and doth postpone any action on the said motion to reconsider until the fifth day of January 1894, to which date this meeting is adjourned.

Resolved that the members of the Board who are present make an earnest appeal to each of their colleagues to attend the adjourned meeting to be held on the 5th of January 1894.

On motion the Board then adjourned to meet on the 5th of January 1894, at 6 P. M.
