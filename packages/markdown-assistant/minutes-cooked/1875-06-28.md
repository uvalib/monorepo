The Rector, Mr. Kean, appeared and took his seat as President of the Board.

The Finance Committee submitted their report which upon being read and considered was on motion adopted and ordered to be spread upon the minutes and reads as follows:

The Committee on Finance offer the following report.

1. After consideration of the communication of Mr. Thomas D. Ranson respecting the legacy bequeathed to the University by the late Thomas Johnson of the County of Augusta we recommend the passage of the following resolution:

That the Rector is authorised and requested forthwith to employ counsel for prosecution of the rights of the University in the estate of Thomas Johnson decd. and that the counsel employed be instructed to take energetic measures for realising the fund so soon as may be, with due regard to the interests of the University.

The Rector is visited with full authority to contract with counsel for their compensation, but the Board expresses a preference that such compensation shall be contingent on, and be paid only out of the collections from this account.

2. We recommend the following resolution:

Resolved, that the resolution in reference to Room rent, passed 28th of June 1873, and found at page 348 of the Minutes, \[p. 396 in typed copy] shall not be continued so as to require payment of room rent by students residing with their parents or relatives.

Allow me through your body to present to the University the polygraph used by Mr. Jefferson for the last twenty years of his life. In reserving for publication many thousand of these letters, they were found accurate facsimiles of his hand writing: no error except where the record pen was caught by some irregularity in the paper. When extricating itself with a spring it missed a few letters leaving space for them.

Resolved, That the medical professors be and they are hereby authorized in the event of a vacancy in the office of Matron of the Infirmary to make such arrangements for the supplying of a suitable Matron as in their discretion may seem best- provided the appropriation for the salary of the Matron be not exceeded.

That a copy of the foregoing resolution be transmitted to Col. Randolph by the Secretary.

Resolved, that the resolution in reference to Room rent, passed 28th of June 1873, and found at page 348 of the Minutes, \[p. 396 in typed copy] shall not be continued so as to require payment of room rent by students residing with their parents or relatives.

We recommend the following appropriations for the ensuing year.

The Committee make this partial report and will hereafter make a further report.

Your Committee respectfully report that in the performance of their duties they have made such an inspection of the grounds & public buildings as their opportunities have made practicable and they are gratified to be able to state that both are in as good condition as could be expected or required under the circumstances. The Grounds exhibit evidence of careful attention and the Buildings show that every effort within the means of the Proctor has been made to preserve them, and to prevent as far as possible the decay inevitable from the want of the necessary repairs. In this connection Your Committee will inform the Board that they have called upon the Proctor to furnish them an estimate of the amount necessary to put the Buildings & Grounds in perfect order with a view to such action by the Board as will secure this sum, and they respectfully suggest that the General Assembly should be called for an appropriation for this purpose. Your Committee are aware of the consequences involved in any appearance of the University before the Legislature as an applicant for assistance, but they can but think that this body would recognize the necessity for preserving from loss the investment which the state has made here, and would accordingly provide the requisite funds. Your Committee therefore recommends that the executive Committee should be authorized to apply to the Legislature for an appropriation for this purpose, should they upon inquiry deem it judicious to do so.

Your Committee with the light of the Faculty's interesting and elaborate report in reference to the sanitary condition of the University desire to say that they are satisfied that already everything expedient to promote it, and to remove the causes which have heretofore endangered it, has been accomplished, The sewers have been extended so as to make their discharge outside of the precincts of the University sufficiently far off to render impossible any infection of the air or water in and about the University and such other provisions made for the proper action of these sewers as will insure their cleanliness and efficiency. Your Committee further state that they together with a Committee of the Miller Board, and accompanied by the Proctor, examined the land belonging to the University and adjacent to it, which the Miller Board desire to be assigned to them for their experimental farm and they are satisfied that it would be judicious to comply with the request of the Miller Board and they accordingly recommend that the area of this tract not now used by the professors as gardens, and not including the mountain be turned over to the Miller Board for such use as they see fit to apply it to during the pleasure of the Board of Visitors. It is estimated that about 40 acres, will be included in the boundaries agreed upon and pointed out by the Proctor.

It seems but just, as well as clear to the interest of the University that the parsonage should be preserved, and as the University has received this property as a donation Your Committee conceives that it is under obligation to keep it in such order as its finances will allow and therefore it is submitted that the Proctor should be advised that the property is as much under his charge as any building on the grounds, and that he shall make the repairs necessary to make it agreeably tenantable.

Your Committee it will be observed omitted to suggest any action as to the proposition of the Faculty to assign the vacant hotel at the South end of the Eastern Range to the Messing system with a view to its extension and placing it within the reach of a larger number of students than is practicable under the present facilities not being sufficiently apprised on the subject to enable them to act advisedly. Upon reflection your Committee deem it wise that any encouragement should be affected for the largest success of the Messing system, and they therefore recommend that the Hotel in question shall be placed at the disposal of the Faculty to be used for the system under such restrictions and safeguards as the Faculty may prescribe. Your Committee however suggest that a moderate revenue should be derived from this hotel, and in as much as the students who mess are obliged to provide themselves accommodations Your Committee deem it proper that a reasonable rent should be paid therefor to the University.
