Baucom was the presenter.\n\nMr. Murray opened the meeting and asked Ms. Davis to present the consent agenda items.\n\n**Consent Agenda: Capital Investment for the New Rehabilitation Hospital**\n\nMs. Davis said this item approves an investment of up to $20 million.\n\nOn motion, the committee approved the following resolution and recommended it for full Board approval:\n\nAUTHORIZATION FOR THE MEDICAL CENTER TO MAKE AN ADDITIONAL CAPITAL INVESTMENT FOR A NEW REHABILITATION HOSPITAL\n===============================================================================================================\n\nWHEREAS, in order to proceed with the development and construction of a new 70-bed rehabilitation hospital to be located on land in the UVA Research Park, the Medical Center will be required to make an additional capital investment in an existing joint venture known as UVA Encompass Health Rehabilitation Hospital, LLC; and\n\nWHEREAS, the Board of Visitors previously approved the Medical Center’s participation in this joint venture and agrees with the determination for the need for a new rehabilitation hospital to be located on the UVA Research Park campus;\n\nRESOLVED, the Board of Visitors authorizes the Medical Center to invest additional capital into UVA Encompass Health Rehabilitation Hospital, LLC in an amount up to $20 million for the purposes set forth herein; and\n\nRESOLVED FURTHER, the Board of Visitors authorizes the Executive Vice President for Health Affairs to execute one or more amendments to the Operating Agreement for UVA Encompass Health Rehabilitation Hospital, LLC and any and all other documents necessary, all on such terms as the Executive Vice President for Health Affairs deems appropriate, and to take all other actions necessary and appropriate to effectuate the foregoing.\n\n**Consent Agenda: Capitalization of Accumulated Endowment Distribution**\n\nMs. Davis said the Board approves quasi-endowment transactions of $2.0 million or more.\n\nOn motion, the committee approved the following resolution and recommended it for full Board approval:\n\n**CAPITALIZATION OF ACCUMULATED ENDOWMENT DISTRIBUTION**\n\nWHEREAS, the University wishes to capitalize accumulated endowment distributions in the associated quasi-endowment to enhance the permanent income stream to support University strategic initiatives, as identified through the annual budget process;\n\nRESOLVED, the Board of Visitors authorizes that $3.7 million in the Commonwealth Income Fund be capitalized in the Commonwealth Endowment Principal account; and\n\nRESOLVED FURTHER, the Board of Visitors authorizes that $4.5 million in the Davenport Income Fund be capitalized in the Davenport Endowment Principal account; and\n\nRESOLVED FURTHER, the Board of Visitors authorizes that $16.5 million in the Robert C. Taylor Income Fund be capitalized in the Robert C. Taylor Endowment Principal account; and\n\nRESOLVED FURTHER, the Board of Visitors authorizes that $4.0 million in the Shannon Center Income Fund be capitalized in the Shannon Center Endowment Principal account.\n\n**Consent Agenda: Deposit of Currie Farm Proceeds into the Kent D. Currie Unrestricted Quasi-Endowment Fund**\n\nMs. Davis said this was a walk on item. Because of the amount involved, Board approval was required.\n\nOn motion, the committee approved the following resolution and recommended it for full Board approval:\n\n**Deposit of Currie Farm Proceeds into the Kent D. Currie UnrestrIcted Quasi-Endowment**\n\nWHEREAS, the Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer wishes to deposit the $8,769,298.22 in proceeds from the sale of the Curry Farm Property into the existing Kent D. Currie Unrestricted Quasi-Endowment, which is a component of the University’s consolidated unrestricted endowment.\n\nRESOLVED, the Board of Visitors authorizes the deposit of the Curry Farm Property proceeds into the existing Kent D. Currie Unrestricted Quasi-Endowment.\n\n**Action Item: 2019-2020 Tuition and Required Fees for Undergraduate, Graduate, Professional, and Special Programs in the Academic Division and the College at Wise**\n\nThe Chair said there were two undergraduate tuition proposals under consideration. The first was the University’s base tuition proposal. The second was a differential tuition proposal for third and fourth year students in the College and Graduate School of Arts & Sciences. At this meeting, the University was only seeking approval of the base tuition proposal. The differential tuition proposal, which would be discussed later in the meeting, was on the agenda as an information item. It would be presented for approval at the Board’s March meeting.\n\nHe reminded the committee of the University’s approach to tuition. Two years ago in the context of access and affordability, the University stated it would endeavor to limit tuition increases to not more than 1% above the inflation rate. The University also had an unwritten policy for development of its budget. Tuition was to be considered last after first looking to state appropriations, philanthropy, research income, auxiliary enterprise income, etc.\n\nThe Chair said the Board had traditionally set tuition in spring after the amount of the state appropriation was known. In 2017, the Rector suggested it be set in December. Given that state appropriations only accounted for 5% of the University’s budget, waiting for the state was less important and by setting tuition in December, parents and applicants would have an earlier notice of the cost of attendance. If state appropriations were greater than anticipated, the University could reduce the amount of the tuition increase. The Chair gave the floor to the Rector.\n\nThe Rector said approving tuition in December allows the financial aid staff to distribute the financial aid packages earlier. By waiting until February or March for tuition approval, the University was at a competitive disadvantage for first year and low income students since other institutions were able to get their aid packages out earlier. He said the Board has to consider both affordability and quality during its tuition deliberations to maintain the University’s attractiveness.\n\nThe Rector said the University’s leadership team was not hired to run a low cost university, but a great university based on relevancy. He referenced the recent U.S. News & World Report ranking, which lists the University as the 25th best institution in the country and 55th in terms of financial resources. He ended by saying the Board adopted a resolution in 2013 setting the goal of having an average faculty salary within the top 20 AAU institutions. At the time, the ranking was 26. In spite of the investments that have been made in faculty salaries since 2013, the University’s position has slipped to 28th.\n\nMs. Davis said the University’s tuition philosophy was to balance affordability, accessibility, and quality. The University meets 100% of the financial needs of its undergraduates. For low income Virginians, loans are capped at $4,000; for all other Virginians, they are capped at $18,000. For out-of-state students, loans are capped at $28,000. The University covers the cost of tuition and fees for Virginians with incomes under $80,000 and the cost of tuition, fees, room and board for those with incomes under $30,000. Ms. Davis gave the floor to President Ryan.\n\nMr. Ryan reviewed tuition and state funding over the last 30 years. On an inflation-adjusted basis, the combined investment in education from students and the state is now less than it was in 1989-1990. In-state tuition increases have not kept pace with the decline in general funds. Differential tuition, increases in out-of-state tuition, endowment returns, and philanthropy have partially closed the funding gap. Mr. Ryan then compared the University’s per student funding to the top 25 private institutions in the 2018 U.S. News & World Report ranking. This comparison shows that the University has the lowest funding per student. Private institutions were used for the comparison because reliable or consistent data for public institutions did not exist. The average listed tuition and fees for these schools is $20,960 higher than the University’s. Mr. Ryan said the tuition conversation had to address the kind of institution the University wants to be. Some say the best public university, others say it should compete with both publics and privates. He ended by saying that if the University continues its policy of increasing tuition by no more than inflation plus 1%, it will take 48 years to reach the current funding level of its peers.\n\nMs. Davis asked Ms. Bianchetto to present the tuition proposal. Ms. Bianchetto began with a review of comparative tuition data. The University’s tuition increases for in-state undergraduates for the past three years were 1.5%, 2.2%, and 2.4%. For 2018-2019, the tuition for an entering in-state undergraduate student in the College of Arts & Sciences was the third highest among Virginia public universities. A national comparison of tuition and fees for first year undergraduates at the top 25 universities in the 2018 U.S. News & World Report ratings show the University’s out-of-state tuition at the lower end of the tuition range for the private schools. A chart of data from fall 2017 showed the leading schools students attended when they declined admission offers from the University. The chart compared in-state and out-of-state tuition and fees.\n\nMs. Bianchetto then reviewed the University’s 2019-2020 tuition proposal, which calls for an undergraduate tuition increase of 2.9% for current and entering in-state students and a 3.5% increase for current and entering out-of-state students. There will be step increases for entering students in Nursing, Engineering, Batten and McIntire. Increases for the graduate and professional programs varies by school and by program.\n\nThe increase for in-state undergraduates would generate $3.5 million. The increase for out-of-state undergraduates would generate $6.3 million. The proposed increases in graduate tuition would generate $3.5 million. Anticipated costs for the year include merit increases for faculty and staff, inflationary increases for non-personnel services, increasing costs for library materials, an increase in student financial aid staff, first generation programming, student support in the women’s and multi-cultural centers, and safety and security enhancements. These costs would be partially offset by $22 million in savings from Organizational Excellence.\n\nDuring the fall, the University presented the tuition proposal to students on six occasions. Student feedback focused on affordability, maintaining the value of a University degree, expanding course offerings, and having a diverse faculty. The University issued a public notice of its tuition and fee proposal on November 7.\n\nThe auxiliary fee proposal calls for an increase of $120 (5.2%) with $100 for operating and program costs for the new student health center and $20 for staff and operating increases for auxiliaries. Ms. Bianchetto said there was no increase in the athletics fee, which has been flat for 10 years. Within the state, only VCU and Virginia Tech have lower auxiliary fees.\n\nThe tuition proposal for the College at Wise calls for a 2.9% increase in tuition and fees and a 3.0% increase in auxiliary fees for both in-state and out-of-state students. The increases are needed to enhance the quality and stability of the faculty; address affordability and base budget instability; and fund state authorized pay increases. They also support continued investment in Title IX, regional economic development, and accreditation initiatives. Within the state, only Norfolk State and Virginia State have lower tuition and fees for first year in-state undergraduates.\n\nCommittee discussion covered a range of topics. Mr. Griffin said the University has to consider the type of public university it aspires to be: a great national university or a great state university. Mr. DePasquale said the University was a state university, but wants to be the highest quality institution it can be. Mr. Walker said the University was a high quality national university. When compared to many other institutions with similar structures, the University’s costs for in-state students is significantly less.\n\nMr. Griffin said tuition increases are always upsetting, but pointed out that the University’s recent tuition increases have been significantly lower than the increases in the higher education price index. He said consideration of tuition increases needs to take into account return on investment and affordability. The University needs to make sure its net price is affordable.\n\nThe Chair said another consideration is efficiency. When Mr. Hogan arrived, he initiated a study to identify waste and inefficiencies. This led to the operational excellence campaign. The University will undertake a follow-up study, which will be completed within the next 18 months.\n\nMr. Walker was concerned about costs for in-state students from families making more than $80,000 since students from families who make less were covered by AccessUVA. The Rector said the University was concerned about families with incomes between $80,000 and $125,000. Students with family incomes in this range and with normal assets are eligible to apply for aid. Ms. Bianchetto said the University is meeting the financial aid needs of families at the $125,000 income level after taking into account family size, how many children were in college, etc. Even families making $200,000 are eligible for need based financial aid if they have a number of children in college and few assets. At the $125,000 income level, most families are getting $2,000 in grants. Dr. Lateef asked if the University could revisit expansion of the financial aid program for families making more than $125,000. Mr. Ryan said the University had begun a review of the program starting with a focus on the $80,000 to $120,000 income range.\n\nMs. Murphy asked how the proposed increases impact the University’s standing in relation to the other state schools. Ms. Bianchetto said for the last three years the University’s increases were among the lowest in the state; the University didn’t have the figures for this year, but anticipated the trend would continue.\n\nMr. Jones wanted to understand the tuition proposal for the College at Wise in the context of its declining enrollment and its request to reduce out-of-state tuition for students from the federally designated Appalachian Region. Ms. Henry said the College was facing a declining budget and had lost the ability to support its operations. It was working to grow its enrollment. If some of its legislative funding requests are approved, the College will have the ability to reduce tuition.\n\nOn motion, the committee approved the following resolutions and recommended them for full Board approval:\n\n**2019-2020 INCREASES IN ACADEMIC DIVISION TUITION AND REQUIRED FEES**\n\nWHEREAS, the Board of Visitors wishes to approve tuition and fees for 2019-2020 in a timely manner so that families of returning students and Fall 2019 applicants can better plan and receive financial aid notification earlier; and\n\nWHEREAS, the Board seeks to keep increases for all continuing undergraduates and all students in the College of Arts & Sciences at an affordable level while continuing to meet 100% of financial need and to invest in recruiting and retaining excellent faculty and instructional delivery;\n\nRESOLVED, increases in the Academic Division tuition and fees are approved as shown below, effective July 1, 2019; and\n\nRESOLVED FURTHER, this proposal was developed assuming a 2019-2020 unrestricted state appropriation as included in the 2018-2020 Appropriation Act. If this unrestricted state appropriation is substantially different from the level assumed, adjustments to these tuition rates may be proposed in Spring 2019.\n\n**2019-2020 INCREASES IN COLLEGE AT WISE TUITION AND REQUIRED FEES**\n\nWHEREAS, the Board of Visitors wishes to approve tuition and fees for 2019-2020 in a timely manner so that families of returning students and Fall 2019 applicants can better plan and receive financial aid notification earlier; and\n\nWHEREAS, the Board seeks to keep increases for all students at the College of Wise at an affordable level while continuing to meet 100% of financial need and to invest in recruiting and retaining excellent faculty and instructional delivery;\n\nRESOLVED, increases in the College at Wise tuition and fees are approved as shown below, effective July 1, 2019; and\n\nRESOLVED, this proposal was developed assuming a 2019-2020 unrestricted state appropriation as included in the 2018-2020 Appropriation Act. If this unrestricted state appropriation is substantially different from the level assumed, adjustments to these tuition rates may be proposed in Spring 2019.\n\nFURTHER RESOLVED, the Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer is authorized to approve reduced tuition rates for non-residents in accordance with Section 23-7.4:2.F of the Code of Virginia.\n\n**Action Item: 2019-2020 Faculty and Staff Housing Rates**\n\nMs. Sheehy said the proposed average increase for faculty and staff housing is 3.1%. As required by the state, the rents for these units are based on the market.\n\nOn motion, the committee approved the following resolution and recommended it for full Board approval:\n\n**Action Item: 2019-2020 Student Housing Rates**\n\nMs. Sheehy said the average student housing increase at the University is 3.5%. It is needed to address debt service costs for new residence halls and ongoing renovations and for increases in operating costs. Compared to its public and private peers, the University’s double room rate is well below average. For public institutions in Virginia, the rate is average. The proposed average increase for student housing at the College at Wise is 3.0%. Compared to its public and private peers, the College’s double room rate is slightly above average. For public institutions in Virginia, the rate is average.\n\nOn motion, the committee approved the following resolution and recommended it for full Board approval:\n\n**Action Item: 2019-2020 Contract Rates for Dining Services**\n\nMs. Sheehy said the proposed average increase for the University’s contract dining rates is 2.4%. Compared to its public and private peers, the University’s full meal plan rate is below average. For public institutions in Virginia, the rate is at the higher end. At the College at Wise, the proposed average increase is 3.0%. Compared to its public and private peers, the College’s full meal plan rate is just below average. For public institutions in Virginia, the rate is below average.\n\nOn motion, the committee approved the following resolution and recommended it for full Board approval:\n\n**College of Arts & Sciences Differential Tuition Proposal for Third and Fourth Year Students**\n\nMr. Baucom, Dean of the College and Graduate School of Arts & Sciences, reviewed the proposal. He said the College was at an inflection point. Over the next 5 to 10 years, it will face a gap between its needs and resources. The College had a five-year financial plan to fund its vision. It was built on significant increases in philanthropy, research, and new revenue generating master’s programs. The College is the most efficient of the University’s undergraduate schools and has the fewest staff per faculty and the fewest tenure track faculty per student. Since 2009, the undergraduate enrollment has increased by 10% while tenure-track faculty has only increased by 2.5%. Of its classes with more than 30 students, 30% have wait lists; the average wait list has 32 students.\n\nThe College identified cost savings and operating efficiencies. It uses general faculty where appropriate, reduced Ph.D. enrollments, eliminated programs, concentrated on time-to-degrees, and streamlined graduate admissions. The College also reduced utility costs, withheld inflationary cost increases on non-personnel costs, and eliminated staff positions.\n\nMr. Baucom said the College understands it cannot cut its way to excellence. Its financial plan calls for investments to fund $30 million per year to sustain its faculty and address the generational turnover in the faculty, $6 million per year for debt service for STEM research facilities, and $28 million per year for central services. These costs will be funded by efficiency savings, philanthropy, and sponsored research.\n\nRevenue generated by the proposed fee would improve the undergraduate experience by supporting curricular innovation and small learning environments, redesigned courses and new programs particularly in the STEM fields, increasing the faculty, and creating state-of-the-art teaching labs.\n\nMs. Bianchetto reviewed data comparing the projected four year cost at the College after the proposed fee had been implemented to the costs at the University’s other undergraduate schools and at William & Mary and its business school. The College is at the lower end of the scale.\n\nDuring the committee discussion, several members said they were uncomfortable with the proposal. It was easier to understand the use of differential tuition at McIntire and Batten. They wondered if the costs should be spread over all four years. They asked how the state would react.\n\nMr. Walker asked how the College planned to address improvements to the first and second year experience since there would be costs for smaller classes, more classes, and classroom redesign. Mr. Baucom said they will be funded from philanthropy and the reallocation of other resources. Mr. Hardie asked for a comparison of the current student-faculty ratio with the ratio in 2009. Mr. Katsouleas said the 2009 student-faculty ratio was six tenure track faculty per 100 students; it was now five per 100. Funding from the differential fee would move the ratio closer to six.\n\nMr. Nigro said students buy into the value proposition, but he doesn’t think their concerns are limited to the third and fourth year experiences. He was concerned third and fourth year students would be discouraged by the extra fee. He felt the cost should be distributed over four years. Mr. Baucom said the fee would support the hiring of more tenure track faculty. While these faculty would primarily teach third and fourth year students, they would also teach first and second years. He said the financial aid structure would not be changed by the proposal.\n\nPresident Ryan said he supported the proposal and said comparative data on tuition costs at the College and the University’s other schools would be helpful.\n\n**Action Item: Distinguished Professorships in Biocomplexity Quasi-Endowments**\n\nOn motion, the committee approved the following resolution and recommended it for full Board approval:\n\n**ESTABLISHMENT OF Distinguished ProfessorshipS in Biocomplexity QUASI-ENDOWMENTS**\n\nWHEREAS, the University wishes to establish three quasi-endowments to support three endowed professorships for the Biocomplexity Institute;\n\nRESOLVED, the Board of Visitors authorizes the liquidation of the HOPE Physician Incentive Quasi-Endowment as the original purpose of the quasi-endowment is no longer valid; and\n\nRESOLVED FURTHER, the Board of Visitors authorizes the establishment of the Distinguished Professorship in Biocomplexity #1 Quasi-Endowment, with the transfer of $5 million in unrestricted funds from the Executive Vice President for Health Affairs’ start-up funding package; and\n\nRESOLVED FURTHER, the Board of Visitors authorizes the establishment of the Distinguished Professorship in Biocomplexity #2 Quasi-Endowment, with the transfer of $3 million from the liquidated HOPE Physician Incentive Quasi-Endowment; and\n\nRESOLVED FURTHER, the Board of Visitors authorizes the establishment of the Distinguished Professorship in Biocomplexity #3 Quasi-Endowment, with the transfer of the remaining balance, estimated at $1.4 million, from the liquidated HOPE Physician Incentive Quasi-Endowment.\n\n**Action Item: Major Capital Project Financing Plan for the Ivy Mountain Central Utility Plant**\n\nMs. Sheehy said a budget increase was needed to relocate the plant from the Musculoskeletal Center to a stand alone facility that would be able to serve the development of the precinct. This would result in long term savings and create more program space in the Musculoskeletal Center.\n\n**MAJOR CAPITAL PROJECT FINANCING PLAN FOR THE IVY MOUNTAIN CENTRAL UTILITY PLANT**\n\nWHEREAS, the revised financing plan for the Ivy Mountain Central Utility Plant calls for the use of operating cash in the amount of $9.4 million and debt in the amount of $10.6 million;\n\nRESOLVED, the Board of Visitors approves the financing plan for the Ivy Mountain Central Utility Plant.\n\n**Report by the Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer**\n\nMs. Stuck reviewed the status of the Ufirst project, which is the strategic redesign of human resources at the University. The project involved the testing of thousands of unique test cases, massive stakeholder engagement, extensive training, review of the command center structure, dry\n\nruns, increases to the solutions center staff, launching of an online chat service, development of screen share capability, and a new website. January 7 is the go-live date.\n\n\\-------------------------------\n\nOn motion, the chair adjourned the meeting at 10:50 a.m.\n\nSGH:wtl\n\nThese minutes have been posted to the University of Virginia’s Board of Visitors website: http://bov.virginia.edu/committees/205***"}]}}

CHRISTA DAVIS ACAMPORA\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n### RESOLVED, Pavilion II, East Lawn, is assigned to Ms. Christa Davis Acampora, Dean, College and Graduate School of Arts & Sciences, for a term of five years commencing August 2023.\n\n**AMENDMENT TO THE PAVILION ASSIGNMENT POLICY**\n\nRESOLVED, the Pavilion Assignment Policy is amended to add the Dean of the School of Data Science to the Order of Precedence for Lawn Pavilions (other than Pavilion VIII apartments), Montebello, and Weedon House.\n\n**Discussion with University Leadership**\n\nPresident Ryan expressed thanks to the Board and to the University leadership team for their extraordinary hard work – around the clock in some cases – and dedication to supporting the community over the past few weeks, including personal support of him. He said the challenge for the session is recovery from the tragedy of November 13. He expressed the profound sadness members of the community are feeling about the loss of three truly outstanding young men. Having attended the services for D’Sean Perry, Devin Chandler, and Lavel Davis, as well as the Memorial Service in JPJ, he said he had a much better understanding of just how deep this loss is for the families, their home communities, their teammates, coaches, friends, and classmates. He mentioned the two students who were injured: Mike Hollins and Marlee Morgan. Both are expected to make full recoveries. He named many of the constituent groups most impacted by the shootings, including the members of the police force; students and the faculty member on the bus who witnessed the events; the medical personnel and first responders who attended to the deceased and to the injured; the football team and coaches; friends and classmates of the victims; roommates of accused student Christopher Jones; the Black community at UVA, who have faced a great deal of adversity all semester; and the many students who were sheltering in place and genuinely afraid, including those closest to the incident.\n\nIn the aftermath of the tragedy, the University pivoted from business as usual to crisis mode, and he enumerated the many ways this was accomplished, including canceling classes for two days and requiring only designated employees to come to work. Charlottesville City Schools and Albemarle County schools also canceled classes on Monday. On the academic side, deans and faculty were asked to offer flexibility in class attendance and mode of participation, to postpone grades and exams until after Thanksgiving, and then offer pass/fail option.\n\nThe Students Affairs staff launched a massive student support response, including designating gathering spaces, ensuring food was available, arranging for walk-in counseling and therapy dogs, and communicating about available resources, including building a web page for resources. They also were in regular contact with students on the bus and other directly affected groups.\n\nOther actions: the basketball game was canceled that Monday night, and the remainder of the football season was canceled, State Police launched a criminal investigation, and we asked the Attorney General to appoint counsel to undertake an external review. To add to the stress, the day after the shootings, the community was again unnerved by social media threats made by Bryan Silva, which turned out to be unrelated, but he was arrested by Charlottesville Police. And, right before the Memorial Service at JPJ there was another threat that required additional security measures to clear.\n\nPresident Ryan said in many ways, the University community has never felt more like family. People have stepped up to support one another. He named many actions and events including the vigil on the Lawn; 4th Year students rededicating their traditional 5k, and donating the proceeds to the victims and their families; those who spoke on behalf of their teammates and friends at the Memorial Service; Architecture students who built three memorials for display outside JPJ, where people left flowers; athletics teams wearing tributes to 1, 15, and 41 on their uniforms; reworking Lighting of the Lawn; Cavalier Marching Band performances on the Lawn and at the Memorial Service; and student representative to the Board Lily Roberts’ dedication to working on behalf of affected students.\n\nFaculty, staff, and alumni also stepped up in numerous ways, including opening their homes to students and pivoting to accommodate canceled classes and changing academic policies; the Alumni Association and Advancement creating the UVA Strong Fund; Communications documenting the messages painted on Beta Bridge; Steve Farmer identifying financial support for affected students and how to get it to them before they even had to ask; Athletics staff creating beautiful tribute videos shown at the Memorial; efforts to create and send sympathy cards to families; Police diligence in coordinating law enforcement efforts in the immediate aftermath – and providing security in the days that followed; Catering providing free hot cocoa and cookies at student gatherings; UVA Health providing outstanding and compassionate care for the injured students.\n\nStudent Affairs worked to arrange for walk-in counseling; organized study breaks and opportunities for engagement for students through the end of the year; and continued to directly support students most affected.\n\nParents and community members also helped, finding therapy dogs for grieving community members, leaving flowers on Beta Bridge and elsewhere, and much more.\n\nMovingly, there has been an outpouring of assistance from Virginia Tech, tirelessly assisting with all aspects of recovery, from the UVA Strong Fund to the external review to communications.\n\nPresident Ryan turned over the “item for feedback” to Chief Operating Officer J.J. Davis to lead a discussion on the uncertain outlook for the economy. Many Board members offered insights into the current economic situation, particularly around inflation.\n\n**Remarks by the Rector**\n\nThe Rector thanked President Ryan for his comments and for his leadership. He commented on the administration’s extraordinary work over the past few weeks, and he asked for a moment of silence in remembrance of those who were killed and injured.\n\n**Remarks by the Student Representative**\n\nMs. Lily Roberts’ comments are reproduced verbatim:\n\n_Thank you, Mr. Rector. It is typical for the student member to use the December meeting as an opportunity to provide a reflection on the past semester. While much has occurred around Grounds the last three months, I think it is imperative that I use my time this afternoon to focus on the past three weeks and the loss of the three beloved members of our student community—Devin Chandler, Lavel Davis and D’Sean Perry and the injury of two more—Mike Hollins and Marlee Morgan._\n\n_It is unfortunate to say that it was not outside of the realm of possibility that gun violence would visit our Grounds given the larger context of all too frequent instances of gun violence across the Commonwealth and across the nation. Yet, the reality that such a horrific instance occurred over three weeks ago now is still hard to sit with. Many of you have asked me how the student body is doing in the face of such tragedy. The best answer I can provide to this simple, yet complex question is “considerably unwell.” Many are still deeply grieving the losses of Devin, Lavel and D’Sean, the injuries of Mike and Marlee and the trauma inflicted upon our peers, a beloved Drama professor, and bus driver who witnessed this horror. We grieve while we also try to recover from the twelve sleepless hours of being on lockdown on and off Grounds that put us into high alert. We are also doing so while trying to balance caring for ourselves, our communities and attempting to get across the finish line that is the end of the semester. I have also heard of course that it still feels surreal to so many, as some are still unable to process this tragedy._\n\n_I do not want to focus on my personal relationship to this tragedy too much, but I will share this: I did not personally have the pleasure of meeting Lavel, Devin or D’Sean during my time here, yet I felt that I had lost three loved ones because we shared two common bonds as Black students and students involved in the Arts. They do not get to make contributions to our society and grow old as three Black men in a nation where we see Black people’s lives cut short all too often. As three deeply creative people with a love for the arts, their lives were senselessly cut short after attending a play about the life of Emmet Till on a trip to D.C. described by one student as “once in a lifetime.”_ \n\n_They lost their lives in a place that I walked through daily as a student both in the School of Architecture and in the Drama Department as part of their Dance Program. One of the first things I heard from my fellow peers following the announcement of their losses was that Devin, Lavel and D’Sean had been in countless music, art and drama classes with students outside of the athletics community. Their presence will certainly be missed Around Grounds on the football field every game day moving forward, in the locker rooms and around JPJ, on Arts Grounds, in every classroom and lab they attended, in the clubs and activities they dedicated so much of their busy schedules and certainly, on the Lawn with their respective classes during final exercises._ \n\n_As the Board will continue to confront the aftermath of this tragedy for years to come, I believe it is useful for you to envision the spaces and places around grounds the week following what began as another relatively quiet Sunday night around Grounds that ended in tragedy. I will try to capture what our spaces and places were like the week after this tragedy and how creativity and collaboration have been central to our journey toward healing._\n\n_While I cannot even suggest that these 12 hours we spent in lockdown were not among the most frightening many of our students have experienced, there were lights that shined brightly in the darkness, especially the light of three stars that illuminated the night sky after a cloudy day. Though our tear-filled eyes in the silence of the night during the vigil did not all look up to see, President Ryan posted a picture from the vigil that was shared widely on social media by members of the UVA and Charlottesville community. Some of you witnessed the tragically beautiful vigil that occurred Monday, November 14th which VP Hadley mentioned students organized. To take you into that room, while this Board met in our first emergency meeting of the week, student leaders filled Vice President Hadley’s pavilion and started to consider how to support one another and the community at large. Many of these conversations are leaning into the work that the Recovery Work Group President Ryan called is currently working toward. The orange ribbons many of you are wearing were present at the vigil as well—the difference is they were hand-crafted by student leaders and other student volunteers they recruited who sourced orange ribbon and safety pins from every craft store up and down Route 29 and used their hands to craft the ribbons an hour ahead of the quiet vigil in any corner we could find in Pavilion VI._\n\n_Two days later, an invitation to gather from the Department of Drama and Dance went out to the community of students, faculty and staff on Arts Grounds. It read:_ \n\n_“The Arts Grounds are a sacred space of creation, community, and artistic expression. It is important to our healing that we honor the lives of Devin Chandler, Lavel Davis Jr., and D’Sean Perry; that we extend our healing thoughts to those who witnessed and were injured during Sunday’s tragedy; and that we reclaim the Arts Grounds as a site of healing, learning, and art-making.”_\n\n_I cannot say anything to express to you all how beautiful this brief and healing time on Arts Grounds was. Students followed this event by sharing their artwork, poems, photos, music and other creative contributions on social media and around grounds. It was echoed by the painting of Beta Bridge and the hundreds of messages and small drawings that I encourage you to see in person after this session._ \n\n_At the Memorial Service, you may have noticed halftone portraits of Devin, Lavel and D’Sean inspired by Kehinde Wiley’s portrait of President Barack Obama and Eto Otitigbe’s rendering of Isabella Gibbon’s eyes on the back of the Memorial to Enslaved Laborers. These beautiful structures were created to provide a place of memorial on Arts Grounds and to display flowers at the memorial service. I hope that this contribution and other designs students are currently working on in the School of Architecture can be considered as we conceive of ideas for a memorial in the future._ \n\n_The last space I hope to bring us into is a glimpse of the future. I, nor any of us in this room can predict exactly what that may look like, yet, we can lean into some of the lessons we are learning at this time to plan for it. What I can sense about the next semester and possibly the next 10 years is that ‘normal’ cannot be a descriptor we use. The concept of ‘returning to normal’ is concerning to myself and many of the students I have spoken to in the past several weeks because there is a concern that we may go on without recognition of this tragedy and how it fundamentally changes our Grounds. All of the spaces I gave glimpses into are now changed as a result of the night of November 13th—we cannot view these spaces or the people who occupy them as unchanged._\n\n_Last night Professor O’Shaughnessy suggested we not replicate the past but continue to innovate. We might do so by considering the imaginative and empathic ways we have already started to commemorate this event and the losses of Devin, Lavel and D’Sean—whether they be students shifting their architectural studio work to conceive of what a memorial could look like on Arts Grounds, partnerships between student organizations that cater to student athletes and those that encompass students without unique athletic prowess, or continuing to encourage the collaboration and connections between this University and other Universities in the Commonwealth, especially Virginia Tech and UVA-Wise which has been a great support to our students, administrators and overall community in this time._\n\n_We might do so by taking the suggestion Blake D. Morant made in his November 30th article “The Conundrum of Gun Violence: The University of Virginia’s Inevitable Triumph Over Tragedy'' and put our many great resources and mission to work by creating interdisciplinary study of gun violence’s effect on places of education at all levels. This ought not be done to set ourselves apart as leaders of this study or to gain any advantage as the title of the article might suggest, rather this is a venture that could allow us to continue the mission we are founded upon: contributing to the public knowledge base to support the development of an educated and engaged populous. I will take this one step further by echoing my peers in adding a study into safety and security practices as a key study in this overall study. Mr. Morant illustrates that we have done just this after the events of August 11th and 12th._\n\n_We might do so by learning into the spirit of the dozens of individuals who engaged in unexpected acts of kindness in the weeks following the tragedy. We should this unexpected act of malice into an opportunity to practice unexpected acts of kindness and healing in our community._ \n\n_And lastly, we might continue to allow this tragedy to inform our future by continuing a seemingly simple act that we have relied upon more than I have ever witnessed in my time here: listening. Listening to our students, especially those uniquely impacted by the loss of Devin, Lavel and D’Sean—Black students, student-athletes and students on Arts Grounds. Listening to our faculty and staff who are also in great need having lost students they taught, mentored, and worked with daily._\n\n**Remarks by the Faculty Senate Chair**\n\nMs. Tish Jennings made the following remarks:\n\n_First, on behalf of the Faculty Senate, I wish to thank President Ryan, Provost Baucom and the entire administration for their efforts supporting our community in the wake of the recent tragedies. The faculty is committed to supporting our students through the current crisis. They have worked tirelessly to modify their courses, assignments, and expectations to help students successfully complete this semester. This has involved a great deal of work we have had to do while they too have been experiencing the effects of this community trauma. The Faculty Senate is working to learn more about what our faculty needs to recover and how best to support them, along with our staff and students._\n\n_This Monday, voting closed on five amendments to our bylaws, which were all passed. Turnout was high with 90% of the faculty senate voting._\n\n_The first changed the minimum number of senators per school to two. this will not affect the allocation of senators from any other school. Senators are allocated to schools and the college by a formula accounting for the number of full-time students and faculty. Policy BOV-006 requires that our Academic Affairs Committee have a representative from each school and the college, for schools that have only one senator, they must serve on this committee. This does not allow for any other school representation on any other committee. It also causes complications when the lone senator from a school cannot be present at a senate meeting, and there is no other person from said school to give a proxy vote to or to represent that school. Batten, Data Science, and Continuing & Professional Studies will now have two senators instead of just one._\n\n_For 64 (83.12%)_\n\n_Against 13 (16.88%)_\n\n_Abstain 0_\n\n_Bylaw Amendment 2: Change in Senate Chair Seat Surrendering Proposed change: That the newly elected senate chair no longer give up his/her seat._\n\n_For 69 (89.61%)_\n\n_Against 7 (9.09%)_\n\n_Abstain 1 (1.30%)_\n\n_Bylaw Amendment 3: Change in Proxies Proposed change: That the senate allow for both general and special proxies._\n\n_For 61 (79.22%)_\n\n_Against 15 (19.48%)_\n\n_Abstain 1 (1.30%)_\n\n_Bylaw Amendment 4: Change in Start Date of Senate Terms Proposed change: That a senator’s term will begin on July 1st._\n\n_For 73 (94.81%)_\n\n_Against 3 (3.90%)_\n\n_Abstain 1 (1.30%)_\n\n_Bylaw Amendment 5: Change in Election of Board of Visitors Representative Proposed change: That the senate elect a slate of three proposed representatives, and the Board of Visitors will choose the specific individual from those three to serve as the faculty representative. The date of the election is to change slightly as well. This was to align our bylaws with the BOV interpretation of VA statute 23.1-1300 and the request to us made by Rector Clement. Thanks to members Hardie and Payne for joining the November meeting of our Executive Committee to help senators understand the BOV perspective and to answer questions._\n\n_For 56 (72.73%)_\n\n_Against 19 (24.68%)_\n\n_Abstain 2 (2.60%)_\n\n_New text reads:_\n\n_7\\. Organization of the Faculty Senate_\n\n_E.v. The Faculty Representative to the Board of Visitors will be elected annually for a term of one year.  Nominations will be made in December. A Faculty Representative and two alternates will be presented to the Board of Visitors based on an election to be completed by February 15. For the election, the nominating committee will solicit candidates. The current chair will automatically be included as a candidate in the election, if they are willing to serve. If the chair is willing to serve, the minimum number of additional candidates for the election is two. If the chair cannot serve, the nominating committee must solicit at least three nominations. Nominees may be chosen from current members of the Faculty Senate or from the body of faculty eligible to serve on Faculty Senate._\n\n_Senators will vote for their preferred candidates by rank choice indicating preferences in sequence (e.g., first, second, third, etc.). They do not need to rank every candidate. The individual who receives the most first-choice votes will be presented to the BOV as the Faculty Representative, assuming they were ranked first by at least 50% of the voting senators. If there is no majority candidate, the Faculty Representative will be determined by taking the second choice vote of every senator who did not vote for one of the top two candidates as their first choice and adding that to the tally. The Faculty Representative must be ranked by a majority of voting senators._\n\n_Of the remaining candidates, the two candidates who received the highest number of first- and second-choice votes will be presented as the two alternates, assuming they were ranked by a majority of voting senators. If only two candidates were ranked by a majority of voting senators, the senate will initially present a representative and one alternate. The remaining seat will be filled by a runoff using traditional single-choice voting, and the winner of that election will be the second alternate. For the runoff, all remaining candidates will be on the ballot and additional candidates may be nominated._\n\n_Finally, the Academic Affairs Committee approved a proposal from the School of Data Science to add a Bachelor’s of Science in Data Science. This proposal will be voted on by the full faculty senate at our next regular meeting next Tuesday._\n\n**Gifts and Grants Report**\n\nRector Clement asked the Visitors to review the Gifts and Grants Reports, which is reprinted below.\n\n**Summary of Fiscal Year 2023 through September 30, 2022:**\n\nTotal fundraising progress for the University of Virginia and its related foundations was $166,191,728 through September 30, 2022.
