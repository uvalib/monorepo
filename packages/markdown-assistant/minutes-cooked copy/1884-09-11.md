The following Resolution of July 1, 1884, is hereby repealed, to wit: "Resolved, that Prof Stone and the proctor, J.K.Campbell, are hereby appointed to examine Mount Jefferson; and determine and designate the land embracing the Leander McCormick Observatory, which it may be expedient to set aside for the perpetual and exclusive jurisdiction and uses of the aforesaid Observatory."

Resolved that a certain Resolution of September 6, 1882, be modified so as to read as follows:

That the Instructors are entitled to a room, rent free, only during the session, that is for 9 months.

Resolved that the resignation of Prof John W. Mallet of the Chair of General and Applied Chemistry be, and the same is, hereby, accepted, to take effect this day, September 12, 1884.

On the adoption of the above Resolution, Colo Ruffin voted, No!

Resolved that the Executive Committee do at once make all convenient enquiries for a suitable person to fill the Chair of General and Applied Chemistry in this University; and report the facts and credentials of each one recommended by it for the same to this Board at its next meeting.

Whereas, the late Arthur W. Austin, of Dendham, Massachusetts, by his last will and testament bequeathed a large legacy, to wit: about $472,000 to this University, to take effect in possession however, not until the death of his daughter, Miss Mary Austin, now about 24 years of age, except as to his library which comes at once; and whereas, Colo R. T. W. Duke was retained as counsel on behalf of the University to be present at the probate of said will at a fee of $50, and expenses; and whereas, Colo Duke has performed said duty and submitted a written report of his action in the premises, accompanied by an unattested copy of said will, and a statement of expenses amounting to $85: Therefore,

Resolved 1. That the gratitude of this Institution and of its friends is due to the generous benefactor. 2. That said report be accepted; and 3. That the proctor is directed to pay Colo R.T.W. Duke the sum of $135 in full of said fee and expenses.

Resolved that the Proctor be authorized to pay out of the contingent fund not more than $100 to Genl Daniel Ruggles, special agent for soliciting the attendance of students and the bestowal of gifts etc. upon the University: The amount paid to cover only the actual expenses of said special agent in the performance of said trust.

Prof Holmes is hereby granted a leave of 3 weeks to begin in November and end in December.

Resolved that board-money to the hotel-keepers of the University and to the Mess shall be deposited with and go through the hands of the proctor as always heretofore; anything in the enactments of this Board to the contrary notwithstanding.

Resolved that $2500 of the $8000, which has been appropriated for Repairs and Improvements, be expended for general repairs and improvements; and that $5500 of said appropriation be expended under the direction of the Board of Health for sanitary purposes.

Resolved that $1019.26 be allowed for completing the arrangements for pumping the water from the ice pond to the tanks on top of the Rotunda - to be paid out of the sum set apart for "Water Supply".

Resolved that the Executive Committee prepare a memorial to be presented to the General Assembly at its next convening praying that the Board of Visitors may be authorized to borrow the sum of $50,000 to be secured by deed of trust on the bequest of the late Arthur W. Austin to this University; which sum shall be used as far as necessary to supplement the recent appropriation by the Legislature for the purpose of establishing a proper and convenient system of drainage and water supply.

Resolved that when this Board adjourns, it shall adjourn to meet on Thursday, September 25, 1884.

Resolved that all such acts and proceedings be and the same are hereby expressly validated, in all respects, severally and collectively, as though each of said acts and proceedings had been done and enacted during the term of a regularly elected Rector of this Board of Visitors.
