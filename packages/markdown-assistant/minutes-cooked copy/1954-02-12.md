The President reminded the Board of the generous gift received from the Garden Club of Virginia of funds aggregating **$77,601.99** for the restoration of the walls and gardens between West Lawn and West Range. Mrs. Herbert McKelden Smith, Chairman of the Committee on Buildings and Grounds, spoke briefly about the project, which was commemorated, upon its completion in 1952, by a plaque on the garden wall of Pavilion I reading as follows:

"These Garden Walls Originally designed and built by Thomas Jefferson, As a part of his architectural plan for the University of Virginia, were restored and the Enclosed garden planted by THE GARDEN CLUB OF VIRGINIA 1952. The garden designs were By Alden Hopkins, Landscape Architect."

The Secretary was directed to convey to the President of the Garden Club of Virginia the lively sense of gratitude of the Board for this constructive work, and the satisfaction of its members in the enhanced beauty of the University, which has been conspicuous since the completion of the project.

The Board adopted the following resolution:

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the following resignations be accepted:

* Mr. V. Webster Johnson, Lecturer in Land Economics, as of February 8, 1954. His work with the Ford Foundation and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development makes this necessary.

* Prof. Clinton Mochon, Assistant Prof. in Architecture, as of February 1st, 1954. Mr. Mochon has accepted a position with the Kawneer Corp., Niles, Michigan, as Architectural Research Consultant.

We wish for them the highest success in their new undertakings.

The following resolutions were adopted by the Board:

* **RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that Mr. Orville R. Harris be and he is hereby elected Acting Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering in the Electronics Division for the session 1954-55 at a salary of **$5,700** for the session.

* **RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the title of Mr. A. H. Shuster be and it is hereby changed from Assistant Professor to Lecturer in Education.
* **RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that Dr. Wilford A. Councill, Jr. be and he is hereby appointed as Lecturer in Urology, effective January 1, 1954, at no salary.
* **RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that Mr. Joseph Norwood Bosserman be and he is hereby appointed Acting Assistant Professor of Architecture for the second semester of the 1953-54 session at a salary of **$1,900.00**.

The Board adopted the following resolution:

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, that the Hospital Accounts Committee be and it is hereby authorized to charge off as uncollectible accounts Schedules 417, 420, and 421, aggregating **$26,150.06**, recommended by them for cancellation.

The President reported that during the calendar year of 1953, the Hospital Accounts Committee was authorized by resolution of the Board of Visitors to charge off uncollectible hospital accounts totaling **$322,372.82**. The total charged off during the year 1952 was **$176,873.00**.

The President presented a recommendation from Mr. C. Venable Minor, Special Counsel for the University, that approval be given to acceptance of an offer of **$3,000.00** to the Twentieth Street Bank of Huntington, West Virginia, as West Virginia Trustee, for ninety acres of land in Wayne County, West Virginia, owned by the estate of the late William J. Humphreys in which the University has an interest. Following discussion, it was resolved that the President be authorized to investigate the matter further and decide it at his discretion.

President Darden read a letter from Dr. John T. Bate, M.D. of Louisville, Kentucky, enclosing a check for **$500.00** for the Student Loan Funds of the University, the gift of this sum and any future additions to the fund by Dr. Bate to be conditioned on agreement by the University to make loans from his gift only to Kentucky students of the fourth generation in the United States and of pure Caucasian stock, the term Caucasian to eliminate "certain races of people from the near east" not recognized as pure Caucasians by Dr. Bate.

After discussion it was resolved that the President be authorized to accept the gift provided that he could reach a workable agreement with Dr. Bate to make it reasonably sure that needy students from Kentucky would in practice be able to use the loan fund.

The Rector presented a letter from The Rector of the Board of Visitors of Virginia Polytechnic Institute, who is also President of the Association of Governing Boards of Colleges and Universities, on behalf of the said Association, inviting The Rector and Visitors to membership in the Association, dues to be set at approximately **$70.00** a year.

The Board resolved that the invitation be accepted.

The Board discussed a request from the Mariner's Museum for the University's concurrence in the proposed sale of a parcel of land in Huntington Park adjacent to the Museum. The Rector explained that the request is presumably based on the fact that the original gift of the Museum stipulated that the University should become the owner of its properties in the event that the Museum's trustees should fail to carry out the terms of the bequest. Some doubts were expressed as to the propriety of compliance with the request.

The Board resolved that the request be referred to the University' Special Counsel for study.

Mr. Gay requested that attention be given by his successor as Chairman of the Finance Committee to the handling of Bursar's Fund securities, chiefly fraternity real estate loans, by the Peoples National Bank of Charlottesville. Having noted from recent reports by Mr. Turner that the Bank appeared to be assuming no responsibility for the collection of delinquent payments, he had written to Mr. Homan Walsh to ask for the Bank's interpretation of the agreement. No reply had yet been received, Mr. Gay said, but he felt that if the Bank were only to receive payments, the arrangement might as well be terminated, if the Bursar's Office received the payments directly, which it could do quite easily, the Bursar would have much more prompt knowledge of delinquency in payments.

The Rector invited the attention of the Board to the statutory requirement which will make necessary at the March meeting of the Board the election of a Rector, and, at the same meeting, the election of a Secretary to the Board.

Mr. Black expressed his keen personal regret over the retirement from the Board as of the close of today's meeting, of Mr. Richard A. Carrington, Jr., Mr. Thomas B. Gay, and Mrs. Bertha Wailes. President Darden joined in the appreciation of the Board for their unselfish service for the maximum terms permitted by statute.

Mr. Gay, replying for the retiring members, assured The Rector of their readiness to assist the Board at any time in an unofficial consultative capacity.

The Rector reviewed the recent progress of the enquiry into the administration of the College begun on November 27th, read to the Board a resolution in support of Dr. Combs signed by all but twenty members of the College faculty and staff, and laid before the Board, for reading by members, additional letters on the subject received from individuals and organizations, and acknowledged by The Rector.

The Rector reported that he had been requested last Monday by Messrs. Jere M. H. Willis and Alfred W. Garnett, attorneys for Dr. Combs, to confer with them. At a conference in Richmond on February 10th they had advised him that Dr. Combs would be willing to relinquish the burden of administrative authority and responsibility at the College, providing he could continue in charge of new construction, fund raising, and related matters, and could retain the title of President. The Rector had stipulated that suitable letters be written by Dr. Combs to the parents of the four young ladies he had interviewed on November 19th and to the authors of letters received by the Board.

After extensive discussion of the administrative problems noted during the investigation, the Board resolved that the Rector, Mr. Gay, and Mr. Talbott should constitute a committee to draft a resolution summarizing the conclusions of the inquiry, the necessity for relieving Dr. Combs of duties beyond his present physical ability, and the assignment of future administrative functions by Chancellor Darden. The Rector thereupon designated the same committee to confer with Dr. Combs or his representative, and the committee retired to perform these tasks.

Following a recess, the committee reported back to the Board the following resolution, incorporating minor changes proposed by President Combs, and thereupon agreed to by him.

**WHEREAS**, for several months past, the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia has been engaged in a careful investigation of substantial complaints concerning the administration of Mary Washington College by Dr. Morgan L. Combs in a manner adversely affecting student discipline and morale and proper faculty relations, and,

**WHEREAS**, the Rector and Visitors is of opinion that a rearrangement of responsibilities for the administration of Mary Washington College is both necessary and desirable, and,

**WHEREAS**, the Board's investigations have demonstrated the fact that administrative responsibilities heretofore assigned to President Combs are presently more than he is physically able to discharge in justice to himself and to the best interests of the College,

**NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED**
(1) That in the discharge of his duties as the principal administrative officer of Mary Washington College, the President of the University of Virginia shall have and exercise in respect to Mary Washington College supreme administrative authority;

(2) That in pursuance of this authority the President of the University of Virginia be and he hereby is authorized to delegate the performance of such duties in respect to construction and development, solicitation of funds, and related matters as he in his discretion shall determine, to Morgan L. Combs, who shall retain the title of President of Mary Washington College until his retirement or so long as his performance of such duties is satisfactory to the Rector and Visitors;

(3) That the President of the University of Virginia is further authorized to delegate all other administrative functions of Mary Washington College, including faculty relations, student relations, curriculum, internal budget, and control to such other administrative official or officials as shall be designated by him with the approval of the Rector and Visitors.

The resolution was adopted by the Board, and the Rector was authorized to issue copies of it to the press, with the statement that it had been read by President Combs, who was satisfied with its terms and resolved to cooperate fully in its execution.

The Rector read to the Board a letter of this date addressed to the Rector and Visitors and signed by Dr. Combs. In this letter Dr. Combs stated his approval of the resolution, and promised his full cooperation in implementing it, assured the Board of his complete cooperation with the administrative officer or officers chosen by Chancellor Darden to function in the manner contemplated in the resolution, promised to write suitable letters, in form to be agreed upon by his attorney, Jere Willis, and representatives of the Board, to (1) all persons who have written to the Board about the investigation (a list of names and addresses to be supplied by the Rector) and (2) the parents of the four students interviewed on November 19th, agreed to relinquish the President's office spaces to the administrative dean or other officer named by Chancellor Darden, and stated his understanding of the Board's plan to pursue the matter of a suitable successor as President of the College at some time in advance of his own retirement.

It was further resolved as being the sense of the Board, subject to the State budget and conditioned on the establishment of satisfactory relationships at the College, that President Combs' salary be continued at its present rate.

The Board resolved that the Rector and the Chairman of the Committee on Mary Washington College be requested to file with the Secretary the Committee's Report and all other papers relating to the investigation just concluded, and that the Secretary be directed to preserve this material as a special file.

Finally, it was resolved by the Board that its hearty appreciation be expressed to the Committee on Mary Washington College for the fair, painstaking, and thorough work of the Committee in carrying out the investigation.

On motion the meeting was then adjourned.
