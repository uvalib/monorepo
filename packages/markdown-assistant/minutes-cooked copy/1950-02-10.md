The regular monthly meeting of the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia was held on this date in the Office of the President of Mary Washington College, Fredericksburg, Virginia, with the following present: The Rector, Barron F. Black, President Colgate W. Darden, Jr., of the University of Virginia, Dr. M. L. Combs, President of Mary Washington College, Visitors Anderson, Carrington, Garnett, Gay, Mears, Smith, and Willis. Absent: Visitors Barksdale, Gravatt, Howard, Talbott, and Wailes.

The minutes of the meeting of January 20, 1950, which had been copied and mailed to the members, were approved.

The President announced receipt of the following gifts.

Upon recommendation of the President, the following leave of absence, elections, and appointment were approved.

Dr. Robert K. Gooch, Professor of Political Science, granted leave of absence for a year, beginning February 1, 1950, for research in France.

Dr. John Hamilton Allan elected Professor of Orthopedics and chairman of the School of Orthopedics, at a basic salary of $5,000 from the University, effective July 1, 1950.

Dr. Monroe D. Eaton elected Visiting Professor of Bacteriology for the second semester of the session of 1949-50, effective February 1, 1950, at a salary of $2,500 for the semester.

Commander Charles A. Burch appointed Associate Professor of Naval Science, effective upon his arrival at the University in the summer of 1950, at no salary from the University.

The following resolution was adopted:

RESOLVED that the Hospital Accounts Committee be and it is hereby authorized to charge off as uncollectible accounts schedules 103, 105, and 106, aggregating $13,209.84, recommended by them for cancellation.

A report was presented from a special committee of the University Senate on proposed names for the new dormitory units now under construction, and the names were approved as recommended.

The names were selected on the basis of stature in the world of scholarship, influence on the University of their day, and in the case of the last two their hold on the affections of the alumni growing out of their personal influence on students. About forty names were considered out of which the selection was made. It was a matter of regret that men like Tuttle and Dunnington had to be passed over. The name of Albert H. Tuttle might well be considered for the Life Science Building. Of the earlier men of note, we regretted having no place for men like Maupin and Courtney.

Mr. Gay moved that only the surname be used on the tablet on the exterior of each building, but that a bronze plaque be placed in each dormitory giving the full name of the individual for whom the building is named, together with the position he held at the University. The motion was passed and it was further resolved that at a future date similar bronze tablets would be placed in the present dormitories.

It was called to the attention of the Board that the road leading from Route 29 to the Leander McCormick Observatory is known as "Observatory Road" and also as "McCormick Road," and that this double designation had resulted in confusion, inasmuch as there is also in Charlottesville an Observatory Avenue. Members of the Board felt it proper for the road to be named in honor of the donor of the Observatory, and its designation as "McCormick Road" was approved.

President Darden presented to the Board a preamble and draft of an Act which has been prepared to enable this Board to sell a narrow strip of land owned by the University and situated in the subdivision known as Park Place which lies just east of the Frys Springs Road and across that road from the Nurses' Home.

A copy of said preamble and proposed Act was ordered filed with the minutes of this meeting and it was therefore

Resolved: That W. Allan Perkins, Attorney for the University, be instructed to send copies of said preamble and Act to Mr. Henry B. Gordon and to Mr. James F. Dulaney, the Representatives of Charlottesville and of Albemarle County in the House of Delegates, stating that this Board requests them to secure passage of said Act at the present Session of the General Assembly.

WHEREAS, by deed dated 10 May 1884, G. Peyton and Champe C. Peyton, his wife, conveyed to the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia all that certain tract or parcel of land lying on the southerly side of Fry's Springs Road in the City of Charlottesville, Virginia near the University of Virginia, and more particularly described as follows. Beginning at a point in 10 foot alley and corner of piece of ground known as Lot No. 10 (this being Lot No. 11) and running thence S 28° 45′ W and 2.85 chains to point on said Fry's Springs Road, thence N 72° 15′ E along said Fry's Springs Road 1.55 chains, thence N 30° 45′ E and 1.58 chains, thence along line of Lot No. 10 S 52° 45′ E and 1.28 chains to point of beginning and 10 foot alley, containing about one-quarter acre, more or less, and,

WHEREAS, a street (now known as Lane Road) has been opened across the southerly portion of the said tract, leaving a small portion of the said lot lying on the southerly side of the said road, the said small portion being more particularly described as follows. Beginning at an iron in the Southeast corner of the intersection of 15th Street, S. W., and Lane Road, at the south or back edge of a concrete sidewalk and with the back edge of the sidewalk S 58° 28′ E 96.48 feet to an iron in the west margin of a 10 foot alley, thence with the west margin of the alley S 29° 21′ W 4.8 feet to a point, the northeast corner of Lot No. 24 of the Park Place Improvement Company, thence with the Northern line of said Lot No. 24 N 61° 25′ W 97.7 feet to a point in the eastern margin of 15th Street, S. W., the Northwest corner of said Lot No. 24, thence with the east margin of said 15th Street, N 37° 13′ E 9.8 feet to the beginning, and,

WHEREAS, the owner of the said Lot No. 24, adjoining the said small strip on its southerly side, desires to purchase the said small strip of land,

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF VIRGINIA.

1. The Board of Visitors of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia be, and it hereby is, authorized to sell and direct the conveyance of the said small strip of land, described as aforesaid, to W. B. Russell, owner of Lot No. 24 aforesaid, for such price and upon such terms and conditions as the said Board of Visitors may determine, conveying to the said W. B. Russell all right, title and interest which the said Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia may have in the said small strip of land, as heretofore described.

President Darden presented for consideration of the Board a program for awarding graduate professional degrees in the Department of Education, as set forth in the following letter from Dean Lindley J. Stiles.

The Department of Education respectfully requests that the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia approve:

1. The establishment of graduate professional degrees in education—;the Master of Education and Doctor of Education degrees—;to be administered by the Department of Education;

2. The development of a program of graduate extension work by the Department of Education in cooperation with the University Extension Division.

Detailed descriptions of the degree requirements and of the proposed program of work in extension are attached.

These requests, as outlined, have been considered favorably by both the Department of Graduate Studies and the University Senate. After considering the need for graduate professional degrees and a program of graduate extension work in education, the Graduate Committee of the Department of Graduate Studies unanimously approved the following statement in its meeting on January 17, 1950.

"The Graduate Committee recognizes the need for professional graduate degrees in Education and favors the presentation of the proposals of Dean Lindley J. Stiles to the University Senate. The Committee recommends that these professional degrees, when established, be administered by the Department of Education."

The University Senate, on February 3, 1950, in consideration of the above action by the Department of Graduate Studies, voted unanimously to recommend to the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia that the Department of Education be authorized to grant professional graduate degrees in education and to develop in cooperation with the University Extension Division a program of graduate extension work in the field of education.

Authority for the granting of professional degrees by the Department of Education was established by action of the Board of Visitors in its January 12, 1920, meeting. Excerpts from the minutes (Minutes, page 164, Vol. IX) of that meeting read:

"Resolved, that the Rector and Visitors of the University be requested to grant authority to organize the Curry Memorial School of Education into a Department, coordinate with the other professional departments of the University, with power to confer appropriate professional degrees.

"The above was disposed of in the following resolution, being unanimously adopted:

"Resolved by the Rector and Visitors of the University, that the request of the Curry Memorial School of Education to organize said school into a Department, coordinate with the other professional departments of the University, with power to confer appropriate professional degrees, be and is hereby granted."

Since the above action was taken the Curry Memorial Department of Education has been granting three undergraduate professional degrees: the Bachelor of Science in Education; the Bachelor of Science in Nursing Education; and the Bachelor of Science in Physical Education. The present request for approval of the granting of graduate professional degrees by the Department of Education is in accord with the functions prescribed and delegated to the Department of Education as a professional department of the University.

The prerogatives for the granting of graduate professional degrees by professional departments of the University and for offering graduate work in extension are already reputably established in the University of Virginia. Graduate professional degrees are now being granted by the Departments of Law, Medicine and Engineering. The Department of Engineering has developed a program of graduate work in extension leading to the Master of Science degree in Engineering.

The requests by the Department of Education are in accord with established practices in other major universities. Their implementation will represent fundamental and necessary steps in the direction of making available through the Department of Education greater service to teachers and to public education throughout the Commonwealth of Virginia.

| Year   |  Yield on Investments Disposed Of |  Yield on New Investments |
|--------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------|
| 1949   |  3.67%                            |  4.81%                   |
| 1950   |  4.29%                            |  4.02%                   |

The handling of the account as a whole by State-Planters Bank and Trust Company is most gratifying to your Committee, as it will be observed that the effective yield on the book value of the fund at the present time is estimated at 4.29% compared with 3.96% one year ago. These yield figures are based upon an estimate of the income to be received during the coming year on the present investments at present dividend and interest rates. The actual yield obtained during 1949, based upon a weighted average by months of the actual book value during 1949, was 4.26%, which compares with a yield of 4.02% on book value during 1948.

Attached to the report and summary you will observe certain schedules showing the diversification of the assets at market values as of January 25, 1950. The diversification is first shown as between bonds, preferred stocks, and common stocks - 44%, 20%, and 36%, respectively. The diversification is then shown by industries. Heading the list is the utility industry representing 26.5% of the account as a whole. From the first page of the complete list of assets it will be noted that utility bonds represent 8.3% of the account as a whole, utility preferred stocks represent 8.4% and the utility common stocks represent 9.8%. This latter common stock figure has also been broken down to show the telephone and telegraph stocks represent 3.1%, natural gas stocks 1.4%, and electric utility stocks 5.3% of the total account.

In the detailed list of investments in industries it is to be noted that each individual investment is stated at its cost and at its current price, and in this manner the Board will be able to observe the performance of each individual investment and of each category of investments.

In order that the Rector and each member of the Board may have an opportunity critically to review the report and summary provided by the State-Planters Bank and Trust Company, fifteen copies thereof are submitted with this report.

It is the purpose of your Committee to ask that consideration of the report be made a special order of business at the March meeting of the Board, at which time officers of the State-Planters Bank and Trust Company will be asked to appear, for the purpose of reviewing the account personally and presenting to the Board a general statement of their views and recommendations in respect to the handling of the funds.
