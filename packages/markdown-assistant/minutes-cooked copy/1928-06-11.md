The annual meeting of the Rector and Visitors was held on this date at 10 o'clock A. M., lasting until 6 P. M., with intermission for lunch, followed by a session on the morning of the 12th which convened at 9:30 o'clock.

There were present Visitors Carson, Hull, McIntire, Munford, Rinehart, Scott and Williams, and the Rector C. Harding Walker, and President Alderman.

The minutes of the meeting of April 25th which had been copied and sent to the members for examination were approved.

The President announced the following gifts:

An appropriation from the International Education Board for the development of graduate instruction and research in chemical, physical, and biological sciences, over a period of not more than seven years, $175,000. On motion duly made and seconded the following resolution was unanimously adopted:

RESOLVED, That the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia officially sanction the request by the President of the University, made to the International Education Board for the appropriation of $175,000, for the development of graduate instruction and research in the chemical, physical, and biological sciences. It will be the purpose of the Rector and Visitors to undertake to do all in their power to carry out the tentative apportionment of the sums voted by the Board in accordance with the following plan:

At a meeting of the members of the Board of Trustees of the International Education Board held May 25, 1928, the officers presented your letter of February 2, 1928, in which, on behalf of the trustees of the University of Virginia, you request the Board's cooperation in strengthening and stimulating research in the physical and biological sciences. It was observed that in addition to sums now available, annual sums approximating $45,000 would be required eventually to carry out your program of development in chemistry, physics and biology, and that there was reasonable assurance that beginning with the fiscal year July 1, 1930, the authorities of the University would be in position to provide annually increasing sums for this purpose, so that within a period of from five to seven years the University would be able to assume the increased annual expenditure of $45,000.

I have the honor to inform you that the Board acted favorably on your request and authorized the executive officers, in their discretion, to commit the Board to an appropriation to the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia, of a sum not to exceed $175,000 for the development of graduate instruction and research in the physical and biological sciences in general conformity with the plan outlined above, the Board's appropriation to be available over a period of not more than seven years.

The amount to be made available each year is to be determined by the executive officers after conference with the University authorities. Below I give the tentative apportionment of the sums voted by the Board:

I should like to be informed if the request to the International Education Board for this assistance has been officially sanctioned by the trustees of the University. Upon receiving word to this effect, the officers are prepared to make available the sum required for 1928-1929.

Contributions to Institute of Public Affairs $6,625 and pledges $3,510.

On motion, it was resolved that the President be, and is, hereby authorized to accept the foregoing gifts and to express to the several donors the thanks and appreciation of the Rector and Visitors.

The resignation of Professor James R. McKeldin, Assistant Professor of Philosophy was presented and accepted in the following resolution:

RESOLVED, That the Rector and Visitors of the University accept the resignation of Professor James R. McKeldin, Assistant Professor of Philosophy. Professor McKeldin has carried forward his work with ability and energy, and the Rector and Visitors wish him continued success in his new field.

Upon the recommendation of the President the following were elected to the faculty:

Dr. Edwin P. Lehman, Professor of Surgery and Gynecology, at a salary of $10,000, incumbency to begin with the session 1928-29.

Dr. Sidney Wm. Britton, Professor of Physiology, at a salary of $4,500, incumbency to begin with the session 1928-29.

The Budget for the Institute of Public Affairs as follows was adopted:

A resolution from the Professorial staff concerning an increase in the salary schedule was presented, and on motion, the Committee consisting of Messrs. Hull, Buchanan, and Carson was appointed to study the whole question of the salary scale and report to the Rector and Visitors at as early a meeting as it is practicable.

The New Buildings Committee submitted the following report:

The New Buildings Committee met on this date at the Colonnade Club at 3 o'clock with Messrs. Rinehart, Scott, McIntire, Hull, and Williams present. There were also present Mrs. Munford and Judge Carson, and President Alderman.

The Architects presented preliminary plans for the proposed dormitories and academic building, which were examined and discussed, after which the whole group visited the proposed sites for the respective buildings.

The Committee then held a meeting for further consideration of the plans and locations, when the following action was taken:

RESOLVED, That the locations selected for the proposed dormitories on the western slope of Monroe Hill and for the academic building on the site of the Mallet House, be and are hereby approved, subject to minor changes in location.

RESOLVED, That the plans for the dormitories be approved in general, and the architects are requested to submit final plans after a further detailed study, to the Committee, for approval and adoption.

RESOLVED, That the preliminary plans for the academic building be approved in general, with the understanding that a further study be made of the needs for offices and lecture rooms, submitting final plans to the Committee for approval and adoption.

On the foregoing report the following action was taken:

RESOLVED, That as soon as the final plan for the new dormitories and academic building are received and approved by the New Buildings Committee, they are hereby authorized to secure bids for the erection of the same and if they be within the sum appropriated for the respective buildings, they be empowered to let the contracts therefor and proceed with their erection.

With respect to building sites heretofore allocated to fraternities on which to erect chapter houses, which sites have now been taken up in the proposed locations for the new dormitories, the following motion duly made and seconded was adopted:

Whereas, This Board had allocated certain parcels of land for erection of fraternity buildings, located on the Towles and Barracks Roads on the northwest side of the Monroe Hill, and

Whereas the locations for the proposed dormitories will take up the sites for the fraternity houses, therefore be it

Resolved, That the said sites be withdrawn and that the Buildings & Grounds Committee be requested to investigate other suitable sites for fraternity houses and report to this Board for action.

In the matter of creating the office of Business Manager of the University and the filling of the position, the President presented the following

After mature reflection upon the proposal to create the office of Business Manager of the University of Virginia, I have formed the judgment that, at least for the immediate future, it is the part of wisdom to vest the duties of this officer in the person of the Assistant to the President.

There are many reasons in support of this judgment, which I will give if called upon, but I think it particularly important in view of the fact that time is essential in order to more clearly and accurately define the duties of this proposed new officer.

The Assistant to the President would assume responsibility under the President for the supervision of the Superintendent of Buildings and Grounds, the Superintendent of the Hospital, the Superintendent of the Cafeteria, and such other managerial duties as the President or the Rector and Visitors may from time to time delegate to him.

I beg to recommend for the consideration and the action of the Rector and Visitors the following resolutions:

Resolved first, that J. L. Newcomb, Assistant to the President be and is hereby directed to assume on July 1, 1928, the managerial duties outlined above.

Resolved second, that he he and is hereby directed to employ a Superintendent of Buildings and Grounds as a successor to Dr. W. A. Lambeth, at a salary not in excess of $4,000 per annum.

Resolved third, that on account of these added duties his salary as Assistant to the President be increased from $1500 to $3000 per annum.

Resolved, fourth, that the Assistant to the President he, and he is hereby directed, to make a report to the President for transmittal to the Rector and Visitors of his managerial duties after one year of service. In the report he should make recommendations concerning a more accurate definition of the duties of a business manager.

Mr. Scott, Chairman of the Finance Committee, presented a report as of May 25, 1928, which was received and ordered read.

The largest single maturing investment included above, was an item of $103,600 School & College 6% Certificates which were called for payment by the State of Virginia at par on January 1, 1928. $100,000 of these were held in the Corcoran Fund. To replace this large investment at a time when high grade bonds were selling at prices which returned lower yields than for many years past, of course, worked a hardship upon the University. It was necessary to accept a lower return in order to obtain anywhere nearly commensurate safety.

Investments sold and matured during the year netted us a profit of $2,886.83 over their book value to us. Of this amount the largest item $1,656.45 was a profit on the sale of 12 shares of Stock of the Rossia Insurance Company. Ten shares of thos stock was taken over by us from the estate of Arthur W. Austin at the then market price and the remaining two shares we subscribed to under rights issued to us as holders of the above ten shares.

We have received during the year in securities the following additional donations and bequests:

Total endowment funds under our direction in the various funds at their book value (i.e. cost to us or market price at the time they were given to the University) are $2,108,000. These holding have a present market value of $2,392,000. or $284,000 greater than their cost.

The funds are invested as follows:

The current income is $117,412.50 which is a return of 5.6% on the cost price or $4.90% on the market value of the endowment.

We have been most fortunate in recent years in receiving several large bequests in the form of excellent investment stocks. While we would not have felt justified in buying this class of security for the funds, it has seemed wise to hold the stocks thus given us and we have been rewarded by material advances in the value of many of them. The University has thus been able to participate in the fruits of the country's industrial prosperity.
