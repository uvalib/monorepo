At a called meeting of the Board of Visitors, of the University of Virginia, at 2:30 P. M., on above date, in the office of the President, East Lawn.

Present: The Rector, and Visitors Harmon, Craddock, Shackleford, Irvine, and Flood, and President Alderman.

The Board having been called to order by the Rector, Armistead C. Gordon, the following was adopted:

Resolved: That the salary of Professor J. S. Grasty be fixed at $1,500.00, beginning July 1, 1910, as Adjunct Professor of Geology. This increase to be derived from salary of Professor W. M. Fontaine whose salary ceased on September 1, 1910.

Resolved: That $150.00 be appropriated to the Linden Kent Memorial School of English Literature for additional instructorship in English Composition.

Resolved: That $500.00 be appropriated from the monies hitherto used to defray expenses of Department of Pharmacology, to Dr. Theodore Hough for a Laboratory course in Pharmacology for second year students.

Resolved: That Dr. M. L. Rea be elected demonstrator of Dermatology vice Dr. R. W. Garnett, resigned. No salary attached.

Resolved: That Dr. W. H. Goodwin be elected Adjunct Professor of Surgery at a salary of $1200 per annum beginning September 15, to succeed Dr. Harvey B. Stone, resigned.

Resolved: That a Committee be appointed to consider the communication of Mr. R. Hall McCormick dated June 11, 1910, and report to the Board at its next meeting. This committee shall consist of President Alderman, and Visitors Harmon and Gordon.

The correspondence follows:

I received a copy of passages from the Records of the University of Virginia, having to do with the establishment, of the University Observatory by Mr. Leander McCormick and the endowment of the professorship and working fund in connection therewith.

From an examination of these records, I find, first, that Mr. McCormick presented the telescope to the University and also built an observatory for it. Second, that a society of alumni of the University, in consideration of this gift, through a committee of which Col. C. S. Venable was chairman, raised a fund of $50,000 for the endowment of a directorship for the Observatory, and that in accordance with the wish of Mr. McCormick, it was made a condition of this endowment, that the Director should have no teaching to do in the University, except in Practical and Theoretical Astronomy. Third, Mr. W. H. Vanderbilt, made a gift of $25,000 which should be kept as a distinctive and separate working fund to be known as the "W. H. Vanderbilt Endowment." Fourth, it appears that the Board of Visitors of the University on June 26th, 1884, passed a resolution assuring Mr. McCormick that the fund donated to the Observatory had been and would continue to be regarded as a sacred fund never to be diverted from the original purpose contemplated by the donor.

It is therefore clear from these statements from the University records, that $50,000 was raised by the alumni for the purpose of endowing a directorship of the Observatory; that this Director should be a Professor of Astronomy, but should have no teaching to do in the University, except in Practical and Theoretical Astronomy.

I have been informed by Professor Ormond Stone that he discussed with Col. Venable, who was the chairman of the committee of Alumni, who raised this fund, what was intended by the words practical and theoretical astronomy, Mr. Venable explained to him that graduate work which would prepare persons who wanted to make astronomy a profession, was what was meant, and this construction that practical astronomy was considered by the donors of the fund as graduate work is corroborated by a resolution adopted by the University on Nov. 16th, 1883, which provides: "that a prescribed course in Practical Astronomy"—;—;—;should "be considered as the equivalent of the graduate course in either mathematics or Natural Philosophy for graduates in these schools who are offering for a Doctorate."

I was further informed by Professor Stone that astronomical work of this order means research work, and can only be carried on at the observatory. The $50,000 fund was therefore clearly given for paying a Director of Astronomy, who should give his time to teaching post graduate courses in Practical and Theoretical Astronomy at the Observatory, and devote the balance of his time to research work, and the fund was to be used for no other purpose.

Professor Stone gave his time to research work and advanced instructions to post-graduates only until 1889, when his services were diverted to other channels.

Professor Stone has informed me that one of the obstacles in his way is that there is no money which enables the Observatory to print its results in its own publications, and states that a few hundred dollars annually would enable him to do this. It seems to me that the Vanderbilt Endowment was made for just such purposes as this, since it was to be kept as a distinctive and separate working fund. The income from $25,000. should be at least $1000 a year. I should think that $1000 a year would go a long way towards carrying out such requirements.

It is quite clear from the University records and the statements of Mr. Venable and Professor Stone, first that the donor of the telescope and observatory made his gifts for the purpose of their being used along lines of scientific astronomical research which is the only object for which they can be used. Second, that it was the intention of the alumni who made the endowment to provide the observatory with a trained astronomer, all of whose time should be devoted to the use of the telescope. This is further shown by the fact that a condition of the gift was that a house for the astronomer should be built, and that one was built adjacent to the observatory. The desire to make the telescope useful was further shown by the setting aside of a separate endowment as a distinctive and separate working fund for the Observatory. The desire to keep the observatory distinct from the University is shown by its location at such a distance from the college.

It seems to me, as trustee of the estate of Mr. McCormick, that everything was done by him, and by Mr. Vanderbilt and by the alumni of the University to found and equip a first class and practical working observatory, and endow it so that it might obtain the best results, and it further seems to me that by the using by the University of a great portion of the Director's time for undergraduate teaching at the college, the object of the foundation and endowment have been and are being defeated.

In view of the above, I would suggest that the Director of the Observatory should give all his time to the objects prescribed in the endowment, and that the Vanderbilt Fund be used as a distinctive and separate working fund in connection with the observatory as provided. If there is anything in either of these two endowments which prevents the observatory's accomplishing within reason, the purposes which are disclosed in the deed of gift, I wish you would inform me at once as trustee of Mr. McCormick.

I would like to make a further suggestion. I thought I noticed while at Charlottesville that Professor Stone's predilections run more to teaching than to practical work in the Observatory. Would it not be advisable that Professor Stone be retained by the Board of Visitors for the purpose of teaching at the University and that a younger astronomer whose tastes and ambitions lie in the field of astronomical studies and research, should be engaged who can devote himself to the objects of the foundation. It seems to me that the observatory will not do itself justice until some such change has been made.

I beg to acknowledge receipt of your communication of June 11th, containing a presentation of the conditions under which the McCormick Observatory was established at the University of Virginia, and making certain suggestions as to the future use of the observatory and the future conduct of the astronomical work at the University. I had hoped to be able to present that matter to the Board at their June meeting, but by reason of circumstances beyond my control, that meeting was not held, and it is not possible to bring the matter before them before the early fall. Your letter and all the facts must be brought before them and a clear decision reached. The great majority of the Board are men who have taken up service on the Board since these matters were handled, and it will be necessary for them to go back over the records and make a study of the situation themselves.

The whole matter, as I understand it, hinges on the definition of practical and theoretical astronomy. It is perfectly clear from the nature of the telescope and the observatory that it was expected that research work should form an important part of the whole undertaking. That is quite to my taste, and it has been done to a certain extent, but if only research work is to be undertaken, an absolute revolution in the whole astronomical situation here is involved. The subject of Astronomy, as a subject in a liberal education, must be erased from our curriculum, the present Professor of Astronomy practically excluded from our Faculty, because there would be no students within his jurisdiction, except the Vanderbilt Fellows. There is no money available for the University to create another Professorship of cultural and descriptive Astronomy, with the instruments, equipment and small building necessary for that purpose. However, this matter is a matter of twenty years revolution and quiet growth. It cannot be changed in a twinkling, and its change must go through the only form that changes can be brought about here.

I shall certainly see that your communication an all the facts are taken up by the Visitors.

I wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter of June 20th which has been forwarded to me.

Let me know when the matter has been taken up by the Board of Visitors, and what their decision is in regard to it.

Please accept thanks for yours of the 3d. According to the records of the Board of Visitors of the University, the duties of the Professor of Astronomy were to be two-fold: 1st. To teach theoretical and practical astronomy: 2nd. To spend any remaining time in the use of the telescope.

Before I accepted the position I was told by Col. Venable, Chairman of the Committee which extended the invitation to me that I "could teach as little or as much as I chose." As, however, general astronomy was taught at that time in the School of Natural Philosophy, and Astronomy was not recognized as a part of the work for the titled degrees of the University, I assumed that I was to give advanced instruction only, which I did until 1889, when the conditions for the degrees of Master and Bachelor of Arts were changed, and all the academic subjects taught in the University, were for the first time included in the general scheme of those degrees. At the same time, at the urgent request of the Professor of Natural Philosophy, the instruction in Astronomy which he was giving was transferred to the School of Astronomy where it properly belonged.

I had conversation with your father at various times between then and his death in 1900, and both he and Col. Venable, were of course aware of the transfer referred to. If the School of Astronomy founded in connection with the observatory is to "do something for Virginia" as he expressed it, then it is manifestly important that it be made an active force in the life of the University of Virginia, of which it forms a part. From my conversations with your father, I have reason to believe that the policy I have pursued met his approval.

It has been a cause for regret that the endowment of the observatory is so meager, since the efficiency of every institution depends upon the amount available for current expenses, above all for the salaries of competent men, to do the work of the institution. The one need of this Observatory is not more telescopes, but more endowment. All the great Observatories have large incomes. Without such income it is hopeless to compete with them.

On the other hand, even a small addition to the financial power of the Observatory would bring commensurate results. For instance an added annual income of a few hundred dollars would enable the Observatory to print its results in its own series of publications, instead of scattering them elsewhere. One or two thousand dollars a year would permit the employment of at least one assistant who could devote his entire time to the work of the Observatory, the character of such assistance depending on the amount that could be given him. An endowment of even $10,000 would accomplish something, but an endowment of $50,000 would accomplish much more, even though it might not permit us to compete on a basis of equality with the larger observatories of the country.

Resolved: That the thanks of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia be conveyed to Mr. W. Gordon Merrick for his action in the establishment in connection with the Engineering School of the University of Virginia of the "Isabella Merrick Sampson Scholarship."

Copy of correspondence and deed of trust here follows:

Enclosed please find a copy of the above mentioned trust, the original of which is recorded and filed in the clerk's office of the Albemarle Co., court, also an order on the Albemarle Nat.
