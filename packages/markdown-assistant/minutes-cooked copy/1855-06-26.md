### Wednesday June 27

The Board met pursuant to adjournment present the same gentlemen as on yesterday with the addition of Joseph C. Cabell Rector.

The Rector having called the Board to order, submitted his annual Report to the Legislature which was read and on motion of Mr Stevenson it was unanimously approved.

The Rector laid before the Board a Communication from Dr Harrison in relation to his school, and on the motion of Mr Stevenson it was referred to a committee of two.

The Rector appointed Messrs Stevenson & Miller a Committee to consider the memorial of Dr Harrison.

The memorial of the Hotel-Keepers upon the subject of Board having been read & considered on Motion of Mr Stevenson, it was

**Resolved** that under existing circumstances and the state of the markets the Board deem it reasonable and proper that the sum of ten dollars be added to the present rates for Board, so as to restrict the full amount to be received for the session to the sum of $130 but with an express understanding that this arrangment is to be regarded as temporary and limited to one year.

The letter of Dr Maupin in relation to the addition to his Pavilion having been read and considered

Upon motion, it was resolved that the Proctor be directed to pay to Dr Maupin annually the legal interest on $3033.00 the cost of said addition, computing the same, from the 1st day of February 1855 until the principal is extinguished.

The Letter of Dr Maupin was laid before the Board by the Rector, and after a full and careful examination of the prior proceedings of the Board in connection with the resignation of Dr Smith and the appointment of Dr Maupin to the Chemical Chair, and the payment of Dr Smiths salary, the Board deem the application of Dr Maupin inadmissible and it is therefore rejected.

The following report from the Executive Committee was presented by the Rector, read, and on motion ordered to be spread upon the minutes.

### REPORT.

"The undersigned members of the Executive Committee submit the following report to the Board of Visitors. In pursuance of the report of the special committee upon the subject of repairing the terraces and supplying water for the University \[adopted by the Board of Visitors on the 29th of June 1854] the Executive Committee to whom the duty was assigned of carrying into effect the objects of the report, preceeded to do so in the following manner.

They first caused due notice to be given by the Proctor in the newspapers of Richmond, Washington Baltimore Philadelphia and New York, inviting propositions for the works proposed to be executed, from those who might be disposed to contract for the same according to the specifications in the hands of the Proctor. In pursuance of this notification various propositions were submitted both for the repairs and the water works, which your committee proceeded to examine and consider.

Upon the subject of a supply of water, it became apparent at the threshold that nothing could be done, under the authority given to the Committee.

In the first place the lowest bid for the work upon the cheapest and most economical scale, exceeded the $25,000 the limit fixed by the Board, and to which your committee was authorized to go, and which presented at once an insuperable objection to any further proceeding on the subject. But it may be proper also to state that, if the bids for the work should have fallen within the limit, another obstacle presented itself at the threshold, and that was the refusal of the proprietor of the Springs (or one of them at least, and that the most important, relied upon for the supply of water) refused to sell or dispose of the same for the uses of the University, except upon conditions (which if even just and reasonable of which the Committee express no opinion) they had no authority to make. These conditions the Proctor will lay before the Board and explain if desired.

Upon the subject of the terraces the committee were more successful- An advantageous contract was made with George W. Spooner for the entire work, within the limit proposed, and for a less sum, to be completed by the 1st day of December next, as will appear by the contract exhibited with this report. This however could not have been accomplished but by dispensing with the copper covering and substituting in lieu of it, a covering of heart pine plank of the best discription well seasoned and tongued & grooved, with seven coats of paint, and a final covering of duck or canvass, to render it secure against all weather. For this latter work a contract was made with James F. Boyer, at a reasonable price he being the lowest bidder therefor, and which contract will hereafter be perfected and exhibited. In the progress of the business and preparatory to entering into any contract for the work to be done, it appeared important to your Committee, indeed indispensable that they should have the aid of some schilful person in examining in detail the various bids and estimates, which had been submitted to the Committee, and enabling then to decide in the first place upon the relative merits of each bid (of which it was not to be expected they were competent to judge in finally contracting for the work) and with that view they proceeded to engage the services of Mr Shaw a skilful enjineer and practical man of business, who readily assented to the proposition, and immediately proceeded to discharge the duties assigned him in a satisfactory manner, It was moreover apparent that the work under any contract they could make, could not be satisfactorily and safely done without such a superintendent well qualified to judge of the timber and work, and who would be able to superintend the whole work as it was in progress, from its commencement to its final completion, for this your Committee agreed to allow Mr Shaw the sum of $400, which they regard as a reasonable compensation for the services to be performed by him.

It may be proper also to state that before anything was done, upon the subject of the water works it became essential to have the aid and attendance of Mr Erdman who had made the original estimate for the water works, and he was accordingly invited to attend, which he did from Philadelphia in February last and remained several days at the University and for his travelling expenses and per diem attendance the sum of $65.72 was directed to be paid by the Proctor by your Committee.

All which is respectfully submitted

**A Stevenson Executive Committee**

**Wm J. Robertson Executive Committee**

The following resolution was adopted.

**Resolved** that it be recommended to the Executive Committee to cause a further examination to be made, (if they shall deem it expedient to do so), during the present summer, by a Competent engineer, in reference to the supply of the University with water and its probable cost, and to report to the Rector.

The Report of the Chairman of the Faculty was read and laid upon the table.

The Rector appointed the following Committees:

* **Committee of Finance** Messrs Miller & Robertson
* **Committee of Inspection** Messrs Stevenson & Carr
* **Committee of Library** Messrs Stevenson & Miller

A communication from the Secretary of the Faculty was read and laid upon the table.

The annual reports of the Proctor & Patron, Bursar, and Commissioner of accounts were referred to the committee on Finance: and the Librarian's Report to the Committee on the Library.

On motion of Mr Carr it was

**Resolved**, that the Faculty be requested to revise and collect the laws in relation to Discipline, so that the same may be printed in a condensed form, for the use of the Students.

A communication from Prof Schele De Vere in relation to the purchase of maps was read, and on motion it was,

**Resolved**, that the sum of Five Hundred Dollars\[*] \[*]to be expended under the direction of Dr. Schele De Vere. be and the same is hereby appropriated, for the purchase of Maps with the appendages for the use of the School of Modern Languages;

to be expended under the direction of Dr. Schele De Vere.

Mr Sherrard Clements appeared and took his seat at the Board. Thereupon the Rector placed him upon the Library Committee in place of Mr Stevenson.

On motion of Mr Robertson the following preamble and resolution were adopted.

In consideration of the recommendation of the Faculty and in view of the peculiar circumstances of the cases, and especially of the fact that the previous action of this Board may have induced reasonable expectations on the part of the young gentlemen referred to, that the strict letter of the enactments would not be insisted on, to entitle them to the degree of Bachelor of Arts, provided they displayed an amount of attainment equivalent in the opinion of the Faculty & Board of Visitors to that required for the degree; it is resolved that the Faculty be authorized to confer the degree of Bachelor of Arts upon Messrs Wm G. Strange, H. M. Mathews, and John E. Jones, but it is declared that in the opinion of the Board the best interests of the Institution require that in future, in no case whatever, should the precise requisitions of the law as to the qualifications of applicants for the degrees of Bachelor of Arts and of Master of Arts be departed from, but that the same should be rigidly enforced.

The Board then adjourned until tomorrow morning at 9 oclock A.M.

### Thursday June 28th 1855

#### Morning Session

The Board met pursuant to adjournment present the same gentlemen as on yesterday.

Mr Stevenson from the Committee on Dr Harrisons memorial offered the following report and resolution which were on motion unanimously adopted. The Committee, to whom was referred the memorial of Dr Harrison the Professor in the School of Ancient Languages, have had the same under consideration, and beg leave to report,

"That the views presented in this memorial, are in the judgment of your Committee, of a highly important and valuable character, and the subject one intimately connected with the usefulness of the school, and the interests and character of the University.

With regard to the question of appointing another Professor it is not needful at this time, that any action should be taken either by your Committee, or the Board of Visitors, insomuch as by the existing enactments, the number of Professors is limited and there is no power without further legislation, to increase, or diminish the number now in existence. What course the Board may deem it necessary hereafter to take, to remedy the evils likely to result from the existing state of the school of ancient languages, will be a subject for future consideration of the board.

Your committee can only invoke for it early and effective action.

Upon the subject of increasing the means of instruction in this important school, your committee have no difficulty in expressing a decided opinion, that both in regard to the variety and extent of the subjects assigned to this school, and the greatly increased mubers frequenting it, there can be no doubt but that the provision of one Professor and a single assistant teacher for such a school is totally inadequate, and ought to be changed. This in the opinion of the Committee is made quite manifest by the views and statements contained in the memorial presented to them, and of which each of the members of the Board is in possession.

To attempt to enlarge or enforce these views of Dr Harrison would seem to be unnecessary and uncalled for,

Your Committee therefore recommend to the Board the propriety and necessity of providing forthwith, for the appointment of an additional assistant teacher in the school of Ancient Languages, and with that view, submit the following resolution for adoption.

**Resolved** that in the opinion of this Board it is essentially needful to the character and usefulness of the School of Ancient Languages, as well as the best interests of the University, that an additional assistant teacher should be forthwith appointed in that School to take effect from the 1st day of October next with a salary of $700, and the appointment to be made by Dr Harrison with the consent and approbation of the Executive Committee.

All which is respectfully submitted

**A Stevenson**

**F. B. Miller**

Mr. Stevenson submitted the following Preamble and resolution which on motion of Mr Carr were unanimously adopted

Whereas the Board of Visitors being satisfied that the interests of both the Academical and the Medical Departments of the University, would be promoted by relieving the Professor of Chemistry of the duties of teaching Materia Medica & Therapeutics & assigning the same to the Lecturer on Anatomy; adopted a resolution on the 30th of June 1853 making the proposed change.

And whereas at the same time, the Board resolved, that the fees to be paid by each medical student to the Lecturer on Anatomy and Materia Medica, should be $25, with a provision that should the aggregate amount of fees exceed $2000, then the surplus should be appropriated for the purchase of specimens and appliances for the cabinet of Materia Medica and Anatomy-

And whereas Doctor Davis receives no salary from the University, but is paid exclusively by fees from students for doing full work, and doing it well, it appears not just and proper that he should be limited to the $2000, but on the Contrary that he is fairly entitled to the aggregate amount of all fees paid; subject to the restrictions imposed, upon the other Professors; And this would seem the more reasonable, in as much as the $2000 besides being no sufficient compensation for the la or performed, is entirely inadequate to meet the necessary expenses of maintaining a family, upon a scale of the most rigid economy.

And whereas, it appears that increased advantages have resulted to the University, from the creation of this department, and the fees paid by the students matriculating have never passed into the general treasury of the Institution.-

1. **Resolved**, as the opinion of the Board that the limitation aforesaid ought to be removed, and the surplus amount of the fees, enure to the exclusive benefit of Dr Davis.

2. **Resolved** that in consequence of the limited accomodations which the house now occupied by Dr Davis affords and the discomfort and consequent inconvenience to which his family is subjected: the Proctor is directed to enter into a contract for the construction of 3 rooms in the rear of the House, the cost of which is not to exceed the sum of $2000; the contract and Plan for which addition shall be approved by the Executive Committee.-

Mr Lucas appeared and took his seat at the Board.

The Committee of Finance submitted the following report which was read, and laid on the table for further consideration. "The Committee of Finance have examined the accounts of the Bursar and Patron and Proctor, and the report of the Commissioner of the University, which they find to correspond with and verify each other, showing a balance in the Bursars hands on the 1st of June 1855 of $5178.15 the receipts for the year previous being $32978.10 and the disbursments $33799.95.

In accordance with the practice heretofore the certificate of the Commissioner is taken as evidence of the fact that the items of disbursmerts are sustained by proper vouchers. It will be seen that the balance on hand is considerably larger than the estimate made last year by the Proctor, and this although the disbursements also exceed his estimates.

The proctors Estimate for the coming year is that the receipts will amount to $43683.15, and the disbursements to $35905 giving a balance on the 1st of June 1856 of $7778.15.

In the disbursements contemplated by this estimate is included the balance of the debt due the Farmers Bank in Charlottesville amounting to $3240- only $760 of the principal of that debt having been paid during the past year. In view of the large balance on hand, and the fact that the $25,000 which it was supposed would be needed for the water works will not be required, at least for some time to come, your Committee are of opinion that it would be expedient to discharge the whole of this debt to the Bank at as early a day as practicable.

They think it probable that it can be paid at once without inconvenience but if such should turn out not to be the case, they recommend that the Proctor be instructed to reduce it as rapidly as he can without interfering with the payment of other demands which ought to be met.

Your Committee have been much surprised at the result exhibited by the "Labor and Farm" account; and think it proper to call the attention of the Board especially to it. It will be seen that the disbursements amount to $1238.44 while the receipts are only $120.97. Showing a balance against the farm of $1117.47. It appears however from the explanations of the Proctor given orally that some items are included in this account which should not properly be charged against the farm. Of this character is the hire of three of the servants who are employed, not upon the farm, but about the buildings of the University. These items amount together to $255 and to this sum should be added a charge of $25.07 which it seems from his statement, was for a purchase mode for the farm several years ago, and which therefore ought not to be included in the estimate of the cost of keeping up the farm during the past year- But after deducting all these items it appears that the farm cost, during the last year, the sum of $837.40 over and above the amounts received from it. The whole receipts not equalling the wages of the Overseer- In this state of facts it deserves the serious consideration of the Board whether some change should not be made in the management of this matter. If it should be determined to abandon the effort to keep up the Farm and thought expedient to rent out the land, it would perhaps be best not to do so until the commencement of the next year (1st Jany.) especially as the hands and teams may be usefully employed in removing the old timbers, which will be taken down when the Terraces are repaired: & which, under the contract which has been made, will belong to the University. But the Committee are not prepared to recommend decidedly what course should be pursued with reference to the farm. There object is to call the attention of the Board to the subject; so that some action may be taken which will put an end to the present state of affairs.

In connection with this subject your Committee would most respectfully suggest for the consideration of the Board the propriety of relieving the Proctor & Patron from the supervision and care of the Buildings and other property of the University; and employing the services of some practical man of business who will understand and be able to give his whole attention to the management and preservation of the buildings and public grounds. With the greatly increased business of the office it is impracticable for the Proctor to attend sufficiently to the out door as well as the indoor duties which are now required of him. Besides, it is not to be expected that one man can combine in himself the qualifications requisite for the discharge of duties so unlike in their character. Without intending therefore to reflect upon the present Proctor (who as your Committee believe, has done as much as could reasonably be expected of him under the circumstances) it seems to them that the interests of the University would be promoted by the appointment of a superintendent of buildings and grounds, and a division of duties between him and the Proctor, leaving to the latter the financial matters, and those connected with the discipline of the Institution which now belong to him. In that event the Proctor would probably be able to dispense with the services of a clerk- whose salary as also that of the present overseer, might be applied towards making up the salary of the superintendent. But as to this matter also the object of the Committee is rather to call the attention of the Board to the subject than to suggest any definite plan.

Among the recommendations of the Proctor is one for repairs of the roofs of the dormitories on the Eastern and Western Ranges which, according to his estimate, will involve an expenditure of some $2000. The Committee suppose that it would not be prudent to incur such an expense without a preliminary examination as to the best plan for the repairs- but this, as well as the other repairs suggested, will as they suppose be referred to the consideration of the Executive Committee.

In reference to the recommendation that gates should be erected across the roads leading around the University the Committee are of opinion that any which would be likely to afford the desired protection would interfere too much with the convenience of the residents at the University and of persons visiting it on business or pleasure. But while they are not disposed to adopt any course which can interfere with free access to all parts of the University they concur with the Proctor in the opinion that it is not proper that the roads leading around the University and passing in front of the Dormitories and Hotels, should be used as public roads by persons passing from one part of the County to another. They are so used, as they understand, chiefly, if not entirely by persons travelling the Lynchburg Road. This may, and in the opinion of the Committee, ought to be prevented by the erection of gates across the roads, on each side of the Gymnasium, leading into the Lynchburg road near the points where they unite with that road- These gates might be kept locked, except when needed for the use of persons connected with, or regularly dealing in, the University.

All which is respectfully submitted

**F. B. Miller**

**W. J. Robertson.**

A letter from the Faculty in reference to the compensation of the assistants having been laid before the Board and considered by them it is

**Resolved** that the salary of the assistants be fixed at $700 per annum- to be increased to $800 per annum after two years of service in the same school, to $900 per annum after four years of service in the same school and to $1000 per annum after five years of service in the same school.

The memorial of Dr Allen having been read and considered it was on motion of Mr Olements

**Resolved** In consideration of the fact, that the demonstrator of Anatomy, has been employed in the University for the last three years, in active and efficient cooperation with those engaged in the Department of Anatomy at a salary of $500- that the same be now fixed at the sum of $700.

A Subpoena in Chancery having been served upon the Rector and Visitors at the suit of Philip H. Jones surviving admr with the will annexed of William W. Michie decd in the Circuit Court of Hanover, the Executive Committee are requested to take the necessary steps, by the employing of Counsel or otherwise, to have the interests of the University attended to.

A communication from Charles B Shaw in relation to instruction in civil engineering, having been read it was on motion of Mr Robertson

**Resolved** That it is in the opinion of the Board inexpedient to take any action under the communication received from Mr Shaw in reference to instruction in Civil Engineering. The Board then took a recess until 1 1/2 oclock P.M. for the purpose of hearing the address of Lieut. Mauray and after the same was concluded, reassembled. When on motion of Mr Robertson it was Ordered that the Bursar be authorized to draw his checks upon the Auditor for the amounts required for the repairs of the Terraces.

The Board then adjourned until four oclock P.M.

### Evening Session.

The Board met pursuant to adjournment.

The Library Committee presented their report which was read.

The Committee on the Library beg leave to report. That its condition, together with that of the books seems to be good.

It would no doubt, be desirable to have a more full and accurate catalogue, as the only one in print, bears date in the year 1828 but in view of the means at the disposal of the Board, the Committee are not prepared to recommend it. We do recommend however that, the late additions to the library be included in the present catalogue or a supplement to it, by transcription.

We beg leave to submit, herewith the report of the librarian for the present year, giving a detailed account of the books purchased or added during the present year together with those which are in the hands of the professors and others,

We beg leave also, to recommend that the sum of named in the report of the Librarian for the purpose of binding documents \&c be appropriated.

All of which is respectfully submitted

**Sherrard Clements**

**F. B. Miller**

The board then adjourned until tomorrow morning at 9 oclock A.M.

### Friday June 29th 1855

#### Morning Session.

The Board met pursuant to adjournment present the same gentlemen as on yesterday, and before any business had been transacted adjourned to attend the Public exercises, After the conclusion of the same, the Board reassembled.

Mr Stevenson submitted the following Preamble & resolution for adoption;-

Whereas it appears that the State Agricultural Society of Virginia, animated by a desire to advance the interests of Agriculture, by elevating the rank of the farming class of Virginia, & placing its educational training by the side of the other learned Professions of the State, and being moreover desirous to employ a large portion of their ample funds, in the advancement of an object, so desirable and praiseworthy, and at the same time as the best means of rearing a monument to the Public spirit, & Patriotism of the founders, of their Society; did at its last annual meeting appoint a committee of thirteen of its distinguished members to confer with the Board of Visiters of the University of Virginia, for the purpose of ascertaining, upon what terms, & conditions, & to what extent, that Institution, would be disposed to cooperate with their Society, in the accomplishment of their object, by the establishment of a Professorship of Agriculture in the University, & which it was the wish of the Society to endow, & support out of their funds.

And whereas 5 members of the Committee viz Franklin Miner, Francis Cabell, Oscar Crutchfield, J. B. Baldwin, & Thos. Lee, esquires, have been pleased to attend the Board of Visitors in person, & a free conference & interchange of opinion, having taken place upon the subject, to the mutual satisfaction of all Parties & with a perfect understanding as to each others views & opinions; the Board have adopted the following as the result of their best judgment, upon the subject:-

**Resolved**, as the opinion of this Board that the proposition of the State Agricultural Society of Virginia to endow & establish a Professorship of Agriculture in the University, meets with the cordial approbation of the members of this Board, & they accept it in the same frank & generous spirit in which it has been made-Concurring most fully, in the views & objects of the Agricultural Society, as expressed through this committee & regarding the object to be attained, as one of vital importance, to the best interests of the People of Virginia, & as one of the most efficient means for the dissemination of Agricultural knowledge among men & their Posterity, & the promotion of moral progress; & moreover as well calculated to ensure the ultimate success and triumph of this noble institution, identified with the best interests & glory of our beloved Old Commonwealth; the members of this Board consent, & agree to accept the endowment of the Professorship offered; & give to the Society of Agriculture, an assurance, that the authorities of the University will use the powers confided to them, to have the proposed Professorship established in the manner, best calculated to meet the wishes & objects of the Society, & ensure to the Farmers of Virginia, a complete course of Agricultural instruction, upon a scale of the most rigid economy:-

**Resolved** that the Rector be requested to communicate to the Chairman of the Committee of the Agricultural Society, a copy of the foregoing preamble & resolutions, with an assurance that the Board of Visitors, regard the liberal proposition that has been made, as a fit subject for sincere & candid congratulations.

Mr Stevenson offered the following resolution for adoption:-

**Resolved** that the Rector be requested to make application to the ensuing Legislature to remove the restriction imposed by the present enactments as to the number of Professors, in the University & to ask that power may be given to the Board of Visitors to increase the number. This in their opinion, the interests of the institution should require it.-

The question being put on this resolution, it was unanimously adopted.

Col H. B. Tomlin appeared and took his seat at the Board.

A report from a committee of the Faculty was laid before the Board and the following resolution was on motion of Mr Stevenson adopted

**Resolved** that the report be referred to the Executive Committee, and that they be requested to take such order in the matter, as may appear to them proper under the circumstances.

Mr Stevenson from the Committee of Inspection offered the the following report.

The Committee of Inspection have not had time sufficient to make as thorough an examination as might have been desired, but they have availed themselves of every leisure moment in making the best examination in their power, and submit the following report to the Board.

The several departments of the University appear to be in their usual good order and condition. The library is in good order, the books being arranged according to the order of the printed catalogue and the shelves are labeled, but for further particulars in regard to this subject they refer to the report of the Committee on the library. In examining the buildings the Committee found great delapidation and injury in many of the buildings and especially in the dormitories and the ceiling of the terraces, this last however will soon be remedied, by the contemplated repairs of the terraces.

They find the public water closets in a very filthy state and a perfect nuisance endangering the health of the students, and even of those who reside within the limits of the University.

The grounds also seem to have been greatly neglected, and are in a wretched state, It is an act of justice to the Proctor to state, that he informed the committee, that he had not the means nor experience requisite to keeping them in order, The Committee are decidedly of the opinion that some remedy ought to be applied, and as a means of remedying the evil it might be advisable to separate the duties of the Proctor and place all the out door duties of his office under the management of a skilful man of business; by so doing your Committee are of the opinion that the evils referred to may be avoided, and the Buildings and grounds of the University properly cared for.

All which is respectfully submitted

**A. Stevenson**

**J. L. Carr**

Mr Robertson offered the following resolution

**Resolved** that one of the Dormitories now in the occupancy of Dr Howard be appropriated to the use of Students, or of one of the assistant Professors, as the Proctor in his discretion may think fit, to which Mr Tomlin offered the following substitute.

**Resolved** that no Professor shall be at liberty to occupy more than one dormitory adjoining his pavilion, he paying the rent and making the repairs required of the Students occupying dormitories.

Mr Tomlin called for the Ayes and Nos on his substitute and the question was decided in the negative by the following vote.

The vote being then taken on Mr Robertsons resolution it was carried unanimously.

On motion of Mr Robertson it was

**Resolved** that Dr Socrates Maupin be appointed Chairman of the Faculty for the next twelve months after the expiration of his present term.

**Resolved** that the Proctor be authorized to cause to be erected gates across the roads on each side of the gymnasium, where they meet with the Lynchburg road, to be kept closed except when persons connected with, trading to, or visiting, the University desire to pass through them.

**Resolved** that one half of the cost of a Band of music for the closing exercises at the end of each session (including the celebrations of the literary societies) be paid by the Proctor and that the band shall be under his control.

Mr Stevenson offered the following resolution which was adopted.

Having reason to believe from the experience of past years that the Proctor and Patron of the University might with propriety and benefit to the University be relieved from the supervision and care of the Buildings and other public property of the University and that all the out-door duties, might with advantage be confided to some skilful and practical man, who could devote his whole time to the discharge of these and other duties for a suitable compensation. **Resolved** that the whole subject be referred to the Executive Committee with authority to divide the duties of the Proctor in the manner suggested, and with power to them to make the appointments of such an assistant with a salary not exceeding $1200 if in their opinion the interests of of the University would be promoted by such apportionment and division of labor between the Proctor & such superintendent, and in case such division shall take place, the offices and salaries of overseer & clerk of the Proctor shall cease, and their respective salaries be applied to the payment of the superintendent aforesaid. It appearing that the Proctor and Patron has executed bonds in the penalties required by the resolutions passed on the 29th day of June 1854 and that the surities thereto, made affidavit to their sufficiency on the 21st of August 1854 but that said bonds have never been submitted to the Executive Committee for their approval and that there is no evidence before the board, of the continued sufficiency of said sureties at the present time, it is ordered that the Proctor and Patron be required to lay before the executive committee, such evidence within sixty days from this time and obtain their approval of the said bonds.

And it further appearing that the Bursar has not as yet executed the bond and furnished the evidence required by said resolutions of the 29th of June 1854, but that the failure so to do has been purely accidental, the Board doth order that the Bursar execute said bond and procure the approval of the Executive Committee within sixty days from this date.

The Board then adjourned without day.
