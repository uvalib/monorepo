The minutes of the meeting of March 4th, copies of which had been mailed to the several Visitors, were approved.

The President announced the following gifts:

From Paul G. McIntire the sum of $155,000 to establish a School of Fine Arts.

Following is the correspondence between Mr. McIntire and President Alderman:

I am sending you be registered mail (fully insured, for $102,000), a United States Certificate of Indebtedness No. 647 for $100,000. dated January 2, and due June 3, 1919, the interest of which amounts to $1,873.97 and my cheque for $48,126.03 and including the cheque for $5,000. that I handed you in Charlottesville makes a total of $155,000.

The purpose of this gift is to establish in the University of Virginia a School of Fine Arts to comprise first, a School of Art and Architecture, second, a School of Music, and the income from these funds is to be used in perpetuity for the use and development of these schools.

The sum of $75,000. of this amount I desire to be allotted to the School of Art, consisting of Art and Architecture, and the sum of $80,000. to the School of Music.

I sincerely hope that the University will see its way clear to give many lectures and concerts on the above subjects so that the people will appreciate more than ever before that the University belongs to them and that it exists for them.

I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of March 14th. I have also received, by registered mail, the United States Certificate of Indebtedness No. 647 for $100,000. dated January 2, and due June 3, 1919, the interest of which amounts to $1,873.97. I have also received your check for $48,126.03. I have previously received from your hands a check for $5,000. The total of all these receipts, as you state in your letter, is $155,000.

I note that the purpose of this splendid gift is designated by you to found at the University of Virginia a School of Fine Arts, comprising, first, a School of Art and Architecture; secondly, a School of Music.

I further note that you desire the income from these funds to be used in perpetuity for the use and development of these schools and for no other purpose.

I beg to renew my expression of profound gratitude, on behalf of the University for this wise and far-seeing gift, and to assure you that its purposes will be carried out by the Rector and Visitors with strict adherence to the wishes of the donor.

I shall bring the whole matter, for formal consideration, to the Rector and Visitors at their next meeting, and will then communicate to you what I am sure they will command me to do, the expression of their gratitude for the immense new strength that your foresight has given to the University of Virginia in increasing its ability to serve and strengthen the people of the commonwealth and of the nation.

In connection with the foregoing gift, the following resolution was adopted:

RESOLVED, That the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia acknowledge, with gratitude and appreciation, the great gift of $155,000, made by Mr. Paul Goodloe McIntire, '79, of New York City and Charlottesville, for the purpose of establishing and endowing in the University, a School of Fine Arts, embracing Art, Architecture, and Music. It will be the duty of the Rector and Visitors to see that this great gift is applied exclusively to the purposes indicated in the letter of gift. The Rector and Visitors will take immediate action in the matter of the inauguration of this new school.

A resolution establishing a School of Fine Arts was adopted as follows:

RESOLVED, by the Rector and Visitors of the University, That, in accordance with the terms of a gift of $155,000, made by Mr. Paul Goodloe McIntire, of New York City, a School of Fine Arts, embracing Art, Architecture, and Music, is hereby established in the University of Virginia, to be known as the McIntire School of Fine Arts.

From Mr. and Mrs. F. D. Minor, of Beaumont, Texas, a gift of $10,000 as an endowment for the Law Library.

Following is the correspondence between Mr. Minor and President Alderman:

As the parents of the late Farrell Dabney Minor, Jr., who graduated from the Law School of the University of Virginia in June, 1911, and who died in France on August 29, 1918 from wounds received in battle, it is our desire to erect some useful and enduring memorial which will permanently associate his name with the University of Virginia, - his, as well as his father's, Alma Mater. This motive springs not alone from the promptings of parental affection for the memory of an only son, - and an only child, - but from the wish to give some outward expression to the love and loyalty that he cherished for the University.

We are, therefore, transmitting to the Bursar of the University, through the hands of our kinsman, Professor Raleigh C. Minor, Ten Thousand Dollars, par value, of United States Liberty Bonds, of the following description:

Eleven Bonds (being nine of the denomination of $1,000.00 each and two of the denomination of $500.00 each) with the proper transfers duly authenticated endorsed on each bond, and more particularly described as follows:

(a) Five Bonds, each of the par value of $1,000.00, numbered 35473 to 35477, both inclusive, Second Liberty Loan, converted, interest payable semi-annually on May 15th and November 15th, each bond registered in the name of Farrell D. Minor.

(b) Four Bonds, each of the par value of $1,000.00, numbered, respectively, 91548 to 91551, both inclusive, Third Liberty Loan, converted, interest payable semiannually on March 15th and September 15th, Bonds numbered 91548 and 91549 registered in the name of Mrs. Eleanor S. Minor, and Bonds numbered 91550 and 91551 registered in the name of Farrell D. Minor.

(c) Two Bonds, each of the par value of $500.00, numbered, respectively, 112516 and 112517, Third Liberty Loan, converted, interest payable semi-annually on March 15th and September 15th, each Bond registered in the name of Mrs. Eleanor S. Minor.

We desire that these Bonds, or the securities into which they may hereafter be converted, be held in perpetual trust by the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, for the uses and purposes following:

1. This donation is to be entitled and known as the "Farrell Dabney Minor, Jr., Donation".

2. The principal of this fund (including additions thereto, hereinafter provided for) is to be preserved intact in securities approved by the financial authorities of the University.

Of the net income in each year, corresponding with the fiscal year of the University, seventy-five per cent (subject to the provisions of the paragraph next succeeding) is to be devoted to the upkeep and the promotion of the general usefulness of the University Law School Library, chiefly in the purchase of books, other library conveniences and accessories, but exclusive of salaries to employees or permanent housing or preservation. The object of the donation is rather the enlargement of the facilities and resources of the Law Library, that as a relief to the general financial budget of the Law School. In expressing these purposes, however, it is not the desire of the donors to limit the reasonable discretion of the Rector and Visitors in arranging their annual appropriations.

The remaining twenty-five per cent of the net income in each fiscal year we desire to be turned back into the principal account and deposited promptly in a Savings Bank, at interest, until a sufficient amount is collected to be conveniently invested in other securities, to be added to the principal securities held to the credit of the donation. The entire interest accruing upon the funds thus deposited in the Savings Bank while they are deposited there, is to be considered as part of the twenty-five per cent of income and with it is to be turned back into the principal fund. But after it has been invested in other securities, as in the case of other interest, seventy-five per cent of the interest thereon shall be for the use of the Law Library, as above indicated, and only twenty-five per cent thereof is to be turned back into the principal account, in the manner before described.

3. The Rector and Visitors are empowered to convert the securities mentioned, from time to time, into such other securities or forms of investment, as they may deem wise, such substituted securities or investments to be held on similar trusts.

4. The donors should desire that there be placed on the front inside cover of volumes purchased under this trust, a simple book-plate, making reference to the donation. The donors ask the privilege of providing, at their own expense, an engraved plate for this purpose.

5. The donors request that this letter of donation, along with the accompanying brief sketch of Lieutenant Minor's life, be entered in the permanent records of the University, and that a certified copy of this letter be delivered to the Dean of the Law School.

In the hope that the acceptance of this trust may be agreeable to the Rector and Visitors, and with the expression of high regard for yourself and of deep affection for the University, we are, dear Sir,

I have this day received your letter of the 28th inst., with the enclosure, giving so moving and interesting an account of the life and service of your son, Farrell Dabney Minor, Jr. I have read with the greatest interest and approval the communication in which you give to the University of Virginia the sum of $10,000 to be known as the Farrell Dabney Minor, Jr., donation, and to be used for the general purpose of the enrichment of the Law Library through the purchase of books and other accessories. I note, of course, the conditions of the use of the fund set forth so clearly by you, the wisdom of which I sincerely subscribe to. I can, in advance, accept for the Rector and Visitors this noble gift, and can, in advance, assure you of their profound gratification and appreciation of the great service you have done to the University and of their pride that so brave and noble a youth shall be here commemorated.

I shall bring your communication before the Board at their first meeting in the latter part of April, and shall take care that every detail of the bequest be understood, the sketch of Lieutenant Minor's life entered upon the permanent records of the University and your whole communication made a part of our records. I hope we shall have the liberty to print in our publications as well the brief sketch of Lieutenant Minor. I shall want to make public announcement of this gift at our Founder's Day ceremony, April 12, prior to the actual meeting of the Board.

Assuring you of my own deep appreciation of this splendid act and of my desire to see that the purposes herein indicated be carried out, I am,

My wife and I appreciate your kind letter of the 31st ult. I have written my kinsman, Prof. R. C. Minor, consenting to the publication of the sketch.
