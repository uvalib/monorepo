The following resolution, recommended by President Shannon and briefly discussed by Dr. Martin and others, was adopted

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the Hospital Accounts Committee be and it is hereby authorized to charge off as uncollectible accounts Schedules 958, 959, 962, 963, 965, 966, 968, and 969, aggregating $91,229.42, as recommended by it, consisting of the following

The President discussed the dangers to undergraduates and inconvenience to the University caused by the present location of a major highway, Route 29 South, which passes through the University Grounds along Emmett Street. The Board, approving the recommendations already made by the President, in cooperation with local government authorities, to the State Highway Commission, adopted the following resolution

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the Board joins with the Charlottesville and Albemarle Chamber of Commerce, the Albemarle County Board of Supervisors, and the Charlottesville City Council in urging the Virginia Department of Highways to provide the necessary funds in its allocation for the fiscal year 1961-1962 for the completion of that portion of the Charlottesville By-Pass connecting U. S. Route 250 West and U. S. Route 29 South. It is vital to the University that the heavy through truck and passenger traffic, which now bisects the University Grounds, separating the dormitories from the other University buildings, be diverted to the By-Pass. Besides inconvenience and noise, there is grave danger from this traffic to large numbers of students who have to cross it in going from their rooms to classes and eating places. Additional University buildings, either under construction or appropriated for, will add to the traffic in this already congested area, and increase the danger

RESOLVED, FURTHER, that a copy of this resolution be sent to the Commissioner of Highways, the Charlottesville and Albemarle Chamber of Commerce, the Albemarle County Board of Supervisors, and the Charlottesville City Council.

Mr. Camp expressed the hope that President Shannon could arrange to appear before the Highway Commission to urge action on this matter.

Referring to the action taken by the Board on 8 October relative to the offer from The Seven Society to present a mace to the University, President Shannon reported on an inquiry that he had made into the academic uses of the mace, and reported that the Faculty's Committee on Public Occasions has now recommended acceptance of the proposed gift. The Board accordingly adopted the following resolution

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the President be authorized to accept the generous offer of The Seven Society to present to the University a mace to be used by the faculty on appropriate academic occasions and to be suitably exhibited at other appropriate times at the discretion of the President, provided that the design and specifications of the mace and its display case shall be subject to advance approval by the President.

RESOLVED, FURTHER, that the thanks of the Board be conveyed to The Seven Society for this fresh evidence of continuing interest in the University's welfare.

The Comptroller of the University, Mr. Shea, appeared before the Board at the President's request and joined in a discussion of a proposed change in the TIAA program for faculty retirement annuities. The change, as presented by the President and the Comptroller, will enable the faculty to take advantage of the Technical Amendment Act of 1958, Public Law 85-866, and will result in exempting from current federal income taxes the 5 per cent contribution which each professor under TIAA is now required to make.

The Board adopted the following resolution

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the resolution concerning a Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association annuity plan adopted by this Board on 22 February 1938 as amended on 10 June 1960 be further amended to delete the following

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that beginning with the session of 1938-1939 it shall be compulsory for all administrative officers of the University and all professors of every grade to pay respectively five per cent (5%) of their salary as received to the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America, until he reaches his sixty-fifth birthday, each such payment to be matched by an amount to be paid by the University equal to fifteen per cent (15%) of the salary in excess of $4,800. The salary shall not include salaries received for summer teaching nor payments made in excess of the regular faculty salary schedule for administrative duties

Nothing in this resolution shall be construed (1) to modify the actions taken by this Board at its meetings on 14 June 1958 and 13 June 1959, or (2) to deprive any faculty member of the rights available to him under the provisions of the Virginia Supplemental Retirement Act as set forth in Article 3, Chapter 3.2, Title 51, of the Code of Virginia, 1950, as amended.

and substitute therefor the following

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that, beginning 1 January 1961, all professors of every grade and all administrative officers shall receive gross compensation as prescribed by the appropriate schedules, of which five per cent (5%) will be contributed directly by the University to the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America and the balance paid to the individual. In addition, the University, from its endowment funds, will contribute for each such individual, an amount equal to fifteen per cent (15%) of the gross compensation in excess of $4,800. The gross compensation shall not include compensation received for summer teaching or payments made for administrative duties in excess of the regular schedules

Nothing in this resolution shall be construed (1) to modify the actions taken by this Board at its meetings on 14 June 1958 and 13 June 1959 except for the Clinical Medical Faculty which is included under the provisions as set forth above, or (2) to deprive any faculty member of the rights available to him under the provisions of the Virginia Supplemental Retirement Act as set forth in Article 3, Chapter 3.2, Title 51, of the Code of Virginia, 1950, as amended

President Shannon and Mr. Shea, Comptroller, discussed the need for a branch bank in the University Hospital, and reported the preliminary inquiries that have been made toward obtaining one.

The following resolution, proposed by the President and moved by Dr. Martin, who accepted as an amendment the final paragraph proposed by the seconder, Colonel Hartfield, was thereupon adopted

WHEREAS, the hospital is desirous of being authorized to set aside 240 sq. ft. for a small branch bank, two of the local banks having indicated an interest in operating such a branch which would be a great convenience to the Medical Center, and

WHEREAS, there is a precedent for this in the State as a branch of one of the Richmond banks is located in the Medical College of Virginia Hospital,

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the University be authorized to enter into an agreement with a local bank for the establishment of a branch in the Medical Center.

RESOLVED FURTHER that this resolution shall not take effect until the University's Special Counsel shall have found, upon investigation, that the establishment of a branch bank in a University building is in accord with Virginia law.

The President reminded the Visitors of their decision at the Annual Meeting last June to sell the property in Dallas, Texas, bequeathed by the late Vivian Louise Aunspaugh. He reported that the several attorneys representing the University in this matter now wish the Board to repeat the previous resolution and to elaborate it so that the names of the present proposed purchasers shall appear in the minutes of the Board. The following resolution was accordingly adopted

WHEREAS, at its regular meeting held on 10 June 1960, the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia adopted the following resolution

RESOLVED, by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the Finance Committee be and it is hereby authorized to dispose of the property located in Dallas, Texas, bequeathed to the University of Virginia by Miss Vivian Louise Aunspaugh, and that the Comptroller of the University be and he is hereby authorized to pay inheritance taxes levied against the bequest by the State of Texas, and,

WHEREAS, an offer was received from Messrs. A. Weinberger, Ervin Weinberger, and A. J. Jackson to purchase said property at the price of $35,000 cash, which offer was accepted on behalf of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia by President Shannon on 4 November 1960, and a written contract for such sale entered into, and

WHEREAS, it is now desired to ratify and confirm the actions of President Shannon in this respect and to authorize the execution of a deed of conveyance to said property,

THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the actions of President Edgar F. Shannon, Jr., in accepting the offer of A. Weinberger, Ervin Weinberger, and A. J. Jackson, of $35,000 cash, and executing a contract of sale with them at that price, of the real property devised to The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia under the Will of Vivian Louise Aunspaugh, consisting of Lots Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4 of Block 507, Seay's Subdivision of the City of Dallas, Texas, be and the same are hereby confirmed, ratified, and approved.

RESOLVED, FURTHER, that said Edgar F. Shannon, Jr., President as aforesaid, be and he is hereby authorized and empowered to execute, in the name and on behalf of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, deed with Special Warranty of Title conveying said property to said A. Weinberger, Ervin Weinberger, and A. J. Jackson, or such person, firm or corporation they may in writing designate, and that Weldon Cooper, Secretary, be and he is hereby authorized and empowered to affix the corporate seal to said deed and to attest the same, said deed to be in form approved by the special counsel of the University of Virginia,

RESOLVED, FURTHER, that the officers of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, be and they are hereby authorized and empowered to execute such other documents or papers, and to take such further steps and do such other things as may be needful or advisable to complete the sale and conveyance of said property.

The President stated that on several occasions in the past the question had come up as to his general authority to execute instruments dealing with real estate or interests in real estate on behalf of The Rector and Visitors, and he believed a resolution granting general authority to him and to the Comptroller would be advantageous.

After discussion, upon motion duly made and seconded, it was

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the President and Comptroller be and they each are hereby authorized and empowered to execute deeds, contracts, options, and other instruments and documents dealing with real estate and interests in real estate, in the name and on behalf of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, and that the Secretary and Assistant Secretary be and they each are authorized and empowered to affix the corporate seal thereto and to attest the same.

The President commented upon a statement directed to the Board by a former student appealing from dismissal by his fellow students on an honor charge. The President stated that receipt of the statement had been reported to the Rector, and that it had then been filed without action in accordance with the traditional practice of the Board and the University's administrators since 1842

The President reviewed developments in athletic matters since the October meeting and he and Mr. Fenwick, Chairman of the Athletics Committee, reported briefly on the Athletics Committee's meetings of 11 November and 9 December, the 18 November joint meeting with the Finance Committee, and the three statements issued to the press. The assurance that President Shannon had given to Mr. Voris, that he could continue as head coach of football for another year, in accordance with his contract, had been well received, Mr. Fenwick noted, by alumni, press, and public.

On 9 December, Mr. Shannon reported, Mr. Voris had called at the President's Office and expressed a wish to resign, provided that he be paid his salary for the final year of his contract. Mr. Voris had appeared before the Athletics Committee on the evening of 9 December and repeated his proposal, asserting that it was a voluntary action on his part, not suggested by any official of the University.

Mr. Shannon pointed out that Mr. Voris' proposal necessitated Board action, despite the President's authority over coaching appointments, because the President cannot expend University funds for services not rendered. After a general discussion, the Board adopted the following resolution:

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the resignation of Coach Voris, conditioned upon the University's paying his salary for the remainder of his contract, be accepted;

RESOLVED FURTHER that the payment be made from funds received from the Atlantic Coast Conference.

Mr. Fenwick, Mr. Camp, and others complimented the President upon his handling of this matter and upon his thorough study of athletic policy and practices over the past thirty years.

President Shannon said that he planned to appoint a special committee to assist him in the selection of both a new Director of Athletics and a new Head Coach of Football.

Both the Rector and the President commented on Faculty attitudes regarding the Conference and the coaching matter. The consensus appeared to be that membership in the Atlantic Coast Conference should be given a further trial, and so continued for the present.

The President called particular attention to the anonymous gift of 400 du Pont shares valued at $73,800 for the publication of the Madison Papers or, if not needed for this purpose, then to be used for the benefit of the University at the discretion of the President. The Visitors joined in comments praising this gift, and adopted unanimously the following resolution:

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the anonymous gift of 400 shares of du Pont stock valued at $73,800 for the publication of the Madison Papers, or if not needed for that purpose then for other uses for the benefit of the University at the President's discretion, be and it is hereby accepted with deep appreciation; that such funds be expended in accordance with the wishes of the Donor; and that the Secretary is hereby instructed to convey this resolution to the Donor.

The President announced the following gifts and grants:

Mr. Edgar E. Woodward, Bursar of the College, substituting at this meeting for Chancellor Simpson, joined President Shannon in reporting on the transfer of the Gari Melchers Memorial property to the University for use by the College.

The attorneys for the University and for the Virginia Museum, it was noted, have reached agreement as to the conveyance of the real estate, and the deed will be recorded shortly in Stafford County, arrangements are being made with Mr. Robert Marsh of the Museum Board for the transfer to the University of some $115,000 in assets of the endowment fund.

The President and Mr. Woodward reminded the Visitors that the time has now come to issue $500,000 in bonds on the two new College dormitories, occupied respectively in 1959 and 1960, in order to reimburse the Treasurer of Virginia for the construction loans.

President Shannon said that unless he heard objections from members of the Board he would authorize the officers of the College to proceed with the employment of the New York law firm of Messrs. Mitchell, Pershing, Shetterly, and Mitchell, as bonding attorneys, and that the issue would probably be offered, after consultation with the State Treasurer, in the spring of 1961. Colonel Hartfield praised the choice of attorneys, and there was general concurrence in the plan as presented.

The President requested permission to accept from a group of anonymous donors a portrait of the late Dr. Morgan L. Combs, former President of the College, painted by Mr. David Silvette of Richmond. The plan, Mr. Shannon stated, is to hang the portrait in the science building named for Dr. Combs, and this will be subject to future approval by the Virginia Art Commission after the Board has acted. The Board thereupon adopted, subject to the reservation noted, the following resolution

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the portrait of Dr. Morgan L. Combs, former President of Mary Washington College, donated to the College, be and it is hereby accepted

President Shannon reported to the Visitors, recommending approval, a request from the Faculty of Clinch Valley College for authority to name the new auditorium - gymnasium building as a memorial to the late Fred Bonham Greear. The Board, concurring in the appropriateness of the proposed tribute to Mr. Greear's generous service to the College and to the entire University, resolved unanimously that the request be approved.

On motion the meeting was then adjourned.
