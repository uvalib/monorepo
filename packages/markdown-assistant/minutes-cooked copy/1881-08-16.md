Board of Visitors' minutes, Accession # RG-1/1/, Special Collections Dept., University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Va.

Minutes of meetings of the university's governing body which is the legal owner and operator of the institution. Recorded in the minutes are appointments and other personnel decisions concerning faculty, decisions about construction of facilities, gifts to the university, and all other board actions, decisions and resolutions.

The Board met at this place at the Call of the Rector, pursuant to the recommendation of the Committee of Conference with the Miller Board appointed under resolution adopted July 1, 1881 (see page ante 112).

Present- Messrs Bocock, Chairman, Marye, Conrad, Gilmore, Randolph, Goode & Lay.

The following Report was submitted:

To the Hon. A. H. H. Stuart, Rector of the University of Virginia.

The Committee of the Professors appointed by the Board of Visitors to act with the Executive Committee in regard to the selection of the site for the Leander McCormick Observatory and to the making some arrangement in regard to the preparation for building the same, beg leave to report progress and to submit the recommendations herewith enclosed for the consideration and action of the Executive Committee.

In the examination of the different sites in the University grounds we were kindly assisted by Prof. Hall of the U.S. N. Observatory who visited the University by invitation, sometime during the month of May. The result of that examination was the unanimous opinion that the top of the Old Observatory Mountain would be the most suitable site within the University domain, provided it was not disturbed by vibrations caused by Rail-way trains passing in the C & O R. R. & V. M. R.R. It only remains then to make observations to test this point- this has been done. Observations made on two different nights by Prof. Mallet, Thornton & myself during the passage of ten or fifteen trains have failed to reveal any tremor of the earth or of the rockledge on the mountain top.

In addition to those observations the Committee, through one or other of its members has been in communication with Prof. Hall and other Astronomers with regard to the preparations for building the Observatory; and one member of the Committee (Prof. Mallet) has by the authority of the Committee visited the Observatory at Washington and the Messrs. Clarke (the makers of the Telescope), at Cambridgeport with reference to the same matter. We are now prepared to make the following recommendations.

### Recommendations:

1. That the summit of the Observatory Mountain be chosen as the site for the Leander McCormick Observatory.

2. That steps be taken at once to proceed with the construction of the foundations of the walls of the Observatory building and also of the piers for the instruments in order that these foundations may get the benefit of settling thoroughly during the winter season.

3. That in order to provide the necessary plans for these foundations, the services of Mr. Rodgers, a draughtsman in the U.S.N. Observatory be engaged at a reasonable compensation who will make the necessary draughts under the instructions of Prof. Hall.

4. That these foundations be laid with the best brick that can possibly be obtained for the purpose, and with the best hydraulic mortor and that the work be done on carefully drawn specifications by a first class brick layer (such as one as may be gotten in Richmond or Baltimore) on contract under constant and careful supervision and inspection.

5. That these recommendations be carried out at once as it would not be well to begin the foundations unless they can be completed before the winter frosts set in.

6. That as much as is practicable of the necessary timber be purchased now in order that it may be seasoned as thoroughly as possible by the Spring of 1882.

It will be observed that while in the completion of the Observatory in all its details it is best in the opinion of the Committee to have the work done under the Supervision of its future Director, yet for the foundations and general plan we have for our guidance the plans of the Observatory at Washington built for a Telescope of the same dimensions of the Leander McCormick Telescope, the accurate details of which are given in the U. S. Naval Observatory Reports with great minuteness. And it is the opinion of the Committee confirmed by all the advice obtained from practical astronomers that time for thorough settling of the foundations of the piers & walls and the thorough seasoning of the timbers of the (Drum) or Cylindrical building in which the dome will rest is of the greatest importance. As we can very safely proceed with the operations recommended much time will be gained by doing the foundation work this summer and fall, then in the coming spring after the appointment of the Director of the Observatory, the work of completion can be commenced and carried through on a solid foundation under his supervision.

Very respectfully submitted for the Committee

Augt 3d 1881

Chs S. Venable.

Members of the Committee - Prof. Smith, Mallet, Thornton & Venable.

The foregoing report having been read and considered, On motion, Resolved,

That the Report of the Committee on the Observatory be received and approved and the Committee which is charged with the further duty of the Construction of the Observatory buildings is directed to supervise and conduct said work in accordance with the suggestions contained in the foregoing report of the 3d of August 1881.

### The Finance Committee submitted the following Report which upon being read and considered was on motion received, approved and adopted.

1. That the amount heretofore appropriated at the regular meeting in June last to the School of Experimental and Scientific Agriculture from the funds of the University be refunded from the amount of the $5,500 lately paid over by the Miller Board of Trustees.

2. That the cash and securities of the Observatory fund now in the hands of and under the control of Prof. C. S. Venable be turned over by him to the Proctor & Superintendent of the University.

3. That out of the Observatory fund the sum of $5000 is appropriated for the construction of the Observatory building and appurtenances, and the Proctor & Superintendent is directed to proceed forthwith with the erection of said building under the supervision and direction of the Committee heretofore charged with the selection of the site of the Observatory \&c.

4. That the Proctor do under the direction and advice of the Executive Committee invest the $2000 heretofore appropriated to the endowment fund of the McCormick Observatory under the requirement of the condition of the Society of Alumni, and such of the Observatory fund as is not already appropriated, in such securities as he may deem safe and productive.

5. That the sum of $300 is hereby appropriated for the improvement of the kitchen attached to the Pavilion occupied by Dr. Harrison.

6. That the sum of $1000 be appropriated to the three Miller Scholarships, giving to each of said Scholarships the sum of $333.33.

7. Resolved, that the sum of $2000 be & the same is hereby appropriated for the improvement of grounds & buildings, of which sum $1000 is to be used in the enlargement and improvement of the Proctor's house.

Mr. Bocock, the Chairman of the Committee of Conference with the Miller Board, made an informal verbal report- Whereupon the following resolution was unanimously adopted:

"Upon a careful consideration of the Report of the Committee of Conference with the Miller Board of Trustees made through its Chairman, Mr. Bocock, and of the papers & resolutions referred to by him, the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia can not concur in the judgment expressed by the Miller Board, that the School of Experimental and Practical Agriculture is a \`lamentable failure' because of any facts yet obtained by the Board in its own passed examinations of the Subject nor from any facts or considerations yet communicated by the Miller Board; And not recognizing the justice of comparing the operations and results of the School with more liberally endowed & differently organized & equipped Agricultural Schools referred to in the Report of Messrs Minor & Barbour to the Miller Board, hold, that it would be a manifest wrong & injury to the present Executive Head of the University School to take the positive action indicated or to reflect upon the conduct and working of the School without affording opportunity to its Head to be fully heard in his own behalf & vindication.

To this end & cheerfully according to the Miller Board of Trustees that respectful consideration to which they should always be entitled when heard with reference to the expenditure of this special fund- This Board, Resolves, that a Committee be appointed by the Chairman to investigate the whole matter of the conduct of this School, to ascertain if inefficiency exists and wherein it exists and to make report to the next regular meeting of this Board with such suggestions to remedy any existing defects or to make the School more efficient and place it in more thorough sympathy with the practical designs of the liberal minded donor of this fund, as the result of their investigation may enable them to present."

Resolved, that the Secretary forward a copy of the foregoing resolution to the Chairman of the Miller Board.

The Chairman appointed as the Committee under the foregoing resolution Messrs. Randolph, Conrad & Whitehead.

On motion Dr. James F. Harrison was elected Chairman of the Faculty in place of Prof. Mallet who decline to accept the position.

On motion the Board adjourned to meet at the University of Virginia on the 28th of September 1881.
