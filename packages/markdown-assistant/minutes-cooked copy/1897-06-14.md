The Board of Visitors met in pursuance of adjournment on yesterday.

Present the same members as on yesterday, viz: The Rector, and Visitors, McCormick, Gordon, Irvine, Harmon, Bryan and McIlwaine.

The following was enacted

Resolved: That the thanks of the Rector and Visitors be extended to Messrs T. Jefferson Coolidge and Augustus Hemenway for their recent donations to the University.

Resolved: That the Rector and Visitors approve of the communication of Profr Wm M. Thornton to the Trustees of the Balinda Randall fund; and the Rector be clothed with authority to do whatever may be necessary to forward the success of said petition.

Resolved: That Profr Buckmaster be elected to the chair in the Medical Faculty now occupied by him.

Resolved: That the thanks of the Rector and Visitors be extended to Profr Wm M. Thornton for his services in endeavoring to secure a donation to the University from the Trustees of the Balinda Randall Fund.

Resolved: That Dr P. B. Barringer be re-elected Chairman of the Faculty for the ensuing session. This resolution was adopted by call of the ayes and nos and on call of the roll all of the members voted aye, but Mr McIlwaine, who voted no.: he having called for the vote by ayes & nos.

Resolved: That the present Executive Committee be continued for the ensuing year with Mr Harmon as Chairman, the Rector having requested that he be relieved of the duties of Chairman of the Committee.

Resolved: That the Faculty be requested to furnish the Visitors at their meeting in November next a sheme of entrance examinations for academic students in the University of Virginia.

The Committee appointed at the meeting in April last to prepare resolutions in regard to the death of Major Green Peyton, late Proctor, submitted its report through Mr Gordon its chairman, which was read to the Board and is as follows:

Memorial.

The Committee of the Visitors appointed at the meeting in April last to report suitable resolutions in regard to the death of the late Proctor of the University, Major Green Peyton, submit following:

The announcement of the death of Major Peyton has come with peculiar sorrow to the Visitors. For a period of more than twenty five years he was a faithful and trusted officer of the University, giving to the discharge of the duties of the office he so ably filled, all the energy and talents with which he was so remarkably endowed. In his intercourse with this Board as a wise counsellor and friend in the matters of University finance, he exhibited an interest, an ability, and a kindly consideration that were as marked as they were acceptable to the Visitors. In his death the University has lost an admirable and efficient officer, and each member of the Board a personal friend. His work is ineffacably stamped upon the history of the University as most beneficent and valuable, and his memory will live in the hearts of all those with whom he was ever brought in personal contact.

The Visitors desire to spread this testimonial upon their record, and ask that it may be printed in the Alumni Bulletin; and that the Secretary of the Board send a copy to the family of our friend.

Mr Harmon moved that the report be adopted and that a recorded vote be taken thereon which was ordered, and on a call of the roll all of the members voted for the adoption of the report, viz: The Rector, McCormick, Gordon, Harmon, Irvine, Bryan & McIlwaine.

Resolved: That the Faculty be requested to furnish to the Visitors at their meeting in November next a scheme of prize scholarships to be offered to the University Schools in Virginia and the South based upon the idea of the exemption from all fees, matriculation and other in Virginia, and upon the idea of the exemption from tuition fees in other Southern states to students in the academic departments. Said scholarships to be awarded such University schools as may have sent to the University a certain number of academic students in the previous sessions.

But this resolution shall not exclude the presentation by the Faculty of any other scheme of University school prize scholarships, which may tend to draw the University and the said schools throughout the south in closer contact.

Resolved, that the Faculty be requested to suggest to the meeting of the Board to be held in November next a plan for the selection of 5 scholarships in the academic schools of the University of Virginia to be filled upon completion from the pupils of the Public Free-schools in the State, each scholarship to be for the term of three years and to include the payment of $200.00 per annum to the successful applicant while a student in the academical schools of the University. And the Secretary of this Board is directed to forward a printed copy of this resolution to each of the County and City Superintendents of Schools in the state with the request that he make suggestions as to a plan for carrying the proposed arrangement into effect.

Resolved, that the Board appreciates the efforts of the Faculty during the last vacation to add to the attendance of the University, and hopes that similar work, with equally good results, may be done during the coming vacation.

Resolved, that a Committee of three be appointed to take into consideration and report to a special meeting what, if any, retrenchments can be made in the expensds of the University particularly to consider the number and salaries of the professors and instructors. Action on the part of this committee will be considered at the November meeting, but any result reached shall not take effect until Sept. 15th 1898.

The Rector appointed Messrs McCormick, Gordon and McIlwaine as the committee.

Resolved: That a committee of three, to be chosen by the Rector, be appointed to examine and report upon the revision of the laws of the University made by the Secretary, pursuant to the resolution of the Board; and that said Committee report what sum will be a proper compensation for said Secretaries services in compiling said revision.

The Rector appointed as said Committee, Messrs Gordon, Harmon and McIlwaine.

Whereas the qualifications and large personal acquaintance of the Proctor are such as to enable him to do efficient work towards increasing the attendance at the University,

Resolved: That the Proctor be requested to do what he can to add to the number of students.

Learning that an effort is being made by friends of the University, both here and in the North to gather together a Poe Memorial Library for the Library of the University of Virginia, at the suggestion of friends of the movement here, it is resolved that an alcove of the University Library be set aside as a Poe Memorial Alcove for the reception of said Memorial Library; said alcove to be selected by the Library Committee of the Faculty.

Resolved: That the Professor of Astronomy be authorized to nominate to the Visitors for appointment by them the Fellows in the Astronomical Department, provided for by the Board at its June meeting, 1896.

Resolved: That Section I (page 9), of the Faculty Report be approved so far as the recommendations therein contained are concerned; and that in accordance with the said recommendations the Professors in the several schools in which there are assistants or Instructors be severally authorized to nominate to the Visitors for appointment by them, the said several assistant instructors.

\[Inserted here pages 9 and 10 from the Annual Report of the Faculty for 1896-97, Section I of which is as follows:

I                 Report on Fellowships.

In response to the desire of the Visitors for a report from the Faculty in regard to the first recommendation of the executive committee's report on the proposed establishment of of five fellowships, to be awarded upon competitive examination, the fellows to act as Instructors in their several departments, the Faculty beg leave to suggest:

First. That it is desirable that all Instructors or Assistants to Professors shall, as far as their duties to the University, for which they are paid, will permit, devote their time to advanced study, especially in the direction of original research, to this extent carrying out the object, and themselves deriving the advantage, of the institution of fellowships. An order to this effect has already been suggested by the Faculty and approved by the Visitors.

Second. That in the choice of Instructors it is desirable that, as far as possible, preference be given to young men engaged in, or desirous of engaging in, advanced and especially research work.

Third. That in the choice of Instructors it is indispensable that not only scholarship but also teaching ability, general character and tact on the part of the candidates for these positions be considered. A man may be admirably well suited to hold the position of a fellow or advanced student and yet quite unfitted to perform the duties of an Instructor with advantage to the students whom he is to aid in teaching. In other words, an Instructor should have the qualifications of a fellow and other no less important qualifications besides.

Fourth. That in view of these considerations it is not feasible to select proper men for the positions of Instructors by means of competitive examinations, and that their selection should, as formerly, be left to the Professors in charge of the several schools concerned, such Professors (or Heads of Schools) to be held responsible for the good judgment of their selections, and the Instructors or Assistants to be in turn held responsible for the proper performance of their duties to the several Professors.

Fifth. That in some at least of the Schools or Departments named for the proposed fellowships it is not possible to procure competent instructors or assistants at the compensation proposed. The duties involved are different in character as well as extent, and the positions require separate consideration.

Sixth. That Professor Harrison wishes to draw attention to the case of his assistant as similar to those of the other Schools named, though, owing to the late date at which his assistant was authorized, no mention was made of him in the paper to the Visitors.]

Resolved: That it is at present deemed inexpedient to consider the recommendation of the Faculty (K, page 10, Faculty report) with reference to the erection of a building for the Law Department.

\[Section K, page 10, of the Annual Report of the Faculty, reads as follows:

K                 Report on a Law Building.

Resolved, That the Faculty wish to present for consideration by the Visitors the fact that the space accommodation for carrying on the work of the University, as provided for in the arrangement of the new buildings, is insufficient.

It is, therefore, recommended that the Visitors consider the advisability of erecting a Law Department building, to cost about $20,000, to be used exclusively for the Law Department.]

Resolved: That the nominations of the following Assistant instructors made by the Faculty for the Session of 1897-1898 be approved, and the instructors named be elected. They are as follows:

Physics: J. H. Corbett

Latin: C. C. Wright

English: H. M. Blain

Demonstrator of Anatomy: A. C. Jones

Demonstrator of Pathology & Medl Biology: L. Skeen, Jr.

Resolved: That as suggested in the Faculty report on page 14, the instructorship in Chemistry be abolished; and that for the present the services of the Assistant in Engineering be dispensed with.

Resolved, that the salary of the instructor in Latin be placed at $700. pe annum; that of the instructor in Physics at $800., that of the instructor in English at $300, that of the two in Biology at $300. each, that of Demonstrator of Anatomy at $800., that of the Demonstrator of Pathology and Medical Biology $800., and that the salaries of the Professors, Associate Professors and Adjunct Professors remain for the session 1897-98 as stated on page 18 of said Faculty report.

Resolved: That $600. be appropriated to establish a hospital for the next session, to be expended under the direction of the Executive Committee.

Resolved: that it is inexpedient at this time to increase \* \*On page 180, information from the Annual Report of the Faculty (1896-1897) has been inserted. the salary of the Secretary of the Faculty.

On page 180, information from the Annual Report of the Faculty (1896-1897) has been inserted.

Resolved: That applicants for the Degree of Ph.D. who may not be in attendance at the University shall never theless pay the usual matriculation fees.

Resolved: that the settlement made by the Chairman of the Faculty with Mr E. S. Vass for fees in the medical department by taking his note for $100.00, be and the same is hereby ratified and approved.

Resolved: That the appropriation for the Bulletin be diminished to $300. as requested in the Report of the Faculty, page 15.

Resolved: That the appropriation for the annals of Mathematics be increased to $500. as requested by the Faculty on page 16 of the Report.

Resolved: That under the circumstances of the case the tuition fees of Mr James A. Lyon be returned to him, it being understood that the requirements of the Law touching citizenship have been fully complied with.

Resolved: That in all cases of students applying for exemption from tuition fees on the ground of citizenship, about which there may be any doubt, the Chairman of the Faculty shall report the facts of the case to the Law Faculty, and such exemption shall be allowed upon his advice, when the citizenship of the student shall be such as is required by law.

Resolved: That the Proctor be directed to press the collection of all unpaid tuition fees, in such manner as in his judgment may be expedient, after full consultation and conference with the Chairman of the Faculty.

Resolved: That the Proctor pay to Dr Buckmaster $35.15 amount expended by him for rent of rooms opposite the Dispensary for the occupancy of patients.

Resolved: That the request of Mrs Elsom to have restored to her the room opening on the back porch of the Hotel and House now occupied by her, be granted, said room having been last year used as a dormitory, but properly belonging to said house.

Resolved: That the classified summary of Expenditures of the Building Committee, from Nov. 15th, 1897, as checked and corrected by Robert Robertson, Superintendent of Grounds & Buildings, be spread on the records. The following is a copy thereof:

Classified Summary of Expenditures of the Building Committee, from Nov. 15th 1895 to June 15th 1897.

"Checked & correct within 0.44 cts." signed, Robert Robertson, Supt

Resolved: That as requested by the Professor of Astronomy, two of the fellows in Astronomy hereafter receive $350.00 per annum, and the other fellowship remain as heretofore at $400.00 per annum.

Resolved: That as requested by Profr Tuttle and concurred in by the Miller Board, the assistants in Biology & Agriculture be known as Fellows, and that their salaries be as recommended by the Miller Board.

The Rector having laid before the Board a letter from Profr Charles W. Kent to Col. Thomas H. Carter, Proctor, dated June 3d 1897 states that there was a balance of $797.31 in the general account of the University which properly belongs to the specific Endowment of the Linden Kent Memorial School of English Literature.

Resolved: that Profr Kent is invited to present to the Board such suggestions of expenditures for the benefit of said school as he may think the school requires.

Resolved: That the fee deposited by Mr R. M. Bruns of $30.00 for the course in Materia Medica, which course was not attended by him, be refunded, as recommended by the Faculty.

Resolved: That $50.00, the matriculation fee of Mr W. J. McNair for the current session and for the session of 1897-1898 be remitted to the Committee on Religious Exercises, as approved by the Faculty.

Resolved: That as requested by Mr. Mann Page, and approved by the Chairman of the Faculty, the sum of $28.50 due him on account of withdrawal for sickness, from the University during the session of $1895-96 be refunded to him by the Proctor.

Resolved: That it is at this time inexpedient to consider the application of Messrs Sykes, Cochrane and Bowen, for the establishment of twelve additional scholarships out of the Fayerweather fund.

Resolved: That the Report of the Superintendent of Grounds & Buildings dated June 7th, 1897, be referred to the Executive Committee with authority to act.

Resolved: That the Report of the Librarian be received and filed.

Resolved: That the bill of W. P. Smith for work in examining the Proctor's Office and his expenses in the same behalf, the whole amounting to $293.80 be paid, less any amount already paid.

Resolved: That the donation of Profr James A. Harrison to the Library, standing to the credit of the Library Fund on the books of the Proctor, and amounting to $100. be at Profr Harrison's request, applied to that portion of the Library to be known as the Poe Memorial Alcove, heretofore at this meeting provided for, and that the same be paid over to Profr Harrison by the Proctor, as said Profr Harrison may require, to be expended by him for the purchase of books, connected with Edgar Allen Poe, for said Alcove.

Whereas, the Hon. William Jennings Bryan of Lincoln, Nebraska has offered to give to the University of Virginia, $250.00 on condition that said sum be permanently invested and the annual proceeds used as a prize to stimulate the students of the University to study and understand the principles which underlie our forms of government. Therefore, be it Resolved, that the Proctor of the University of Virginia, who is its financial agent, be authorized to receive and be the custodian of said sum, the income of this money as invested to be used annually in the purchase of a medal to be won by open competition in the University Magazine for the best original article on the Theory of Government, the chairman of the Faculty being authorized to appoint the Committee whose decision shall be final.

Resolved: That the Medal shall be known as the William Jennings Bryan Medal; and that the thanks of the Rector and Visitors be returned Mr Bryan for his generous donation.

Resolved, that the compensation of the Demonstrator of Anatomy shall be $1000.00 per annum, and the resolution heretofore passed fixing the sum at $800. be and is hereby repealed.

Resolved, that authority is hereby given the Proctor to lease to Mrs Mary E. Towles for one year and thereafter from year to year the tract of land containing 10 or 12 acres lying south of the farm of the said Mrs Towles and between said farm and the road to the Cemetery, for the annual sum of $5.00,-the tenant to keep the land fenced.

The report of the Committee appointed to examine the accounts and securities in the hands of the late Proctor, Major Green Peyton decd, having been read and considered on motion the following resolution was adopted:

Resolved: That the report of the Special Committee to examine the accounts and securities in the hands of the late Proctor be and the same is received and approved; and the Secretary of the Board is directed to record on the minutes of the Board the said report, and also the Report of W. P. Smith the Expert Accountant and the statements marked A. C. D. E. filed therewith and shall also record on the minutes the receipt of Thomas H. Carter, Proctor, for the Cash and securities turned over to him.

Said reports and receipt here follow:

To the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia.

Your Committee appointed to examine the accounts & securities in the hands of the late Proctor respectfully report.

After some difficulty in securing the services of a competent expert they succeeded in employing Mr W. P. Smith of Richmond, after a thorough research and with considerable labor he has made his report, which is returned herewith, from which it appears that the cash on hand apparently exceeds the amount to be accounted for by the Proctor's books by $164.57.

Your Committee had also taken an inventory of the cash and securities in the Proctor's Office and herewith returns the receipt of Col Thomas H. Carter, Proctor, for the same.

The accounts kept by the Chairman of the Faculty during the interval between the death of the late Proctor and the appointment of his successor were also examined and found correct, as were also the accounts of the Superintendent of Grounds and Buildings.

While the Proctor's books were in an unfinished condition, owing to his death, his accounts were found to be correct.

The Special Committee on investigation of the Proctor's office, University of Virginia.

Gentlemen: I respectfully beg to report that in accordance with your directions, I have thoroughly examined the books and accounts in the office of the Proctor, and while the accounts are kept in the old fashioned system of single entry, where there are no checks or proofs by balancing, so far the postings, additions, transfers and transactions in cash are concerned they are with the exception of a few errors, which are plainly clerical, correct.

I enclose herewith, statements of the most important accounts, to which I invite your attention, but all of the books have been examined and corrected, and an inspection of the Ledger will fully inform you as to any other accounts, which I deem it unnecessary to make up in detail.

Appendix "A." showing to the credit of the late Proctor $164.57

Appendix "B." presents status of Restoration Fund.

Appendix C. Cash transactions in Bonds.

Appendix D. Inventory of bonds on hand May 26th 1897.

Appendix E. Account of sales of bonds.

Appendix F. Income derived from payment of students.

Appendix G. Memo of salaries paid professors.

I also enclose some original data which I have used in the compilation of the accounts, and which may be useful to you in future. At your suggestion I be to recommend a change in your Cash Book ( a copy of which I have furnished to Col Thos H. Carter, Proctor.) so arranged that the postings to the different accounts may be made monthly, and a reference to which, at any time, will show the receipts and disbursements without the long and laborious work of referring and condensing. I think this change will save great time and labor to the Proctor, and be much more satisfactory to all the officers and all concerned.

I further recommend that all the cash business, as far as possible, be done through the Banks by checks and deposits, and to this end that the Fuel Account be so arranged and kept as to prevent the necessity of carrying an amount of cash tickets in the cash drawer.

The collection of interest or dividends on any securities held by the institution, when collected, if credited to its peculiar fund, before being passed into income account (which should be done when closing the books at the end of the session), would save much trouble and research to the officers and others in determining the standing of any of the accounts at any time during the session.

I further respectfully recommend that the Double Entry or check system be adopted in the work wherever it can be applied.

The regulations governing the books of the University require that they shall run continuously from the beginning to the end of the session, and I therefore omit to enclose some other reports, which I cannot do without some changes in the books; but an examination of the accounts which I have fully audited, examined and corrected, will give you any desired information.
