### Special Approval

The Board resolved that the proposed salaries as set forth above be adopted effective at the opening of the 1955-56 session.

The following schedule of present and proposed tuition charges, which, like the salary schedules, had been submitted in advance to the Governor and to the Visitors, was laid before the Board.

The Board resolved that the proposed charges be approved and made effective as of the beginning of the 1955-56 session.

President Darden discussed a proposed cooperative research project on "The Law of Farm Rental and Cropper Contracts". The Board adopted the following resolution:

RESOLVED by The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that Dean F. D. G. Ribble of the Law School be authorized to sign a Memorandum of Understanding between the Virginia Agricultural Experiment Station, Virginia Polytechnic Institute, United States Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, Production Economics Research Branch; and the School of Law, University of Virginia, relative to a cooperative research project on THE LAW OF FARM RENTAL AND CROPPER CONTRACTS.

At the President's request, the Board adopted the following resolution:

RESOLVED by The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the Dean of the Law School be authorized to enter into contracts with appropriate publishing houses for the publication of the annual William H. White Foundation Lectures.

The bonding agreements entered into with the Department of the Army in 1948 and in 1951 and the revised requirements of 1954 having been reviewed, the Board resolved as follows:

WHEREAS, The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia by resolution dated 9 July 1948 bound itself to the extent of $100,000 to the United States Government at the time of establishment of a Transportation Reserve Officers Training Corps, and

WHEREAS, in 1951 a Signal Reserve Officers Training Corps, and an Air Reserve Officers Training Corps were established and the value of the military property furnished to the University of Virginia for the use of the three ROTC units was substantially increased, and

WHEREAS, The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia by resolution dated 8 June 1951, bound itself to the extent of $225,000 to the United States Government as required, and

WHEREAS, Section 47 of the National Defense Act was amended in 1954, reducing the amount of bond which ROTC institutions must furnish to a maximum of $25,000.

NOW, THEREFORE, KNOW ALL MEN BY THESE PRESENTS: That said The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia hereby cancels the previous bond in the amount of $225,000 and in lieu thereof is held and firmly bound unto the United States of America in the just and full sum of twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) lawful money of the United States, for which payment, well and truly to be made, it binds itself, its successors and assigns, firmly by these presents.

THE CONDITION OF THIS OBLIGATION IS SUCH that if the above-bounden The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia shall take good care of the property covered by this bond and shall when required by the Secretary of the Army, duly return the same in good order to him, or to such persons as he may designate to receive the same, within thirty (30) days from the receipt of notice so to do, except uniforms, expendable articles, supplies expended in operation, maintenance and instruction, such property as has been worn out in the service for which it was intended, and/or property lost or destroyed without negligence of said The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, or its agents, including students under its jurisdiction, then this obligation to be void and of no effect, otherwise to be and remain in full force and virtue.

It was, thereupon,

RESOLVED, that Colgate W. Darden, Jr., President of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, be and he is hereby authorized and requested to execute said bond in the name and on behalf of said The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, and that Francis L. Berkeley, Jr., Secretary of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, be and he is hereby authorized and requested to affix the corporate seal of said corporation to said bond, attesting the same and delivering the said bond to the Judge Advocate of the United States Army.

President Darden presented a request for confirmation of a conveyance of 1946.

In the settlement of the estate of the late Dr. Walter M. Seward a number of lots in the City of Petersburg, Virginia, were conveyed to the University, and by deed dated August 10, 1946, Lots 17, 18, 19 and 20, Block C, in a subdivision in said City known as "Hillcrest" were conveyed by the University to Johnie Winston Fleming and said deed was recorded by said Grantee in the Clerk's Office of the Hustings Court of said City on the 17th day of September, 1946, in Deed Book No. 158 p. 69.

We are advised that while the attestation clause of this deed recites the fact that "The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia has caused its name to be signed by J. L. Newcomb, its President, and its corporate seal to be thereunto affixed by E. I. Carruthers, its Secretary", there is no reference made to any specific resolution of this Board authorizing and directing this action by these officers.

A Petersburg attorney, in examining the title to these lots, has asked that he be furnished with several certified copies of the resolution which authorized this action, but upon a thorough examination of the minutes of the Board, it would seem that if such a resolution was adopted it was not spread upon the minutes. Our records do show, however, that the transaction was properly concluded, the deed delivered and the purchase money paid. The following resolution was, thereupon, unanimously adopted:

RESOLVED, that the action of the late Dr. J. L. Newcomb as President of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, in executing a deed dated August 10, 1946, by which Lots 17, 18, 19 and 20 in Block C on a plat for the subdivision known as "Hillcrest" in the City of Petersburg, were conveyed to Johnnie Winston Fleming, and of E. I. Carruthers, Secretary of the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia in affixing and attesting the seal of the Corporation to said deed and in delivering said deed to the purchaser, be and is hereby approved, ratified and confirmed in all respects.

The following memorandum of recommendations from the Faculty Committee on the University Cemetery was laid before the Board by President Darden.

The undersigned Cemetery Committee of the University of Virginia hereby submits the following recommendations to the President and The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia:

1. That the privilege of purchasing space in the University of Virginia Cemetery be rigidly restricted to the President and to members of the University of Virginia Faculty or to others as follows:
   * (a) the President, Active Full Professors, Associate Professors and Assistant Professors.
   * (b) the Husband, Wife, Child or Relative of such above President and Professors who die without having acquired such space.

2. That the privilege of burial in the University of Virginia Cemetery be restricted to the above President and Professors and to their Wives and/or Husbands and to said President, Professors and to their Wives and/or Husbands who had reached their retirement age at the University of Virginia without having purchased space.

3. That after burial in either of the lots is made, the second lot will be available for use by the surviving husband and/or wife as the case may be. Should the surviving husband and/or wife not be buried in the second lot, then after the death of the second party said lot shall revert to the University of Virginia and reimbursement be made as noted below.

4. Should space be purchased by any said President or Professor and he or she sever their relationship with the University of Virginia before either lot is used, then said lots shall revert to the University of Virginia, the right of burial in the University Cemetery shall be lost and the University of Virginia shall reimburse said President or Professor the payment for said lot.

5. The right of purchase of space and burial in the University of Virginia Cemetery shall be retained by any President or Professor who has to sever his relationship with the University of Virginia because of permanent illness of any kind.

"I have read the resolution today adopted by the Board. It has my full approval and the implementation of it will have my full cooperation. In so doing I will:

1. Give my full and complete cooperation to any person or persons who are selected by President Darden to function in the manner contemplated by the resolution, and will so state publicly to the faculty, student body, and alumnae of Mary Washington College.

2. I will address suitable letters, in form to be agreed upon between my attorney, Jere Willis, and representatives of the Board, to all persons who wrote the Board regarding the recent investigation (a list of which will be furnished me by the Rector), stating that I agree with the action this day taken by the Board and that I am satisfied with the Board's disposition of the matter and its consideration and treatment of me.

3. That I will write suitable letters of apology to the parents of those young ladies who appeared in my office for disciplinary action in regard to the disturbances in the dining hall, in form to be approved by my attorney, Jere Willis, and representatives of the Board.

"It is understood that the administrative dean or other officer or officers designated by the President would require and occupy the office facilities now occupied by me.

"I further understand that at some time prior to my retirement, the Board will expect to pursue the matter of securing a suitable successor as President of the College.

"I am deeply grateful to you for the letter you wrote to the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia in my behalf. Your confidence in me has done much to reassure me and to keep up my morale.

"I am very glad to be relieved of many administrative details and other responsibilities at Mary Washington since the load I had been carrying for many years was too great for any one person to continue to carry. Many colleges half the size of Mary Washington have, in addition to a Dean of Instruction, a College Dean to take care of many of these matters, which we did not have.

"I want you to know that the administrative changes were made with my knowledge and consent, after they had been discussed at some length, and I hope in spite of unfortunate newspaper speculation, that they will work out to the satisfaction of all parties concerned.

"With warmest personal regards, I am,

I am directed by the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia to inform you that the following Resolution was adopted by the Board at the meeting held today:

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that Dr. Morgan L. Combs be and he is hereby removed from office as President of Mary Washington College of the University of Virginia, effective immediately.

RESOLVED further that provision be and is hereby made for continued payment of his salary from private funds of the University until June 11, 1956, at which time he will reach retirement age.

At the request of the Rector, I am sending this letter to you by special messenger, who has been instructed to hand it to you personally, so that the Board's decision will be known to you in advance of its release to the public.

I am enclosing, with the thought that you may care to have it in advance, a statement prepared by the Board that will be released to the press after this copy is delivered to you.
