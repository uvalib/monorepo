The President then informed the Board that it became his sad duty to convey to them, official intelligence of the recent death of one of their most valued and highly esteemed associates, Hon. Daniel Harmon, for sixteen years resident member of this body, whereupon, it was

**Resolved:** That a Committee of three, including the Rector and President, be appointed to draft suitable resolutions of respect on account of the death of our fellow member Daniel Harmon.

In pursuance to the above, the following committee was appointed, the Rector, the President, and Mr. Oliver.

**Resolved:** That a committee of three be appointed to confer with a committee of the Faculty of the University of Virginia to consider the character of a memorial in honor of the late Daniel Harmon.

**Resolved:** That the "Building Committee" be requested to recommend to the Board, a suitable site on the University grounds for the new "Educational Building," after consultation with the architect of the University.

The president having submitted a letter from the Trustees of the Phelps-Stokes Fund, transmitting their check for $6,250.00 in payment of the balance of their donation of $12,500.00 to establish a "Fellowship in Sociology," it was

**Resolved:** That the letter be entered of record, and the Bursar be instructed to deposit the check, with the "Virginia Trust Company," Richmond, to be invested by the Finance Committee, for the Fellowship, as indicated.

The letter follows,—;

In accordance with the authorization of the Trustees of the Phelps-Stokes Fund, referred to in my letter of January 31st, 1912, I beg to enclose herewith our check for $6,250.00, being payment of the balance of the Endowment Fund to create a Fellowship for the study of the negro, under the terms and conditions outlined in my letter of January 31st, 1912.

As this completes the payment to this endowment, kindly send me your acknowledgement of the same.

The Rector submitted the following letter from Mr. C. Lee Moore, Auditor of Public Accounts,—;

The Board of Visitors of your Institution should, in session, by resolution, designate such officers of the Institution as they may elect, to make demands, monthly, in the corporate name of the Institution upon the Auditor of Public Accounts for the payments of the several funds appropriated to your Institution. Copy of the resolution adopted by the Board in session, should be duly certified to this office, so that I may, on and after June 1st, 1912, draw warrants on the Treasury payable to the Institution in its corporate name, which warrants will be mailed direct from this office to such officer of the Institutions as the resolution may direct. The resolution can be so drawn as to have force and effect until changed by similar resolution adopted by that Board.

I adopt this method that the money may be paid direct to the Institution in accordance with the provisions of the Actmaking the appropriation.

And, in accordance therewith, it was unanimously,

**Resolved,**

That the Bursar be authorized to make demands, monthly, in the corporate name of the University of Virginia, upon the Auditor of Public Accounts for the payments of the several funds appropriated to this Institution, and to receive warrants therefor, and to receipt for same. This authority to remain in force and effect until changed by action of this Board.

**Resolved:** That the proposition embodied in the letter of Messrs. Johnson & Price, dated May 7, 1912, which is as follows:-

Believing that there is room and demand for a second drug store at the University of Virginia, we have decided to make the following offer,

1st—; That we erect a building on the East Side of the present University Post-Office building with such architectural features as will improve the general appearance of the University entrance, and in accordance with the demands of the Board of Visitors at a cost not to exceed $3,000. This new building to house the Post Office.

2nd—; That we pay to the University the sum of $300.00 per annum as a ground rent for the lot on which the proposed new Post Office is to be erected; and that we be given a lease on this property for a period of years and under similar terms as those granted to professors who build on University land.

3rd—; That we be given possession of the old Post Office room at the same rental as is charged the Post Office department, at present, and that this lease run for twenty-five (25) years.

4th—; That we be allowed to improve the appearance of the front of the building now occupied by the Post Office, and also be permitted to extend this building in the rear 25 feet more or less as shall be necessary for the drug business. All of this is to be done at our expense.

The following are some of the benefits which would come to the University of Virginia from the acceptance of this offer,

1st—; The University will have an increased income of $300.00 per year, without any additional investment.

2nd—; The architectural appearance of the University entrance will be greatly improved.
