A special meeting of the Board of Visitors was held on this date at 8 P. M., and concluded on the morning of the 20th, with the following members present:

Rector Gordon, Visitors Craddock, Hatton, Irvine, Michie, Norton and Turnbull, and President Alderman.

The Special Committee in the matter of R. L. Parrish bequest, submitted its report, which was accepted, approved, and ordered spread, as follows:

At a meeting of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia held October 19th, 1916, the following resolution was adopted:

"RESOLVED: That the matter of the legacy under the will of R. L. Parrish, deceased, be and is referred to the Attorney for the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, for investigation and his opinion as to the legal rights of the University under said will: and further as to the property of which the estate consists and its value. Said report to be made as soon as possible to the Rector and the Finance Committee, who are hereby empowered to take such action therein as they may deem expedient."

Shortly after this resolution was adopted, the attention of the Attorney for the Rector and Visitors was called thereto, and on or about the 6th of December, 1916, a written opinion upon this subject was submitted by him to the Rector and Finance Committee at a meeting held at the Gleason Hotel in Charlottesville.

A copy of this opinion is attached hereto, from which it will be seen that in view of the renunciation by Mr. Parrish's widow of the provisions made for her in his will, a grave doubt existed as to the possibility of the University receiving any benefit from this legacy until after the death or remarriage of said widow.

A statement was also submitted by Mr. Perkins from which it appeared that Mr. Parrish's personal estate was insufficient to pay all of the pecuniary legacies, after providing for the widow's distributive share therein, and that as the gift to the University was in all probability not chargeable upon the real estate of which Mr. Parrish died seized and possessed, it would seem that some compromise would have to be made with Dr. Philip Percy Parrish, the sole residuary legatee under said will, if the University hoped eventually to receive the full benefit of this gift.

Mr. Perkins was therefore instructed to take the matter up with the representatives of Mr. Parrish's Executors and with Dr. Philip Percy Parrish, and endeavor to obtain a settlement by which $50,000.00 could be turned over to the University at once, payment of a portion of the income therefrom being made to Dr. Philip Percy Parrish, during his lifetime.

After several conferences between Mr. Perkins and the Attorneys for the Executors and Dr. Philip Percy Parrish, he reported that he had been able to make such an arrangement. A contract was entered into by Dr. Philip Percy Parrish and the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, under date of January 31st, 1917, under the provisions of which $25,825.00 in cash and in valid securities were delivered to the Rector and Visitors by the said Philip Percy Parrish and the Executors of R. L. Parrish, dec'd. And the said Philip Percy Parrish delivered his bond for $24,175.00, secured by deed of trust on some twenty-five or thirty thousand dollars worth of real estate in Covington and Alleghany County, and by certain bonds and stock as collateral therefor, the security for said bond being ample, in Mr. Perkins's opinion. The total amount of Dr. Parrish's bond and of the money and securities previously delivered is $50,000.00, - the total amount of Mr. R. L. Parrish's bequest. The bond of said Philip Percy Parrish bears 6% interest, payable semi-annually.

So long as the said Philip Percy Parrish shall live we are to pay him the sum of $2250.00 per annum, payable on the first days of September and March of each year.

During the lifetime of Dr. Philip Percy Parrish this arrangement will net us only the difference between the amount to be paid him ($2250.00 a year) and the amount of income on the $50,000.00. This sum will, of course, be comparatively small, but upon Dr. Parrish's death all payments to him or to his estate will cease. In the mean time, we have possession of the total amount of the legacy, and by entering into this agreement we have without doubt avoided litigation with Dr. Parrish and with the Executors of Mr. R. L. Parrish. Such litigation would, of course, have been most unfortunate, and we feel that, considering the many doubtful questions which have arisen, the arrangement as a whole is a most advantageous one.

An original copy of the contract with Dr. Parrish is attached hereto. Said contract contains as a part thereof a copy of the will of Mr. Robert L. Parrish, so that with the opinion of the Attorney and this Report, the record of the actions of your Committee in this regard is complete.

A copy of said will is attached hereto.

I am advised that pursuant to provisions of Section 2559 of the Code of Virginia the widow has renounced the will and elected to claim her dower in one-third or the real estate (for life), and her distributive share in the personal property (one-half thereof absolutely).

By a codicil to his will the testator gives to the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia —; "The sum of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) to be paid after the marriage or death of the above mentioned Gray Morehead Parrish", the widow.

The questions arising upon the construction of said will in so far as the University of Virginia is concerned, are as follows: —;

1st. What effect has the widow's renunciation upon the legacy of $50,000.00?

(a) With respect to amount thereof,

(b) With regard to possession thereof,

2nd. Can the real estate be charged with the payment of any portion of said $50,000.00?

3rd. When should the books bequeathed by codicil No. 3 be delivered to the University?

4th. Referring to Section 5 of the will, can the devise and bequest therein contained be upheld?

In answering the first question above, we are at the outset confronted by a difficult situation by reason of the fact that the decisions of our Courts of last resort are not in harmony upon the subject; in fact, there are two distinct lines of authority, each of which is based upon sound and logical reasoning, the conclusion reached by following one being diametrically opposed to that resulting from the other.

I will refer to these decisions as briefly as possible, and then endeavor to reconcile their apparent irreconcilability.

Although the gift to the University is of personalty, for the sake of convenience I shall refer to it as a vested remainder.

The general rule seems to be that:

Upon the renunciation of his wife's will by a husband, all of its provisions for him become inoperative, but all other provisions of the will remain in force.

* Franklin v. Hastings (Ill.) 97 N. E. 265

* Fennell v. Fennell (Kan.) 106 Pac. 1038

There can be no question that this is sound law if the quantity of the estate is sufficient, and the provisions of the will are such that all of its directions may be strictly followed in spite of the renunciation. But what of the situation arising when by the widow's election a loss results to other legatees and devisees by reason of the abatement of their portions to make up the full amount to which the widow is entitled?

Shall the remainder to the University be accelerated by reason of the failure of the intermediate estate and take effect in possession to its full extent immediately, to the detriment of the residuary devisee, or should possession of said remainder be postponed, and the corpus thereof held intact, the income therefrom being applied, pending the death or marriage of the widow, toward reimbursing the residuary legatee for the amount of loss occasioned to him by the renunciation?

Out of the conflict of opinion upon this subject our difficulties arise.

Although the ulterior devise is, in terms, not to take effect in possession until the decease of the prior devisee, if tenant for life, yet in point of fact it is to be read as a limitation of the remainder to take effect in every event which removes the prior estate out of the way.

* Northern Trust Co. v. Wheaton, 94 N. E. 980.

Doubtless the amount of the residuum of the estate would be reduced by the election of the widow to take under the Statute and the payment to her of her distributive share of the personalty; but that is where the uncompensated loss ultimately should fall, unless it is otherwise indicated in the will.

* Dunlap v. McCloud (Ohio-1911) 96 N. E. 774.

Where testator gives son 80 acres of land and widow renounces will and receives 40 acres thereof, loss to the son will be made up out of residuum at the loss of residuary legatees.

* Pittman v. Pittman (Kan) 107 Pac. 235.

A testator bequeathed his personal property to his wife for life, and provided that at her death certain specific legacies should be paid, and the residue should go to certain relatives. The wife renounced the will and took one-half of the personal property absolutely, —; Held, that the specific legacies were thereupon payable in full at once, the wife's renunciation being equivalent to her death.

In re- Vance's Estate (Penn.) 21 Atl. -. 643, (1891).

The testator is presumed to know that the widow's rights under the law are paramount to her rights under his will, and therefore it is not accurate to say that his whole scheme of disposition of his property is destroyed by the widow's election. It is disarranged pro tanto, but in the absence of any reference to such contingency or provision for it in the will, there is ordinarily nothing on which to found a presumption that he would have made any specific difference in distribution, had he known she would exercise her right —; certainly not that he would have decreased any of the definite pecuniary legacies to swell the amount going at the end of the list to the residuaries. No Court is authorized to make distribution for the sake of equality. The testator's scheme must be carried out as he made it, except so far as that has been rendered impossible by the widow's action.

In re- Vance's estate, supra.

There is a line of authorities holding that upon renunciation by a widow of the benefits of a life estate intended for her by the will, such of said property as remains after her election may be sequestered by the Court and used as a trust fund during the life of the widow from which the residuary legatees are to be compensated for the losses sustained by them by reason of such election.

But this rule does not obtain in those estates in which the doctrine of acceleration of estates has become established.

(Insert)

In re- Vance's estate, supra.

In the case of Macknet v. Macknet, 24 N. J. Eq., p. 292, the Court in holding that estate in remainder, then under consideration should be accelerated in its vesting, cites the following:

"Lord Eldon said: \`If a term for ninety-nine years being created, the intention appeared clear on the will that those who were to take after that term should not take in any mode until after the expiration of that term, the Court must act upon that intention; but if upon the whole contents of the will and from the nature of the dispositions it appears that the testator intended to give estates of inheritance subject to the term, upon trusts to be satisfied, and if there are none, subject to such enjoyment as this Court will give when the trusts are satisfied, there is no rule that prevents this from saying this was the intention'."

(Insert)

In re- Vance's estate, supra.

The law must have a settled and uniform rule, and it is that as to provision in a will for legacies subordinate to a life interest in the widow, and contingent upon her death, or payment of which is postponed till then, her election to take against the will is equivalent to the widow taking her share as if the husband had died intestate, and the will then operates on the rest of the estate precisely as it the widow were dead. A court of equity will interpose, if necessity requires, to preserve the intention of the testator from destruction, but such interposition never should take place in favor of a subordinate, as against a preferred or superior interest; and therefore never in favor of a residuary as against a definite legatee, unless upon a plain implication in the will that the residuary legatee was in fact a preferred object of the testator's bounty.

The early cases in which it was held that an estate in reversion vests immediately upon the determination of the life estate upon which it is limited, by the death of the tenant for life, or by the surrender or forfeiture of his estate, or his disqualification to take it (1 Jarman on Wills, 513; Sheppard's Touchstone 435) have been followed in this country in cases such as the present.

It seems to be settled by the weight of authority that —; "Where the widow, who has been given a life interest under the will, renounces and elects to take her dower or the Statutory allowance instead, her renunciation works extinguishment of her life estate, and accelerates the rights of the second taker".

Citing Fox v. Rumery, 68 Me. 121;

Dean v. Hard, 62 Ala. 310

20 Am. & Eng. Ency. Law, pp. 895 & 897, and cases cited in Note 3.

The doctrine of acceleration proceeds upon the supposition that, though the ulterior devise is in terms not to take effect in possession until the decease of the prior devisee, if tenant for life, yet that in point of fact it is to be read as a limitation of a remainder to take effect in every event which removes the prior estate out of the way.

* 1 Jarman on Wills, 539

* Blatchford v. Newberry, 99 Ill. 11.

Whether the life estate is determined by a revocation, or by death, or by the renunciation of the widow, or by any other circumstance, which puts the life estate out of the way, the remainder takes effect, having only been postponed in order that the life estate might be given to the life tenant.

* Blatchford v. Newberry, supra.

Where it can be shown, however, that the intention of the testator is that the remainder shall not take effect until the expiration of the life of the prior donee, the remainder will not be accelerated.

There is a very respectable line of authorities holding that where that portion of the estate which the widow's renunciation leaves intact can be held together during her life and the rents and profits therefrom applied toward remuneration of the residuary legatees whom her election has injured, this should be done,

See Jones v. Knappen (Vermont) 22 Atl. 630.

For a very excellent note by Mr. Henry P. Farnham collecting the leading cases on this subject, see 14 L.R. A., pages 293-to-295.

The renunciation of the widow could not defeat the gift of the remainder, but the latter becomes immediately accelerated, charged however, with the equity in favor of disappointed devisees.

* Kirchner v. Kirchner, 127 N.Y. Supp. 299.

The general rule is, where a widow renounces provisions of a will and elects to take under the law, and where devisees and legatees are disappointed in realizing the provisions made for them, by the widow, that the benefits renounced by the widow are equitably applied as far as possible in compensating the losses so sustained by her election. . . . As between other persons, the will will be enforced as near in accordance with the intention of the testator as it can be enforced.

* Pittman v. Pittman (Kan.) 107 Pac. 235.

Cited as bearing on the subject but not directly in point:

* Turner v. Citizen's Bank, 111 Va. 184, not in point.

* Waggoner v. Waggoner, 111 Va. 325, not in point.

* Kinnaird v. Williams, 35 Va. 400, not directly in point. See on general subject, Coway v. Epes, 2 Pat. & H. 520

In the opinion of Judge Brokenbrough, and Judge Cabell, in Michells v. Johnson, 33 Va. 470 and 474, it would seem that our Court in that case inclined to the view that the property renounced by the widow should be applied toward the indemnification of the residuary legatees.

The latest case on the subject in Virginia, more or less directly in point, is that of McReynolds, v. Counts, 50 Va. 242, decided at Lewisburg at July Term, 1852. The facts were as follows: - M., by his will, devises his real estate to his wife for her life and at her death to his son, J.; and he gave his personal estate after payment of his debts equally among his eight children. His real estate consisted of a farm on which he lived. His widow renounced the provision made for her by the will; and dower not having been assigned to her, she lived for some years on the farm which she permitted her son, J., to cultivate and take the profits of, in consideration of his supporting her. Upon a bill filed by the other children to have dower assigned to the widow, and for a division and distribution of the estate, claiming an account of the rents from the widow and J., it was HELD:

1st, The widow was entitled to occupy and cultivate the farm without rent until dower was assigned to her; and she might allow another to do it for her.

2nd. The two-thirds of the land remaining after the assignment of the widow's dower should be applied to indemnify the legatees of the personal estate for the loss they sustained by the widow's renunciation of the provision made for her by the will, and claim of her third of the personal estate; and for this purpose the said two-thirds of the land should be rented out and the proceeds applied to the satisfaction of the legatees.

3rd. After the legatees had been satisfied for the loss of so much of their legacies as was taken by the widow, or after the death of the widow, whichever event shall first occur, the said two-thirds of the land is to be delivered to J., as devisee in remainder under the will.

The criterion by which to judge whether a case falls within one or the other of these two lines of decision seems to me to be as follows:

First. If, by the will a life estate is given the widow with remainder over to one or to a class of persons whose estates in such remainder are of the same dignity, then upon renunciation of the will by the widow these estates will be accelerated and take effect in possession immediately upon the renunciation just as they would have done under the provisions of the will upon the death of the widow. And if there is a loss to such remaindermen occasioned by the renunciation it will then be partially compensated for by reason of such earlier possession of the estate; at all events, nothing will be gained by postponing possession in said remaindermen.

Second. If by the will a life estate is given the widow with remainder over to one or several of the same class of persons, and with a residuary clause whereby still other persons are granted estates, then upon renunciation of the will by the widow and a resulting increase in the property received by her, the estates in remainder will not be allowed to take effect in possession as of the date of renunciation by acceleration, but will be held and the rents, issues and profits applied toward the building up of the residuum until such residuum is compensated for the depletion suffered by it upon the renunciation. The rationale of this rule rests upon the theory that to accelerate the remainders would result in defeating the intention of the testator as to the amount which the residuary legatees should take. If the payment of definite legacies (taking effect in possession of remainders) is deferred until the widow's death, the legatees or remaindermen will get precisely the same time intended by the testator, and so they cannot complain.

Third. It would seem, therefore, that the question as to whether or not the residuary legatees have an equity which will require the life estate to be sequestered for their benefit as against specific legatees, depends upon the facts of the particular case.

In answer, therefore, to section (a) of Question 1 above, I should say that in this case the amount of the $50,000 legacy should not be reduced pro tanto to make up the widow's share, but the whole amount should be paid to the Rector and Visitors.

Answering section (b) of said Question 1, my opinion is that said $50,000 should be held by the Executors pending the death or marriage of the widow, and the income therefrom paid to Dr. Parrish until the amount so paid him shall be equal to the amount of loss occasioned him as residuary legatee by reason of the widow's renunciation; and when full restitution is made the whole amount should be paid to the University. If the widow should die or remarry before full compensation is made to Dr. Parrish, he will have to stand the loss, for upon the happening of either of these events said remainder will take effect in possession and come into the same class with the legacy to Conny Brown and the bequest to the Trustees of Emanuel Church, both of which are hereafter referred to.

I think not, although possibly real estate blended in the residuum may be so charged.

The real estate of the testator is not chargeable with the payment of legacies unless the testator has so charged it either expressly or by clear and manifest implication.

As a general rule the personal estate is not only the primary, but the only fund for the payment of legacies.

* Armentrout v. Armentrout, 111 Va. 348.

Without going into any lengthy discussion of the principles governing this question, my opinion is that these books should be turned over to the University upon the death of Dr. Philip Percy Parrish, without regard whether this event occurs before or after the death or marriage of the widow.

* Northern Trust Co. v. Wheaton (Ill.) 94 N. E. 980.

It is the settled law of this State that a church cannot take as a legatee under a will.

Dictum in Perkins v. Siegfried, 97 Va. 446.

See Gallego's Ex'rs. v. Attorney General, 30 Va. (3rd Leigh) 450, which is the leading case on this subject.

Also Fifield v. Van Wyck, 94 Va. 557, affirming Gallego v. Attorney General.

See also Seaburn's Ex'or. v. Seaburn, 56 Va. (XV Gratt.) 423, in which a full discussion is given of the construction of Code Ch. 77. Sec. 8, p. 363.

Sec. 1398 Code 1904—;Amended Acts 1916 p/ 136.

But the amendment of Sec. 1398 of the Code above referred to seems to change the established doctrine so far as churches are concerned, and it would seem that now a "Gift", grant or bequest" may be made to a religious congregation or to Trustees appointed for such congregation, within the limits of Sec. 1403.

Quaere? Whether the words "Gift, grant or bequest" include "devise" —; see opinion in Seaburn v. Seaburn, 56 Va. 423.

See also editorial by Lile in 8 V. L. R. 280, citing editorial in 3 V. L. R. 537.

The latest case at all in point is Jordan v. Richmond Home, 106 Va. 710, chiefly valuable on account of a reference to an historical narrative on the subject of constitutional and legislative enactments with reference to "Religion", "Churches", "Charities" and "Schools", prepared by Mr. Jackson Guy and submitted to the Court below with his report as commissioner.

Sec. 1403 of the Code is as follows:

Sec. 1403. Quantity of real and personal estate they may hold.

Such trustees shall not take or hold at any time more than two acres of land in a city or town, nor more than seventy-five acres out of a city or town; and they shall not take or hold at any one time money, securities, or other personal estate exceeding in the aggregate, exclusive of the books and furniture aforesaid, the sum of thirty thousand dollars.

After a careful analysis of the foregoing authorities, I am of the opinion that the Church cannot take the lot devised to it under the will, but under the provisions of Sec. 1398 as amended, the trustees can take the $10,000.00 "Bequest", provided such taking by them will not be in contravention of the provisions of Sec. 1403 above set out.

The rule laid down by our Court of Appeals in St. Stephens Church v. Morris, 115 Va. 225, has no application here, as the testator merely expresses a wish that a memorial be erected to his parents, and does not specifically direct it to be done.

Having renounced the will, the widow should first have her dower in the real estate allotted to her. She should also be given one-half of the personal property absolutely.

Out of the balance of the personalty, $1000.00 should be at once paid to Conny Brown.

And $10,000.00 should be paid to the Trustees of Emanuel Church of Covington, if said Trustees are entitled to hold the same under the provisions of Sec. 1403 of the Code.

$50,000.00 of securities should then be set apart and held by the Executors in accordance with the views hereinbefore expressed.

Such of the books in testator's library as are not assigned to the widow, should be turned over to Dr. Parrish, to be held by him during his life, and upon his death one thousand volumes shall go to the University, and one thousand to the State Library, if so many may remain; otherwise the number to each shall be reduced equally.

I, Robert Lewis Parrish, son of Robert Lewis and Margaret Care Parrish, of Covington, Virginia, being of sound mind and in good health, hereby revoking all other wills at any time heretofore made by me, do make, publish and declare this my last will and testament in manner and form as follows, to-wit:

I give, devise and bequeath to my wife, Gray Morehead Parrish, the real estate and buildings and improvements on which I now reside on the northeast side of Maple Avenue in the town of Covington, Virginia, along with all personal property therein or thereon at the time of my death, for and during the time of her natural life with remainder after her death to my brother Philip Percy Parrish, or until she the said Gray Morehead Parrish shall again marry, in which event the same shall become the property of said Philip Percy Parrish, absolutely.

I give, devise and bequeath to the said Gray Morehead Parrish absolutely, the sum of twenty five thousand dollars cash ($25,000.00).

Out of my private library contained in said residence I hereby request the said Gray Morehead and Philip Percy Parrish to give to the University of Virginia Library (to the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia) one thousand volumes and to the Virginia State Library, one thousand volumes, said volumes to be selected by said Libraries with the consent of the said Gray Morehead Parrish.

I give, devise and bequeath to the Trustees of Emmanuel Episcopal Church at Covington the lot fronting on Maple Avenue in Covington between the Church lot and the lot sold by me to Mrs. Sadie R. Rogers. Also the sum of ten thousand dollars. I hope said Trustees will erect a handsome church and place therein suitable memorials to my late mother and father.

I give, devise and bequeath to the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia the sum of fifty thousand dollars, ($50,000.00).

All the rest and residue of my estate, real and personal and mixed I wish to be divided between the said Gray Morehead Parrish and Philip Percy Parrish, one-third to the said Philip Percy and two-thirds of the said Gray Morehead, Gray Morehead Parrish taking her share for and during the term of her natural life with remainder after her death to the said Philip Percy Parrish or till her marriage again, in which event her share last named shall be and become the property of the said Philip Percy Parrish absolutely.

I hereby nominate and appoint my wife Gray Morehead Parrish, my brother Philip Percy Parrish, my brother-in-law, John Motley Morehead of Chicago and my friend, W. W. Taylor of Lynchburg, Virginia, Executors of this my last will and testament and I hereby request the court or courts in which the same is admitted to probate to allow them to qualify as such without giving any security whatever.

The whole of this will including the signature thereto is written with my own hand.

Given under my hand and seal this 8th day of May, 1912.

Said will was admitted to probate in the Clerk's Office of Allegany County, Virginia, on or about the 15th day of August, 1915, and was duly recorded in said office.

Shortly thereafter the widow of said Robert L. Parrish, Mrs. Gray Morehead Parrish, acting in accordance with provisions of Section 2559 of the Code of Virginia, renounced said will and elected to claim her dower in one-third of the real estate of which her husband died seized and possessed, and her distributive share in his personal property one-half thereof absolutely.

On the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ day of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, 1915, the said Gray Morehead Parrish, Philip Percy Parrish, John Motley Morehead and W. W. Taylor, qualified in said Clerk's Office of the Circuit Court of Alleghany County as Executors of the said Robert L. Parrish, entering into bond without security in the sum of $500,000.00. Subsequently the amount of said bond was reduced to $300,000.00, and on motion of certain parties in interest, security was furnished thereon and approved by said Court.

From the date of their said qualification until the 11th day of December, 1916, said Executors held said estate practically intact. During the early part of the year 1916, adjustment was made by them of the liabilities referred to in the second Codicil of said will, and all debts having been settled in full, said Executors proceeded on said 11th day of December, 1916, with the distribution of the personal estate then in their hands, and at that time turned over to the said Gray Morehead Parrish, the widow, one-half of all intangible personal property so held by them. At the same time settlement in full was made with Connie Brown, and the bequest to the Trustees of Emmanuel Episcopal Church was satisfied to said Trustees in full.

Furthermore, said Executors delivered practically all of the residue of the intangible property remaining in their hands after making said payments, to the Covington National Bank, with instructions to said Bank to deliver same or any part thereof to such person or persons as might be designated in a written order signed by J. M. Perry, Attorney for said Philip Percy Parrish, and also signed by W. Allan Perkins, Attorney for the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia; and upon such delivery, proper receipt to said Executors to be taken by said Bank.

Under the terms of said will the said Philip Percy Parrish and said The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia each have an interest in the property so held by said Bank.

And in order that all questions with reference to the respective amounts due each of these parties, the date at which each of them is entitled to possession thereof, and any and all questions which have arisen or may arise by virtue of the renunciation of said will by said widow as aforesaid, may be forever set at rest, the said Philip Percy Parrish, party of the first part, and said The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, hereinafter called the "University", of the second part, do hereby agree and bind themselves to abide strictly by the provisions hereinafter set out, which are as follows:

The sum of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00), made up of cash and of securities bearing not less than six per cent (6%) interest, shall be delivered to said University immediately upon the execution of this contract. And after the receipt of said amount by it said University will pay to the said Philip Percy Parrish the sum of twenty-two hundred and fifty dollars ($2250.00) per annum during the whole of his natural life, said amount to be paid in semi-annual installments of eleven hundred and twenty-five ($1125.00) dollars each, the first of these payments to be made six months after the date of the receipt of said fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) by said University, if said Parrish be then living, and the subsequent payments to be made at intervals of six months thereafter until the death of said Philip Percy Parrish; said annuity to cease and determine upon payment of the last installment immediately preceding the death of said Philip Percy Parrish, unless such death shall occur at least three months after any appointed day of payment on account of said annuity, in which event the current installment of said annuity shall be pro rated as of the date of such death.

Immediately upon the execution of this contract by said parties of the first and second parts, said J. M. Perry and W. Allan Perkins, Attorneys as aforesaid, shall deliver to said Covington National Bank an order in writing signed by them on behalf of their respective principals, directing said bank to deliver to said Perry and Perkins, Attorneys as aforesaid, the following securities:

Seventy-four (74) shares of the capital stock of the Covington National Bank of Covington, Virginia.

Twenty-five (25) shares of the capital stock of the Peoples' National Bank of Lynchburg, Virginia.

Twenty-seven (27) shares of the capital stock of the Covington Grocery Company, of Covington, Virginia.

As soon as the sale of said bank stock is made and the amount derived therefrom definitely ascertained, said Philip Percy Parrish shall execute and deliver to said attorneys his bond in an amount equal to the difference between the net sum received by them for said bank stock and fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00). Said bond shall bear date as of its delivery and be payable to said Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, at the Peoples National Bank of Charlottesville, Virginia, on or before the date of death of the said Philip Percy Parrish, with the right of the obligor of anticipating payment in whole or in part, shall bear interest at the rate of six per cent (6%) per annum, said interest to be paid semi-annually, contain a waiver of the homestead exemption and be secured by a deed of trust constituting a first lien upon all of the real estate owned by said Philip Percy Parrish and situated in the town of Covington and County of Alleghany, Virginia, said deed to be drawn in such form as to be acceptable to said University.

Immediately upon the execution of said bond and deed of trust and delivery of the same to said Perry and Perkins, Attorneys as aforesaid, said Attorneys shall deliver to said University the total amount derived by them from sale of the bank stock as aforesaid, together with said bond and deed of trust securing same, and as additional and collateral security for the payment of said bond they shall also deliver to said University the bonds and stock of the Oriskany Ore & Iron Company, the twenty-seven (27) shares of Covington Grocery Company stock, and the two Masonic bonds as enumerated above, all of which shall be properly assigned in blank and endorsed by said Philip Percy Parrish.

If sale of said stock is not made by said Parrish within six months, as above, then said University shall be at liberty to sell and deliver, said stock, crediting the proceeds therefrom upon said Parrish's bond as aforesaid.

The Oriskany bonds and the Masonic bonds above referred to may be sold at any time by said University or collected by it at maturity, and amounts so derived are also to be credited upon said Parrish's bond as aforesaid. Oriskany stock shall also be sold by said University and the proceeds likewise applied as a credit upon said bond. And in case of a sale, or sale, of said bonds, or any of them, or of said stock, full authority is hereby vested in said University to consummate the same at such price as it may see fit, and make delivery of said bonds and stock to the purchaser.

All of the property delivered to said University in accordance with the foregoing terms, except the securities turned over to be held by it as collateral for said Parrish's bond, shall immediately upon such delivery become the absolute property of said University and be held by it in fee simple.

Correspondence of President Alderman with the Secretary of War with reference to detailing an officer to serve as Instructor in Military Science and Tactics at the University:

In accordance with a resolution of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, I am hereby making application for the establishment, at this University, of one or more units of the Reserve Officers' Training Corps, Senior Division, in accordance with the provision of an Act of Congress entitled an "Act for making further and more effectual provision for the national defense and for other purposes".

I enclose herewith an application blank duly filled out, provided on p. 37 of General Order 49. If it is not possible for the Department to act under the terms of the new Army Bill, I heartily beg that, under the old law, an officer be detailed here as quickly as possible to take charge of the situation, with a view to organizing the University for the most useful military service. There are reasons why it might be best to have an old alumnus of this University, now in military service, detailed here. Our desire, however, is for the most efficient man of West Point training.

Hoping you can give this matter prompt attention, I am,

### Special orders, No. 75.

Extract.

24. By direction of the President, Lieut. Col. James A. Cole, United States Army, retired, is detailed under the provisions of the act of Congress, approved June 3, 1916, as professor of military science and tactics at the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Va., and will report in person to the president of the university for duty accordingly.

(2561121, A. G. O.)

By order of the Secretary of War:

Recommendations of the Committee on Rules and Courses for the College regarding academic credit for the proposed course in military training.

1. That credit for military training, not to exceed a total of 6-hours per session be allowed on each baccalaureate degree in the College.

2. That the credit be estimated on the same basis as credit for work in any natural science subject,—;that is the lecture work shall be credited on the hour for hour basis; and the drill, etc., on the basis of 1-hour of credit for 2-hours of drill.

3. That for the rest of this session the course in Military Training may be substituted for the third term of any 3-hour course for College credit,—;provided that the substitution is approved by the Adviser of the Student concerned.

4. As an interpretation of the above, it was decided that the student, not dropping any course now in order to take Military Training, may substitute the Military Training for the third term of any 3-hour course on which he happens to fail at the end of this session.

5. That the Dean of the College, with any professor or professors, he may desire to have act with him, is authorized and requested to settle any irregular and exceptional cases which may come up this session regarding credit for Military Training.

6. That the question of granting College credit for work to be done next summer at Plattsburg be postponed for two weeks.

With regard to credit on C. courses for Military Training, for the rest of this session, the following was adopted:

7. That for the rest of this session the course in Military Training may be substituted for the third term of any C course, except a C course in one of the natural sciences.

8. That no credit shall be given towards the degree of Doctor of Philosophy for the work in Military Training.

Your special Committee consisting of the Rector, Mr. Michie and the President, appointed at the March 23rd meeting of the Board to consider and pass upon certain items on the docket for said meeting which were not considered, owing to lack of time, met on this date to consider such items, and beg to report to you thereon, as follows:

The attached communication from Mr. Walter D. Blair, advising that he wished to contribute to the University his fee for designing the gateway on the Fry's Spring Road, was received and the President was requested to extend to him the thanks of the Board for his very generous contribution.

In the matter of entering into a formal agreement with the C. & O. Railway Company for the up-keep of the sidetrack and trestle located on the University's property, the Committee is of the opinion that we should not enter into such an agreement, but express the willingness of the Board to bear one-half of the necessary cost of such repairs, with the request that the Superintendent of Grounds & Buildings be notified of any proposed repairs together with the estimated cost of same, if possible to make such estimate in advance.

A letter to the President from the Bursar, setting forth the facts as to insurance carried on the University property, was read; and your committee being advised that at the last meeting of the State Legislature a committee was appointed to look into the matter of having the State take over the insurance on all property begs to report the following resolution to be adopted and forwarded to the State Insurance Commissioner, Hon. Joseph Button:

RESOLVED, That in the opinion of the Board it would be an economical and much more satisfactory method of insuring the property belonging to the State of Virginia than that now existing, for the State, by legislative enactment, to become its own insurer. This is a method which the Board is informed has been adopted by other states with approved results; and the Board recommends it to the favorable consideration of the General Assembly.

Applications of the General Alumni Association, the Beta Chapter of the Zeta Psi, and the Sigma Nu Fraternities for sites on which to erect a residence for the Alumni Secretary and chapter houses for the fraternities, respectively, were referred to a committee consisting of President Alderman, G. R. B. Michie and Dr. Lambeth.

Application of Lindsay Rogers for the Monroe Hill Office, now occupied by C. H. H. Thomas, together with the adjacent rooms, now occupied by Dr. L. S. Pratt, was granted, with the understanding that he pay the usual rental.

We recommend that a committee be appointed from the Board to serve with similar committees from the Faculty and General Alumni Association to make arrangements for the Centennial Celebration of the University.

The changes suggested by the Faculty for the entrance requirements and also for academic degrees, as follows, were approved.

1. Changing entrance requirements from 14 to 15 units.

2. Certain changes in requirements for academic degrees.

(a) Preliminary requirements of C courses to be counted on an academic degree.

(b) Degree credit for courses in Physical Training: involving 63 hours for the degrees.

(c) An ancient language to be counted toward a cultural B. S. degree.
