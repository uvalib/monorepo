Resolved, that said resolution of March 13th 1896 be so amended as to make Messrs McDonald, Bros & Spooner's compensation $1500.00 instead of $1387.88; and that the other provisions of said resolution stand as passed at said meeting.

The committee on the "Otts Lectureship" submitted its report which is as follows:

The Committee appointed to arrange the details necessary for the establishment of the Otts Lectureship on the Evidences of Christianity begs to report that it would be in their judgment contrary to the policy and tradition of the University of Virginia, and liable to produce future complications in the administration of the school, to accept the tender of Rev. J. M. P. Otts in the form, in which it has been brought before them. They recommend therefore in lieu of such acceptance the adoption of the following resolutions:-

Resolved,

1. That the Visitors have learned with unfeigned gratification and interest the generous purpose of Rev. J. M. P. Otts toward the University of Virginia, and desire hereby to express their sympathy with the objects of the proposed Lectureship on the Evidences of Christianity.

2. That those members of the Faculty of the University, who desire to promote the plan fostered by Dr Otts, be and are hereby authorized to arrange for the custody of the endowment fund of the Otts Lectureship, on any other similar foundation, to invite suitable persons to lecture at this University under conditions of time and place approved by the Faculty, to provide from the income of the fund for the payment of the lectures and the publication of the lectures, and to do such other acts as are necessary for the successful execution of the plan.

3. That a copy of these resolutions be forwarded by the Secretary of this Board to Dr Otts, with a suitable expression of the thanks of the Board for his liberal gift.

On motion the said report, together with its recommendations, was adopted by a unanimous vote.

Minor be retained in his chair by reelection at the expiration of his present term, which was read and on motion it was referred to the Special Committee on reorganization, consisting of Messrs McCormick, Harmon & Watts for consideration and report to the Board.

The Rector and Visitors of the University having received the resignation of Profr Wm M. Thornton as Chairman of the Faculty of the University in accepting the said resignation desire to put on record their appreciation of the services which Mr Thornton has rendered this institution.

For Eight-Years Mr Thornton has performed the duties of Chairman in addition to those of a full professor in which he has exhibited great ability and untiring zeal in promoting its interests.
