The Board met pursuant to adjournment on yesterday. Present. The Rector and all of the Visitors, including Mr Stuart, who was absent on yesterday.

A communication was received from Dr Jas L. Cabell stating that he was too unwell to visit the Board as he was invited to do on yesterday.

Profr J. L. Cabell having informed the Board that the infirm condition of his health made it necessary in his judgment that he should resign his Professorship, and the Board having conferred with him on the subject, it was finally agreed by him in response to the earnest solicitation of the Board that he would not tender his resignation but would consent to accept an indefinite leave of absence from the duties of his chair, upon the basis that the Board should appoint an Adjunct Professor in the School who should perform all the duties and receive all the emoluments of the School.

On motion it was ordered that an indefinite leave of absence be granted to Profr J. L. Cabell from the duties of his school.

On motion it was ordered that the salary of the Adjunct Professor in the School of Physiology and Surgery be fixed at Three Thousand dollars, and that he shall perform all the work and duties of that school.

On motion the Board resolved to proceed with the election of the Adjunct Professor of Physiology and Surgery.

The following named gentlemen were applicants for this chair and their testimonials were before the Board.

After the reading to the Board of the testimonials of all of these gentlemen on motion all four of them were placed in nomination for the position and a viva voce vote taken which resulted in the unanimous choice of Dr Paul B. Barringer.

On motion the Secretary was instructed to inform Dr Barringer of his election.

Resolved that such part of the Faculty report in regard to radical changes in the organization of the Medical Department be laid on the table and the Faculty be informed that the Board is not disposed to make any radical changes but that they are disposed when the subject has been fully discussed to pay especial attention to this department with the view of enlarging its facilities for didactic, and clinical instruction; but the latter only as an adjunct and subordinate to its theoretical teaching.

The Miller Board reported through its secretary that the following resolution (of which a copy was furnished) as the action of that Board

"Resolved that the sum of six hundred dollars is hereby appropriated to employ an Assistant to the Profr Biology & Agriculture for the Session beginning Oct 1st 1889, said Assistant to be nominated by this Board & elected by the Board of Visitors."

On motion the foregoing resolution was concurred in and the Secretary instructed to notify the Miller Board of the fact.

The Infirmary Committee submitted its report which reads as follows

The undersigned the Com. on Infirmary etc. to whom was referred the application of C. C. Kidd to refund to him a portion of the deposit made by him as a student for the present session, beg leave to report that after due consideration of the subject & in accordance with the recommendation of the Faculty they suggest the adoption of the following resolution.

Resolved that the Proctor be directed to refund to Mr. C. C. Kidd the one half of the amount he deposited at the commencement of this session.

Mr Marye was urged to reconsider and withdraw his resignation which he declined to do for the reasons stated in his letter.

On motion Mr Marye's resignation was accepted to take effect at the close of the present meeting of the Board.

Dr W. C. N. Randolph who was temporarily absent from the meeting was placed in nomination to fill the vacancy in the office of Rector in place of Mr Marye resigned and upon a vote thereon was unanimously elected.

Resolved that, the recommendation of the Faculty that a diploma be granted on the completion of the Course in Biology & Comparative Anatomy & Zoology be adopted.

The Board of Visitors being of the opinion that the discipline of the University & comfort & convenience of the students can be better conserved by having the dormitories on the Lawn be occupied by students rather than by the Professors, and that the officies of the Professors be removed to the East Range the sense of the Faculty on this subject is respectfully requested for the consideration of the Board.

On motion the Board adjourned to meet tomorrow at 10 A. M.

The Board of Visitors in view of the large increase in the number of the Law School & the consequent burden added to your already onerous duties, feel that it is due to your long & illustrious service in the University that you should have some relief from the arduous and exacting labors of your school, & accordingly propose to appropriate the sum of fifteen hundred dollars with which to secure for you such assistance as in your judgment you may deem necessary.

The nomination of such Assistant as well as the duties to be assigned him are left entirely to your discretion. A capable man trained by yourself might relieve you from time to time of much of the drudgery of detail & leave you free to perform other important teaching, and complete the great literary work upon which you are engaged, the volumes of which, so far as they have appeared, are every where recognized as a standard authority, & have reflected the highest honor on our University. The Board has felt that, in your single minded devotion to the University you have refrained out of the most delicate & lofty motives from suggesting that assistance, to which you are so eminantly entitled.

The Board therefore duly appreciating the high motives, which have to their mind restrained you from asking such assistance, now beg, with their assurances of grateful recognition of your distinguished services, to tender voluntarily the relief from drudgery you have so amply deserved. With true & faithful regard, we have the honor to be

My Dear Sirs, I have this moment read your communication of this date, and acknowledge with unfeigned thankfulness, the kind considerations manifested by the resolution of the Board to which you refer, and the very flattering terms in which you have been pleased to communicate it.

The proposition, though in some aspects acceptable to me, takes me so much by surprise, that if consistent with the views of the Board, I would fain ask that I may be allowed time to consider it, if need be for a year.

I am not conscious of any decline of my general capacities for usefulness, and perceive that some difficulties may intervene in the assignment of a part of my work to an assistant, and would be glad to have time to consider the whole matter, and if need be, to make deliberate and well-considered arrangements for the most beneficial operation of the system, should it be deemed best to adopt it.
