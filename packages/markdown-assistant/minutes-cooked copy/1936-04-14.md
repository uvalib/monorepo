The following preamble and resolution in connection with the extension of time and waiver of liquidated damages on certain contracts for the erection of P.W.A. Project No. 4881, Private Patients Pavilion of the University of Virginia Hospital, were presented and, on motion, unanimously adopted.

WHEREAS The Federal Emergency Administration of Public Works require that all extensions of time and waiver of liquidated damages in connection with all contracts on P.W.A. Project No. 4881 (Private Patients Pavilion) be authorized by this body.

AND WHEREAS the original set-up upon which the Loan and Grant Agreement was based did not contemplate that the Project would be revenue producing by February 8, 1936.

AND WHEREAS the building will be greatly benefited by not allowing the contractor to install such work as linoleum and rubber tile floors while the building is still damp.

AND WHEREAS the extension of time involving the laying of linoleum and rubber tile floors will, from the nature of building operation, delay the completion of other contracts on the project.

AND WHEREAS The Poe Piping & Heating Company, contractors for Contract "C" had the heating system in operation prior to January 25, 1936.

AND WHEREAS the radiation installed in the building and being used to heat the building prior to January 25, 1936, proved defective.

AND WHEREAS the aforesaid radiation had to be removed and new radiation installed throughout the building.

AND WHEREAS at the time the new radiation was delivered to the building, the weather was so cold that it would have been detrimental to cut off the heat from the building to make the change.

AND WHEREAS when the weather was suitable to make the change, the contractor for Contract "C" did not have time to complete his work by January 25, 1936.

AND WHEREAS Contract "C" was complete as of February 8, 1936.

AND WHEREAS the job at no time suffered from lack of heat.

AND WHEREAS the delivery of the furniture and equipment is not under the control of these contractors.

AND WHEREAS the said furniture and equipment was not delivered by February 8, 1936 and therefore the building could not have been revenue producing by February 8, 1936.

AND WHEREAS the building will not be revenue producing until the furniture and equipment is delivered and installed.

AND WHEREAS it would be difficult to prove liquidated damages on a project which is not in a condition to be revenue producing.

AND WHEREAS the University of Virginia was not put to additional expense in connection with the said extension of time for field supervision, insurance, interest during construction, etc. due to the fact that these expenses will continue until the project is complete with all furniture and equipment and becomes revenue producing.

AND WHEREAS additional data in connection with the extension of time and waiver of liquidated damages, as required by the Federal Emergency Administration of Public Works, is attached herewith.

BE IT RESOLVED that the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia approve the extension of time and waiver of liquidated damages from January 1, 1936 to January 25, 1935 on Contracts "A", "B", "C" and "D" and the further extension of time and waiver of liquidated damages from January 25, 1936 to February 8, 1936 on Contract "C".

The Contracts involved being as follows:

1. Contract "A" - (Building Only) with the CHARLOTTESVILLE LUMBER COMPANY, INC.
2. Contract "B" - (Plumbing) with the WILLIAMS COMPANY.
3. Contract "C" - (Heating & Ventilating) with the POE PIPING AND HEATING COMPANY.

Mr. Newcomb stated to the Board that the City of Charlottesville now desires to widen the Fry's Spring or Lynchburg Road which runs along the southern boundary of the grounds of the University from the point where said road passes under the C. & O. Railway just west of Main Street, out to the point where the road leaves the University grounds toward Fry's Spring at the southern end of Dawson's Row.

He presented to the meeting a sketch of the proposed widening of this road, from which it appears that the plan which the City wishes to carry out will necessitate throwing into the road a strip of land owned by the University along the northern edge of the present road, varying in width from five or six to fifteen feet throughout the entire distance of the proposed improvement. The City will bear the whole expense of the improvement, and proposes to place a six-inch concrete curb along the north side of the widened road, and also to slope back the bank on the University property from this curb making the slope of the bank not in excess of 30°. After a discussion of the matter, it was

RESOLVED: That the Board of Visitors consents to the widening of the Fry's Spring road in accordance with the plan proposed by the City, as shown upon the plat presented to this meeting, upon condition that the City will place a six-inch curb of concrete along the entire length of the road from the C. & O. Railway out to the point where the road leaves the University grounds at the southern end of Dawson's Row, and that the City will do all necessary grading on the University property, making the slope of any and all banks upon the University side of the road not to exceed 30°; and furthermore, that this consent is given upon the express condition that the work in question shall be supervised by the Superintendent of Grounds and Buildings of the University. The plat presented to this meeting, showing the proposed change, shall be filed with the minutes of this meeting.

The meeting then adjourned.
