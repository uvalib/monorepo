The Board adjourned to meet tomorrow at 9 A. M.

June 25th 1872

The Board met pursuant to adjournment on yesterday.

Present- All the members of the Board.

The following communications were presented and laid before the Board: Report of the Librarian and report of Prof. Mallet of the Donations to the Laboratory and Farm.

The Finance Committee submitted their Report.

A communication was received from Prof. Harrison, which on motion was referred to the Committee on Apparatus.

Resolved That the Committee on Finance inquire whether any curtailment of expense can be judiciously effected in the employment of a Carpenter and Janitor.

The Committee on Grounds and Buildings submitted their Report, on consideration whereof.

Resolved that the Report be adopted, except in so far as it relates to the assignment of Pavilions to the Professors-reserving that part of the same for future consideration.

A communication was received from a Committee of Students of the University in reference to the Election of Chairman of the Faculty- requesting the reelection of Prof. Venable as Chairman.

Resolved, that in accordance with the recommendation of the Committee on Grounds & Buildings, the vacant Pavilion and lot formerly occupied by Dr. Maupin be assigned to Dr. J. L. Davis, and that the Pavilion now occupied by Dr. Davis be placed at the disposal of Prof. Venable and that Prof. Boeck be assigned the Pavilion now occupied by Prof. Venable in the event that the latter shall take that of Dr. Davis, but in case Prof. Venable prefers retaining his present residence then the Pavilion of Dr. Davis assigned to Prof. Boeck.

The Library Committee submitted their Report which upon being read and considered was adopted.

Resolved, that the Faculty, individually and collectively are invited to make such suggestions to the Board of Visitors as they may deem proper.

Your Committee on Grounds & Buildings beg leave to report that they have made such an inspection as seemed to them necessary to the discharge of the duties, and regret to say that they have found much delapidation in the buildings and great disfigurement in the grounds. The buildings are out of repair in various particulars, but more especially in the roofing of the terrace, and the "Dawson Row". The grounds are checkered with paths that are unsightly & entirely unnecessary. Your Committee are aware that the repairs desirable would require an expenditure beyond the revenue of the Institution at present but they recommend that provision be made for putting in order the roofs referred to, as the damage already serious is becoming worse every day and further delay in the matter will involve heavier cost. They are also apprised of the difficulty of preventing the short cuts across the ground but they nevertheless are of the opinion that the evil can be corrected by active attention and they therefore recommend that the Proctor be required to put in operation every expedient practicable to this end.

Greater industry should be exhibited in breaking them up than there is in making them.

The Committee on Finance having already recommended the adoption of the Proctor's Estimate for repairs, and having approved the suggestion of the Faculty; Report as to the labor essential to the order and preservation of the buildings & grounds, the Committee deem it unnecessary to take in consideration these questions, and are not in possession of any facts that render it advisable for them to supplement the action of the Finance Committee.

The attention of the Committee has been directed to some shanties just over road from "the Infirmary" and adjacent to a settlement known as "Canada", and as they are not necessary and are conspicuously detractive from the completeness of the lawn to which they are attached it is deemed best that they should be removed and it is therefore proposed that the Proctor be required to take them away and as soon as possible put the ground in grass.

Your Committee have inquired into the claims of the applicants for the Pavilion formerly occupied by Dr. Maupin and after careful consideration have become convinced that the large family of Dr. Davis requires increased accommodations, and therefore recommend his application to the favor of the Board. We further advise that the present residence of Dr. Davis be put at the refusal of Prof. Venable and that Prof. Boeck be assigned the house now occupied by Prof. Venable in the event that the latter shall take that of Dr. Davis. If Prof. Venable should prefer to remain where he is we recommend that Prof. Boeck be allowed the house now in occupancy of Dr. Davis.

The Committee on the Library respectfully report that upon inspection they found the Library in good condition there are many suggestions that might be made with a view to its improvements- such as the procurement of glass doors for many of the cases for the protection of the books, and others, but the financial embarrassment of the University is such as to render the requisite appropriations therefore inexpedient at this time.

The Committee would recommend that the Librarian be required to indicate by label on each book donated to the University the name of the donor thereof.

The Committee would further recommend that the Board acknowledge by appropriate resolutions of thanks the reception of the donations made to the Library during the past years, as reported by the Librarian.

The Committee would also suggest that the investments made for the benefit of the Library as well as the Exchange of books made as set forth, in the report of the Librarian to this meeting of the Board be approved.

Resolved, that the Secretary of the Board be requested to express the thanks of this body in writing to the parties respectively who have made donations to the Library as well as the Laboratory & Farm, as reported by Prof. Mallet.

The Board adjourned to meet tomorrow at 9 A.M.

**Jas. D. Jones Secretary**

**R. G. H. Kean Rector**

The Board met pursuant to adjournment on yesterday.

Present the same members as on yesterday.

The Annual Report of Mason Gordon, Esq. as Commr of Accounts was laid before the Board.

The Committee on Apparatus submitted their Report which on being read and considered was on motion adopted.

**Report of the Committee**

The Committee on Apparatus beg leave to report that they proceeded in discharge of the duties imposed upon them to inspect both the Laboratory and the Philosophical Apparatus they were fortunate enough to find both Dr. Mallet and Professor Smith in their respective Departments who not only gave them every facility for the desired inspection but took occasion most kindly to make the visit of the Committee both pleasant & instructive by the completeness & fullness of their exhibition of the objects of greatest interest in each of the branches.

The Committee are gratified to report that in both cases they found the Apparatus and all matters connected with both Departments in thorough order and most systematically arranged-Prof. Smith has within the past year or two enriched his collection (especially in the branch of acoustics) with many valuable instruments and Dr. Mallet has added to his collection many interesting specimens of the progressive process in the manufacture of Pottery and Leather.

The Committee were unable to give as full an inspection of these Departments as they desired, but they saw enough to assure them that both Departments are in the highest state of efficiency, and that no appropriations of any moment will be required by either Professor. It is obvious however that in the Department of Pure Chemistry an appropriation may be needed to put it on the same footing with the Departments visited today, and in conclusion they would suggest that the appropriation of $350 as recommended by the Faculty be favorably considered when the General appropriation bill shall come up.

All of which is respectfully submitted.

The Board met pursuant to adjournement last night.

Present the same members of the Board as on yesterday with the exception of Mr. Berkeley, who was called to Richmond on public business.

1. Resolved That the Rector & Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia receive with lively sensibility the announcement of the zeal and unanimity with which the society of Alumni have entered upon the consideration of a plan for aiding the University in the improvement of its finances & the enlargement of its theatre of usefulness.

2. They would further express their hearty approbation of the plan for reading these results as sketched by Mr. Blakey in his conference with this Board yesterday.

3. They reiterate their earnest wish & purpose in every possible way to encourage & cooperate with the Society of Alumni in the prosecution of this laudable enterprise, and will be ready at any and all times to consider and act upon any suggestions touching this matter which may come to them.

4. Resolved That the Committee appointed yesterday be charged with the duty of delivering these Resolutions to the Society of Alumni and it is further instructed to confer with the Committee of that Society whenever it shall be desired.

Ordered That the Rector execute the agreement dated June 27th 1872 with the Board of Trustees of the Miller Fund which is as follows:

Whereas the following order was made at a meeting of the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia held the 7th day of September 1870, viz: Whereas the Board of Trustees of the Miller Fund have agreed to make an appropriation for building a house for Professor Mallet on University ground upon special condition that, in case of separation of said Trust Fund from the University, the prime cost of said house shall be refunded, the Rector is hereby authorized & instructed to enter into such written legal agreement, as shall bind their Board or their successors to fulfil said condition, if said separation should occur: "& whereas the Board of Trustees of the Miller Fund did, in pursuance of their agreement, appropriate the sum of seven thousand two hundred dollars for building a house for Professor Mallet, which has been erected on University ground: Now, therefore, in consideration of the premises, the Rector & Visitors of the University of Virginia hereby agree, & bind themselves to refund the said sum of seven thousand two hundred dollars to the Board of Trustees of the Miller Fund whenever a separation of said Fund from the University of Virginia shall take place- In testimony whereof, I, Robert G. H. Kean, Rector of the University of Virginia, have hereunto signed my name, and affixed the seal of the Rector & Visitors of the University of Virginia this 27th day of June 1872.

The Board met pursuant to adjournment on yesterday.

Present the same members as on yesterday with the exception of Mr. Baker absent on account of indisposition.

Whereas the Board of Visitors is called upon to provide for instruction in three distinct departments of Chemical Science, viz: Pure, Applied, & Analytical Chemistry—;and as from the necessity of the case heretofore Pure Chemistry has been assigned to one chair, and consequently the other two subjects have been relegated to a second & distinct professorship- and whereas with the lights now before them such a distribution of these subjects seems to the Board to be most unequal. It is therefore ordered that for the present (it being regarded as strictly a temporary arrangement, to be made permanent or abolished as experience may dictate) that Pure & Applied Chemistry shall be united under one professorship and the department of Analytical Chemistry be assigned to another Chair whose occupant shall be entitled Adjunct Professor- subject to the control and under the constant supervision of the Professor of Pure & Applied Chemistry-the duties of said Adjunct Professor shall be prescribed by the Professor of Pure & Applied Chemistry except that it is hereby ordered that the said adjunct Professor shall be required to deliver a series of Lectures on Agricultural Chemistry.

Prof. J. W. Mallet is hereby appointed to the Chair of Pure & Applied Chemistry, subject in all that related to salary & income to the rules & regulations which govern the Faculty at large.

Frank P. Dunnington is hereby appointed to the Chair of Analytical Chemistry with the title of Adjunct Professor, and subject (as recited above) to the discretion and supervision of the Professor of Pure & Applied Chemistry- the said Adjunct Professor shall receive for his services the sum of $500 and the fees in his school to the extent of $300—;if they produce so much—;any excess over that sum to be paid into the general treasury of the University.

Absent Messrs Walton & Campbell—;left for home.

Ordered That the following appropriations are made for the ensuing fiscal year for the purposes named- to wit:

Of the funds appropriated by the Trustees of the Miller Fund

Of the funds of the University (General) as follows:

see part in proceedings at the meeting in Sept. 1872 when these are modified, p. 360 \[original, p. 316 typed]

Ordered That the Executive Committee of the Board, be charged with the duty of making such arrangements as may be necessary for temporarily providing for the present deficiency shown by the Proctor's Report, and for the payment of the Bond for Carr's Hill which matures in July next, and for meeting such other expenditures as may be necessary to be provided for before the next meeting of the Board.

Ordered That it is not intended by the foregoing appropriation that the salary of Prof. Mallet shall in any event exceed three thousand dollars ($3000) inclusive of the sum of $500 appropriated by the "Miller Trustees" to the "Prof. of Agricultural Chemistry".

The Board adjourned to meet on the 19th of September next.
