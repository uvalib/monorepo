President Darden reported that, in accordance with the authority granted under the resolution of the Board adopted at its special meeting held on September 15, 1956, the contract of sale of the Riley property at Falls Church had been duly executed by Mr. Berkeley and himself on behalf of The Rector and Visitors, that it had been also executed by Mrs. Gage and Mrs. Parker, the life tenants, and by the City of Falls Church. He stated that the Governor had united in the contract as evidence of his approval of the sale. He further reported that the approval of the voters of Falls Church of a bond issue to provide the City with the necessary funds with which to make this purchase, the contract being contingent upon such approval, was obtained at the election held on November 6, 1956. He pointed out that under the terms of the contract the transaction was to be completed within sixty days after the approval of such bond issue was obtained which meant that the transaction would be closed on or before January 6, 1957. He then submitted to the Board, draft of a deed dated December 10, 1956, prepared by C. Venable Minor, Special Counsel for the University of Virginia by which The Rector and Visitors, and Mrs. Gage and Mrs. Parker, the life tenants, conveyed to the City of Falls Church, with special warranty as to The Rector and Visitors and with general warranty as to the life tenants, the tract of 8.3208 acres situated in the City of Falls Church, Virginia, being the property devised to said life tenants with remainder to The Rector and Visitors, by the will of Joseph H. Riley, dated November 24, 1941, probated February 24, 1942, and of record in the Clerk's Office of the Circuit Court of Fairfax County in W.B. 21 p. 130.

After discussion and consideration of the draft of the deed submitted to the Board, upon motion duly made and seconded, the following resolutions were unanimously adopted:

**RESOLVED**, by The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, that, upon payment by the City of Falls church, Virginia, of the sum of $100,000.00, and its compliance with the other terms and conditions set out in the contract of sale between the parties dated September 17, 1956, Colgate W. Darden, Jr., President, and Francis L. Berkeley, Jr., Secretary, be and they hereby are, authorized, empowered and directed, the approval of the Governor, as required by Section 23.77.1 of the Code of Virginia, 1950, as amended, having been obtained thereto, to execute and deliver a deed of conveyance on behalf of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, conveying with special warranty of title, to the City of Falls Church, the remainder in the tract of 8.3208 acres of land in Falls Church, Virginia, devised to it by the will of Joseph H. Riley, and more particularly described in the draft of the deed submitted to this meeting, said deed to be substantially in the form of the draft submitted to this meeting.

**RESOLVED**, FURTHER, that the President and other officers of this corporation be and they hereby are, authorized, empowered, and directed to take such further steps, and do such further things as may be necessary to complete this transaction.

The President called to the attention of the Board that under the terms of the will of Dr. Joseph H. Riley the proceeds of sale of the property at Falls Church is to be used as a nucleus of a fund to found a school and museum of vertebrate zoology. He went on to say it was to a great extent through the cooperation, interest and generosity of Mrs. Margaret R. Parker and Mrs. Maude K. Gage, life tenants of the property under Dr. Riley's will that the University was able to dispose of its remainder interest in the property at this time for the sum of $100,000.00, and that he felt the Board should express its appreciation.

Upon motion, duly made and seconded, it was unanimously

**RESOLVED**, that the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia express to Mrs. Margaret R. Parker and Mrs. Maude K. Gage, sisters of the late Dr. Joseph Harvey Riley, and life tenants under his will, the deep appreciation and gratitude of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia for their interest, cooperation and generosity which made it possible at this time to dispose of the remainder interest in the property at Falls Church, Virginia, devised to the University under the will of the late Dr. Joseph Harvey Riley, to the City of Falls Church for the sum of $100,000.00.

The President was requested to transmit to Mrs. Parker and Mrs. Gage this expression of appreciation.

President Darden submitted to the Board draft of a deed dated December 10, 1956, prepared by C. Venable Minor, Special Counsel for the University, conveying to Charles M. Hodgman, Jr., a parcel of 10 acres of land near Diamond Springs, Princess Anne County, Virginia, being the same land devised to the University by will of Bertha L. Makinson, dated November 22, 1939, probated in the Clerk's Office of the Corporation Court of Norfolk in W.B. 23 p. 98, and also the same land conveyed to The Rector and Visitors by deed of Edwin J. Smith, Executor and Trustee u/w of Bertha L. Makinson, dated December 27, 1951, of record in the Clerk's Office of the Circuit Court of Princess Anne County, Virginia, in D.B. 296 p. 353. The consideration for the conveyance is $6900.00, of which $500.00 is cash and the residue of $6400.00 is evidenced by 5 negotiable promissory notes secured as deferred purchase money by deed of trust.

The President reported that, pursuant to the resolution of the Board adopted at its meeting held on June 16, 1956, after submitting the matter to Mr. Minor, he had executed a contract of sale of the property on behalf of The Rector and Visitors, to Charles M. Hodgman, Jr., upon the terms above set forth, and that the approval of the Governor to such contract of sale had been obtained.

Mr. Darden reminded the Board that sale of this property to the David Lea Corporation had been authorized by resolution adopted at the June 10, 1955, meeting but the sale had fallen through and that contract of sale had been cancelled by mutual agreement.

After discussion and consideration of the draft of the deed submitted to the Board, upon motion duly made and seconded, the following resolutions were unanimously adopted:

**RESOLVED**, by The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, that Colgate W. Darden, Jr., President, and Francis L. Berkeley, Jr., Secretary, be and they hereby are authorized, empowered and directed, the approval of the Governor as required by Section 23-77.1 of the Code of Virginia, 1950, as amended, having been obtained thereto, to execute and deliver a deed of conveyance on behalf of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, conveying with special warranty of title, to Charles M. Hodgman, Jr., in consideration of $6900.00, part cash and the residue secured as deferred purchase money by deed of trust on the property, the parcel of land containing 10 acres, more or less, lying near Diamond Springs in Princess Anne County, Virginia, and more particularly described in the draft of the deed submitted to this meeting, said deed to be substantially in the form of the draft submitted to this meeting.

**RESOLVED**, FURTHER, that the President and other officers of this corporation be, and they hereby are, authorized, empowered, and directed to take such further steps and do such further things as may be necessary to complete this transaction.

The President stated that because of the rapid movement in the securities market it had been found necessary to adopt some method whereby the consent of The Rector and Visitors to changes in investments in the Succession of the late Hugh E. Vincent could be obtained more rapidly than heretofore. He pointed out that under existing procedure such changes were submitted to the Honorable Wayne G. Borah, the University's representative, who then transmitted the recommendations for changes in investments to the Comptroller for approval. It was suggested that this procedure could be improved upon by authorizing Judge Borah to give his consent on behalf of the University to such changes upon a receipt of a telegram of authority from The Rector, the President or the Comptroller. After discussion, upon motion duly made and seconded, the following resolution was adopted:

**WHEREAS**, under the will of the late Hugh E. Vincent, which was probated April 24, 1951, in the proceedings No. 304-985 of the Civil District Court of Orleans Parish, Louisiana, Mildred Saffold Vincent, his widow, was named as Usufructuary, and the University of Virginia, Tulane University and Trinity Church were named as Naked Owners of certain assets, including certain securities, which in accordance with the will have been lodged in the custody of the Whitney National Bank of New Orleans; and

**WHEREAS**, by an agreement executed, in couterparts, by the said four parties in interest (Counterpart by the University of Virginia being executed by Vincent Shea), which agreement became effective by the lodgment of counterparts signed by all four parties in Whitney National Bank on June 7, 1956, a method of handling those securities was formulated and agreed upon; and

**WHEREAS**, the said agreement provides for the consent of the four parties in interest to the reinvestment of capital resulting from the maturity of securities, and also for the consent of all four parties to the disposal of securities in the estate, and the reinvestment of the proceeds of those securities; and

**WHEREAS**, because of the rapid movement in the securities market, it is essential that these consents be given without unnecessary delay; and

**WHEREAS**, by resolution of this Board adopted December 12, 1952, and still in force, The Rector or President or the Comptroller of this corporation is authorized and empowered to sell, assign and transfer any and all stocks, bonds, evidences of interest or indebtedness, rights, and options, to acquire or to sell same and all other securities, corporate or otherwise, standing in the name of, or belonging to, this corporation in any capacity; and

**WHEREAS**, as a courtesy to this institution the Honorable Wayne G. Borah has agreed to act for this institution in the matter giving the written consent of this institution, to any such transaction upon receipt by him of a telegram signed by either the Rector, the President or the Comptroller of this institution,

**NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED** that upon receipt by him of a telegram signed by any one of said officials authorizing such consent, the said Wayne G. Borah is hereby authorized, empowered and directed on behalf of this institution, to consent in writing to any of the above described transactions made under the said agreement of June 7, 1956, provided that the other three parties in interest have already consented to such transactions.

President Darden laid before the Board a report by the Cemetery Committee dated 8 June 1955, and pointed out that there was divergent opinion in regard to some of its provisions, some of which had not been reconciled with the legal advice of the University's Special Counsel. In response to the President's statement that an increased fee for spaces in the cemetery is needed to assist in maintenance, the Board adopted the following resolution:

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the charge for lots in the University Cemetery be and it is hereby increased from twenty dollars ($20.00) to forty dollars ($40.00) effective this date.

The President read to the Board the following letter from the Comptroller:

Confirming our conversation concerning an employee of Seward Forest who is sick with cancer, the circumstances are as follows:

This man has been an hourly employee for fifteen years. His rate of pay is 90¢ an hour. Under State regulations, all hourly people are considered temporary employees and are not entitled to any sick leave. As this operation is supported entirely from endowment funds, the University need not follow State Personnel regulations. It has been the general policy of Seward Forest to pay all of its employees, other than Director, on an hourly basis. Under the circumstances, Mr. Jenkins and I feel that this man should receive some sick leave because of his long service.

As a general policy, it is proposed that any hourly employee with ten or more years of continued service be entitled to one-half pay for a serious illness, for a period not to exceed three months.

Pointing out that non-hourly employees can accumulate up to ninety days sick leave, President Darden recommended approval of Mr. Shea's proposal. The Board adopted after discussion the following resolution:

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that, effective this date, any hourly employee with ten or more years of continuous service shall be entitled to half-pay for a serious illness, for a period not to exceed three months.

Mr. Darden informed the Board that President Eisenhower had requested the members of the special Committee that is engaged, under the chairmanship of Mr. Benjamin Fairless, in a study of foreign aid policies for the State Department, to visit certain areas of the Far East and elsewhere between December 27th next and February 5th. He had not contemplated such travel, Mr. Darden said, when he originally accepted membership on this Committee, and he would resign from the Committee if the Board thought it best for him to do so.

The Board resolved that the President be granted leave for the period of foreign travel to be undertaken by the Committee.

The President said that unless he heard objections from the Board, it was his intention to assign to the Provost, Dr. Joseph L. Vaughan, additional duties, especially in regard to the branch junior colleges, beyond those listed in the resolution creating that office. The Chairman and other Visitors expressed the opinion that the President required no additional authority for such assignments or reassignments unless they appeared to be prohibited by anything in the original resolution.

The following letter from the Dean of Engineering was read to the Board by President Darden:

The present regulation for admission of women students to Engineering calls for at least 60 semester-hours credit and a minimum age of 20. This was passed by the Board of Visitors sometime during the 20's so I wonder if it would not be well to reconsider the matter since opinions have changed quite a bit since that time. If you feel that it is advisable to present this matter to the Board of Visitors for reconsideration, I suggest that the minimum age be changed to 18 so an outstanding student who has completed two years of college elsewhere may be considered for admission. I agree with the requirement of 60 semester-hours as I do not believe it would be advisable for a girl of 16 or 17 to make the transition from high school to college in a predominantly boys' school.

After discussion the Board adopted the following resolution:

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the present academic requirements for the admission of women students to the School of Engineering be retained, but that the minimum age for admission be reduced from twenty to eighteen, effective this date.

The president reported that, in accordance with the authority delegated to him by the Board on September 15th, he had ordered an increase of fifty dollars ($50.00) in the tuition fee for Virginia students and one hundred dollars ($100.00) for out-of-state students, effective as of the beginning of the 1957-58 session. The Governor, Mr. Darden reported, has approved the increased fees, but has not yet approved the accompanying increased faculty salary schedules, which he is to review in coming months.

President Darden laid before the Board his recent correspondence with Mrs. Preston Davie, of New York, who has offered to present to the University a portrait of Sir Walter Raleigh, painted in 1588, and recently appraised by Mr. Milton Samuels, of French and Company, at $7,500. Mrs. Davie, Mr. Darden noted, had expressed the hope that the University would lend the portrait, if it was accepted, to the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts for exhibit during the year of the Jamestown Festival of 1957.

The Board resolved that the gift of the Raleigh portrait be accepted, subject to the approval of the Art Commission, and that the President be requested to convey to Mrs. Davie the gratitude of the Visitors for her generosity to the University.

### Report of Buildings and Grounds Committee

The Committee met on December 7th, inspected the Piedmont development and commended the administration and Mr. Frederick Nichols, architect, for the adequate and attractive housing for young professors.

The Committee again examined the brick panels for the Student Activities building, confirmed the previous selection, leaving coice of mortar to the architect.

In reference to the request of Professor Abbott who lives in Pavilion VI, formerly the Romance Pavilion to use the room known as the Salle Lafayette as additional space for his family, the Committee visited the room, which contains a work of art in the frescoes painted by St. Hubert and presented by Ormond Smith of New York at a cost of $20,000 - and dedicated by the French Ambassador in memory of Thomas Jefferson and the Marquis De Lafayette, the room to be used exclusively for the study of the French language. The Committee recommends that we defer action on the request, and that further study be made of the disposition of this room with its work of art after consultation with the Metropolitan Museum.

In reference to a request from Phi Delta Theta and Pi Epsilon Pi fraternities for lease of Building sites between Scott Stadium and the Filtering plant, the following recommendation is made following consultation with the President:

That the request be denied in view of the property being suitable for University housing near the Engineering School and Science Buildings. It is further recommended that the matter be referred to the administration for further study in an effort to find a suitable area for fraternity housing.

In reference to the request from Dr. Sterling Decker that the 30-foot right of way from McCormick Road (Old Mountain Road) to Midmont, known as the Chamberlain property, be increased to 50 feet which will enable the developers to build a road that will meet State specifications, the site was visited and the Committee recommends:

That the application for an increase from a 30 to a 50 foot right of way be granted, on condition that all expense be borne by the developer, that such increase in the right of way shall be for such distance as is required by the Zoning Board, and that all of the details of the application be subject to the approval of the President, and that there also be obtained an opinion of the Counsel of the University that the Board is legally authorized to give such consent.

The Board resolved that the foregoing Report be accepted and that its recommendations be adopted.

The problem of a suitable location for the proposed Northern Virginia College was considered by the Board in open session from 10:00 A.M. until 12:45 and again during the final hour of the executive session in the afternoon.

After laying before the Board approximately fifty resolutions, petitions, and letters from local governments, clubs, civic organizations, and individuals on behalf of various sites, the Chairman pro tem welcomed the representatives from Northern Virginia and requested that each delegation limit its spokesman or spokesmen to fifteen minutes.

Pursuant to a ruling by the Chair that group representatives and individuals would be heard in the order in which they had made application, as listed by the Secretary, but that the Advisory Council, in view of its semi-official status, would be allowed to present two additional spokesmen at the end of the hearing, the following persons, in the order named, addressed the Board.

* Mr. Joseph L. Vaughan, who read a statement by Dean George B. Zehmer in regard to the problem.
* Mr. Shelley Krasnow, offering a choice of Prince William County sites on behalf of a County Committee.
* Mr. A. B. Rust, Jr., on behalf of the Prince William County Supervisors and in support of Mr. Krasnow's proposals.
* Mr. Clarence A. Steele, representing the Advisory Council to the Northern Virginia Extension Center in support of Ravensworth.
* Mr. Joseph Basilone, of Springfield, on behalf of the Ravensworth site.
* Mr. Joseph L. Duvall, a student at the Northern Virginia Extension Center, who presented 452 mimeographed statements, signed by Extension students and teachers, requesting the Board's approval of the Advisory Council's choice of Ravensworth.
* Mr. Henry Glasse, who spoke on behalf of the Bowmans' Sunset Hills tract near Herndon.
* Mr. Cooper Dawson, who spoke on behalf of University of Virginia Alumni at the Episcopal High School and elsewhere in Northern Virginia in support of the Herndon site.
* Mr. W. V. T. Justis, who introduced to the Board Messrs. Wallace Carper, Maurice Fox, William Keys, Lewis Moore, and others present who joined him in support of the Herndon site.
* Mr. Joseph Freehill, who spoke on behalf of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors, generally in support of the Ravensworth site, but without specifically rejecting the Herndon or other sites.
* Judge Carleton Penn, of Loudoun County, who appeared as an Alumnus and on behalf of the County Board, and introduced Messrs. Newkirk, J. T. Hirst, Sterling M. Harrison, and J. D. Nichols, who shared his support of the Herndon site.
* The Rev. John B. Shinberger, who discussed the rising population of the Vienna area and the advantages of the Herndon site.
* Mr. Shawn, who favored the Herndon site.
* Mr. Lucas D. Phillips, who supported the Herndon site.
* Mr. Egbert Thompson, who offered his farm in Prince William County, on the Shirley Highway near Woodbridge.
* Mr. Harrison Mann, who explained the intentions of the Virginia Advisory Legislative Council and of the General Assembly, which he interpreted as favoring "only the Tenth District", and hence the Ravensworth site.
* Mr. Richard E. Shands, like Mr. Mann a member of the Advisory Council, and former member of the Fairfax School Board, who analyzed the elements favorable to the Ravensworth site.
* Mr. John Ticer, representing the City Council of Alexandria, which favors the Ravensworth site and is prepared to give financial support.
* Mr. Cash (?) of Herndon, in support of the Sunset Hills tract.

At the conclusion of these arguments, at 12:45 P.M., the Chairman directed the Secretary to take charge of the maps, charts, petitions, and other exhibits, and thanked the groups and individuals from Northern Virginia, who then withdrew from the room.

During the concluding hour of the afternoon session, the recommendations were reviewed and a general discussion of the problem was held in executive session. To correct the record as misstated in certain newspaper accounts, attributed to Advisory Council members, and published following release of the Board's Committee Report in September, members of the former Committee briefly reviewed their work. It was pointed out that the Committee had begun by studying the legislative background of the project, had notified all members of the Advisory Council and Northern Virginia members of the General Assembly, and had consulted with them in open meetings of the Committee. No closed session had been held by the Committee except when the final decision was reached, at which time the presence of the Advisory Councillors would have seemed partial in the eyes of the public. Maps showing population trends and school locations were studied, and it was pointed out that competition by other colleges coming into the urban area was not a potential threat, being already present in the form of several large city universities which are more accessible to students in the Alexandria-Arlington area than either of the proposed Ravensworth and Herndon sites will be. Adequate ultimate control by the University of its proposed branch was questioned in the light of some of the current local attitudes towards the University's participation in the choice of a site.

The Board resolved to defer action on a site until the March 9th meeting and at that time to reconsider the entire problem of the advisability of establishing a college of the University in Northern Virginia.

As the concluding speaker at the morning's public session, Miss Charmenz Lenhart, a former faculty member, appeared at her own request and addressed the Board from 12:45 to 1:00 o'clock. Miss Lenhart was accompanied by her advisor, Mr. Bayard Q. Morgan, Professor Emeritus at Stanford University and a member of the executive council of the Modern Languages Association. Upon retiring from the Board Room, after completing her remarks and receiving the Chairman's thanks, Miss Lenhart handed to the Secretary a carbon copy of her statement, which called for "justice" for the late Dr. Morgan L. Combs, a review by the Board of its proceedings of 1953-54 in regard to him, and action by the Board to build a chapel in his memory.

Mr. Smith, as Chairman of the Committee on Mary Washington College, reported on a meeting held on the evening of December 7th at which the Committee had been informed of the Governor's decision to ask the General Assembly to restore to the College, for its debt retirement program, the $351,000 from its 1955-56 operating surplus that had been placed by executive order in the General Fund of the Commonwealth. Mr. Smith spoke briefly of the good planning in progress for dormitory, gymnasium, and library needs, and of the informed exchange of views at the Committee meeting, at which the President, the Chancellor, and the Bursar of the College had been present.

At the request of the Chairman, the Secretary handed to each Visitor copies of the following. (1) A two-page statement by the Chancellor, entitled "Future Building Program", outlining dormitory needs estimated at $1,680,000, library expansion needs estimated at $275,000, and a new gymnasium to replace the 1910 structure at a cost of $500,000, and (2) A six-page "Survey of Dormitory Capacity for Mary Washington College as Related to Future Dormitory Needs", prepared by the Bursar and the Dean of Students.

On motion the meeting was then adjourned.
