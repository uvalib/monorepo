During each period of six months beginning six months prior to the date of the first maturity of said bonds and continuing up to and including the period of six months beginning January 1, 1942, there shall be so set aside and paid into said Sinking Fund out of the fees and charges aforesaid an amount equal to 110 percentum of the amount required to pay all interest and principal payments falling due on or before the next date when any of the bonds mature. The amount by which such payments into the Sinking Fund exceed the aggregate amount of interest and principal falling due on or before such dates shall be held in the Sinking Fund as a reserve for contingencies and shall be used only in accordance with the provisions of this resolution. During each period of six months beginning July 1, 1942, and continuing so long as any of said bonds shall remain outstanding, there shall be so set aside and paid into such Sinking Fund out of said fees and charges an amount equal to the amount required to pay all interest and principal falling due on or before the next date when any of the bonds mature, provided, however, that no further payments need be made into said Sinking Fund when the amount of money held in said Sinking Fund (including the reserve for contingencies) equals the amount of interest and principal that will be payable at the time of the maturity of all the bonds then outstanding. If, in any such period, the institution shall fail to pay into the Sinking Fund the full amount hereinabove stipulated, then an amount equal to the amount of such deficiency shall be set aside and paid into the Sinking Fund out of the first such fees or charges available in the following period, without, however, abating the amount required hereunder in such following period. If the institution shall fail to make such payment into the Sinking Fund, as aforesaid, during any such period, any funds then held in the Sinking Fund as a reserve for contingencies as above provided shall be used for the payment of any portion of the interest on or principal of the bonds on which there would otherwise be a default, but the amount by which such reserve is so reduced by such payment shall be replaced from the first such fees or charges available in the following period or periods, in excess of the required payment for the then current period.

### Section 7.

The institution shall keep complete and accurate accounts of all sums of money received and disbursed in connection with the construction, equipping, operation and maintenance of the project, including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, a complete and accurate record of all such fees or charges charged or collected, and all sums disbursed for payment of the interest on and principal of said bonds. Within sixty days after the close of each fiscal year, beginning with the fiscal year which closes June 30, 1939, the institution shall prepare and furnish to the holder or holders of any of said bonds who may request the same, complete operating and income statements of the project, covering the preceding fiscal year in reasonable detail and certified by the Bursar of the University. Such operation and income statements shall be certified by an independent auditor (at the expense of the Institution) if demand for such independent audit be made by the holder or holders of twenty percentum (20%) of the bonds at any time outstanding.

### Section 8.

So long as any of said bonds remain unpaid, the Institution shall maintain the project in good condition and operate the same in an efficient manner and at a reasonable cost, and shall maintain insurance upon said New Library Building of a kind and in an amount which usually would be carried by a private corporation operating a similar project, the policies of insurance to be made payable to "The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia". The proceeds of any such insurance in event of loss shall be used only for—;(a) replacements or repairs, or, at the option of the Institution, (b) payments into the Sinking Fund. Nothing in this section shall be construed or operate as requiring the Institution to pay the costs of operation and maintenance of the project out of any other funds than the revenues and receipts derived directly or indirectly from the project.

### Section 9.

So long as any of said bonds shall remain outstanding the Institution shall not issue any additional bonds of any other authorized issue or other evidences of indebtedness payable from the revenues and receipts of said project unless the lien and security of such additional bonds or evidences of indebtedness of such receipts and revenues are made junior and subordinate in all respects to the lien thereon of the bonds hereinbefore described.

### Section 10.

The holders of said bonds are, and shall be, entitled to all the benefits of and subject to the provisions of Section 7 of the Act referred to in Section 1 of this Resolution, and any Trustee appointed by the holders of bonds pursuant to said Section 7 of said Act shall have the powers provided by sub-division (e) of said Section 7 of said Act.

### Section 11.

The provisions of Section 5 to Section 9, both inclusive, of this Resolution shall be a part of the contract with the holder or holders of the bonds, and the President or Bursar, or other Executive or Financial Officers of the Institution, shall be, and they are hereby, authorized and empowered to do any and all things necessary, proper or convenient in order to fully carry out and perform the agreements on the part of the Institution to be carried out and performed pursuant to said Sections.
