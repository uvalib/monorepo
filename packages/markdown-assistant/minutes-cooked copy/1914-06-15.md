The Following copy of a resolution adopted by the Council of Charlottesville, June 11, 1914, was transmitted to the Board:-

The special committee on repairs and improvements, submitted the following report.

June 2nd, 1914.

At a meeting of the special committee, consisting of the Rector, Mr. Michie, Dean Page and the Superintendent of Buildings and Grounds, held in the President's Office, at which all members were present, the following recommendation was unanimously agreed to,-

First-recognizing the primary importance of the preservation of the property of the University, and endeavoring to keep perfect faith with the legislature, we recommend that the plumbing be put in the dormitories of East and West Lawns; that painting of all exposed woodwork throughout the University, and repairs of all interior walls and plaster be first attended to.

Second-that whatever balance of funds, remains, we recognize our promise to the legislative committee, in improving the roads and walks of the University.

That this object can best be carried out in conjunction with the Senff entrance gate. From this point, follow the old East Range Road, to a point opposite the Infirmary, from the Infirmary to the steps leading to Lawn, near Cabell Hall, from this point, between the East Lawn and East Range buildings, to a point at North front of Rotunda, thence connecting temporarily with the road at West Range near Anatomical Hall; from thence, to Dawson's Row. This road to be built of brick or other dustless material. We feel that this driveway will permit and invite distinguished visitors to become acquainted with the wonderful architectural composition of the University, in a manner which cannot be otherwise provided. It will facilitate the orderly keeping of our grounds, and add to the comfort and pleasure of all those connected with the University.

It is recommended that all repairs be proceeded with in advance of the Road, and that be completed only in case sufficient funds remain after these repairs are finished.

The details of this plan of procedure are appended.

The foregoing report was approved, with the exception of "Repairs and Improvements to Roads and Alleys," which was passed by, and the following resolution, dealing with the roadway from "entrance" to and in front of Hospital was adopted:

Resolved: That the Superintendent of Grounds and Buildings be authorized to lay the brick now on hand, from the street to the proposed "Memorial Gate," and thence up to the front of the Hospital.

On motion, the Board adjourned, subject to call of the Rector.

I take pleasure in announcing the award of the following scholarships from the Charlottesville High School to the University of Virginia for the session 1914-1915.

Rinehart Scholarship to Gilbert S. Campbell.
