The President announced the receipt of a gift of 4,291 shares of the capital stock of the First City National Bank of Houston, in Houston, Texas, which has been made to the University of Virginia by Mrs. M. W. Perkins (Mrs. Sallie Shepherd Perkins) of Asheville, North Carolina. This gift is to be added to an earlier gift of $50,000 made in June 1947, and the income from the combined sum is to be used to supplement the salary of a distinguished pediatrician to occupy a Chair to be known as the Benjamin Armistead Shepherd Professorship of Pediatrics.

The gift has been made by Mrs. Perkins in honor of and as a memorial to her grandfather, Benjamin Armistead Shepherd, and her brother, Benjamin Armistead Shepherd, II.

Benjamin Armistead Shepherd was born on 14 May 1814 in Fluvanna County, Virginia, and moved to Kentucky in 1833. He lived successively in Nashville, Memphis, and New Orleans, from which he moved to Galveston, Texas, where he was married on 28 October 1840 to Mary Hobson of Nashville. The exact date of Mr. Shepherd's move to Houston is not known, but he was living there on 30 December 1847 when a bank was chartered, of which Mr. Shepherd was a Director. He opened a private bank in Houston in 1854 and continued with that institution until January 1867 when it was merged with the First National Bank of Houston, now the First City National Bank of Houston, of which he became President and held that position until his death in 1891. During the War Between the States, he and some associates bought and operated a ship, which ran cotton through the Federal blockade. In 1867, he purchased a residence on Park Street in Charlottesville, which he called "Meadeland" and which he and his family used for a summer home for several years.

Mr. Shepherd is known as one of the great contributors to the growth and development of Houston, and it was through his farsightedness and business acumen that many enterprises, including one of the railroads entering the city in the early days, were brought to Houston. His name is still revered as one of the pioneers in the development of Houston as a great commercial center.

Benjamin Armistead Shepherd, II, who was named for his grandfather, was born in Fluvanna County in December 1886. He entered the University of Virginia and graduated with a Master of Arts degree in 1909. Following graduation, he studied law at Columbia University, but because of failing health, was unable to complete the course. He died in Richmond, Virginia, in November 1916 at the age of 30.

In order to carry out the wishes of Mrs. Perkins, the President proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that there is hereby established a Chair in the School of Medicine to be known as the Benjamin Armistead Shepherd Professorship of Pediatrics

The President proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution

WHEREAS Mrs. Sallie Shepherd Perkins has made a magnificent gift to the University of Virginia for the purpose of supplementing the salary of a distinguished Professorship in Pediatrics in the School of Medicine in honor of and as a memorial to her grandfather, Benjamin Armistead Shepherd, and her brother, Benjamin Armistead Shepherd, II,

AND WHEREAS this Board has established a Chair in the Department of Pediatrics in the School of Medicine, to be known as the Benjamin Armistead Shepherd Professorship of Pediatrics, in order to carry out the wishes of Mrs. Perkins,

NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that we hereby record our deep gratitude for this gift which will enable the University to attain further eminence in the field of pediatrics, and direct the Secretary to transmit a copy of this resolution to Mrs. Perkins as a mark of our warm appreciation.

The President announced the receipt of a gift by an anonymous donor for the support of instruction and research in the Department of Chemistry. This gift consists of 2,300 shares of common stock of the Du Pont Company. The anonymous donor, who has previously made gifts of approximately the same amounts for the Departments of Physics and Biology, has directed that the gift is to be used to supplement the salary of a distinguished professor to occupy a Chair to be known as the John W. Mallet Professorship of Chemistry, to supplement the salaries of younger, promising members of the faculty of the Department of Chemistry, to purchase equipment needed in Chemistry, and to establish a scholarship fund to be used to attract undergraduate, graduate, and post doctoral students. The gift was made on the condition that an appropriation be made by the 1962 General Assembly in the amount of $3.5 million to construct a Chemistry Building. As the President reported to the Board at its April meeting (Minute Book, University of Virginia, No. 12, 14 April 1962, p. 314), such an appropriation was made, and it is now necessary to establish the Chair in Chemistry as requested by the anonymous donor.

Mr. John W. Mallet was born near Dublin, Ireland on 10 October 1832. He came to the United States in 1853 to collect information for his father about the Erickson Caloric Engine with no expectation of remaining in this country. He became a professor at Amherst College, however, and served as a member of the faculty at a number of institutions of higher learning in this country before accepting a position as Professor of Chemistry at the University of Virginia. He was a member of the University faculty from 1868 to 1883 and from 1885 to 1908 when he retired and became Professor Emeritus. He died in 1912.

The President proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that there is hereby established a Chair in the Department of Chemistry to be known as the John W. Mallet Professorship of Chemistry.

The President proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution

WHEREAS a devoted friend of the University, who desires to remain anonymous, has made a magnificent gift of 2,300 shares of common stock of the Du Pont Company for the support of instruction and research in the Department of Chemistry,

AND WHEREAS this same person in previous years has made gifts of a similar magnitude for the support of instruction and research in Physics and Biology,

NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that we hereby record our deep gratitude for these gifts which have enabled the University to attain a position of eminence in the field of science, and direct the Secretary to transmit a copy of this resolution to the anonymous donor as a mark of our warm appreciation.

The Chairman of the Finance Committee, Mr. Blanton, submitted for the Board's consideration the proposed 1962-1963 University Budget, copies of which had previously been mailed to each member of the Board. Mr. Blanton reported that the Finance Committee had met with the President and the Comptroller on 18 May 1962 for a detailed review of the proposed budget and that the Finance Committee, at the conclusion of its meeting, had unanimously approved the budget as recommended. Following a discussion, Mr. Blanton proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the proposed 1962-1963 University Budget as recommended by the President and as approved by the Finance Committee be and it is hereby approved.

The President reported on some changes he was making in the organization of the Arts and Sciences, which were to be effective on 1 July 1962. He explained in detail the reasons for these changes and reported that he had sent a letter under the date of 1 June 1962 to each member of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences describing these changes. This letter is as follows

I am today reporting to the Rector and Visitors a new administrative structure which I believe will permit more effective operation of the College and Graduate School of Arts and Sciences than has previously been possible.

At present, the Dean of the College is burdened with more duties than one man should be called upon to discharge. In addition to administrative details of the undergraduate College, he is responsible for obtaining suitable replacements and additions to the faculty of Arts and Sciences without having any responsibility for the graduate teaching which many of the new members of the faculty actually will engage in and must be employed to do.

The plan set forth below, to become effective 1 July 1962, (a) changes the title of the present position of Dean of the College to Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, (b) relieves the Dean of the Faculty of the day-to-day duties of administering the undergraduate College, which are delegated to a new position (although its title is not new) to be known as Dean of the College, and (c) makes the Dean of the Faculty responsible for appraising and coordinating both the graduate and undergraduate curricula and for recommending to the President persons to join the faculty of Arts and Sciences.

Direct responsibility for administering the undergraduate College is placed under the new position of Dean of the College, and the present position of Associate Dean of the College is discontinued.

The position of Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences is only slightly modified to include responsibility for research policy in Arts and Sciences and to provide for active participation with the Dean of the Faculty in obtaining members of the faculty of Arts and Sciences who will participate in graduate instruction.

I have appointed, effective 1 July 1962, Mr. Frank L. Hereford, Jr., Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and Mr. Irby B. Cauthen, Jr., Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences.

In a short time I hope to be able to announce the appointment of the Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.

The duties and responsibilities which will be assigned to the three positions are as follows:

1. Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences to serve as the chief staff advisor to the President on all matters related to the undergraduate and graduate curricula in Arts and Sciences, to appraise the existing faculties of the several Departments in Arts and Sciences, and in consultation with the Dean of the Graduate School, the Dean of the College, and the Chairmen of Departments, to recommend to the President persons to fill vacancies on the faculty and to staff positions for expansion to staff into areas not now covered, to prepare tables of organization for each of the several Departments, to consult with the Comptroller on the preparation of the annual and biennial budgets and other matters of a financial nature involving Arts and Sciences, on behalf of the President, to interview prospects for election to the faculty and make recommendations to the President on all such elections, and, in general, to conduct a continuous re-appraisal of the faculty strengths and weaknesses and needs of the faculty as expansion of enrollment occurs. The President will continue to interview all candidates for tenure appointments.

2. Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences to advise the President and the Dean of the Faculty on all matters relating to graduate instructional and research policy in Arts and Sciences, to develop and expand the graduate enrollment in Arts and Sciences, to counsel graduate students on appropriate matters relating to graduate instruction, and to participate actively with the Dean of the Faculty in obtaining faculty members whose duties will involve graduate instruction.

3. Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences to undertake all duties with respect to the academic programs of undergraduate students in the Arts and Sciences, to advise the Dean of the Faculty with respect to undergraduate faculty staffing and curricula, to advise the Dean of the Faculty on such matters involving undergraduate educational policy as he may deem advisable or as may be requested by the Dean of the Faculty, and to undertake such other duties as may be assigned by the Dean of the Faculty.
