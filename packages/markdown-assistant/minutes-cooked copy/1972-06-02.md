Mr. Wilkinson requested that the Board discuss the report at a future time and that sufficient time be set aside for the discussion. The Rector agreed to this schedule.

Mr. Potter suggested that an outside firm might be able to examine the report and to validate the proposals set forth in the report.

Mr. Zimmer announced that he felt strongly that outside consultation would make the report more authentic and one that could be readily endorsed by members of the General Assembly.

The Rector urged validation of the report by use of competent outside consultants.

The President pointed out that we have an outstanding committee that has studied the problems thoroughly and he felt that these workers understand the University's problems better than outside consultants would.

The Rector advised that action on this question be deferred for the present. The report was accepted by the Board.

Ballou and Justice, conditioned only upon the necessary procurement of funds for execution of the work, and at the same meeting authorized the President to make application to the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development for a grant of one half of the total estimated cost of $2,176,500 needed to complete the restoration, so that with matching funds from non-Federal sources, the Rotunda, Thomas Jefferson's last and greatest architectural masterpiece, could be restored to its original design and functions by the nation's anniversary year, 1976, the primary objective recommended for that year by the University's Bicentennial Committee; and WHEREAS, on April 28, 1972, at Monticello, the Assistant Secretary of Housing and Urban Development for Community Development signed and delivered to the President of the University a contract granting the sum of $1,088,250 which, matched by a similar sum from private sources available to the University, will make possible the long-planned restoration; NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, in the conviction that this generous grant, the largest ever made by the Department for historic restoration, is also a wise and far-seeing action that will reflect the highest credit hereafter on all concerned in it, extends its gratitude on behalf of the Commonwealth of Virginia and the University of Virginia to the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development.
