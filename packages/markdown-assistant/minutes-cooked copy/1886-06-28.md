In view of his long and eminent services to the University of Va it is ordered by its Board of Visitors that Dr Jas L.

Dr Cabell however is designated and shall be regarded by the other members of the Medical Faculty whose duty it will be to render general medical services to the students of the Institution as their Consulting Physician.

As the Board considers that the duties of Dr Cabell in his relation of consulting Physician and President of the Board of health will be as onerous and responsible and his services in this capacity as valuable as under the existing arrangement, it is for these reasons ordered that his proportional interest to which he is entitled as at present determined, in the Infirmary fees shall not be impaired.
