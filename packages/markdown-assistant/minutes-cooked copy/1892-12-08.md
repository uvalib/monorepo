At a meeting of the Rector and Visitors called by the Rector and held at the University on the 8th day of December 1892 in pursuance of notice.

Present. W. C. N. Randolph, Rector, and Visitors, Messrs Kean, Parrish, McCabe, R. W. Martin, Gordon, T. S. Martin, & Patteson. Absent Mr McCormick.

Professor Thornton, Chairman of the Faculty laid before the Board, Report & Supplemental report of the Faculty, School reports, Librarian's, Proctor's reports, Report of the Superintendent of Grounds and Buildings and several petitions. These papers were referred to the appropriate Committees.

On motion, Resolved, that Basil B. Gordon be added to the Committee on the Conduct of Schools and Examination of Students.

The Rector submitted and had read to the Board two letters received by him from Col Archer Anderson of which the following are copies:

Dr W. C. N. Randolph, Rector of the University of Va, Charlottesville, Va:

Dear Sir: I hand you herewith my check on the 1st National Bank of Richmond drawn to your order and certified by that Bank for five thousand dollars ($5000.), which sum I give to the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia upon the following trust. The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia are to invest this sum in bonds of the State of Virginia, or such other securities as they may select, and therewith establish a Scholarship in the said University to be called the "John Y. Mason Scholarship". They are to apply the income of these securities every year to the maintenance and instruction at the said University of some deserving student born in Virginia, who shall be deemed by them unable to prosecute his studies without such assistance and shall be selected under regulations to be prescribed by them. The said Rector and Visitors may execute this trust directly or through the agency of the Officers of the State of Virginia in accordance with existing laws, so far as the financial part of it is concerned, as the said Rector and Visitors may elect. If I have omitted any important detail or any more formal writing is required, I shall be glad to do what your experience may suggest in order to carry out the purpose above set forth.

In conclusion, I have only to request that as little mention be made of my name in connection with this matter as may be consistent with the proper keeping of the official records of the University, and I remain, with great respect,

Dr. W. C. N. Randolph, Rector of the University of Va.

Richmond, Nov. 22d, 1892

Charlottesville, Va.

Dear Sir. I received yesterday your letter of Nov. 18th acknowledging mine of 17th, and I thank you for your kind expressions. It gives me pleasure to accept your suggestion that it be left to the discretion of the Board of Visitors whether the endowment shall go to establish a fellowship or a scholarship; and you will, therefore, consider my letter of Nov. 17th as amended to this effect. With warm regard. Yours faithfully.

Archer Anderson.

Professor Wm M. Thornton laid before the Board a letter received by him from Mrs Leita M. Kent of Washington, City, D. C., the widow of Mr Linden Kent decd, which letter was read to the Board and of which the following is a copy:

I am in receipt of your letter of Nov. 6th and concur with you and my brother Charles Kent in your opinion, that the fund in memory of my husband shall be devoted to establishing the "Linden Kent Chair of English Literature". I, therefore authorize you to say to the Board of Visitors, that I am prepared to pay them on the 1st of January \`93' or later, as the Board prefers, the sum of three thousand dollars, annually for the support of the chair and to further secure this payment, by bequeathing to the Rector and Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia, at Charlottesville Va, the sum of Sixty thousand dollars, for the endowment of the Chair of English Literature, to be known as the "Linden Kent Chair of English Literature".

Nothing would gratify me more than to see my brother occupy this chair, and, while I confess, the suggestion from you as to this probability has had some weight with me in the change from Lectureship Fund, to the Chair of English Literature, I would emphasize the fact, that in making the gift to the University, the sole activating motive with me has been, to honor the memory of my husband in a way that seemed to me the most fitting. No longer able to honor him in life and left only the burning desire of doing so in death, the memory that a home in Virginia was soon to tell of his abiding love for his native state, of a last drive around the Classic Halls of his loved Alma Mater, of a career in life such, that as an Alumnus of this University, he could be pointed to with pride, almost spontaneously, upon his death, inclined me to the thought, that in making greater the power for good of this child of his native state, I would be doing what he would most like to see and be associating his name with a source of learning that contributed no little to the success of his own life.

I appreciate my brother's unwillingness to accept this Chair unless called to it solely upon his merits, and therefore I have no objection to my name's being withheld for the present.

Thanking you much for the pains you have taken to assist me in this matter, believe me Very truly yours,

The Board met in pursuance of adjournment on yesterday.

Present. The Rector and all Eight of the Visitors, including Mr McCormick who arrived to day, (and would have been present on yesterday, but for a mistake made by the Secretary in naming in his notice to him the 9th instead of the 8th as should have been.)

The following preamble and resolutions were unanimously adopted:

The Rector having laid before the Board, the correspondence with Col Archer Anderson of Richmond City Va, presenting to the University the sum of Five Thousand dollars, to be invested in Bonds of the State of Virginia or such other securities as they may select, and therewith establish a scholarship, or fellowship in the University to be called the "John Y. Mason Scholarship" or Fellowship, the income arising from said securities to be applied to the maintenance and instruction at the said University of some deserving student born in Virginia who shall be deemed by them unable to prosecute his studies without such assistance and to be selected under regulations to be prescribed by them.

Resolved, 1. That the Board of Visitors accept the said donation, upon the terms and for the purposes indicated by the donor, and will make suitable regulations for carrying the same into effect according to his intention.

2. That the Rector cause the action of the Board to be communicated to Col Archer Anderson, and express to him the thanks of the Board, for his judicious liberality, a liberality not only valuable to the cause of education, and to the persons who will enjoy its benefits, but also as an example.

3. That the Rector inquire of Col Anderson whether it will not be consistent with his intention, if the Board should, in the exercise of the discretion given by his letter of the 22d Nov. 1892 elect to establish a Fellowship, they may not provide that that the basis of election be that of merit alone.

The following resolution in reference to Mrs Linden Kent's proposition was adopted:

Resolved, that the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia accept the proposition of Mrs Linden Kent to endow a chair in the University with which the name of her late lamented husband shall be associated, and that the Chairman of the Faculty be requested to visit Mrs Kent as soon as it may be agreeable to her for the purpose of ascertaining when she will be ready to complete her donation, together with the details of her plan. The Rector and Visitors beg to thank Mrs Kent for her generous offer to the University and to express their gratification at the prospect of having linked with a chair in this institution the name of an alumnus so honored as that of her late husband.

The following was adopted:

1. Resolved that R. G. H. Kean, Esq, he requested to accompany Profr Wm M. Thornton to Washington to see Mrs Kent in regard to the establishment of the Linden Kent Profr of Eng. Lit. in the University, if in his discretion Mr Kean shall see fit so to do.

2. Resolved that Profr Thornton be empowered to invite Mr H. T. Kent to come from St Louis to Washington to attend the conference in regard to said professorship, at the expense of the University of Virginia, shall Profr Thornton in his discretion deem it advisable.

The Committee on Grounds & Buildings submitted a report which was read, approved and adopted and on motion the same was referred to the Finance Committee. The report reads as follows:

To the Rector & Board of Visitors.

The Committee on Grounds & Buildings, to whom the Report of the Superintendent of Grounds & Buildings was referred, beg leave to report.

That the various items of work ordered by the Board at its annual meeting in June appear to have been vigorously carried out, except the removal of the pavements on the Ranges, for the present postponement of which, a good reason is assigned, in the anticipated approach of unsuitable (winter) weather.

Your Committee note that in several instances the amounts appropriated have been exceeded, namely

of this aggregate, the first amount of $761.04 having been expended and paid, it is no longer open for consideration.

The reasons for constructing the new ice pond seem to have been sufficient, namely the fear that ice gathered from the former source of supply might a source of disease.

As the use of the existing ice ponds, contiguous to the old pond, would necessitate a great amount of hauling, at times when it might be impracticable to obtain teams upon any reasonable terms we consider the construction of a new ice house convenient to the new pond unavoidable, we therefore recommend the approval of the work, and the appropriation of the $1200. required for it.

Your Committee recommend the payment of $80.00 per month for efficient day and night police as the same appears to be necessary.

They are not prepared at present to recommend the employment of a foreman at $75. per month.

The Committee call the attention of the Board to the fact that the three out of four instances presented, amounts have been expended beyond the sums appropriated. In one instance the excess being more than 40% beyond the amount authorized, and that too when the appropriation provided that the sum to be expended should be "not exceeding" the amount named.

The Committee have no doubt that the money so expended was deemed to be advantageously spent, but they feel constrained to observe that that the utility of a system of Estimates and appropriations, depends entirely upon a rigid adherence to the principle, that there is no authority by which money can be expended except by the provisions authorized by the Board, or of the Executive Committee, within the limits of the functions of the latter.

In view of an unanticipated expenditure of about $2000., as above shown, and the probable failure of collection of interest on the R. & D. R. R. Bonds, this committee respectfully refer the suggestion of the Superintendent, to add $1878.54 to the General Appropriation for maintenance and Repairs to the Finance Committee.
