Borah was empowered to act for the University in giving written consent to any transaction involving selling, assigning, or transferring of any and all stocks, bonds, evidences of interest or indebtedness, rights, and options, upon receipt of a telegram of approval signed by either the Rector, the President, or the Comptroller of the University.

The President reported further that the Comptroller, Mr. Vincent Shea, had informed him that, under this arrangement, the University is spending a considerable amount of money for telegrams covering many routine authorizations, such as the disposal of stock rights received by the estate. The Comptroller had discussed this problem over the telephone with Judge Borah who is willing, on behalf of the University, to give consent in writing to any transaction not in excess of $1,000 without receiving telegraphic authorization from a University official, provided that the resolution of 8 December 1956 is amended to that effect.

The President proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution:

> RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the resolution adopted by the Board at its meeting on 8 December 1956 relating to the Vincent Estate be amended to read as follows:
>
> WHEREAS, under the will of the late Hugh E. Vincent, which was probated April 24, 1951, in the proceedings No. 304-985 of the Civil District Court of Orleans Parish, Louisiana, Mildred Saffold Vincent, his widow, was named as Usufructuary, and the University of Virginia, Tulane University and Trinity Church were named as Naked Owners of certain assets, including certain securities, which in accordance with the will have been lodged in the custody of the Whitney National Bank of New Orleans, and
>
> WHEREAS, by an agreement executed, in counterparts, by the said four parties in interest (Counterpart by the University of Virginia being executed by Vincent Shea), which agreement became effective by the lodgment of counterparts signed by all four parties in Whitney National Bank on June 7, 1956, a method of handling those securities was formulated and agreed upon, and
>
> WHEREAS, the said agreement provides for the consent of the four parties in interest to the reinvestment of capital resulting from the maturity of securities, and also for the consent of all four parties to the disposal of securities in the estate, and the reinvestment of the proceeds of those securities, and
>
> WHEREAS, because of the rapid movement in the securities market, it is essential that these consents be given without unnecessary delay, and
>
> WHEREAS, by resolution of this Board adopted December 12, 1952, and still in force, the Rector or President or the Comptroller of this corporation is authorized and empowered to sell, assign and transfer any and all stocks, bonds, evidences of interest or indebtedness, rights, and options, to acquire or to sell same and all other securities, corporate or otherwise, standing in the name of, or belonging to, this corporation in any capacity, and
>
> WHEREAS, as a courtesy to this institution the Honorable Wayne G. Borah has agreed to act for this institution in the matter giving the written consent of this institution, to any such transaction upon receipt by him of a telegram signed by either the Rector, the President or the Comptroller of this institution,
>
> NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that upon receipt by him of a telegram signed by any one of said officials authorizing such consent, the said Wayne G. Borah is hereby authorized, empowered, and directed on behalf of this institution, to consent in writing to any of the above described transactions made under the said agreement of 7 June 1956, provided that the other three parties in interest have already consented to such transactions, provided further, however, that, in the case of any transaction involving a sum not in excess of $1,000, the said Wayne G. Borah is hereby authorized, empowered, and directed on behalf of this institution to consent in writing to any such transaction made under said agreement of 7 June 1956, provided that the other three parties in interest have already consented to such transaction, without the necessity of receiving telegraphic authorization approving such transaction signed by either the Rector, the President, or the Comptroller of this institution.

The President stated that since the recruitment of faculty members extends into the summer months past the Annual Meeting of the Board in June, it had been customary for the Board to pass a resolution each year authorizing the President to employ such faculty members to be followed by formal approval by the Board at its next regular meeting in October. In order to eliminate the need for the passage of the same resolution at each meeting of the Board in June, the President proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution:

> RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the President be and he is hereby authorized to employ members of the faculty during the period between the Annual Meeting of the Board in June and the following meeting in the fall, which action will be formally approved by the Board at its next regular meeting.

The President reported that the Student Health Fee, now set at $25, would not support the present student health program. Accordingly, the University was faced with the necessity of either reducing the service or increasing the fee. The Dean of the University, the President stated, had consulted with the Student Council and its recommendation was that the fee be increased in order to maintain the present level of student health services.

The President proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution:

> RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the present student health fee of $25 be and it is hereby increased to $30, effective 1 September 1960.

The President commented in detail on the recent report of the Auditor of Public Accounts on certain financial transactions at the University Heating Plant and Clinch Valley College. A copy of the Auditor's report was ordered to be placed in the files of the Board.

The President reported on the recent gift to the University of the Morea property which the donors had requested be used as a residence for distinguished visitors to the University. In order that the use of Morea might be in conformity with the wishes of the donors, the President proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution:

> RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that, in accordance with the wishes of the donors, the property known as Morea shall be reserved for the use of distinguished visitors to the University, as assigned by the Buildings and Grounds Committee of this Board, for a period not exceeding one year.

The President read to the Board a letter received from Lady Astor, dated 20 April 1960, replying to the resolution of the Board at its meeting on 9 April 1960 expressing to her the University's best wishes on her 81st birthday.

The President prefaced his recommendations for architects to be employed on new construction at the University by reviewing the procedure for securing architects since the inauguration of the building program following World War II. He presented in detail the procedures that had been used in selecting architects for buildings now completed and for buildings currently under construction. During the course of his review he noted that President Darden in 1957 had appointed a Long-Range Planning Committee to prepare plans for the development of the University over the next 20 to 25 years. This Committee, the President stated, attempted to estimate enrollment projections for the University and to determine what buildings would be needed to provide facilities for the several schools. In addition, the Committee considered the whole problem of the selection of architects and recommended to the President that wherever possible Virginia firms be employed to design future buildings at the University and that an Architectural Advisory Committee be appointed by the President to advise him in the selection of appropriate firms.

In the spring of 1959, President Darden appointed the first Architectural Advisory Committee. This Committee made a number of recommendations to the President concerning the employment of architects and President Darden selected the architects for the buildings either now under construction or in the design stage.

Continuing his report, President Shannon stated that in the early spring of 1960 he had appointed an Architectural Advisory Committee to advise in the selection of architects for new buildings for which appropriations had been made by the 1960 General Assembly. Based on the report of that Committee, the President recommended (1) Baskervill and Son of Richmond, Virginia, for the Field House, (2) Rawlings and Wilson of Richmond, Virginia, for the Civil Engineering Addition, and (3) Oliver and Smith of Norfolk, Virginia, for the Science Building at Clinch Valley College. The President noted further that his recommendation for the Field House was based on the assumption that a mutually agreeable working relationship could be arranged to bring in as associates on the Field House, the firm of Anderson, Beckwith and Haible of Boston. Likewise, the President noted that his recommendation of Oliver and Smith for the Science Building at Clinch Valley College was based on the assumption that C. B. McElroy of Wise, Virginia, be associated as resident architect. He concluded by noting that he had no recommendation concerning the Chemistry Building at this time but would be prepared in the fall to recommend an architect for that project.

In order that there might be no delay, the President further recommended that, in the event one or more of the firms selected could not undertake the project, he be authorized to secure the approval of the Buildings and Grounds Committee and the Executive Committee of the Board for the designation of an alternate architectural firm or firms.

The President proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution:

> RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the President be and he is hereby authorized to employ the architectural firms listed for the following projects:
>
> 1. Field House - Baskervill and Son, Richmond, Virginia (provided that a mutually agreeable working relationship can be arranged to bring in as associates the firm of Anderson, Beckwith and Haible of Boston),
> 2. Civil Engineering Addition - Rawlings and Wilson, Richmond, Virginia, and
> 3. Science Building at Clinch Valley College - Oliver and Smith, Norfolk, Virginia (provided that a mutually agreeable arrangement can be made for associating C. B. McElroy of Wise, Virginia, as the resident architect),
>
> AND BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that, in the event the services of one or more of these firms cannot be obtained, the President be and he is hereby authorized to submit an alternate firm or firms to the Buildings and Grounds Committee and the Executive Committee which are hereby authorized to take final action.

The President reported on the recent gift of Mr. Clifton Waller Barrett of his collection on American Literature to Alderman Library. Following this report, the President proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution:

> RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the President convey to Mr. Clifton Waller Barrett both our corporate thanks for his gift of The Barrett Library, which was dedicated and opened to use on 30 April 1960, and a sense of our individual admiration for and pride in him as Alumnus and educator.
>
> Like our Founder and first Rector, whose last day at the University was spent overseeing the cataloguing of the books he had purchased for it, Mr. Barrett has dedicated himself with single-minded devotion to the assembling of great books as the indispensable foundation of a great University.
>
> Hailed by the press as the largest gift ever received by the University during the lifetime of the donor, The Barrett Library is in fact made priceless as a result of this donor's quarter century of creative work for the sake of his beloved University.
>
> Not money alone, but industry and wisdom have made Mr. Barrett's collection of books and manuscripts without a superior in the field of American Literature. Fittingly, this library is now housed beside the McGregor Library of books and manuscripts in American History, for these two collections make the University of Thomas Jefferson a true center for American Studies.
>
> RESOLVED, FURTHER, that we individually salute Mr. Barrett with esteem and with respect. May his great and still-growing collection indeed become the "seed pearl" for library growth that shall in time give the University the materials needed for similar distinction in English literature and in other areas of human experience and knowledge.
>
> RESOLVED, FURTHER, that a copy of this resolution be sent to Mr. Barrett, to the Editor of the Alumni News, and to the Trustees of the McGragor Fund.

The President reported on the recent gift by the American Cancer Society to support the teaching and research of Dr. Vincent Hollander of the School of Medicine.

The President reported that, in view of the gift of the American Cancer Society for the support of the teaching and research of Dr. Vincent Hollander, it was necessary for the Board of Visitors to establish the chair to be known as the American Cancer Society Professor of Internal Medicine. Accordingly, the President proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution:

> RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that there is hereby established a chair in the School of Medicine to be known as the American Cancer Society Professor of Internal Medicine.

The President presented a detailed report on the current status of the admission of students to the University for the academic year 1960-1961.

The President proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution:

> RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the Hospital Accounts Committee be and it is hereby authorized to charge off as uncollectible accounts Schedules 905, 906, 909, 910, 913, 914, 917, 918, 920, 921, 924, 925, 927, 928, 931 and 932, aggregating $184, 913.68, as recommended by it, consisting of the following.

The Chairman of the Finance Committee, Mr. McWane, submitted for the Board's consideration the proposed 1960-1961 University Budget, copies of which had been previously mailed to each member of the Board. Mr. McWane reported that the Finance Committee had met with the President and the Comptroller on 26 May 1960 for a detailed review of the proposed budget and that the Finance Committee, at the conclusion of its meeting, had unanimously approved the budget as recommended. Accordingly, he proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution:

> RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the proposed 1960-1961 University Budget as recommended by the President and as approved by the Finance Committee be and it is hereby approved.

The President presented for the Board's consideration a proposed change in the TIAA Annuity Plan for faculty members. Under the program now existing, the President explained, the University and the faculty member each contributes 5 per cent of the annual salary. Under the proposed plan, the University would contribute 15 per cent of each faculty member's salary in excess of the first $4,800. The faculty member's contribution would remain unchanged at 5 per cent. The President further noted that the proposed change would not affect the annuity plan now in existence for the Clinical Medical faculty as approved by the Board at its meeting on 13 June 1959 (Minutes, Board of Visitors, University of Virginia, No. 12, 13 June 1959, page 157). The net additional cost would amount to $65,000 per year. The necessary action, the President concluded, was an amendment to a resolution adopted by the Board at its meeting in February 1938 (Minutes, Board of Visitors, University of Virginia, No. 10, 22 February 1938, page 289).

After discussion, the President proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution:

> RESOLVED by The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that beginning with the session of 1938-1939 it shall be compulsory for all administrative officers of the University and all professors of every grade to pay respectively five per cent (5%) of their salary as received to the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America, until he reaches his sixty-fifth birthday, each such payment to be matched by an amount to be paid by the University equal to fifteen per cent (15%) of the salary in excess of $4,800. The salary shall not include salaries received for summer teaching nor payments made in excess of the regular faculty salary schedule for administrative duties.
>
> Nothing in this resolution shall be construed (1) to modify the actions taken by this Board at its meetings on 14 June 1958 and 13 June 1959, or (2) to deprive any faculty member of the rights available to him under the provisions of the Virginia Supplemental Retirement Act as set forth in Article 3, Chapter 3.2, Title 51, of the Code of Virginia, 1950, as amended.

At the meeting of the Finance Committee on 26 May 1960, the President reported that the late Miss Vivian Louise Aunspaugh of Dallas had bequeathed to the University certain property located in Dallas, which had been tentatively estimated to be worth approximately $40,000. Under the laws of Texas this property cannot be held by the University but must be sold. Moreover, the President noted, it would be necessary to pay inheritance taxes levied against the bequest by the State of Texas.

With the approval of the Finance Committee, the President recommended and the Board adopted the following resolution:

> RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the Finance Committee be and it is hereby authorized to dispose of the property located in Dallas, Texas, bequeathed to the University of Virginia by Miss Vivian Louise Aunspaugh, and that the Comptroller of the University be and he is hereby authorized to pay inheritance taxes levied against the bequest by the State of Texas.

The President reported that he had discussed with the Finance Committee at its meeting on 26 May 1960 the possible availability of the Murray Property which consists of 11 1/2 acres adjacent to the property now owned by the University at Copeley Hill. This property, he stated, could be put to good use as the University expanded. The President reported further that the proposal had been approved by the Finance Committee at its meeting on 26 May 1960.

The President proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution:

> RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the President be and he is hereby authorized to purchase the Murray Property consisting of 11 1/2 acres adjacent to Copeley Hill at a price which the Finance Committee of this Board deems fair and reasonable.

The President reported that one and one-half acres of land now owned by Mrs. Gilbert W. Farish was available for purchase and that the land could be put to good use for parking purposes for the University Hospital. He stated, moreover, that funds were available in the Rucker Endowment Fund for the University Hospital for the purchase of this property.

The President proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution:

> RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the President be and he is hereby authorized to purchase the property of approximately one and one-half acres in size located on Fifteenth Street, Southwest, in Charlottesville, now owned by Mrs. Gilbert W. Farish for an amount not to exceed $30,000 to be paid from the Rucker Endowment Fund for the University Hospital.

The President reported that the Dean of the University, Mr. B. F. D. Runk, had recommended to him that all student loan funds over which the Board of Visitors has the power to set the conditions of the loan should follow the uniform practice, now prevailing for National Defense Student Loans, of requiring that interest should begin on the loan one calendar year after the student borrowing the funds had terminated his status in the University. The President proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution:

> RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that in the case of all loans to students from loan funds for which the Board of Visitors sets the conditions of the loan, the loan shall begin to bear interest one calendar year following the termination of the borrower's status as a student in the University.

The President stated further that the Dean of the University had recommended to him that additional loan funds could be used very effectively by the Scholarship Committee in the case of students who do not qualify, because of their academic records, for a full scholarship award on the basis of academic standing alone. If loan funds should be made available, the Scholarship Committee could conserve the funds available for scholarships.

The President proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution:

> RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that, subject to the approval of the President, an amount not to exceed $10,000 of the income of the du Pont Scholarship Fund may be used annually for loans to students.

The President reported on the organizational arrangements for the operation of Newcomb Hall and on his plan to authorize the operation of a student supply store in Newcomb Hall.

So far as the organizational arrangements were concerned, the President stated that the Director of Newcomb Hall is appointed by the President. In turn, the President appoints a Student Union Advisory Committee, composed both of faculty and administrative personnel, to propose policy for the approval of the Dean of the University and the President. In the organizational structure, the Student Union Advisory Committee reports to the President through the Dean of the University. The Director of Newcomb Hall carries out policies proposed by the Student Union Advisory Committee and approved by the President. The President pointed out, however, that the Director had access to the President, in company with the Dean of the University, on matters which the Director feels he should bring directly to the President's attention.

Recently, the President stated, the Student Union Advisory Committee had recommended to him the establishment of a supply store in Newcomb Hall to make conveniently accessible to students such items as tooth paste, shoe polish, blue books, a small selection of stationery and note-keeping material, a limited number of magazines, etc. The President stated further that, after considerable study, he proposed to approve this recommendation with the clear understanding that the supply store would provide a restricted number of items directly related to student use. The President concluded by noting that he would review this operation at the end of one year.

The President reported that Mrs. Theodore Hough had exercised her option to remain in the residence on McCormick Road for the rest of her life as provided in Dr. Theodore Hough's lease with the University dated 1 June 1910.

The President reported that the 1960 General Assembly had authorized The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia to borrow funds from either Federal or private sources for the construction of apartment houses for married students and dormitories. In view of the prospect that no Federal funds would be available, the President recommended the passage of a resolution which would authorize him to borrow either from Federal or from private sources at the best interest rates available.

After discussion, the President proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution:

> WHEREAS, under the provisions of Chapter 410 of the Acts of Assembly of Virginia, 1960, The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia were authorized to borrow funds from the United States or any agency thereof or from any other source for the purpose of building not exceeding twelve apartment houses to house one hundred twenty married students, at a total cost not to exceed $1,200,000 and to issue revenue bonds for the repayment of said loan which bonds shall be payable from the revenue derived from rentals received from students occupying such apartments, provided, however, that the Commonwealth of Virginia shall not at any time be required to provide funds for the operation or maintenance of said apartments. The Act further provided
>
> 1. That the full faith and credit of the State shall not be pledged to secure in any way any such bonds,
>
> 2. That the construction shall be in accordance with the Manual for the Planning and Execution of Capital Outlays, Commonwealth of Virginia,
>
> 3. That priority in the assignment of these apartments shall be given the residents of Virginia;
>
> 4. That Chapter 3 of Title 23 of the Code of Virginia, as now or hereafter amended, shall be complied with in all respects in such transactions, and,
>
> WHEREAS, under the provisions of Chapter 425 of the Acts of Assembly of Virginia, 1960, The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia were authorized to borrow funds from the United States or any agency thereof or from any other source for the purpose of building not exceeding seven dormitories to house one hundred twenty students each at a total cost not to exceed $3,000,000 and to issue revenue bonds for the repayment of said loan which bonds shall be solely payable from the revenue derived from rentals received from students occupying such dormitories, with the same provisos as those contained in Chapter 410 and hereinabove set forth, and,
>
> WHEREAS, The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, deeming it of prime importance, desires to take the necessary steps without delay toward the erection of said twelve apartment houses and seven dormitories, and the borrowing of the necessary funds with which to erect the same, and,
>
> WHEREAS, undue delay may be caused by the fact that the next regular meeting of the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia will not be held until October, 1960,
>
> NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, a corporation created and existing under the laws of the State of Virginia, that Vincent Shea, Comptroller of said body corporate, be and he is hereby authorized and empowered to make, in the name and on behalf of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, application or applications to the United States, to the Federal Housing and Home Finance Agency, or to any other agency of the United States, and file the same, for loan assistance, under Title IV of the Housing Act of 1950, as it may now or hereafter be amended, or under any similar Act, in the amount of $1,200,000 for the erection at the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia, of twelve apartment houses to house one hundred twenty married students, and in the amount of $3,000,000 for the erection at the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia, of seven dormitories to house one hundred twenty students each, such application or applications to be subject to the provisions and limitations set forth in said Chapters 410 and 425 of the Acts of Assembly, 1960, hereinabove set forth.

Upon further consideration the following resolution was adopted:

> BE IT RESOLVED, that, in the event funds shall not be available from the United States or any agency thereof for such purposes, the Finance Committee of this Board be and it is hereby authorized and empowered to negotiate upon such terms and conditions, and to take such steps and do such acts, as it may deem necessary or requisite, to borrow funds from sources other than the United States or any agency thereof for purposes hereinabove set forth.

The President reported that the National Science Foundation had indicated that it would make a grant of $60,000 to assist the University in the purchase of a computer and the installation and operation of a computer center. He pointed out that the reason for the failure to obtain a National Science Foundation grant in the past had been lack of experience in the operation of a computer center. Further, he stated that this was probably the best arrangement that could be made and he therefore recommended and the Board adopted the following resolution:

> WHEREAS, the National Science Foundation has offered the University of Virginia a grant of $60,000 to assist in the purchase of a computer and the installation and operation of a computer center, the total cost of which, over a three-year period, will amount to $210,000
>
> NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that it agrees to accept the offer of the National Science Foundation and to provide not to exceed $150,000 from unappropriated surplus to cover the additional cost of the computer and the operation of the computer center for three years.

The President stated that the following item on the Docket next below would be a proposed new salary scale for full professors. As explained below, the President stated that the new salary scale for full professors could be supported for the academic year 1960-1961 from other sources but that it would be necessary, beginning 1 September 1961, to provide a tuition increase for the support of the new plan.

The President proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution:

> RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the tuition for all schools of the University be increased $20 for residents of Virginia and $45 for out-of-state students, effective 1 September 1961.

The President reported that he had discussed with the Finance Committee at its meeting on 26 May a proposed new salary scale for full professors. He pointed out that the new salary scale authorized by the Governor and the Board a year ago had not obtained the salary scale for full professors which had been sought. The President stated that he had been in consultation with the Governor and the Division of Personnel on this proposal and that he had been assured by the Director of the Budget that approval would be given to the proposed new salary scale for full professors. For the academic year 1960-1961, the scale would be supported from funds available from unfilled vacancies and from an extra dividend which the University had received. (Subsequently, the Governor approved the new scale in a letter dated 10 June 1960).

The President proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution:

> RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the following faculty salary scale, to apply to all members of the faculty except those in the School of Nursing and in Clinical Medicine, is hereby approved, subject to the approval of the Governor, effective 1 September 1960.

**Special Approval**

The President reported that the Buildings and Grounds Committee, at its meeting on 9 June 1960, had considered at length the present policy of the Board of Visitors with respect to the assignment of pavilions, hotels, and residences on the Grounds to members of the faculty. The Committee had noted that the present policy was established by the Board in 1953 (Minutes, Board of Visitors, University of Virginia, No. 11, 9 January 1953, page 274) and that a number of schools had been established since that time along with the position of Chancellor for Community Colleges. Accordingly, the Buildings and Grounds Committee proposed, and the Board adopted the following resolution:

> RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the Buildings and Grounds Committee of this Board, in its assignment of pavilions, hotels, and residences to members of the faculty, shall be governed by the following policy:
>
> That housing upon the Lawn, the Ranges, Monroe Hill, and the Dawson's Row area, as available in the future for assignment to members of the faculty, be assigned upon the following basis:
>
> (a) The Deans of each school (excepting Deans who are not full professors) and the Chancellor for Community Colleges shall have first priority according to the seniority of their respective schools or office.
>
> (b) Subject to (a),
