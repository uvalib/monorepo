The biennial budget as presented to the legislature was based on an increase in student fees. This increase was projected for the following reasons: (1) to provide additional funds for instructional purposes; (2) to provide sufficient funds for the auxiliary enterprises to operate on a self-sustaining basis; (3) to provide additional needed funds for student activities; and (4) to increase the tuition charge paid by out-of-state students whereby the out-of-state student will bear an increased share of the cost of instruction.

It is proposed to increase general college fees $35.00, residential fee $14.00, student activity fee $6.00, and non-Virginia tuition $100.00. These increases in fees are proposed to be effective 1 September 1966.

## REMOVAL OF CITY RESERVOIR FROM COLLEGE CAMPUS

The City Reservoir has for many years been located on the College campus south of George Washington Hall. In 1956 the Board of Visitors approved the purchase of the reservoir from the City, deeding the City approximately seven acres of land where the National Guard Armory is now located. The College retained possession of the property until such time as the City provided a reservoir in another location. This was completed about two months ago. The previous location of the reservoir is the proposed location for Thomas Jefferson Hall to be constructed during the next year.

The City volunteered to grade the area. The reservoir had a mound of earth around it approximately ten feet high with concrete on the inside and a concrete floor which caused the demolition to be a time-consuming and expensive project.

The following resolution was therefore adopted: RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that we wish to express our appreciation to the City Council of the City of Fredericksburg for its splendid cooperation in grading the site at Mary Washington College, from which the old city reservoir has recently been removed by the City to another location; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Secretary be and he is hereby directed to send a copy of this resolution to the City of Fredericksburg as a mark of the close and cordial relations between the City and Mary Washington College.

## EASEMENT TO COUNTY OF STAFFORD

The President reported the County of Stafford was desirous of obtaining an easement for a water pumping station and necessary water lines over the property known as "Belmont" situated in said County and had approached the authorities of Mary Washington College for a grant of such easement. Upon investigation it was ascertained title to "Belmont" was in the Commonwealth of Virginia and that an Act of the General Assembly would be necessary to authorize such grant on behalf of the Commonwealth. The President informed the Board that an Act for this purpose was passed in the 1966 session of the General Assembly and is now in force. Such Act authorizes the Governor and Secretary of the Commonwealth, upon resolution of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia requesting the same, to grant and convey such easement on behalf of the Commonwealth of Virginia to the Board of Supervisors of Stafford County, such easement to be for such term and upon such conditions and for such purposes as might be prescribed by the resolution of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia. The President stated the authorities of Mary Washington College had approved the granting of such easement.

After consideration and discussion, upon motion duly made and seconded, it was,

RESOLVED, that The Rector and Visitors of the University request the Governor and the Secretary of the Commonwealth, on behalf of the Commonwealth of Virginia, to grant and convey, in a form approved by the Attorney General, to the Board of Supervisors of Stafford County, Virginia, a perpetual easement for the purpose of constructing, operating and maintaining a water pumping station and necessary water lines thereto extending from the main water line to said pumping station, over the property situated in Stafford County, Virginia, owned by the Commonwealth of Virginia, which was acquired by deed from Corinne Lawton Melchers, dated the 17th day of February, 1942, and fully set forth in Chapter 437 of the Acts of the General Assembly of 1942, said easement being described as follows:

Beginning at a point N 40° 10' E 73 feet from the northeast corner of the Rights of Way of State Route No. 1001 and State Route No. 1012, thence N 49° 50' W a distance of 34 feet; thence N 40° 10' E a distance of 34 feet, thence S 49° 50' E a distance of 34 feet; thence S 40° 10' W a distance of 34 feet to the point of beginning, being a lot containing .0265 acres.

2. The water lines shall at all points be well below the surface of the ground so that the growth of vegetation above them may not be impaired; that after digging the trenches for said water lines, or upon any reopening thereof for purposes of maintenance, repair, replacement or enlargement of said water lines, the County of Stafford shall re-fill and pack the ground thoroughly, and re-turf the same to the end that there will be no subsequent sinking to impair the contour of the surface;

3. All trees, shrubbery and grass, as far as possible, shall be protected during the course of the operations, either of initial construction or subsequent repair of said water lines and water pumping station, and if it be necessary to move any shrubs or turf said County will replace them as before; and generally leave the premises in the same condition in which they were found;

4. In the exercise by said County of its rights to construct, repair and maintain said water lines and pumping station, said County, its agents and servants, shall at all times perform their operations in such a manner as to disrupt as little as possible the order and routine of the property belonging to the Commonwealth;

5. Should the Commonwealth or any State institution or department for whose benefit the Commonwealth holds title to said property conveyed to it by said deed of Corinne Lawton Melchers, dated February 17, 1942, deem it necessary, in its sole discretion, for any purpose, said water pumping station and water lines easements, either or both, shall be relocated and re-routed to another location, the expense of such relocation and re-routing to be borne by said County.
