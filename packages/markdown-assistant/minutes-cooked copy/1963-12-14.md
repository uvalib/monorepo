### Section 605.

The Board covenants that from and after the time when the contractors or any of them engaged in constructing the Project or any part thereof shall cease to be responsible, pursuant to the provisions of the respective contracts for the construction of the Project or such part, for loss or damage to the Project or such part occurring from fire or lightning, it will insure and at all times keep the Project or such part insured with a responsible insurance company or companies, qualified to assume the risk thereof, against physical loss or damage caused by fire or lightning, with such exceptions as are ordinarily required by insurers of structures or facilities of similar type, in an amount not less than eighty percent (80%) of the replacement value of the Project or such part, less depreciation, provided, however, that such amount of insurance shall at all times be sufficient to comply with any legal or contractual requirement which, if breached, would result in assumption by the Board of a portion of any loss or damages as a co-insurer, and such insurance may provide for the deduction from each claim for loss or damage (except in case of a total loss) of not more than two percent (2%) of the total amount of insurance required by the application of the co-insurance clause, and provided, further, that if at any time the Board shall be unable to obtain such insurance to the extent above required, either as to amount of such insurance or as to the risks covered thereby or the deductible provision thereof, it will not constitute an event of default under the provisions of this resolution if the Board shall carry such insurance to the extent reasonably obtainable.

If such proceeds are more than sufficient for such purpose, the balance remaining shall be deposited to the credit of the Sinking Fund.

The President reported that the resolution authorizing the issuance of $1,200,000, The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia Student Apartment Buildings Revenue Bonds, which was adopted by the Board on 29 September 1962 (Minutes, Board of Visitors, University of Virginia, No. 12, 29 September 1962, pp. 353-360), requires the Board to fix, charge, and collect fees, rents, and charges in such amounts as may be necessary to provide the funds necessary to support the operating expenses of the project and to amortize the bonds.

Accordingly, the President proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution:

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the rental charges per month for the Copeley Hill Apartments be and they are hereby established as set forth below, effective 1 September 1963.

The President reported on the Roanoke Center of the School of General Studies, and the advisability of developing it into a branch, coordinated with other institutions of higher learning in the area.

The President proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution:

WHEREAS the consultants to the Virginia Department of Highways have recommended a southern route, known as Line C in their report, for the location of Interstate Highway 64 in Albemarle County and Charlottesville,

AND WHEREAS this route appears to be in the best interests of the University of Virginia for its future growth and development,

NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that we endorse the southern route as the most appropriate location for Interstate Highway 64 and urge its selection by the Virginia Department of Highways.

Mr. Montague proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution:

WHEREAS our fellow Visitor, Charles R. Fenwick, is unavoidably absent from this meeting,

BE IT RESOLVED that we have missed his wise and thoughtful counsel in our deliberations, his experience and good judgment in our decisions, his warm and friendly presence in our moments of relaxation,

RESOLVED FURTHER that the Secretary convey to him our appreciation for his always generous share in all our tasks, our confidence in his leadership, our high regard for him as a friend, and the lively pleasure with which we look forward to having him with us when we next meet.

In the absence of the Chancellor, the Bursar proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution:

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the following person be and she is hereby elected to the faculty of Mary Washington College:

* Miss Margaret Nolan as Instructor in Health, Physical Education, and Recreation, for one semester, effective 1 February 1964, at a salary of $2,650.

In the absence of the Chancellor, the Bursar proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution:

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the following faculty member be and she is hereby granted leave of absence:

* Miss Margery Arnold, Associate Professor of Health, Physical Education, and Recreation, for one semester, with half pay, effective 1 February 1964, to continue advanced study at the University of Maryland toward the Ph.D. degree.

The Bursar reported that the vacant property on Sunken Road, immediately opposite the entrance to Brompton, has been recently sold to Mr. Russell Sullivan, who plans to construct an apartment building on the property. This type of building, the Bursar stated, would present an unattractive condition in this particular location because of the historic value of the property, which is bounded on the Sunken Road side by the historic stone wall which was standing at the time of the Civil War. The Director of the Budget was consulted to see if funds could be made available for the purchase of the property. He authorized Mary Washington College to offer up to $15,000, to be paid from the Governor's Contingency Fund, for the property, subject to the approval of the President of the University and the Governor. The President of the University approved this proposed purchase.

At the present time there is no definite commitment from the owner of the property that he will sell the property. However, he has left the Bursar with the impression that he would accept $1,000 more than he had paid for the property, or about $14,200, provided he can obtain another location for the construction of his proposed apartment building.

Accordingly, in the absence of the Chancellor, the Bursar proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution:

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that Mary Washington College be and it is hereby authorized to purchase the vacant property on Sunken Road, immediately opposite the entrance to Brompton, for a sum not to exceed $15,000, subject to the approval of the Governor, provided, however, that the form of the purchase agreement shall be subject to the approval of Special Counsel of the University.

The Bursar reported that he has been informed by the City Attorney of Fredericksburg that the contractual agreement for an easement to be granted to the City for the relocation of the City Reservoir from its present location to a designated location on the College golf course was approved by the City Council at its regular meeting on Tuesday, 10 December 1963. When the University's Special Counsel has completed his review of the agreement, the instrument will then be ready for the President's signature under the authority of the resolution adopted by the Board on 20 April 1963 (Minutes, Board of Visitors, University of Virginia, No. 12, 20 April 1963, p. 399).

The President proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution:

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the President be and he is hereby authorized to request the Governor to authorize Clinch Valley College to incur a deficit not to exceed $15,000 for the fiscal year ending 30 June 1964.

The Board adopted the following resolution:

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the Eastern Shore Branch of the School of General Studies be established and that the President be and he is hereby authorized and directed to take all necessary legal steps to secure its establishment.

The President proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution:

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that we approve a change in status of the Patrick Henry Branch of the School of General Studies to the Patrick Henry College of the University of Virginia and that the President be and he is hereby authorized and directed to take all necessary legal steps to secure this change in status.

On motion the meeting was then adjourned at 12:45 p.m.

Subject to the provisions and in accordance with the terms of the resolutions duly adopted by the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia on December 14, 1963, which resolutions are hereby made a part of this bid, we offer to pay \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Dollars ($ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_), plus accrued interest from February 1, 1964 to the date of delivery, for all, but no part less than all, of $1,200,000 The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia Field House and Gymnasium Revenue Bonds (Series 1964), dated as of February 1, 1964, bearing interest at the rate of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_% per annum.

We enclose herewith a certified or bank cashier's or treasurer's check for $24,000 payable to the order of the State Treasurer of the State of Virginia, which check is to be applied in accordance with the resolution providing for the sale of the bonds duly adopted by the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia on December 14, 1963.

Over the past two years, the above committee has examined an impressive mass of evidence relating to the functioning of the Honor System at the University of Virginia. This investigation was undertaken after my son, Henry S. Haight, Jr. was dismissed from the University under circumstances that were, in the judgement of this committee, predudicial \[sic] to the best interest of the student and the student government at the University.

It is respectfully requested that the Board of Visitors submit this case to a committee to be appointed by the Governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia. Such a committee would be given full access to the files of this committee and full cooperation would be given by the committee which has gathered evidence in other disciplinary cases that cast reflection on the administration of justice under the present Honor System.

Kindly inform me at the earliest practicable date what action the Board of Visitors proposes to take on this request.
