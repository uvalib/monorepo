A special meeting of the Rector and Visitors was held on this date to consider revising the request of the University to the Public Works Administration for loan and grant for the erection and equipping of a new library building and for providing the necessary loan therefor from sources other than from the Federal Government, and for such other matters as may come before the meeting.

There were present the Rector, Fred W. Scott, Visitors Goolrick, Corbitt, Rinehart, Hall, Garnett, Stuart, Williams, Lewis C. and R. Gray Williams, and President Newcomb.

The President stated, in connection with the University's application for loan and grant from the Public Works Administration for erecting and equipping a new library, that it was the general impression that no grant would be made by the said Administration where a loan was also required of the Federal Government, but if the amount required in the nature of a loan could be had from other sources it might be possible to secure the necessary grant. He further reported that after consultation with the Rector, arrangements had been made with the Wilmington Trust Company, of Wilmington, Delaware, for a loan of $400,000 @ 4% interest, and with Scott and Stringfellow for a loan of $123,000 @ 4% interest, making a total of $523,000 required by the Public Works Administration to secure a grant of $427,909.00.

In view of the foregoing statement, the following motion by Mr. Garnett, seconded by Mr. Stuart, was adopted:

IT IS RESOLVED by the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that its President, John Lloyd Newcomb be and he is hereby authorized and directed to change the pending application for loan and grant to the Public Works Administration, for $950,909, for the construction and equipment of a new Library Building, to a grant of $427,909.

The following motion with reference to the proposed loans was made by Mr. Goolrick and seconded by Mr. Corbitt and adopted:

RESOLVED, that from the unrestricted funds of the University, the Finance Committee be and is hereby authorized to set aside and from time to time as may be required to pay over to the Bursar for the use of the Building Committee, the sum of $523,000 or so much thereof as may be necessary to be used in temporarily financing the construction and equipment of the New Library Building, which sum, together with the grant of $427,909 from the United States of America, is estimated to be sufficient to pay the entire cost of such construction and equipment, all of which advancements shall be repaid to the unrestricted fund account of the University, with interest at 4% as and when the bonds issued under the provisions of the Acts of Assembly of Virginia, approved September 7th, 1933, and all amendments and extensions thereof, are sold and paid for.

And be it FURTHER RESOLVED that the offer of the Wilmington Trust Company to purchase $400,000 face value of said bonds as set out in resolution of the Trust Estates Committee of its Board of Directors, adopted June 25th, 1936, copy of which has been presented to this meeting, be and is hereby accepted.

And be it FURTHER RESOLVED that the offer of Scott and Stringfellow to purchase $123,000 face value of said bonds at par be and is hereby accepted.

The President was authorized to make a contract with R. E. L. Taylor for plans and specifications for the new library building as the development of the project may justify.

George O. Ferguson, Jr., Chairman of the Students' Admission Application Committee, appointed at a meeting of the Board on June 8th, 1936, under provisions of chapter 352 of the Acts of the General Assembly of 1936, reported that admission had been denied to the following qualified students to enter the graduate department of the University; that they had made arrangements to enter the schools and to receive the amounts as shown:

The foregoing report was approved.

The meeting then adjourned.
