## REPORT BY CHANCELLOR JOSEPH C. SMIDDY OF CLINCH VALLEY COLLEGE

Chancellor Smiddy outlined the history of Clinch Valley College from its opening in 1954 to the present. At this time the College enrolls 743 full time and 278 part time students. Forty percent of the present students reside at least 300 miles from the campus.

The faculty is divided into four divisions: Education, Humanities, Mathematics and Science, and Professional and Social Sciences. Chancellor Smiddy expressed satisfaction with the high caliber of the instructional staff of the College. He observed that there is a continuing study being made of opportunities for the College to serve Southwestern Virginia. The State Council of Higher Education has approved an Environmental Science Program to provide for the training of specialists in the field of surface mine reclamation and for training in other environmental areas. Under consideration is a program of training in mine management for both surface and deep mines.

Mr. Smiddy requested assistance in two areas. One of these was what he regards as a low faculty salary average. He expressed hope that this can be improved. He also regards as a serious problem the difficulty in maintaining fine arts and language programs within the State's present "Full Time Equivalent" funding policy.

Referring to the relationship of the Board of Visitors to Clinch Valley College, he expressed need for a local Board. He said that many of our programs are suffering because the College has no board to help raise needed funds to supplement state funds for high quality academic programs.

He concluded with an expression of appreciation for the leadership provided by the very capable administrators at the University of Virginia. He said that the University has always responded with assistance when needs for it were made known. He expressed pride in the graduates who have returned as professionals in the area. He is confident that Clinch Valley College has been an important factor in helping Southwest Virginia take its rightful place among the great areas of the Commonwealth.

The Rector thanked Mr. Smiddy for his thoughtful report.

## REPORT ON CONSTRUCTION

A report on construction was distributed. Phase II of the Law School and the Scott Stadium expansion projects are scheduled for completion in September of this year.

## REPORT ON LEGISLATIVE MATTERS

The President made a brief report on legislative matters. He pointed out that it would be necessary to request special legislation to provide for the operation of the Blue Ridge facility by the University.

## REPORT ON LITIGATION

The Legal Adviser, George G. Grattan, IV, presented an information report on litigation in which the University has an interest.

## REPORT ON MILLER CENTER MATTERS

The President reported on the status of the White Burkett Miller Center of Public Affairs. He advised the Board that there was an initial 2.5 million dollar gift from Mr. Burkett Miller. Additional properties were held in escrow pending either the raising of matching funds for the 2.5 million dollar gift, or the death of Mr. Miller. Mr. Miller died in January of 1977. Later the escrowed properties were transferred to the University. The Tonya Foundation made certain suggestions relative to the composition of the Miller Center Council and related matters.

On recommendation of the Finance Committee, the Board of Visitors instructed President Frank L. Hereford, Jr., to refer these suggestions to the Burkett Miller Center Council for study, and to request the Council to advise the Board of Visitors with respect to the suggestions.

## AMENDMENT TO TIAA/CREF RETIREMENT PLAN APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF VISITORS ON JANUARY 22, 1977

## DISCUSSION OF EXPANDING BOARD'S SCHEDULE TO PROVIDE FOR MORE TIME TO DISCUSS ATHLETIC MATTERS

Mr. Lawrence Lewis expressed his concern that the Board of Visitors was unable, with its present scheduling policy, to provide adequate time to discuss athletic matters. He proposed that the Student Affairs and Athletics Committee be divided, and that one division of the Committee should deal exclusively with athletic affairs. Mr. William Dudley endorsed Mr. Lewis' suggestion. Mr. French expressed hope that any such reorganization would not change the present relationship between athletics and academic affairs at the University.

Following discussion, it was agreed that at the March meetings there will be a special meeting of the Student Affairs and Athletics Committee in addition to its regular meeting, and the special meeting will deal exclusively with athletic matters.

The student media representatives shall serve a one year term.

A chairman shall be chosen by the Media Board from among the school representatives who have served one year.

If, prior to the consideration of any adjudicative matter, a challenge is made that one or more members of the Media Board should be excused because of conflicts in interest, the challenge shall be decided upon by a majority vote of the unchallenged members of the Media Board, and when required, substitute members shall be selected by a majority vote; provided that if a majority of the members are challenged, the Student Activities Committee shall act upon the challenge and, if upheld, it shall select substitute members.

The Media Board of Directors may at its discretion elect to have a consultant or advisor from the faculty or staff of the University who should be selected in consultation with the Vice President for Student Affairs, and who would serve ex officio and with no vote.

The purpose of the Media Board of Directors shall be to promote the highest standards of journalism in the operation of student publications and broadcast media under its supervision, to guarantee their freedom and independence, and to insure that those publications are responsive to the concerns of the University community.

The Media Board of Directors shall insure that the student media abide by a code of journalistic ethics and responsibilities and carry out their functions in a manner consistent with the aims and objectives of the University. The Media Board of Directors shall above all require that the media organizations provide outlets for news and opinion in a spirit of fairness, decency and truthfulness.

In addition to the powers necessary to fulfill its purposes, the Media Board shall have the authority to review budgets and requests for operating funds from Student Media organizations subject to its jurisdiction, which do not take part in the Student Council allocation procedures, and to make recommendations to the Student Activities Committee for final consideration and action.

The Media Board shall also have the authority to receive complaints, to make such investigations as may be necessary, to conduct hearings to determine the validity of complaints, to make determinations as to what, if any, corrective action is required, and to implement such corrective action.

In the implementation of corrective action the Media Board may establish general policies; it shall not engage in censorship (i.e., prior restraint), and it shall not recommend the publication or broadcast of specific information except: (1) in the case of public censure,(2) as may be necessary to correct factual errors in previously published or broadcast information, and(3) notices of public meetings of the Media Board. In the enforcement of its directives the Media Board shall be limited to the following actions against the officers and members of the managing boards of student media organizations under its supervision: (1) Private censure and public censure published by all student news media, both actions determined by a majority vote of the membership of the Media Board;(2) Removal from position, determined by a vote of nine of the fourteen members of the Media Board.

Regular meetings of the Media Board shall be held not less than once during each month of the academic year. To qualify as a regular meeting, a majority of the members shall be present. A vote of a majority of the members present shall be sufficient to decide any matter other than the challenge of a member and the censure or removal of an officer or member of the managing board of a student news media organization.

The Media Board of Directors shall submit to the President written reports of its activities at the end of each regular session semester. As a separate section of the report, the Media Board shall include a summary of its periodic inspection and review of student operated radio stations. It shall make other reports as necessary.

The Media Board shall adopt a constitution and by-laws consistent with this directive and the requirements of due process. The Constitution shall include a reasonable code of ethics and responsibilities. The Media Board shall solicit the views of all student media organizations and other interested individuals in promulgating that code.

The Media Board shall be composed of ten students appointed by the presidents of the several Schools of the University. The term of appointment will be for two years, with terms being staggered so that five members end their terms one year and five the next.

Each of the members shall be appointed no later than the fall of their next to last school year before graduation. Persons who have served during the present academic year on a media organization staff or who have a perceivable conflict of interest are to be excluded from appointment. Vacancies in the unexpired term of any School shall be filled within thirty days through appointment by the president representing that School.

In addition, there shall be four student media representatives on the Media Board, one each from The Cavalier Daily, The Declaration, WTJU and WUVA, provided that any such media organization may choose not to be represented. These members shall not be involved in the budgetary concerns of the Media Board. A media representative shall excuse himself from any involvement in any complaint procedure affecting his respective student media organization. The student media representatives shall serve a one year term.

A chairman shall be chosen by the Media Board from among the school representatives who have served one year.

If, prior to the consideration of any adjudicative matter, a challenge is made that one or more members of the Media Board should be excused because of conflicts in interest, the challenge shall be decided upon by a majority vote of the unchallenged members of the Media Board, and, when required, substitute members shall be selected by a majority vote; provided that if a majority of the members are challenged, the Student Activities Committee shall act upon the challenge and, if upheld, it shall select substitute members.

The Media Board of Directors may at its discretion elect to have a consultant or advisor from the faculty or staff of the University who should be selected in consultation with the Vice President for Student Affairs, and who would serve ex officio and with no vote.

## AMENDMENT AND RESTATEMENT OF THE GUIDELINES FOR STUDENT ACTIVITIES CURRENT FUND ALLOCATION

Funds may be allocated by Student Council to recognized student organizations in the following categories, The Rector and Visitors having determined that activities in these categories are related to the educational purpose of the University:

1. student governments and councils;
2. departmental, academic, and curricular activities;
3. club sports;
4. curricularly-oriented publications and a weekly student news magazine;
5. the student radio and television stations;
6. cultural and fine arts activities;
7. the University designated coordinating agency for student volunteer service activities;
8. student clinical training programs;
9. hobby organizations;
10. non-partisan groups whose predominate purpose is to present speakers on a non-partisan basis to speak on topics of probable general interest to the University;
11. student legal services;
12. University service organizations whose primary benefits accrue to non-members and whose purpose is related to an academic program or course of study; and
13. student organizations acting as spokesmen for groups of students protected by federal non-discrimination legislation.

No monies from these funds shall be given:

1. for honoraria or similar fees;
2. for religious activities or activities sponsored by religious organizations;
3. for social entertainment or for organizations whose activities are substantially social;
4. for organizations when admission to the organization is restricted by reason of race, religion, national origin, political affiliation, or sex. Notwithstanding these requirements, a club sport may restrict membership based on sex where selection for such teams is based upon competitive skill or the activity involved is a contact sport. Organizations may also make requirements based on vocal range or quality which may result in a chorus or choruses of one or predominantly one sex. In determining cases of discrimination it is not sufficient to look merely to the constitution of such an organization but to its actual practices and operations.
5. for activities which would jeopardize the University's status under Section 501 (3) (c) of The Internal Revenue Code.
6. for political activities or activities sponsored by political organizations. Political activities are, in general, those normally engaged in by political parties or special interest groups, such as electioneering or lobbying. Electioneering shall include the broad range of those activities incidental to the promotion of partisan political ideas or programs and their representatives. Lobbying shall include any activity whose purpose is to procure or prevent, the acceptance of any social, economic or political theory as an operating principle or policy. This shall not include engaging in non-partisan analyses study, or research or making those results available to the public. A public interest organization will not fail to meet the test merely because it advocates, as an insubstantial part of its activity, the adoption or rejection of legislation.

The ceiling on the aggregate amount allocated to all such organization will be the then current total student activities fees less the amount approved by the Student Activities Committee for The Cavalier Daily. Each organization whose budget is reviewed by the Student Council will have a right of appeal to the Student Activities Committee. Any student or student group may also appeal to the Student Council and to the Student Activities Committee. If no appeal is taken, a Student Council officer will draw a check on the Student Activities Fund for the amount specified by Council payable to the organization receiving the allocation. The Student Activities Committee shall examine on its own motion any budgets that may be approved by the Student Council for organizations deemed by the Committee to be within the categories noted above.
