Pursuant to action taken at a meeting of the Board held November 7, 1934, an adjourned meeting was held on this date at 10 o'clock A. M., in the office of the President for consideration of the report of the Special Committee appointed to study and report upon the physical training and athletic situation here, which report was submitted at the meeting on November 7th, and for consideration of such other business as may be presented.

There were present Visitors Corbitt, Garnett, Hall, Munford, Rinehart, Lewis C. Williams and R. Gray Williams, and President Newcomb. (Mr. Goolrick came in at 4:50 o'clock.)

Mr. Corbitt, elected Rector pro tem. at the meeting last evening, presided.

Mr. Lewis C. Williams having been recorded as voting for the resolution approving the loan from the Public Works Administration for addition to the University Hospital, adopted at the meeting last evening, though opposing it, he being the only one opposed, moved a reconsideration as follows:

I move to reconsider the resolution approving the loan from PWA for hospital building because the loan puts a burden on the University of an annual payment of nearly $11,820 for some years and has no redemption clause;

That the hospital is needed but the conditions, circumstances and restrictions of this loan make it inadvisable;

That the money can probably be obtained to better advantage elsewhere, and

That it does not appear that the Board of Visitors has studied the plans for the building and approved.

The motion was lost.

The President stated the enrollment to date to be 2401, and presented the following list of gifts:

From Mr. Alfred Akerman, Professor of Forestry in the University of Virginia, his Forestry Library and Herbarium (It would cost several thousand dollars to duplicate this collection.)

From Mr. John Dutton Wright, (brother-in-law of Mr. J. S. Galban, Instructor in the School of Romanic Languages) more than 1000 mounted and named photographs of famous foreign and American subjects in art, architecture and landscape.

From the Yale University Press, twelve etchings of Yale, by Mr. Samuel Chamberlain.

Mr. W. Eskridge Duke, Attorney for Mrs. Julia D. S. Cameron, together with Mr. Broadnax Cameron, appeared before the meeting requesting that the Board withdraw its objection to the erection of a filling station at the southwest corner of the intersection of highways 29 and 5, and expressed the willingness of Mrs. Cameron to make effective certain restrictions with respect to the remainder of her property fronting on route 29 if the said opposition were withdrawn. Following a full discussion of the matter the following motion, duly made and seconded, was adopted:

**RESOLVED**, by The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, That opposition be withdrawn to the erection of a proposed filling station on the property of Mrs. Julia D. S. Cameron, located on the S. W. corner of the intersection of highways 29 and 5, on a lot facing 80 feet on Emmett Street (Route 29) by 100 feet on Ivy Road (Route 5), provided the proposed filling station be erected to conform, in general, to the "Lord Baltimore" design of such buildings, and that the plans for the said building be submitted to the Architect of the University for his approval, and that she will agree to the following restrictions with respect to the remainder of her property facing on Emmett Street (Route 29):

1. That no structure shall be built on any lot fronting on this street at a cost of less than $7,500.00 for every fifty-foot of frontage, and that no structure so erected shall be located nearer the western line of the highway right-of-way than thirty-five feet.

2. That no filling station shall be permitted to be erected on said property.

3. That these restrictions be made effective for a period of fifty years from this date, but such restrictions may be changed by and with the consent of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia.

The Special Committee appointed to prepare resolutions with respect to the late William Holding Echols presented the following which was adopted and ordered spread:

William Holding Echols died at his home on East Lawn at the University of Virginia on September 25, 1934, after serving as a member of the faculty of the University for more than forty-three years.

He came to the University in 1891 as adjunct professor of mathematics, which position he held until 1896. From 1896 until his death he was professor of mathematics.

Mr. Echols was born in San Antonio, Texas, December 2, 1859, the son of William Holding and Mary Beirne (Patton) Echols. In 1882 he received from the University of Virginia the degrees of B. S. and C. E. On September 9, 1885, he married Mary Elizabeth Blakey, of Charlottesville, Virginia, who died in 1893, and on June 15, 1897, he married Elizabeth Mitchell Harrison, of New York, who survives him.

In 1882 he was assistant engineer in the construction of the Vicksburg, Shreveport & Pacific Railway, in 1883 he was resident engineer in charge of location, construction and bridge work of the Louisville, New Orleans & Texas Railway; in 1884 he was mining engineer and superintendent of the N. & O. Mining Company, in Colorado; in 1886 he became first resident engineer of the Memphis & Birmingham Railway; from 1887 to 1891 he was professor of mathematics in the Missouri School of Mines, being director from 1888 to 1891, and from the latter position came to the University of Virginia in 1891 as adjunct professor of mathematics. At the time of his death, in point of service, he was the oldest member of the faculty.

He attended private schools in Huntsville, Alabama, then went to the University of the South, at Sewanee, Tennessee, and to the Episcopal High School, Alexandria, before he attended the University of Virginia 1878 to 1882, where he took his B. S. and C. E. degrees. He was the author of one book, "Differential and Integral Calculus", which is widely used throughout the country, and wrote many papers on pure and applied mathematics.

He was a member of the American Mathematical Society, of the Eli Banana and of Phi Beta Kappa from this University, Chi Phi, Lambda Pi and Tau Beta Pi fraternities.

Mr. Echols was affectionately known by the professors and many of the older students as "Reddy". He was not only the head of the school of mathematics, but he was also active in every phase of University life. As has been well said of him, "he gave expression to the ideals and the aspirations of the University", these ideals being "honor and truth, high-mindedness and the courage to fight against odds, fair dealing with men and scorn of a petty spirit". Mr. Echols was the embodiment of these things. "He never formulated any creed of living, but his spirit naturally dwelt on a high plane. His character, to say nothing of his scholarship, was one of the mightiest forces in the life of the University. No student was so callous as not to respond to the uplifting influence of his personality".

**IN CONSIDERATION WHEREOF**, BE IT RESOLVED, That this memorial be spread upon the minutes of this Board, and that copies be sent to the members of Mr. Echols' family.

Application of the S. A. E. Fraternity for a loan of $17,500, to retire existing indebtedness of $4,500 and to enlarge and remodel its present chapter house at an expense of $13,000, was received, considered, and granted subject to the approval of the Finance Committee.

Application from the Phi Gamma Delta Fraternity for a loan of $25,000 to retire in full the existing first mortgage on the Omicron Chapter House, located on Madison Lane, was received, considered and granted, subject to the approval of the Finance Committee.

The President brought up the question of the establishment of a R. O. T. C. unit of field artillery at the University, which matter was discussed at the November 7th meeting without action. After consideration of the matter the following motion by Mr. Rinehart was adopted:

**RESOLVED**, That we are favorable to the establishment here of a unit of field artillery, provided the War Department furnish the money for erecting the necessary buildings to house the said unit.

The routine business being disposed of, the Report and Recommendations of the Committee appointed by the President to study and report upon a plan for coordinating Intercollegiate Athletics, Intramural Sports and Physical Education here, submitted to the Board at its meeting November 7th, 1934, at which time they were read in full, discussed at some length and referred to this meeting for final action, were taken up.

A number of alumni and delegations from alumni chapters were granted the privilege of the floor to express their views, either as individuals or as representatives of certain groups with respect to the recommendations of the President's Committee. Among those appearing was a committee composed of Messrs. Julien Hill and Claude Bain, representing the Board of Managers of the General Alumni Association, who presented the following resolution which had been unanimously approved by the said Board of Managers at their meeting held on this date:

It was moved, seconded and unanimously carried, that the Board of Managers recommend the adoption of the report of the President's Committee in principle, but with the following specific reservations.

First. No person who is employed as a coach or instructor in the department of intercollegiate athletics shall be a member of the faculty.

Second. No credit shall be given for courses in coaching except toward the degree of bachelor of science in education.

Third. That the title of the head of the department of athletics and physical education be director rather than dean.

Fourth. That the 3-3-3 advisory council proposed by the report shall have not less than four meetings regularly each calendar year, and make recommendations to the President of the University.

Following the hearing, the hour being late, a special committee, consisting of Mr. R. Gray Williams, Mr. Garnett and the President, was appointed to draft suitable resolutions covering the Report and Recommendations of the President's Committee, having due regard for the opinions expressed by the alumni at the hearing and for the resolutions of the Board of Managers of the General Alumni Association. The committee was also requested to prepare a statement setting forth the policy of the President and Board of Visitors with respect to subsidizing athletes at the University, and to report on both matters at an adjourned meeting to be held on the following morning, January 13th, at 11:30 o'clock.

The meeting then adjourned.

## RESOLUTIONS ON THE DEATH OF WILLIAM HOLDING ECHOLS.
