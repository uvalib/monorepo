| Investment of Money in Certain Accounts                                                 |

A special account is hereby created in the Sinking Fund and designated "University of Virginia Fixed/Adjustable Rate Hospital Revenue Bonds (Series B) Sinking Fund Account" (the "Sinking Fund Account"). Two other special accounts are hereby created in the Sinking Fund and designated "University of Virginia Fixed/Adjustable Rate Hospital Revenue Bonds (Series B) Interest Account" (the "Interest Account") and "University of Virginia Fixed/Adjustable Rate Hospital Revenue Bonds (Series B) Bank Interest Account (the "Bank Interest Account"), respectively. An additional special account is hereby created in the Reserve Fund and designated "University of Virginia Fixed/Adjustable Rate Hospital Revenue Bonds (Series B) Reserve Account" (the "Reserve Account"), which special account shall consist of two subaccounts designated "Equity Subaccount" and "Proceeds Subaccount," respectively. An additional special account is hereby created in the Redemption Fund and designated "University of Virginia Fixed/Adjustable Rate Hospital Revenue Bonds (Series B) Redemption Account" (the "Redemption Account").

The moneys in each of said Accounts shall be held and applied as hereinafter provided and, pending such application, shall be subject to a lien in favor of the Holders and for the further security of such Holders until paid out or transferred as herein provided.

(a) Prior to and on the Fixed Rate Date, the money held for the credit of the Sinking Fund Account shall be applied as set forth in Section 209 hereof.

In the event the balance in the Sinking Fund Account is insufficient for the payment of the redemption price on the Bonds on the next ensuing payment date, the State Treasurer shall transfer to such account such amounts as may be necessary to remedy the deficiency therein from the Reserve Account; provided, however, that amounts on deposit to the Proceeds Subaccount shall be exhausted prior to the transfer of any amount on deposit to the credit of the Equity Subaccount.

If, prior to any December 1, by the application of money in the Sinking Fund Account the State Treasurer should purchase and deliver to the Paying Agent for cancellation Bonds in excess of the aggregate Sinking Fund Requirement for such December 1, the State Treasurer shall file with the University and the Paying Agent not later than the 20th day prior to the next December 1 on which Bonds are to be redeemed a statement identifying the Bonds purchased or delivered and the amount of such excess. The University shall thereafter cause an Officer's Certificate to be filed with the Paying Agent not later than the 10th day prior to such December 1, setting forth with respect to the amount of such excess the years in which the Sinking Fund Requirements with respect to Bonds are to be reduced and the amount by which the Sinking Fund Requirements so determined are to be reduced.

Upon the retirement of any Bonds by purchase or redemption pursuant to the provisions of this Section, the Paying Agent shall file with the State Treasurer and the University a statement identifying such Bonds and setting forth the date of purchase or redemption, the amount of the purchase price or the redemption price of such Bonds and the amount paid as interest thereon.

The State Treasurer shall withdraw money from the Interest Account and the Bank Interest Account and pay or cause to be paid interest on the Bonds and the portion of the purchase price of Bonds attributable to interest in accordance with Sections 208 and 210 hereof.

(a) Prior to and on the Fixed Rate Date, money held for the credit of the Redemption Account shall be transferred to the Paying Agent one Business Day prior to the date of redemption and shall be applied by the Paying Agent on the date of redemption to reimburse the Bank for drawings made under the Letter of Credit or any Substitute Credit Facility or Alternate Credit Facility to pay the redemption price of Bonds to be optionally redeemed. Within one (1) hour after the Paying Agent has received the money drawn on the Credit Facility to pay principal of all Bonds (other than Bank Bonds) being redeemed and has received the amounts specified in the preceding sentence, the Paying Agent shall notify the Bank that a payment of principal on redemption is to be made and that the Bank shall be reimbursed.

Upon the retirement of any Bonds by purchase or redemption pursuant to the provisions of this Section, the State Treasurer shall file with the University and the Paying Agent a statement identifying such Bonds and setting forth the date of purchase or redemption, the amount of the purchase price or the redemption price of such Bonds and the amount paid as interest thereon.

(a) Simultaneous with the delivery of the Bonds, an amount equal to the Reserve Account Requirement shall be deposited in the Reserve Account from funds contributed by the University and/or the proceeds of the Bonds; provided, however, that the amount so deposited from the proceeds of the Bonds shall be not less than the amount of interest accruing on the Bonds from November 1, 1984 through May 31, 1985. Any funds contributed by the University for deposit to the credit of the Reserve Account shall be deposited in the Equity Subaccount, and any of the proceeds of the Bonds deposited to the credit of the Reserve Account shall be deposited to the credit of the Proceeds Subaccount.

(b) Prior to and on the Fixed Rate Date, if either proceeds of the Bonds or Aged Money is not available in the Interest Account, the State Treasurer shall transfer from the Reserve Account to the Paying Agent, on the Business Day preceding each Interest Payment Date, the amount required to pay interest becoming due on such Interest Payment Date on all Bonds Outstanding which are not Bank Bonds and interest on Bank Bonds in an amount not exceeding the interest payable at the Maximum Interest Rate. Amounts on deposit to the credit of the Proceeds Subaccount shall be exhausted prior to the transfer of any amount on deposit to the credit of the Equity Subaccount.

(c) After the Fixed Rate Date, the State Treasurer shall use amounts in the Reserve Account to make transfers to the Interest Account and the Sinking Fund Account to the extent necessary to pay interest on and principal (whether at maturity, by acceleration or in satisfaction of the Sinking Fund Requirement) of the Bonds, whenever and to the extent that the money on deposit to the Interest Account and the Sinking Fund Account is insufficient for such purposes. Amounts on deposit to the credit of the Proceeds Subaccount shall be exhausted prior to the transfer of any amount on deposit to the credit of the Equity Subaccount.

(d) Prior to the Fixed Rate Date, the State Treasurer shall transfer from the Special Fund to the Equity Subaccount on each Interest Payment Date an amount equal to the amount of any transfer made pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section. If on any Interest Payment Date there shall not be sufficient Net Revenues available to enable the State Treasurer to make the transfer required by this subsection (d), he shall so notify the Paying Agent in writing on such Interest Payment Date.

(e) From and after the Fixed Rate Date, the State Treasurer shall transfer from the Special Fund to the Equity Subaccount, in twelve (12) equal monthly installments, the amount of any transfer made from the Reserve Account pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section.

(f) The University may at any time after the Fixed Rate Date withdraw amounts on deposit to the credit of the Proceeds Subaccount for any lawful Hospital purpose so long as, simultaneously therewith, it shall deposit an equal amount of its funds to the credit of the Equity Subaccount.

(g) Prior to the effective date of any amendment to the Resolution which would increase the Maximum Interest Rate, the University shall deposit to the credit of the Equity Subaccount an amount equal to the increase in the Reserve Account Requirement resulting from such amendment.

Money held in the Reserve Account shall be invested as follows:

(a) In Government Obligations maturing within three (3) years from the date of investment.\
(b) In repurchase agreements for Government Obligations or investment agreements continuously secured by Government Obligations with any bank, trust company or dealer in government bonds which reports to, trades with and is recognized as a primary dealer by a Federal Reserve Bank, and which has outstanding indebtedness that is then rated by Moody's in a rating category not less than Baa3 or P-3, if such Government Obligations are delivered to the State Treasurer or are supported by a safekeeping receipt issued by a depository designated by the State Treasurer and if such repurchase and investment agreements provide that the value of the underlying Government Obligations shall continuously be maintained at a current market value of not less than their purchase price; or\
(c) In investment agreements with any bank or trust company which has outstanding indebtedness or has issued a letter of credit or other credit facility that constitutes the primary security for indebtedness that is then rated by Moody's in a rating category at least as high as the short-term rating category on the Bonds; provided, however, that at all times prior to the Fixed Rate Date an amount equal to the Investment Requirement shall be invested (i) in Government Obligations maturing within the Maturity Requirement or (ii) as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this Section.

Repurchase and investment agreements contemplated under (b) and (c) above must provide that moneys under such agreements may be drawn at any time.

(a) While the Credit Facility or any Substitute Credit Facility or Alternate Credit Facility is in effect, this Series Resolution may be amended or supplemented at any time, without consent of the Holders, provided that the University shall first have received an opinion of Bond Counsel that such amendment would not adversely affect the exemption from federal income tax of interest on the Bonds and that the University shall have notified the Paying Agent of such amendment at least sixty (60) days prior to the effective date of such amendment. Any amendment pursuant to this Section 801, other than to take action with respect to matters set forth in Section 1001 of the Master Resolution or to increase the Maximum Interest Rate on the Bonds, shall only take effect on any December 2, commencing December 2 in the Effective Year.

(b) Notice of any such amendment (other than an amendment pursuant to Section 1001 of the Master Resolution or to increase the Maximum Interest Rate on the Bonds) will be mailed by first-class mail by the Paying Agent to Moody's and to each Holder at his address as shown on the registration books on or before the second Business Day following the Determination Date next preceding the Amendment Date, concurrently with the notice required to be mailed by the Paying Agent to all Holders pursuant to Section 203(b) hereof. Such notice shall state (i) the nature of the amendment, (ii) that the amendment becomes effective on the December 2 following the Amendment Date, (iii) that all Holders who wish to continue to own Bonds after the Amendment Date must give notice to that effect to the Paying Agent no later than 4:00 P.M., New York time, on the November 15 prior to the Amendment Date or be deemed to have tendered their Bonds for purchase and (iv) that any Holders that are deemed to have tendered their Bonds shall not be entitled to any payment (including any interest to accrue subsequently to the Amendment Date) other than the purchase price for such Bonds which shall be equal to the unpaid principal amount of such Bonds, and such Bonds shall no longer be entitled to the benefits of the Resolution except for the purpose of payment of the purchase price therefor, which payment shall be made only upon the surrender of such Bonds at the principal corporate trust office of the Paying Agent.

(c) Any Holder desiring to retain Bonds after the Amendment Date must notify the Paying Agent in writing received not later than the November 15 prior to the Amendment Date. Said notice shall state in substance: (1) The numbers and principal amounts of the Bonds which the holder wishes to retain after the Amendment Date; and (2) A statement that the Holder wishes to continue to hold the Bonds specified in (1) above; and (3) The Holder is aware that the rating assigned to the Bonds by Moody's may be reduced or changed. Any Holders not providing the Paying Agent with the notice described above shall be deemed to have tendered their Bonds to the Paying Agent effective as of the Amendment Date and any such Holders shall have only those rights with respect to such Tendered Bonds as are set forth in Section 207 hereof.

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, so long as the Credit Facility shall be in effect, neither the Master Resolution nor this Series Resolution shall be amended without the prior written consent of the Bank.

Prior to the delivery of the Bonds, the Vice President for Business and Finance of the University may make such technical changes to the Master Resolution and this Series Resolution as shall be necessary to reflect accurately all negotiations among the University, the State Treasurer, Goldman Sachs & Co., the Bank and the Paying Agent with respect to the structuring of the financing for the Project, including, specifically, the terms and provisions of the Bonds; provided, however, that no such amendment shall increase the principal amount of the Bonds or the Maximum Interest Rate thereon beyond the amount and rate specified in the October 5, 1984 resolution of the Board authorizing the issuance of the Bonds.
