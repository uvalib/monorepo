In the absence of Dr. W. D.

The selection of architects for the several projects, as outlined, was approved by the Board, and the President was authorized to sign the contracts on behalf of the University when approval has been made by the State Board of Architects.

The President further explained that it had been deemed desirable to secure a block model for the proposed hospital construction and also site plans for other University construction; that the cost of such model and plans would not exceed the sum of **$10,000**; that the expenditure had met with the approval of the Governor, and that he had made an appropriation to cover the cost thereof.

Approved

Mr. Lewis C. Williams, chairman of the Committee on Use of the Rotunda, stated that he desired some architectural advice in determining the proper procedure, and requested permission to employ the services of Eggers & Higgins to prepare plans for same, which was approved.

A motion by Dr. Lancaster, that a committee on the consolidation of Mary Washington College with the University of Virginia be appointed by the Rector, was adopted.

A committee from the Board of Managers of the University of Virginia Alumni Association presented the following communication in reference to the above matter:

In regard to the proposed School of Foreign Service and International Affairs at the University of Virginia, the Board of Managers of the University of Virginia Alumni Association respectfully submits for your consideration the following:

1. The establishment of this School was proposed by Mr. Edward R. Stettinius, Jr., a member of our Board of Visitors and now Secretary of State, in a memorandum dated March 16, 1943, addressed to the Rector and the President of the University. As that memorandum states the proposition so well and forcefully we are taking the liberty of attaching a copy of the same hereto. We think it is in order to state that the interest of Mr. Stettinius in this School has not abated. On February 28, 1945, he addressed a letter from Mexico City to a member of this Committee in which he said, "I agree entirely that the time is slipping away from us and if we are really to be effective in establishing a School of Foreign Service at the University it should be done immediately. As a matter of fact, from my talk with you, you will recall that I thought it should have been done at the time of my original memorandum in 1942, a copy of which I gave you."

2. At a meeting of the Board of Managers of the Alumni Association on February 3, 1945, the following two resolutions were adopted:

"It was moved, seconded and unanimously carried that the Alumni Association make **$10,000.00** available if necessary, to advance the proposed School of Foreign Service, to be used for such purposes as may seem most desirable in the judgment of the Board of Managers. This commitment is contingent upon the announcement of this School by July 1, 1945.

"It was moved, seconded and unanimously carried that President Henry appoint a committee to request that a meeting of the Board of Visitors be called at an early date to consider the prompt establishment of the School of Foreign Service. The Board suggested that President Henry should be a member of this Committee.

3. The able committee appointed by Dr. Newcomb to study the feasibility of establishing the School of which Dr. L. G. Moffatt of the School of Romance Languages is Chairman, has made its report. This report goes into all phases of the School including its purpose, nature of course of study, curriculum, organization and plan of instruction and a "conclusion" of which a copy is attached.

4. It is a well-recognized fact that many attribute the lack of efficiency on the part of some engaged in diplomatic, consular and foreign service to inadequate preparation. It is obvious that the United States must and will take an ever greater and greater part in the affairs of the world. We quote the following from an article about Mr. Stettinius by Bob Considine in the Reader's Digest of March, 1945:

"He has a young man's outlook on the world. He believes we should train diplomats and foreign-service men as we train midshipmen and cadets, and he will recruit young blood until such a school develops."

5. We can think of no University or place of instruction better suited for such a School than the University of Virginia. The fact that many other institutions are planning for the same sort of instruction shows the tremendous interest in and need for a broad and special training to equip suitable persons for this field of services. We understand that already many inquiries have come to the University in regard to this School by persons interested in entering themselves or their sons.

6. We respectfully urge the prompt announcement of this School, notwithstanding the fact that it may be impossible to adequately supply the personnel of its faculty and directors now. We are convinced that everyone believes that such a School should be established at the University of Virginia. In the opinion of this Committee and of all with whom we have talked the feeling is that such a School at the University of Virginia in the language of the street would be a "natural".

7. We appreciate the privilege of appearing before the Board of Visitors. We trust that our enthusiasm and zeal for this object will not be misconstrued and that we will not be thought of as stepping beyond the limits of our proper concern. The Alumni Association is increasing in strength and effectiveness from year to year. We believe that we are representative of the general alumni. This substantial contribution which the Association offers out of its comparatively small but increasing reserves is tangible evidence of the sincerity of our interest in this undertaking. In addition to this sum we feel quite sure that the sum of **$35,000.00** for the Library for International Studies will be raised by the Association as a party of the Alumni Fund. We also understand that a committee of Alumni are thinking in terms of much greater support in money and prestige. The prompt announcement of this School will in our opinion accomplish indirect effects as great or greater than the direct results from the School itself.

The Committee has also asked the President of the Association, Mr. Henry, to present in a few words the general status and objectives of the Alumni Association and to let the Administration and the Board know that the Association is doing its best and hopes to do better for the good of the University of Virginia.
