Mr. Grattan reported that a representative of the State Board for Community Colleges has requested that the University deliver a deed to the Board conveying the property formerly used by Patrick Henry College of the University of Virginia. Although § 23-222 of the Code of Virginia provided for the transfer by the University of all physical facilities, assets, etc., and although the Board of Visitors authorized the transfer by resolution adopted at the meeting of the Board held on April 3, 1971, no deed has ever been executed and delivered. Consequently, Mr. Grattan recommended that the Board authorize the execution and delivery of a deed.
