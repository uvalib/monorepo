Mr. Perkins, attorney for the University, made a statement to the Board in the matter of the Alfred D. Cooper bond held in the Whitmell T. Taliaferro estate, which was approved.

Upon settlement of the estate of Whitmell T. Taliaferro, of Monmouth County, New Jersey, a bond of Alfred D. Cooper for Eight Thousand Dollars (8,000.00) was turned over to the University by Mr. Richard H. McIntyre, Mr. Taliaferro's Executor, this bond is secured by a first mortgage upon Mr. Cooper's home at Glen Ridge, New Jersey. At the time we received this bond we were advised that Mr. Cooper had become involved financially and it developed that something over $2,000.00 had accumulated and remained unpaid on account of taxes upon his home, and there was also some interest in arrears on his bond.

In March, 1936, we entered into a contract with Mr. Cooper under which the University paid $2,098.56 of delinquent taxes on Mr. Cooper's home, to secure which we took a second mortgage upon the property. Under the terms of this contract Mr. Cooper agreed to pay $100.00 a month until the whole debt evidenced by the $8,000.00 bond and the $2,098.56 above referred to was paid in full.

Mr. Cooper now tells us that it is impossible for him to continue these payments of $100.00 a month, although he has made all payments under his contract from April 1936 down to May 1st, 1938.

The matter has been referred by me to Messrs. Pitney Hardin and Skinner, Attorneys of Newark, New Jersey. These gentlemen have seen Mr. Cooper and talked with him and he has offered to convey his home at Glen Ridge, New Jersey to the University in extinguishment of his debt which now amounts approximately to $9,000.00 in round figures. The question of whether the University should accept a deed from Mr. Cooper or whether we should undertake to make some other arrangement with him looking to private sale by him of his property or whether we should proceed to foreclose our mortgage is one which will have to be considered carefully.

May I suggest that you appoint a committee whose duty it shall be to investigate this whole situation thoroughly, authority being vested in such committee to take such action as may be deemed wise without referring the matter back to the Board.

The following resolution was thereupon unanimously adopted:

**Resolved** that a committee composed of the President and Mr. Rinehart be and is hereby appointed and directed to investigate the situation with reference to settlement with Alfred D. Cooper of Glenn Ridge, New Jersey. Said committee being given full and complete authority to take such action with reference to this settlement as the members thereof may deem proper, and J. L. Newcomb, President, is hereby specifically authorized to execute and deliver on behalf of the University such contract or contracts as may be approved by said committee.

The President was authorized to make application for conditional appropriation from P. W. A. for grant to meet the conditional appropriation by the State for the Hospital of $250,000 for construction and $75,000 for its equipment. (Mr. Lewis C. Williams voted in the negative.)

A resolution authorizing J. L. Newcomb to file an application to the United States of America through the Federal Emergency Administration of Public Works for a grant to aid in financing the reconstruction of the Rotunda, its esplanades and rooms thereunder, including roofing, paving, balustrade, walks, steps and approaches thereto, and furnishings therein.

**BE IT RESOLVED**, by the Rector and Board of Visitors of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia:

**Section 1.** That J. L. Newcomb be and he is authorized to execute and file an application on behalf of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia to the United States of America for a grant to aid in financing the reconstruction of the Rotunda, its esplanades and rooms thereunder, including roofing, paving, balustrade, walks steps and approaches thereto, and furnishings therein.

**Section 2.** That J. L. Newcomb be and he is hereby authorized and directed to furnish such information as the United States of America through the Federal Emergency Administration of Public works may reasonably request in connection with the application which is herein authorized to be filed. (Mr. Lewis C. Williams voted in the negative)

The use of the University Chapel was granted the University Baptist Church congregation for the summer of 1938, with the condition that it be vacated whenever the University may have use for it during said term.

President Newcomb reported to the Board that Dr. E. C. Drash had personally received contributions of $2,500, $2,000 of which was a gift from Mr. C. F. Coffman of Winchester, and $500 from Colonel Wm. H. Langhorne of Warren, to be used in the reconstruction of the south pavilions of the Peltz Wings of the Hospital for use in the treatment of surgical tuberculosis patients. That Mr. Rinehart, Chairman of the Building Committee of the Board, and Mr. Newcomb had agreed with Dr. Drash on the desirability of this reconstruction and had authorized it to be done and paid for by Dr. Drash. The action of Mr. Rinehart and Mr. Newcomb was thereupon ratified and approved by the Board.

With respect to the charges preferred by Prof. Nils Hammerstrand against Prof. Edmund S. Campbell, presented at the former meeting of the board, the following action was unanimously voted:

**RESOLVED**, That the members of this board having been furnished with copies of the charges preferred by Prof. Nils Hammerstrand against Professor Edmund S. Campbell, and having carefully considered the same, are of the opinion that said charges do not justify a further hearing, and decline to consider the matter further.

The President reported to the Board that he had decided not to recommend Prof. Hammerstrand for another three-year term, whereupon the following action was unanimously voted:

The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia concur in the decision not to recommend Mr. Hammerstrand for another three-year term as Assistant Professor of the History of Art.

**RESOLVED** by the Rector and Visitors that the President be and he is hereby empowered and directed to fill the position for a three-year term and to report the name of the Assistant Professor so determined upon by him for confirmation by the Rector and Visitors at their next meeting.

The President presented to the Rector and Visitors of the University a proposal from McGregor Fund, a Michigan corporation of Detroit, Michigan, to give to the University of Virginia the Library of the late Tracy W. McGregor, subject to the terms and conditions of a Library Deed of Gift and an Agreement to be attached to certain schedules referred to in the Library Deed of Gift, which said Deed of Gift and said Agreement read as follows:

### THIS INDENTURE AND DEED OF GIFT made this 11 day of June, A. D. 1938, between:

(1) McGREGOR FUND, a Michigan corporation of Detroit, Michigan, Party of the First Part; and

(2) The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, a public corporation of the State of Virginia, herein sometimes called the University, Party of the Second Part;

**WITNESSETH:**

Tracy W. McGregor, of Detroit, Michigan, expressed in his last will and testament his wish to assist in founding a library of American History in an institution of higher learning having fine ideals of education and means and likelihood of achieving those ideals, and to that end gave and bequeathed his library to McGregor Fund for it to give the same to such college or university as it might select. Consistently with this purpose and with decisions partially made by Tracy W. McGregor in his lifetime, McGregor Fund has selected the University of Virginia to receive and hold his library.

**NOW THEREFORE**, in consideration of the acceptance by the University of the terms and conditions hereof, McGregor Fund gives and grants unto the University and its successors that part of the library of the late Tracy W. McGregor, of Detroit, Michigan, which has been heretofore identified and described in certain schedules signed by the parties hereto, which, with the additions thereto which may be made hereafter as herein provided, is hereinafter sometimes called the Tracy W. McGregor Library, or merely the Library, TO HAVE AND TO HOLD unto the University and its successors FOREVER, subject, however, to the following terms and conditions:

1. That the University and its successors shall forever safely keep, preserve and maintain the Library as a separate library of exhibition, reference and research to be known as The Tracy W. McGregor Library, and shall provide an adequate and suitable place for its safekeeping, preservation and maintenance, either in a general library building or otherwise.

2. That the material in the Library shall never be removed from the place provided by the University for its safekeeping, preservation and maintenance, except for rebinding or the making of necessary repairs to the library material so removed, or for the purpose of the repair or reconstruction of the building or portion thereof in which the same is placed, or for photographic or other reproduction, or for temporary exhibition purposes, and since the use of the material in the Library for educational purposes in the University of Virginia is intended and desired by the parties hereto, therefore temporary exhibition of the material in classrooms may be permitted and encouraged, provided, that none such material shall be removed for any of such purposes from the place so provided, except under adequate conditions and provisions established and executed to ensure the safekeeping, preservation and maintenance of the material, and provided further that none of such material shall be so removed for temporary exhibition outside the University of Virginia, except as part of a larger exhibition of extraordinary and wide interest.

3. That the use of the Library for reference and research shall only be permitted to advanced scholars and other qualified persons.

4. That none of the material in the Library shall be sold, exchanged or otherwise disposed of by the University or its successors, (a) except that any duplicate material which has been or which at any time hereafter may be appropriately indicated by the parties hereto on the schedules referred to above may be exchanged for other suitable library material which shall thereupon become part of the Library, and (b) except further that any material which at any time hereafter may be considered unsuitable for the Library and be appropriately indicated by the parties hereto on such schedules may be withdrawn from this gift and grant and either returned by the University to McGregor Fund or retained by the University and used or otherwise disposed of by it in its discretion free from the conditions hereof.

5. That for the next ensuing ten (10) years the Library shall be kept insured by the University and its successors for such amount as may from time to time be approved by McGregor Fund, not exceeding, however, the sum of two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000), against such risks as are usual and customary with respect to property similar to that included in the Library when held for safekeeping, preservation and maintenance under conditions similar to those prevailing with respect to the Library.

6. That the University and its successors shall for the next ensuing ten (10) years expend the sum of seventy-five hundred dollars ($7,500) per year for the payment of salaries of the librarian or curator, and assistants, in charge of the rare books and manuscripts belonging to the University or its successors, including The Tracy W. McGregor Library, for insurance and for the repair, binding and rebinding, cleaning, mounting and casing of the Library, and for the purchase of additions to the Library, PROVIDED, that at least the sum of twenty-five hundred dollars ($2,500) per year shall be so expended for such period for the purchase of additions, or shall be accumulated and held available for such purpose, but at least the sum of seventy-five hundred dollars ($7,500) shall be actually so expended for the purchase of additions during every period of three (3) successive calendar years.

7. That additional library material, suitable to be included in The Tracy W. McGregor Library, may be given and granted to the University and its successors, to be added to and become a part of the Library, by McGregor Fund or by any other person or persons under the terms and conditions hereof or under terms and conditions not incompatible herewith.

8. That for the next ensuing ten (10) years there be a Committee, to be known as the Advisory Committee, consisting of seven persons as follows:

   (a) The President of the University;

   (b) The Librarian of the General Library of the University;

   (c) The ranking professor of American History in the University;

   (d) Two persons who may be designated by McGregor Fund;

   (e) Two members-at-large who shall be appointed by The Rector and Visitors of the University, in the first instance one to serve for two years and one for four years, and thereafter to serve for four years;

who shall advise the University with respect to the care and use of the Library and with respect to the selection and purchase of additions to the Library, and with respect to the conditions and provisions under which material in the Library may be removed temporarily for exhibition or other purposes as above provided.

**PROVIDED** that upon breach of any term or condition of this Indenture and Deed of Gift, and such breach continuing for three (3) months after written notice thereof to the University or its successors, the Library, except those additions thereto made or given by the University or its successors or by any other person except McGregor Fund, shall thereupon revert to and become the absolute property of McGregor Fund, and McGregor Fund may repossess the same and for such purpose may enter upon the premises of the University or its successors.

After a full discussion on the part of the members of the board, the following Resolution was unanimously agreed to:

**RESOLVED**, by the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that they accept with gratitude and appreciation the offer of McGregor Fund of the gift of the Tracy W. McGregor Library, in accordance with the Deed of Gift and Agreement as set out above, and

**RESOLVED**, that the Rector be and he is hereby authorized and directed to sign the Deed of Gift and Agreement, and the Secretary to affix the seal and attest the same on behalf of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia.

**RESOLVED**, FURTHER, that the President and appropriate administrative officers be authorized and directed to take all necessary and proper steps to carry out the obligations imposed upon the Rector and Visitors by the said Deed of Gift and said Agreement.

The Board gave expression to President Newcomb by a rising vote for the services he had rendered the University in having secured the munificent gift of the McGregor Library to the University of Virginia.

### "ADVISORY COMMITTEE OF THE TRACY W. MCGREGOR LIBRARY."

**RESOLVED**, by the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that Robert B. Tunstall and Alexander W. Weddell be and they are here appointed as members of the "Advisory Committee of the Tracy W. McGregor Library" as provided for in section (e) Paragraph 8 of the Deed of Gift.

These appointments are to be effective as of July 1, 1938, Robert B. Tunstall to serve for two years from that date and Alexander W. Weddell to serve for four years from that date.

Following the acceptance of the offer of McGregor Fund of the gift of the Tracy W. McGregor Library, the President read to the Board a copy of his letter to Miss Betty Cocke, under date of June 26, 1934, in which he declared his purpose to recommend the designation of the manuscript room in the Alderman Memorial Library as a memorial to General John Hartwell Cocke in memory of his distinguished service to this University. The members of the Board declared themselves to be heartily in accord with the establishment of a memorial on the grounds of the University to General Cocke for his outstanding services to the University of Virginia in connection with its founding and the early days of its operation. The President was thereupon requested and directed to take up with the Cocke family the naming of some room or building on the grounds of the University in memory of General Cocke for his conspicuous and able leadership as a member of the Board of this University.

In view of the fact that the Board had agreed to keep the McGregor Rare Book Collection as a separate collection in the Alderman Library and since the Rare Book and Manuscript Room seemed the only appropriate place for this collection, it was thereupon agreed to designate the south end of the Rare Book and Manuscript Room in the Alderman Library as the TRACY W. MCGREGOR RARE BOOK ROOM, and the following resolution was unanimously adopted:

**RESOLVED**, by the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that so much of the south end of the Rare Book and Manuscript Room of the Alderman Library as shall be needed for the purposes of the Tracy W. McGregor Rare Book Collection be allotted for this purpose, and the space so allotted be forever designated as the TRACY W. MCGREGOR RARE BOOK ROOM.

Upon motion, the meeting then adjourned.
