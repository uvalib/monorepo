### July 3d. 1839 The following resolutions were adopted:

A letter to the Board of Visitors, under date of July 1st 1839, was received from George Tucker, Professor of Moral Philosophy, announcing his intention to make a voyage to Europe in the next vacation, and desiring permission to be absent about a month beyond the present limits of the vacation, with a view to enable him to correct the proof sheets, & to superintend the printing of several works which he has in a course of publication in England:

1. Resolved that permission be granted to Professor Tucker to extend the term of his absence in his contemplated voyage to Europe as late as the first day of October next without the forfeiture of any of the emoluments there unto attached; upon condition however that he shall deliver to his classes a full course of lectures between the period of his return and the end of the next session.

2. Resolved that the Committee of Inspection have power & are requested to report to the next meeting of the Board.

3. It appearing from the representations made to the Board of Visitors that W. L. Harris, a Student in the school of Mathematics labours under a peculiar sensitiveness of temperament which it is supposed has prevented him from exhibiting in his examinations the degree of proficiency he has really attained in his studies, & that by that means alone has been prevented from attaining the diploma of graduate in that school, for which he has been a candidate.

4. Resolved that the Faculty be authorised to take the special circumstances of Mr. Harris' case into their consideration & if they be satisfied, notwithstanding Mr. Harris' failure in his examinations, that he really possesses the knowledge of Mathematics which, manifested in the usual mode, would entitle him to a diploma in that school, they be empowered to grant him such diploma.

5. Resolved that the Proctor be instructed to pay the accounts of Gales & Seaton amounting to $18 for advertising in the years 1828 & 1829, and that of G. W. Wood for oil \&c furnished the University in the years 1830 & 1831, presented by him to the Board, if upon enquiry it should appear by affidavit or otherwise that they have not been paid heretofore.

6. Resolved that the Faculty be requested by a Committee of their own body to examine with the Librarian the books bequeathed to the University by the late Christian Bohn, and to select such as, in their opinion, may be appropriate to the Library of the University.

   That the Books so selected be placed by the Librarian in the presses heretofore ordered to be provided for their reception; and the residue be carefully packed in boxes by the Librarian & safely kept by the Proctor subject to the future order of the Board.

6. Resolved that professor James L. Cabell be, & he is hereby authorised to cause to be made the alterations in the interior of his pavilion requested and explained by him at the present meeting of the Visitors, provided that the expense of such alterations shall be made & shall remain at his private charge until such time as the Visitors may deem it proper to reimburse the same from the funds of the University.
