The question of granting a site to the Kappa Alpha Fraternity for the erection of a chapter house was considered but, being unable to arrive at a solution of this matter for lack of time to give it due consideration, and from the further reason that none of the new members and some of the old ones could not be present to view the site selected, the question was deferred until the June meeting.
