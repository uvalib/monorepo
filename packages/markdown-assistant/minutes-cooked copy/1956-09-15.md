The Board adopted the following resolution:

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that Dr. Robert M. Hubbard, Professor of Chemical Engineering, be and he is hereby granted leave of absence without pay for the session of 1956-57 to travel and do research.

The following resolution was adopted by the Board:

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the Hospital Accounts Committee be and it is hereby authorized to charge off as uncollectible accounts Schedules 619, 622 and 623, aggregating $33,832.36, as recommended by it.

President Darden reminded the Board that at the February and June 1956 meetings of the Board the Student Accounts Committee had been authorized to charge off veterans' tuition accounts resulting from the Federal Government's having allowed the University to charge out-of-state fees for Virginia veterans, provided that no excess charges were levied against the individual students.

The President then laid before the Board schedules of veterans' textbook charges falling in the same general category, certified by the signatures of the Student Accounts Committee, and requested authority for the Committee to charge off these accounts as presented in the aggregate sum of $38,927.31 for the years 1945 through 1954.

The Board resolved that the Committee be and it is hereby authorized to charge off the veterans' textbook bills, 1945-1954, as presented, in the total sum of $38,927.31.

President Darden presented to the Board the following memorandum from Captain Richard W. Smith, U. S. N., on behalf of the University's R. O. T. C. units:

The present R.O.T.C. units at the University of Virginia, starting with the Navy in 1940, have been organized at the request of the University. The enrollment in these units is covered by public law. Enrollment is entirely voluntary. (This is not the case at the so-called land grant colleges and universities). The first two years (first year only for the Naval ROTC Regulars) a member may withdraw at his own request. Approval of the resignation is accomplished at the Unit Command level. Starting with the third year, ROTC members receive subsistence compensation, and approval of the resignation can only be made at Departmental (or delegated) level.

Each R.O.T.C. unit is an integral part of the University, and student membership cuts across the lines of the college, the schools, and all of the departments (with the exception of the School of Medicine and the Department of Nursing).

Each of the three R.O.T.C. units is welded together through wearing the uniform of one of the armed services. Within each unit is a spirit of comradery which it is believed should be fostered to the fullest in order to enhance the morale of the service of which the unit is a part. Such morale building effect has in the past been improved through extra-curricular gatherings and activities as have been properly connected with and sponsored by the unit(s). Social gatherings, not the least of which is the annual Military Ball, parade participation and competition and the like, are examples of these extra curricular activities. Such activities do require a slight monetary outlay for which there is no provision within available public funds. It has long been a principle of service life that the financing of such activities should be equally borne by all, and hence, that all should be fully eligible to participate in such activities. Whether or not a member does participate in a particular activity is a matter for him to decide, but being a member of the unit would and should constitute his eligibility. In short, his ticket for participation is his uniform and his pride in wearing it.

Each of the R.O.T.C. units has in the past collected a fee to defray such expenses. In the Spring of 1956 the Student Council considered this fee to be a matter, the collection of which should be properly considered by the Council. Accordingly, they made a very thorough, and it is believed, completely unbiased review of the matter. As a result of the review the President of the Student Council addressed a letter to each of the R.O.T.C. unit commanders. This letter contained the following.

"First, if the fee is to be compulsory for all those who enroll in a particular ROTC, the Council believes that it should first be officially approved by the University. This is to be distinguished from the present informal arrangement, whereby the University has agreed to bank these fees. It is felt that such approval is necessary to justify its collection at registration. It would also alleviate the confusion now existing as to the exact status of the fee."

The units concur with the President of the Student Council, particularly as to the clarification of the status of the fund and the manner of collecting it.

The R.O.T.C. unit student activity fee should be kept small, so as to be as little burden on the individual as possible. It is strongly recommended that it not be permitted to exceed $5.00 per student per annum and that $3.00 (about 1 cent per day) only be exceeded in exceptional circumstances. It is believed that inasmuch as membership in the R.O.T.C. unit is voluntary each member should be required to participate in the fee or to withdraw from the unit, or in the case of third and fourth year members, to submit a request for withdrawal.

It is recommended:

1. The Board of Visitors approve the collection of this fee.
2. The fund be held in the custody of the Bursar.
3. The fund be administered by the unit student organization, subject to the approval of the unit commanding officer.
4. Withdrawals from the fund only be made with the combined approval of the senior student member of the unit organization and the commanding officer of the unit.

At a meeting of the Nursing School Advisory Committee, with all members present this morning, it was unanimously agreed that the plan of reorganization of the Department of Nursing as a separate School of Nursing with the arrangements which we have discussed previously, be recommended to you and to the Board of Visitors. To be more specific, we should like to recommend that the Department of Nursing become The University of Virginia School of Nursing, with a separate dean and with full academic status as a separate school within the University. It would be understood that in academic matters the School of Nursing would have complete autonomy, but that in administrative matters effecting the Medical Center, the Dean of the School of Nursing would answer to the Director of the Medical Center (the Dean of the Medical School).

It was the opinion of the Advisory Committee that this arrangement would recognize the academic equality of the Nursing School Faculty, would enhance the stature of the School and would recognize the already existing independence of the structure of the Department of Nursing as regards registration, admissions and curriculum matters, but at the same time that administrative matters concerning the operation of the hospital and the medical school as well would be under the direct control of the Director of the Medical Center. I might add that this general type of arrangement has been in operation in a number of other schools and has been found satisfactory in general.

I had planned to discuss this matter with Mr. Vaughan at the earliest opportunity, but he is out of town at present. I shall let you know as soon as I have had an opportunity to talk with him, what his feeling about the arrangement proposed is.

The Committee also felt that it would be unwise to proceed with active search for a Head of the School of Nursing until the question of organization has been settled, but they expressed a desire to do this as rapidly as possible.

Pursuant to their appointment by this Board in June, 1956, as its committee to study the question of where the Northern Virginia branch of the University should be located, the undersigned, as a first step in their inquiry, held a public hearing in Alexandria on July 21, after issuing special invitations to the members of the General Assembly in the area and the authorities of the several political subdivisions, as well as general invitations through the press to the interested public, to attend and assist the committee by giving it their views and such information as they thought might be helpful. Thereafter the committee personally investigated the sites suggested, interviewed those persons having particular knowledge of the different tracts, made measurements of the time and distance of the several locations from the populous areas and from the rural sections to be served, and considered the availability thereto of public transportation, sewerage facilities, and water supplies as well as the accessibility of the property by highway, and their situation with respect to the high schools in Northern Virginia.

The committee believes that its foremost and controlling aim should be to place the branch at a point where it would furnish the utmost service to the graduates of the Virginia high schools in Northern Virginia, and to the adult citizens of the State, desiring to continue their education.

The undertaking of the committee was tremendously aided by the earlier thorough study and report of the Advisory Council to the Northern Virginia Center of the University. This is a voluntary group of alumni and others living in Northern Virginia who sensed the demand, and recognized the need, for facilities for higher education in this section, and who brought forth and successfully nurtured the present center now working so responsively and efficiently. They have given unstintingly of their energy and hours in the selection of a site which they could endorse for the permanent location of the branch. Likewise other groups, too, in this part of the State have unselfishly examined into the advisability and feasibility of one location after another for the University's northern branch.

The committee has not treated the question as a controversy between any of the groups, and the groups themselves have been assured that this has not been the attitude of the committee. Its sole concern has been those citizens of Virginia who are to be served by this extension of the University. The members of the several groups have acted wholeheartedly with the committee for this object. They have subordinated all their individual preferences, evincing not the slightest pride of opinion, but offering the committee every assistance within their control. To them the committee is deeply indebted.

After considering all of those that have been suggested, the committee feels that the judgment of the Board may be confined to the Ravensworth tract, the Bowman or Herndon tract, and one of the several offered by Prince William County.

### Ravensworth

A liberal offer has been made by the owners of Ravensworth, an old Lee place in Fairfax County, to give to the University the front 50 acres of the estate, now improved by a main dwelling, a smaller dwelling, and a large brick and stone barn. It has a frontage of almost a mile on Braddock Road and is located a few miles east of Little River Turnpike (State Highway 236 becoming Route 50 west of Fairfax Courthouse) between Annandale and Springfield. The grounds are in lawn and meadow and are shaded by numerous sturdy and spreading trees. From the centre of Alexandria the tract is about 10 miles, a drive of slightly more than 20 minutes.

In addition, an option will be given for 18 months to buy an adjoining parcel of 115 acres, at a price to be determined by independent appraisers, a recent appraisal having put a value of $2600 per acre on the land. A like option will be given on a 59.6 acre adjacent tract, and an outright gift is tendered of another abutting 23.9 acres. Thus 238.5 acres are here available; their attractiveness in enhanced by the proximity of the Fort Belvoir reservoir of water.

Besides the land, gifts of money totalling $77,500 will be made by the owners of Ravensworth and other developers and private citizens in the community.

Springfield residents have shown a most earnest interest in the University and have in many ways proven their desire to have the branch near them.

Fairfax County has offered to expend $125,000 for sewering this land through the county system.

### Bowman or Herndon Tract

Owning 7000 acres of farm land, known as Sunset Hills, near Herndon, in the northern part of Fairfax County, E. DeLong Bowman, Esquire, and A. Smith Bowman, jr., Esquire, his brother, have generously offered the University its choice of two gifts, including the selection of such location as the University prefers, outlined as follows:

1. A cash gift of $25,000 and 250 acres; or
2. A cash gift of $100,000 and 150 acres; plus, in each instance, an option to buy at any time during a 2-year period for $1000 per acre such additional adjacent acreage, not exceeding 250 acres, as the University desires.

On the farm the Bowman brothers operate a distillery but the most desirable land, as the committee views it, is situated more than a mile from, and out of sight of, this commercial operation. The tract is about 2 miles south of Route 7 (the Alexandria-Leesburg pike) approximately 20 miles and 35 minutes from the centre of Alexandria. It touches the corporate limits of the Town of Herndon and the mains of the Town's water supply system extend to it. Natural gas lines are at hand and Herndon has offered to cooperate in any sewerage problem, having in mind either an independent system or some arrangement in conjunction with its own disposal plant.

The land has no buildings on it but lies well; it is accessible by secondary roads on each side. Numerous Loudoun County residents have recommended the selection of this site.

### Prince William County Sites

At the committee's public hearing, Prince William County very liberally offered the committee, as a gift to the University, a 110-acre tract adjoining the Manassas Battlefield Park. Since then the County representatives have given the committee a choice of seven locations, each of them of a large and valuable area. Some are situate to the east of No. 1 highway with frontage on the Potomac River; others are in the vicinity of Manassas or the Battlefield Park. Any one of them would be a desirable site and could be developed into beautiful college grounds.

The delegation appearing for Prince William expressed and proved their sincerity of interest in the University. They explained the sharp need of collegiate educational facilities in the rural sections of Northern Virginia for the high school graduates and the hardship these young men and women are suffering through the absence of any such facilities near their homes. A separate map of Prince William County, with the several offered sites marked thereon, accompanies this report.

### Recommendation

After giving due weight to the many advantages of all of these sites, and being guided by the factors already mentioned, the committee recommends the acceptance of the Bowman offer No. 1 - the sum of $25,000 and 250 acres with the option to purchase additional land up to another 250 acres.

It recommends, too, that the land be taken from that part of the farm bounded by Brown's Chapel Road (Rt. 606), Ridge Road (Rt. 602) and R. 680, which is the line of the Town of Herndon. This tract has a relatively high elevation, with a view of the Blue Ridge Mountains, is easily reached by highway, and has public utilities at hand.

In its selection of a site the committee believes that it should consider the reasonably expected growth of this part of Virginia, and that it should reasonably anticipate the future extension westwardly and northwardly of the present populous areas, having in mind also the needs of the adjacent rural communities of Virginia. The branch is to be a Virginia institution to serve Virginia and it should be located where its accessibility will accomplish that purpose. Another dominant feature of the Bowman tract is that it now permits, and will for some years allow, acquisition of additional land for expansion of the University centre, thus avoiding the problem of constriction so frequently faced in after-years by institutions serving a rapidly developing territory.

It is this latter consideration which heavily contributed to incline the committee to choose the Herndon vicinity instead of Ravensworth. Another persuasive consideration was the probability of the construction of another national airport near Ravensworth, at Burke. The operation of such an installation, despite all scientific effort to minimize it, would not allow the quiet that is sought for classroom and campus. The Advisory Council was without knowledge of this prospect when it made its study and report.

I am writing you relative to the proposed plan for the construction of a new dormitory housing approximately 176 students for which we have an appropriation of $192,500.00.

Should we construct a building housing 176 students, the cost of the building and equipment would be approximately $704,000.00, leaving $511,500.00 to be provided from the bond issue. The building would produce revenue, at the current rate of $153.00 per session, totalling $26,928.00. Should bonds be issued bearing interest at 3% for 25 years, I estimate that it would cost approximately $29,360.00 to service these bonds exclusive of the maintenance cost of the building. Thus, before any maintenance is taken into consideration, there would be a deficit of $2,432.00.

Should we construct a dormitory housing 120 students, it is estimated that it would require a bond issue of approximately $287,500.00. A dormitory housing 120 students at the current rent of $153.00 would produce revenue totalling $18,360.00. Should we issue bonds for 25 years bearing interest at 3%, the annual cost of servicing would require approximately $16,500.00, leaving a surplus of approximately $1,800.00.

It would appear, therefore, that unless funds would be provided by action of the Board from other sources, the project could not be sustained if a dormitory housing 176 students were constructed. However, should the size of the dormitory be reduced to house approximately 120 students, it is my belief that such a dormitory would permit the project to be sustained from the revenues which the building would produce.

I submit this information for your consideration.
