Stettinius, Jr.; President Colgate W. Darden, Jr., of the University of Virginia; President M. L. Combs of Mary Washington College; Visitors Anderson, Barksdale, Calcott, Carrington, Gay, Mears, Trout, Wailes, and Willis. Absent: Black, Bustard, Garnett, and Miller.

The minutes of the meeting of November 14, which had been copied and mailed to the members, were approved. The minutes of the special meeting held November 22 were distributed at this time to members of the Board and were approved.

The President made the following announcements:

Dr. Francis Power Parker, Associate Professor of Pathology since July 1, 1946, died November 26, 1947.

Upon recommendation of the President, the following resignations were accepted:

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the resignation of Dr. James Edward Gates, Associate Professor of Political Science and Research Associate in the Bureau of Public Administration, be and the same is hereby accepted with regret, effective December 31, 1947. We wish for him the highest success in his new undertaking.

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the resignation of Dr. Thomas Shepherd Englar, Associate Professor of Preventive Medicine since 1939, be and the same is hereby accepted with regret, effective January 27, 1948. We wish for him the highest success in his new undertaking.

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the resignation of Dr. Vladimir Alexander Pertzoff, Acting Assistant Professor of Physiology, be and the same is hereby accepted with regret, effective November 11, 1947. We wish for him the highest success in his new undertaking.

The following report was submitted by Mr. W. Allan Perkins, Attorney for the University:

At the meeting of this Board held November 14, 1947, I made a report of my progress in connection with the estate of the late Rear Admiral David C. Cather, and upon my recommendation the following resolution was adopted:

**RESOLVED** that upon payment of $5,148.56, (or of a sum approximately equal thereto) to Vincent Shea, Bursar of the University of Virginia, by Florida National Bank of Jacksonville, Florida, as Trustee under Trust Agreement executed by Rear Admiral David C. Cather, July 17, 1928, Henry P. Adair and W. Allan Perkins, acting as Attorneys for The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, be and are hereby authorized and directed to execute, in the name and on behalf of said The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, and to deliver to said Florida National Bank, Trustee as aforesaid, a receipt for such payment and a release by which said Florida National Bank, Trustee as aforesaid, shall be acquitted and forever discharged from any further liability or duty to said The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, arising out of, or that may be incidental to said Trust Agreement of July 17, 1928.

Before acting under this resolution I reached the conclusion that the terms of the proposed release were too broad and that our acquittance to the Florida National Bank, Trustee, should be confined solely to the fund which was in controversy in the chancery cause wherein said Bank is Plaintiff and Harry Lupton Cather and others are Defendants, now pending in the Circuit Court in and for Duval County, Florida.

I now ask, therefore, that the resolution of November 14, 1947, above set out be rescinded and that in place thereof a resolution be adopted in similar terms except that instead of authorizing a general release of all claims of every sort and however arising, this authorization be limited to a release only of such rights as the University has in the fund which is the subject of controversy in the Chancery Cause above referred to.

It was, thereupon -

**RESOLVED,** That on recommendation of W. Allan Perkins, Attorney for the University, the resolution adopted by this Board at its meeting held November 14, 1947, authorizing said W. Allan Perkins and Henry P. Adair of Jacksonville, Florida, to execute and deliver to Florida National Bank of Jacksonville, Trustee, a general release of all rights of the University under the Cather Trust be and is hereby revoked and rescinded.

And be it further -

**RESOLVED,** That upon payment of $5,170.18 to Vincent Shea, Bursar of the University of Virginia, by The Florida National Bank of Jacksonville, Florida, as Trustee under Trust Agreement executed by Rear Admiral David C. Cather, July 17, 1928, Henry P. Adair and W. Allan Perkins, acting as Attorneys for The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, be and are hereby authorized and directed to execute, in the name and on the behalf of said The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, and to deliver to the said The Florida National Bank of Jacksonville, Trustee as aforesaid, a receipt for such payment and a release by which said The Florida National Bank of Jacksonville, Trustee as aforesaid, and in its own corporate capacity, shall be acquitted and forever discharged from any further liability or duty to said The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, with respect to that portion of the aforesaid Trust which is the fund involved in the cause now pending in the Circuit Court in and for Duval County, Florida, wherein The Florida National Bank of Jacksonville, as Trustee, is Plaintiff, and Harry Lupton Cather, et al., are Defendants.

W. Allan Perkins appeared before the Board, not in his capacity as Attorney for the University, but on behalf of himself and George Pausch of Baltimore, Maryland as Co-Executors under the will of the late William J. Rucker and Co-Trustees under said Rucker's Trust instrument of April 19, 1939.

Mr. Perkins stated that the administration of this estate has now reached a point where distribution of the greater part thereof, now remaining in the hands of the Executors and Trustees, can be made.

The estate now in the hands of these Executors and Trustees is made up as follows:

And the Executors and Trustees now propose to make distribution thereof among the three Beneficiaries under Mr. Rucker's will and Trust agreement as follows:

This distribution will leave approximately $140,000.00 in hands of the Executors and Trustees from which will be paid balances of Attorney fees, Commissions, Taxes, costs, etc., the exact amount of which cannot be accurately determined at this time.

Statements showing the exact plan of this proposed distribution in detail were submitted with this report and Mr. Perkins asked that a resolution be adopted approving said plan and authorizing a representative of this Board to sign written statements by which the University agrees thereto.

Mr. Thomas B. Gay then stated that he had examined this statement above referred to and had discussed this plan of distribution in all of its phases with Mr. Perkins, and he thereupon offered the following resolution:

**RESOLVED,** That a copy of the plan of distribution of portions of the absolute estate and of the trust estate of the late William J. Rucker now held by W. Allan Perkins and George Pausch as Executors and as Trustees, which plan was submitted to this meeting by said W. Allan Perkins, be filed in the Bursar's Office, that said plan of distribution is hereby approved, and Edward R. Stettinius, Jr., Rector, is hereby authorized and directed in the name and on behalf of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, to execute the certificates which are written at the end of each statement and each of which reads as follows:- "The foregoing plan of distribution is hereby approved as of December 8, 1947."

This resolution being seconded by Judge A. D. Barksdale was unanimously adopted.

A proposal by Mrs. Wailes to segregate principal and income of the Rucker gift described in the above resolution to the Rucker Crippled Children's Home was tabled pending further study of the matter.

The Scholarship Committee presented a report concerning the award of Bayly-Tiffany scholarships to students of Mary Washington College and recommended the adoption of the following resolution, which was approved by the Board.

In view of the fact that the large G.I. benefits now available as educational scholarships make the demands on University scholarship funds less pressing, and since the Attorney General has ruled that Bayly-Tiffany funds may be used for the benefit of students at Mary Washington College of the University of Virginia,

**BE IT RESOLVED,** that the Chairman of the Scholarship Committee of the University of Virginia be directed to use such Bayly-Tiffany Scholarship funds as remain after awards have been made to students of the University at Charlottesville to award scholarships to students of Mary Washington College on the same basis as to students of the University at Charlottesville.

Representatives of the Student Council appeared before the Board, with Mr. Lilburn Talley, President, as principal spokesman. He stated that the Student Council desired additional time to devise a plan for student conduct, and requested the Board to defer action on imposing rules of conduct until the Student Council has had more opportunity to work out a solution.

The Council suggested a University police force to enforce regulations established by the Student Council. The Council would serve as a judiciary body to try brought before by the special police.

Mr. Stettinius stated that the Board did not want to impose stringent rules and regulations governing student behavior.

President Darden raised the question of how the culprits could be apprehended and brought before the Council.

The Council desires twenty-four hour service of groundsmen available to answer complaints, the groundsmen to be employed by the University, Mr. Talley stated.

The President pointed out that he thought the Student Council the most effective agency for student government and it appeared inadvisable to divide responsibility between the Student Council and the Interfraternity Council. He felt that the two organizations could be brought together in a common cause.

Mr. Gay pointed out that the Board of Visitors is, under the law of Virginia, constituted the policy-determining body of the University and it is primarily charged with formulating regulations affecting the Faculty and students, and that while the President, as the administrative officer, should administer and enforce such regulations, the authority for their formulation and determination should not be delegated by the Board of Visitors.

The President stated he wanted the Student Council to enforce the rules finally adopted, and that if the Council failed, he would undertake, as the executive officer of the Board, to enforce such rules and regulations, but that he did not wish to take this step until every effort had been made to create responsible student government.

At the request of the Visitors, Mr. Joseph Carter, President of the Interfraternity Council, appeared and presented the following proposed rules which had been agreed upon by the Council.

1. Ladies may be admitted to fraternity houses between the hours of 12 noon and 10 p.m. on Monday through Thursday inclusive, and between the hours of 10 a.m. and 12 midnight on Friday, 10 a.m. and 1 a.m. on Saturday, and 10 a.m. and 12 midnight on Sunday. No ladies are to remain in fraternity houses after the designated hours unless approved chaperons are present. The Dean of Students will be requested to compile a list of approved chaperons. Ladies are to be entertained in living and recreation rooms only.

2. Fraternity houses shall be conducted in an orderly and gentlemanly manner.

3. Special rules will be made for dance weekends and special occasions by the Interfraternity Council.

4. Each fraternity shall be responsible for the enforcement of these rules and for the conduct of its members. The Interfraternity Council shall assume full jurisdiction over the enforcement of the rules as applied to fraternity houses, and over the punishment of any violations thereof.

Mr. Carter stated that twenty-four fraternities were members of the Council and that while the rules had not been accepted by all the chapters, a majority had signified their willingness to be bound by them. He pointed out to the Visitors the difficulty of persuading the fraternity representatives that it is their responsibility to formulate rules for the conduct of their chapters. In reply to questions as to the late hours and lack of chaperones, he stated that while the rules might be regarded as liberal they represented, in his opinion, the maximum in regulation that the fraternities and the Interfraternity Council would agree to enforce.

Mr. Carter stated further that he believed progress was being made in formulating rules by the Interfraternity Council, the Student Council, and the President.

The President stated to the Visitors that Mr. Carter had been unflagging in his efforts to arrive at a workable plan for the government of fraternities at the University, and that the rules submitted, which represented a substantial achievement, were in no small part brought about by his industry and perseverance.

The Visitors after a lengthy discussion of the subject with Mr. Carter tendered him their thanks for his assistance and excused him.

President Darden asked Mr. Edward C. Anderson to present to the Board a brief summary of conferences held by the Student Activities Committee of the Board of Visitors with the Interfraternity Council, from the formation of the Student Activities Committee in June of 1946 until the present. Mr. Anderson made the following statement.

"The first contact which I had with student representatives dealing with regulations governing fraternity houses occurred in the late summer of 1946. A committee of students called on me at my home to report that the Interfraternity Council had presented a set of regulations to President Newcomb during the spring or early summer of that year and that President Newcomb had returned the regulations to the Interfraternity Council without comment. The committee calling on me wanted to know what the council should do next. I told them that the Board of Visitors had recently appointed a Committee on Student Affairs and that this committee would shortly meet with the Interfraternity Council and consider the question of regulations governing fraternity houses.

"On October 10th the Student Affairs Committee of the Board of Visitors, consisting of Mrs. Ben Wailes, Judge A. D. Barksdale, Mr. Richard Carrington, Jr. and myself as Chairman, met with the Interfraternity Council. The set of regulations governing conduct in the fraternity houses and setting forth visiting hours for ladies which had been presented to President Newcomb, were again presented by the Interfraternity Council. These regulations were identical with those which were later presented by the Interfraternity Council to the Board of Visitors at its meeting on December 12, 1947. A full evening was devoted to discussing the regulations in question, student behavior in general and particularly the boy-girl problem in the fraternity houses. The committee tried to emphasize to the students the concern which the Board of Visitors felt that no adequate regulations dealing with the visiting hours of young ladies were in force; also these students were told that the Board of Visitors did not wish to prepare rules of conduct governing the fraternity houses but was very anxious that the fraternities themselves should prepare and enforce a set of regulations which would properly control behavior in the fraternity houses and set reasonable limitations on the visiting of young ladies in such houses. It is my recollection that we discussed with the Interfraternity Council a possibility of employing house mothers or chaperons in order to improve conditions.

"The set of regulations which the Interfraternity Council presented at the meeting was returned to them by the committee as inadequate and the meeting adjourned with the committee of the board feeling that the Interfraternity Council would consider the question further and would present a new set of regulations which would more nearly meet the ideas of the committee. The Interfraternity Council did not indicate that it would do this. In fact, the statements made by members of the council were to the effect that the report of conditions at the university was greatly exaggerated and there was no need of any change being made."

Dean Newman was asked to appear and he presented to the Visitors information which he had gathered from other institutions bearing on student life. He also presented a copy of the rules under which the fraternity houses operated at the University during the year 1942-43 - the last year before the demands of the armed services made it impossible for the houses to continue. He also presented information from some of the national organizations showing the rules governing the chapters making up their membership. This information furnished by Dean Newman is set forth below.

"Women guests are never permitted in any fraternity house which does not have a housemother. In case a fraternity should be without a housemother, women guests are permitted in the house only when there is an approved chaperone present. In all cases, women guests must be out of the fraternity houses at 10:45 P.M., which is the time the women students have to be in their dormitories or sorority houses. The special arrangements made for dances provide for chaperoned parties to be given for one hour after the end of each dance. The dances and at 1:00 A.M. for Friday night dances and at 12:00 midnight for Saturday night dances."

Women shall not enter any student's room, club, or fraternity between the hours of 1:00 and 7:00 P.M. without permission, and then only when there is a chaperone. On special occasions, (football games, dances, etc.) the time is extended to 9:00 P.M.

"The privilege of entertaining unchaperoned women student visitors in fraternity houses is based upon the acceptance of certain basic standards. The acceptance is made in the form of a pledge to uphold these standards, and the pledge is binding on the fraternity that gives it and on every individual of that fraternity.

"It devolves upon the House Privileges Board to assume the responsibility for the program of unchaperoned visiting and guarantee the environment of a gracious home for women student visitors.

"The House Privileges Board accepts the responsibility for the overall administration of the visiting program. The Interfraternity Council and the Women's Council are jointly responsible for enforcing the agreement. The assumption of responsibility is not taken lightly by this Board and the following agreement will be administered and enforced in such a manner as to fulfill the obligations we have accepted.

"The fundamental standards for fraternities, governing conduct in the presence of women student visitors, are:

1. Women students may be entertained only in the social rooms approved by the House Privileges Board.

2. Approved houses shall be open to women students from 12:00 noon until the dormitory closing time for women.

3. There shall be no consumption of alcoholic beverages in the presence of, or by, women students in the house or on the premises of any fraternity.

"Every fraternity member shall be bound to uphold his part in the commitment of his fraternity. Every fraternity member shall be required to prevent the occurrence of violations on the property of his fraternity.

"The individual fraternity is responsible for the conduct of all visitors on its property. The term "visitors" is all-inclusive."

Dean's personal comment on the subject: "This matter of women students' visiting in fraternity houses has given us plenty of trouble. ...With all its faults this plan is still in vogue awaiting some better or more satisfactory arrangement. . . If you find one that is more satisfactory I hope you will let us know."

"Fraternity members are responsible collectively and individually for conduct within their fraternity house.

"Members of fraternities desiring to entertain ladies in their fraternity house are required to register such entertainment in the office of the Dean of Student Affairs at least one week in advance of the date on which the entertainment is to take place. Two married ladies and not the wives of undergraduate students will be required to act officially as chaperons and their names and addresses must be given at the time of registration. When written acceptance has been received from the chaperons, the entertainment will be duly registered and the fraternity notified.

"It is not necessary to comply with these registration requirements when ladies are to be entertained in a fraternity house between the hours of Noon to 2:00 P.M. and 5:30 to 8:00 P.M. on Wednesdays and Fridays, and Noon to 8:00 p.m. on Saturdays and Sundays."

From the General Regulations:

"Students will be held strictly responsible for the conduct which occurs in their rooms. Students must control their visitors.

From the "Gentleman's Agreement"

"It is understood that it is the duty of the resident undergraduate members to see that all ladies leave the club at nine o'clock. Upon the President of the club granting written permission, an undergraduate may have a lady in the club after nine but in no case later than eleven o'clock in the evening. The resident undergraduate members must report to the President the following morning the names of those members who had lady guests after nine o'clock, whether they stated that they had permission from the President or not."

"All mixed functions at fraternity houses after 6:00 p.m. will be chaperoned by a couple, or two or more women of 30 years or over, selected from a list which has been previously approved by the university. This list will be turned in for approval in order to meet future requirements. There will be no women in the houses before noon.

"Saturday night and holiday eve parties at fraternity houses will cease at 1:00 a.m.

"Friday and Sunday night parties will cease at 11:00 p.m.

"Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday night parties will be held only with special permission of the university; time to be designated by them."

"Ladies may be in the fraternity houses unchaperoned until 9:00 p.m., but if they stay from 9 to 1 there must be chaperones."

From Dartmouth College: Report of the Special Committee on Rules:

The seven institutions (Amherst, Bowdoin, Harvard, Princeton, Wesleyan, Williams, and Yale) show no uniformity in their regulations relating to women guests in students' rooms. Amherst and Bowdoin prohibit women guests in the dormitory rooms at any time. The latter (and presumably the former) permits them in the social rooms of fraternity houses until 9 on week nights and until 12 on Saturday and party nights. Only when accompanied by their own or the students' parents or guardians are they permitted to visit a student's upstairs quarters.

"Harvard permits women guests in a student's room only between the hours of 1 and 7 P.M. and then only with the permission of the housemaster or the dormitory proctor. A chaperone is also required.

"Williams allows women guests in students' rooms only with the express permission of the Dean and then only between the hours of 1 and 6:30 P.M.

"Princeton permits an "attended woman guest" in a student's room between the hours of 12 noon and 6 P.M. Yale likewise permits women guests in students' rooms but only between the hours of 12 noon and 6 P.M. unless written permission for a longer visit is first secured from the Dean or housemaster. Wesleyan permits women guests in students' rooms between the hours of 2 and 6 P.M. with the permission of the dormitory proctor, who incidentally, is an undergraduate."

These conditions, mutually agreed upon by a committee representing the fraternities and by the administrative officers of the University on September 24, 1942, shall be in force from this date during their faithful observance. In case they are not effective in correcting abuses, they are subject to revision or repeal.

In the event of violation of any of these conditions by any fraternity at the University of Virginia, the offending chapter house shall be closed by the University either permanently or for such a period as the University may determine.

I. Women shall be admitted to fraternity houses under the following conditions:

A. They shall under all circumstances be admitted only to the living and recreation rooms.

B. From Monday through Thursday women may visit fraternity houses from 1:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. This permission does not apply to residents of Charlottesville and vicinity, which includes those living in or within five miles of the city limits of Charlottesville; or to nurses, co-eds, and visitors who remain longer than two weeks. Mothers, wives, and sisters of active members shall be exempt from restrictions applying to residents of Charlottesville.

C. From 1:30 p.m. Friday till 7:30 p.m. Sunday, women may be in the fraternity houses during the following hours:

D. On nights of authorized University Dances, the night hours shall be extended to one hour after the dance.

E. For special occasions, permission for any extension of these hours must be obtained from the Dean of the University.

II. General open mixed parties must be registered with the Dean of the University and suitable chaperons approved by him must be present. Those parties must be confined to the inner limits of the house.

III. If alcoholic drinks are served at any party, alternative non-alcoholic drinks must be provided.

IV. No after-dance party may be authorized by the Dean.

V. A Counsellor for each fraternity house will be appointed by the Dean of the University. The Counsellor will live in the fraternity house and be responsible to the Dean for the conduct of the house.

VI. An Advisory Board of five Counsellors appointed by the Dean will advise with him on uniform house rules.

VII. Women of bad character are not permitted in a fraternity house at any time.

VIII. Decent and upright conduct shall be maintained at all time, and no conduct will be tolerated that reflects in any way upon the good name of the fraternity or of the University. This applies to excessive drinking, excessive noise, indecent exposure, objectionable language, and offensive conduct in general.

The majority of the national fraternities follow the lead of the institutions in which they have chapters thereby letting each institution set its own standard. Although there are individual variations, this policy may be stated as follows:

Each chapter must observe all the rules and regulations which exist in the institution in which it is located. The regulations on drinking and liquor are definitely included in this statement of policy.

In other words, the institution decides on its rules and the national fraternity exerts every effort possible to see that these rules are observed by its chapter at that institution.

The national fraternities represented at the University which follow the above principle or policy are: Beta Theta Pi, Chi Phi, Delta Psi (St. Anthony Hall), Kappa Alpha, Kappa Sigma, Phi Epsilon Pi, Phi Gamma Delta, Phi Kappa Psi, Phi Kappa Sigma, Sigma Phi Epsilon, Theta Delta Chi, Zeta Psi.

"The General Statutes of Phi Delta Theta Fraternity" states, in part, as follows: "Every chapter occupying a chapter house must adopt strict rules for the government thereof, which shall, among other things, prohibit all gambling, use or presence of intoxicating liquors and other forms of vice in the chapter house."

"House Rules. Gambling, harboring immoral persons, and use of intoxicating liquor as a beverage, in a Chapter house or hall of the Fraternity, or at any banquet or event held in the name or under the auspices of the Fraternity, or any Chapter or alumni organization thereof, are forbidden."

"Sigma Chi has in its Constitution a prohibition against bringing liquor into the chapter house or the consuming of the same therein. This prohibition is for the use of liquor in the house at any time and for any occasion."

Statutes, Chapter VIII, Section 9:

"First. The value of character and the honor of a good name being cherished, the chapter shall forbid any form of gambling, the use of intoxicating liquors, the presence of any degraded persons or the utterance of any language which is filthy, obscene or ungodly.

"Fifth. Suspension shall be the minimum penalty in case of violation of these Chapter House Rules."

"Our fraternity has a definite national ban against use of intoxicating liquors in the fraternity chapter houses either by individuals as individuals or for planned entertainment."

"The Zeta Beta Tau National Fraternity prohibits drinking in chapter houses."

Fraternities who have not furnished information on this subject are: Alpha Epsilon Pi, Alpha Tau Omega, Delta Kappa Epsilon, Delta Phi (St. Elmo Hall), Phi Alpha, Pi Kappa Alpha.

Dean Newman suggested to the Visitors that it would be most effective if a joint agreement could be arrived at with the Interfraternity Council and he expressed the hope that negotiations might continue.

The Visitors, after a mature consideration of the problem, concluded unanimously that it was incumbent upon them to establish a code governing the operations of the fraternities. They expressed the belief that the proposals of the Interfraternity Council were not suitable in that the hours for entertainment would interfere with studying in the fraternity houses and further that the lack of chaperones when young ladies were being entertained at late hours, was undesirable.

After consideration of the Interfraternity Council plan, the Board amended their rules to read as follows:

1. Fraternity houses shall be conducted in an orderly and gentlemanly manner.

2. Women are to be entertained in living and recreation rooms only.

3. No women shall be permitted in fraternity houses on Monday through Friday before 3:00 P.M. nor after 8:00 P.M. under any circumstances.

4. No women shall be permitted in fraternity houses on Saturday and Sunday before 11:00 A.M. nor after 8:00 P.M. under any circumstances.

5. With the proviso that on Friday and Saturday nights women shall be permitted in fraternity houses until 1:00 A.M. if chaperones approved by the Dean of Students are present.

6. The officers of each fraternity shall be held responsible for enforcing these rules.

It was understood that there would be no publication of the rules until they could be presented to the Interfraternity Council by the President who was asked by the Visitors to thank the Council for their suggestions.

A committee from the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity membership appeared before the Board with Mr. John D. Haxall as Chairman. The committee submitted new house rules put into effect after the "Hollins incident."

Mr. J. H. Newman, Dean of Students, was called in for a discussion of this case.

The President recommended the barring of all women visitors to the fraternity for the remainder of the 1947-48 session.

Dean Newman stated that he did not believe the house should be closed; he recommended the barring of all women visitors to the fraternity for a period of twelve months. He recommended that the fraternity and members be placed on probation for twelve months, the penalty for individuals involved being to require the four members to move from the house and to be placed on probation for twelve months. He further recommended that the chapter be required to elect new officers.

Judge Barksdale moved the adoption of the following resolution; the resolution was approved by all Board members except Mr. Gay, who believed it to be inadequate.

Taking cognizance of a recent occurrence at the SPE fraternity house, the Board of Visitors of the University at its monthly meeting of December 12 adopted the following resolution:

1. That all women visitors be barred from the SPE House for the remainder of the 1947-48 session.

2. That the SPE fraternity be placed on probation for the remainder of the 1947-48 session.

3. That the four members of the SPE fraternity directly involved or who had knowledge of the occurrence be prohibited from living in the SPE House and be placed on probation for the remainder of the 1947-48 session.

Mr. Gay then moved the adoption of the following resolution:

**RESOLVED** that no ladies be permitted in the SPE House for the remainder of the 1947-48 session; that the house be put on probation; that the four members directly involved be prohibited from living in the house for the remainder of the 1947-48 session and that they be placed on probation; and -

**BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED** that the Board recommends that the fraternity membership remove its present officers.

The foregoing resolution was defeated, Mr. Gay, Mrs. Calcott, and Dr. Trout voting in favor of it.

The Secretary of the Board was directed to inform members of the faculty whose names appear on a list of applicants for University houses to apply to the Buildings and Grounds Committee of the Board if they desire to be considered in the assignment of the house formerly occupied by Mr. E. I. Carruthers.

The Board originally approved the expenditure by the Development Fund of $161,000 through December 27, 1947. Mr. Anderson requested the Board to approve the expenditure of $71,685.26 or as much thereof as necessary to carry the Development Fund until March 20, 1948, and the request was approved as submitted.

Visitor: Dr. Jordan.

Dr. Jordan proposed the adoption of an interim plan to be made retroactive to July 1, 1947. The interim plan was simply the master plan in effect up to June 30, 1945, with one exception - that the ceiling on earnings be raised from $15,000 to $20,000 per year. Dr. Jordan further recommended that the permanent plan as shown below be installed July 1, 1948.

President Darden pointed out that Dr. Jordan had been requested to submit an interim plan which would be made retroactive to July 1, 1947. The President further stated that he believed the interim plan should not, however, be retroactive, but should be made effective January 1, 1948. He proposed that the interim plan be made effective January 1, 1948 and that the permanent plan be placed in operation as soon as arrangements could be made to finance such a program. The Board unanimously approved the President's proposal. The permanent plan provisions are as follows:

Head of the Department of Surgery and Gynecology - Salary from the University, $15,000.00; fees from limited private practice credited to the department, not to individual.

Head of the Department of Internal Medicine - Salary from the University, $15,000.00; fees from limited private practice credited to the department, not to individual.

Salary scale of other faculty members, exclusive of those in the Departments of Clinical Pathology, Roentgenology, Ophthalmology and Otolaryngology, where special arrangements obtain.

All professors of grades Full, Associate, and Assistant are required to contribute 20% of current earnings from private practice for running expense of their respective departments, including support of research.

The annual surpluses above ceilings from private practice earnings are to be allowed to accumulate and remain intact to be placed in a common fund from which to draw for the improvement and development of the Medical School as a whole. All financial transactions must clear through the Office of the Bursar.

And be it further -

**RESOLVED** that the salaries of all employees of medical departments other than doctors be brought in line with the State Classification plan for such employees.

The Board learned with great pleasure of the appointment of Dr. Allan Gregg by the Governor for the purpose of making a study of the Department of Medicine, and it welcomes him to the University.

The Board authorized the President to make available to Dr. Gregg all the records of the University and to assist him in every way possible in the discharge of his important assignment.

The following resolution was adopted:

**RESOLVED,** by the Board of Visitors of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, that Mary Washington College of the University of Virginia be and is hereby authorized, subject to the approval of the Governor, to purchase the Jenkins property, known as "Trench Hill," containing approximately seven acres of land and the improvements thereon, and to pay a sum not exceeding $80,000 from its operating fund, and upon execution of the deed, together with the certificate of title and abstract approved by the attorney for the University, the proper officers of the Board are authorized and directed to accept said deed, and make payment as herein set forth to the owner, and have said deed recorded.

The following resolution was adopted:

**RESOLVED,** by the Board of Visitors of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, that Mary Washington College of the University of Virginia be and is hereby authorized to purchase from Mr. Edgar Bernard lot number eleven, in block number fifty, as shown on the plat of the Fredericksburg Development Corporation, and to pay a sum not exceeding $1,750 from its operating fund, and upon execution of the deed, together with certificate of title and abstract approved by the attorney for the University, the proper officers of the Board are authorized and directed to accept said deed, and make payment as herein set forth to the owner, and have said deed recorded.

The following resolution was adopted:

**RESOLVED,** by the Board of Visitors of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, that Mary Washington College of the University of Virginia be and is hereby authorized to purchase a bus to cost approximately $20,000 from Student Activity Funds which have been held in reserve for that purpose, and that the Division of Purchase and Printing be consulted as to its purchase.

On motion made by Mr. Gay, the problem of student enrollment by classes at Mary Washington College was referred for study to the Committee on Mary Washington College.

Mr. Gay moved that the question of the advisability of maintaining a student band at Mary Washington College which appears in other cities of the State be referred to the Committee on Mary Washington College for study. The motion was adopted.

There being no further business to come before the meeting, the same was adjourned after a motion to that effect had been made, seconded, and carried.
