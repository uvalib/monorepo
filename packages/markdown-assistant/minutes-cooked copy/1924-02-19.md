From Mr. William A. Clark, Jr., two Jefferson Items, for the University Library.

From Dr. Joseph A. Abraham, a pamphlet "The Seven Days Battle in Front of Richmond" to the University Library; also to the Museum, a piece of mahogany from the rafters of the first stone church built on the Western Hemisphere, and an Indian Stone Hammer found in British Columbia near Prince Rupert.

A committee composed of the Rector and Visitors, Dillard, Scott and Williams was appointed to press before the Legislature, now in session, a bill introduced by Senator Early, at the request of President Alderman, asking for an appropriation of $250,000, conditional upon the raising of $750,000 by the University for the Medical School.

The appointment of Dr. Vincent W. Archer as instructor in Roentgenology was approved.

The request of Dr. Theodore Hough, Dean of the Medical College, for an appropriation of $1050.00 to pay the salaries of two additional nurses needed in the work in Pediatrics, under Doctor Royster, for the balance of the fiscal year 1923-24 was approved.

A report of the Committee on Buildings and Grounds with respect to permanent supervision and control of the new heating plant was submitted and approved, as follows:

The Committee on Saturday, October 13th had interviews with Dr. Hancock and Dr. Lambeth and saw both heating plants. The Committee is of the opinion that it would be well for them to be under one head and as Dr. Hancock has resigned, advise that Dr. Lambeth be placed in charge of all heating plants.

The Committee wishes to express its appreciation of Dr. Hancock's invaluable aid in the installation of the heating plant.

This report is the unanimous opinion of the committee and their names are signed to the same by W. R. Duke at their request.

All of which is most respectfully submitted,

Report of the special Committee in the matter of certain correspondence between Mrs. Josie W. Rodes, the Rector and the Governor, concerning the Cafeteria, was read and ordered filed.

The President presented to the meeting a form of receipt which he stated to the Board he had received from Mr. William Cabell Bruce, on January 2nd., Mr. Bruce as the Executor of J. Douglas Bruce, having requested that this receipt be properly executed on behalf of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia.

The purpose of said receipt is to give to said William Cabell Bruce, Executor of J. Douglas Bruce, complete acquittance for the sum of Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00) cash paid the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia in compliance with bequest contained in the will of said J. Douglas Bruce, said receipt being in the following form:

RECEIVED of William Cabell Bruce, Executor of the Estate of J. Douglas Bruce, deceased, the sum of Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000.00) cash, in full compliance of the special bequest made by the said J. Douglas Bruce in his last will and testament, which was executed on November 4, 1918, and probated in the County Court of Knox County, Tennessee, and we hereby release the said Executor and the said Estate of any other liability so far as we are concerned, growing out of or pertaining to our interest as a beneficiary under the will.

After considering the above matter, it was

RESOLVED, That the Rector be and he is hereby requested to execute this receipt in the name and on behalf of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, and the Secretary is requested to return the receipt to Mr. William Cabell Bruce after it is so executed.

A proposed contract with the Virginia Trust Company for care of securities, etc., was read, discussed and referred to the Rector with power to enter into a contract with the said Company.

The matter of a site on the University grounds for the location of a Preventorium, requested by the State Teachers Association, was disposed of in the following resolution:

RESOLVED, That we view with friendly interest the application of the State Teachers Association for a building site and refer same to the Committee on Buildings and Grounds to investigate and report back at the April meeting.

The request of Dr. Hudnut to be allowed to make certain changes at No. 55 West Range, building a garage and garden, was granted and the following resolution in regard thereto adopted.

RESOLVED, That the improvements as requested by Dr. Hudnut at No. 55 West Range, be and are hereby approved and the sum of $800.00 be appropriated to cover same, and that $48.00, representing interest on the cost of the improvements, be added to the annual rental of the residence, said improvements to be approved by the President and the Superintendent of Buildings and Grounds.

The allotment of the Minor house to the Graduate School was approved.

A report from Dr. S. A. Mitchell on the financial side of the eclipse expedition was read and ordered spread on the minutes.

I have the honor herewith to report on the work of the expedition sent to California by the Leander of McCormick Observatory to make observations on the total eclipse of the sun on September 10, 1923.

The expedition was made possible through a generous grant of $1,000 from the Board of Visitors. This was supplemented by a gift of $1500 from the Leander McCormick Estate and $500 from the National Academy of Sciences. A total of $3000 was thus available. By great good fortune all of the necessary instruments and apparatus were secured without cost to the University, being loaned by the U. S. Naval Observatory. Still greater good fortune was in store for the McCormick expedition, for all of the apparatus was carried to San Diego and return by naval vessels and entirely without cost to us. But our good fortune did not end there. Permission had been received from the Chief of Coast Artillery to locate the eclipse expedition within the military reservation at Point Loma, San Diego. On arrival in California we were amazed to find that officers' quarters were provided for us at Point Loma and entirely without cost. No hotel bills were necessary for our living and the total expense consisted of one dollar per day per person for meals. Even our transportation within the state of California was almost without cost for we bought an automobile, used it for six weeks of our stay and sold it again for the price paid for it.

In addition to myself the expedition consisted of Dr. L. G. Hoxton, Professor and Mrs. H. T. Stetson of Harvard, my wife and son and several persons living in California.

The instruments have all been returned and have been received at the Naval Observatory without loss or breakage.

It is greatly to be regretted that clouds in "sunny California" prevented the securing of any results of scientific value. Nevertheless the expedition should not be looked upon as a total loss for the reason that the good name of the University of Virginia was widely and favorably advertised throughout the length and breadth of the United States.

Due to reasons stated above, the expedition cost much less than was expected. In fact the total cost was only $1500. This money was spent to defray the travel and subsistence of Hoxton and myself (all other members of the expedition paid their own expenses) and the necessary expenses of equipment, etc., connected with such an expedition. A balance of $1500 is thus on hand from the original $3000.

The next total eclipse to be observed will be that of January 24, 1925, the last total eclipse to be visible in the United States for the next fifty years. This eclipse will be visible in New York State and in New England. In fact the great City of New York will be on the edge of the track of totality up-town New York will see the total eclipse while downtown New York will not see the corona. In view of the fact that this eclipse will take place so near at home and so close to the centers of great population of the country it would be well that the University of Virginia be represented in the eclipse field.

The 1925 eclipse will make my sixth total eclipse. My book on "Eclipses of the Sun" has made me one of the recognized authorities on eclipses and I have been elected by the American Astronomical Society their chairman of the committee on eclipses to look after the 1925 phenomenon.

I am requesting the Leander McCormick family for permission to use the unexpended portion of the eclipse grant for the purpose of sending an expedition to the 1925 eclipse. I herewith make a similar request of the Board of Visitors. Its original grant of $1000 will thus help to finance two expeditions instead of one.

Expressing to you my great appreciation of the generous spirit of the Board in granting the large sum of one thousand dollars for research in pure science, and trusting that the Leander McCormick Observatory may have an expedition to observe the 1925 eclipse, I am,

A letter from the Jefferson Society to President Alderman offering to loan a portrait of Thomas Jefferson, by Thomas Sully, now in possession of the Jefferson Society, to the University of Virginia, under certain conditions, was read and the offer accepted.

Your letter of the eleventh was duly received. I went over this morning to see Mr. Bradford about the transfer of the portrait of Jefferson in the Colonnade Club to Jefferson Hall. With the assistance of the janitor there, I hung the picture where Sully's Jefferson formerly hung.

We have ordered the plate for the Sully portrait which will soon be in condition to be hung in the Rotunda.

I regret that this matter has been extended over such a period of time, but the formal adoption of the transfer by the Society necessitated the delay.

The Jefferson Society has now in its possession a portrait of Thomas Jefferson by Thomas Sully purchased some seventy years ago by the Society for the sum of approximately five hundred dollars.

Recognizing that this portrait is highly valuable and that its present position in the hall of this Society is precarious at this suggestion of the President of the University the Society has determined to lend it to the University of Virginia for safe-keeping and display.

In making this loan the Society desires to emphasize the following conditions:

1. The picture is lent with the understanding that it is to be hung in the Rotunda. Its removal from the Rotunda for any purpose shall be subject to the approval of the Jefferson Society.

2. The picture is lent as a unit of portrait, frame and explanatory plate.

3. The picture shall continue to be the unrestricted property of the Society and subject to recall at any time.

4. The Society understands that it is to receive as a loan the portrait of Jefferson, now hanging in the Colonnade Club to remain in its custody during the absence of the Sully portrait.

5. Copies of this communication are to be inserted in the minutes of the Board of Visitors of the Board of Visitors of the University and in the minutes of the Jefferson Society. A third copy is to be placed in the hands of the Librarian.

The above conditions shall be regarded as accepted by all concerned when the signatures of the President of the University and representatives of Jefferson Society have been affixed.

A letter from Dr. John L. Manahan asking approval of the Rector and Visitors of the announcement of the work leading to the degree of Bachelor of Science in Health Education and Bachelor of Science in Physical Education, was read and the programs approved.

A communication from John Armstrong Chaloner enclosing copy of Resolution of Thanks, adopted by the Community League of Roanoke Rapids, N. C., for the donation of land owned by the University of Virginia in Roanoke Rapids, was read and ordered filed.

The request of the University of Virginia Rifle Club for permission to use the old "Barracks" for a rifle range was considered and approved.

The matter of revoking an agreement between Paul G. McIntire and the United States Trust Company of New York, covering the endowment funds held by them in trust for the University of Virginia, and the execution of a new agreement covering this trust was disposed of in the following resolution.

RESOLVED, by the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the Rector is authorized and directed to sign a revocation of the original trust agreement between Paul G. McIntire and the United States Trust Company of New York, dated December 5, 1923, covering funds held in trust for the University of Virginia, and to execute a new agreement covering this trust, and the Secretary directed to spread copies of the revocation and new agreement on the minutes of this meeting. (See below—Agreement).

Several members of the Kappa Alpha Fraternity appeared before the meeting to petition for change of the Board's grant of site for a fraternity house, heretofore made them on McCormick Road, to a location on Carr's Hill. Upon hearing the several petitioners a motion duly made and seconded, was adopted reconsidering the former action of the Board in said matter. Following this action a motion, duly made and seconded, was adopted, referring the question of change of location of the site to Carr's Hill to a committee consisting of the Chairman of the Grounds and Buildings Committee and Messrs. Scott and McIntire for consideration and report at the April meeting.

Mr. Scott reported that after a very careful consideration of the matter of the disposition of sewage from the Memorial Gymnasium, it had been found necessary to abandon the construction of the proposed sewer line and to substitute tanks and pumps and force the sewage up to the sewer line at a point near the Chapel. The cost would be about $4,500 with an approximate cost of operation of $25.00 per month. After consideration of this report, the following resolution was adopted:

RESOLVED, That the Committee on New Gymnasium be authorized to expend not to exceed $4,500 in installing the necessary sewage disposal for the Gymnasium, and

RESOLVED, further, that the Committee be and is hereby given full power in the matter of accepting the said Gymnasium and making final settlement with the contractors, including the question of liquidated damages, provided in the contract. (Offered by Oliver.)

The President reported that the construction of the new wing to the Hospital had been completed, and, on motion, the following resolution was adopted:

RESOLVED, That the Committee on Buildings and Grounds be and is hereby authorized to accept the New Hospital Wing from the contractors and to make final settlement with them for same, including the matter of liquidated damages.

By an agreement dated June 23rd, 1922, Paul G. McIntire transferred to UNITED STATES TRUST COMPANY OF NEW YORK $160,000.00 par value United States of America Third Liberty Loan converted 4-1/4% bonds and $40,000.00 par value United States of America Fourth Liberty Loan 4-1/4% bonds in trust for the uses and purposes set forth in said agreement, one of which was that upon certain limitations therein set forth, said Trust Company should pay the net income from said trust fund to the University of Virginia to provide for certain scholarships as set out in said trust agreement.

Since the execution of said agreement, the University of Virginia has requested Mr. McIntire to make certain changes in the trust therein set out with reference to said scholarships and in compliance with said request Mr. McIntire has executed a revocation of said trust agreement and also a new agreement of trust, which new agreement is dated December 5, 1923.

In order that said new agreement may become operative, it is necessary that the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia unite with Mr. McIntire in the revocation of the original trust.

An instrument revoking said trust and which is signed by Paul G. McIntire was presented to the meeting by the attorney for the University, copy thereof being attached to this resolution. It is thereupon

RESOLVED: THAT the Rector is hereby authorized and directed to sign said revocation on behalf of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia to the end that the terms of the new agreement, a copy of which, signed by Mr. McIntire, was presented to the meeting and ordered spread as part of the minutes, may become operative.

By Vice President.

On motion the meeting then adjourned.

The Committee on Saturday, October 13th had interviews with Dr. Hancock and Dr. Lambeth and saw both heating plants. The Committee is of the opinion that it would be well for them to be under one head and as Dr. Hancock has resigned, advise that Dr. Lambeth be placed in charge of all heating plants.

The Committee wishes to express its appreciation of Dr. Hancock's invaluable aid in the installation of the heating plant.

This report is the unanimous opinion of the committee and their names are signed to the same by W. R. Duke at their request.

All of which is most respectfully submitted,
