Board of Visitors' minutes, Accession # RG-1/1/, Special Collections Dept., University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Va.

Minutes of meetings of the university's governing body which is the legal owner and operator of the institution. Recorded in the minutes are appointments and other personnel decisions concerning faculty, decisions about construction of facilities, gifts to the university, and all other board actions, decisions and resolutions.

A conference of the Rector and Visitors was held at the residence of Mr. Lewis C. Williams, Richmond, Va., for the purpose of considering the suggestion of Governor Byrd that the School for the Blind to be located at Charlottesville, adjoining the property of the University of Virginia, be erected under the supervision of the Rector and Visitors and that the school be developed and operated by them.

There were present The Rector, C. Harding Walker, and Visitors Buchanan, Hart, Hull, Scott and Williams, and President Alderman.

The President stated the proposition of the Governor to the meeting and, after a full discussion of the matter, the following motion, duly made and seconded, was adopted:

**RESOLVED**, That the Rector and Visitors have considered with great care the suggestion that the erection of the buildings for the School for the Blind be undertaken by this Board, and the initial development of the school be under this Board.

The Board is of the opinion that the operation of the School for the Blind by the Board of the University, as a permanent policy, would prove unwise and unsatisfactory.

The Board expresses the belief that the control of the School for the Blind by the State Board of Education would prove more satisfactory as a policy and insure the proper development of this school.

The Board expresses the fear that temporary control by the University Board may lead to a permanent policy which might serve to divert the University Board from the large and fundamental tasks now imposed upon it.

The Rector and President were requested to confer with the Governor and advise him of the action taken.

The meeting then adjourned.
