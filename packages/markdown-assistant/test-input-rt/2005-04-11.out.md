The Rector opened the meeting by directing the Secretary to call the roll, after which Mr. Sandridge gave a brief summary of the proposed tuition and required fees for the 2005-2006 Academic Session at the University and at The University of Virginia’s College at Wise, and for the 2006 Summer Session. He reminded Members that discussions of these had taken place at both the February and April meetings of the Board.

In setting forth the proposed tuition and fees, Mr. Sandridge emphasized that there will be a concomitant increase in student financial aid – in fact a 17% increase.

Mr. Thompson said it is important that publicity be given to the increase in financial aid.
