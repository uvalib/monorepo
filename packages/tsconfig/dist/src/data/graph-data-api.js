Does it have a coherent meaning beyond a laundry list of employable skills in the era of big data?\u00a0 Does it have a distinct disciplinary identity when compared to fields such as statistics and computer science? In this talk, I will draw from my research on the history of data science to make the case that data science is indeed a thing. It refers to a kind of knowledge work that dates back to the 1960s when the term was used by the Air Force in a manner surprisingly consistent with current usage. It is a distinct and multifaceted field that emerged with the need to process vast amounts of signal and other instrument data to produce actionable representations of non-point realities such as nuclear threats, the global climate, and, more recently, collective political and economic behavior.

Recent events (pandemic, invasion of Ukraine, etc.) and systemic facts (global warming, resource depletion, etc.) lead us to believe that the world, as we have known it up to now, is heading towards a total collapse. Different authors have defended in recent years the need to\u00a0articulate a debate on collapse that helps us to think about how such collapse could be triggered and what its implications would be (Servigne and Stevens, 2015).\u00a0 Within the framework of DAHSS22, we propose to think about creativity as a mechanism to ameliorate the causes that lead us to a collapse and to imagine possible alternative futures. Thus, the DAHSS22 five tracks will revolve around the following central question: How can creativity and imagination, in alliance with contemporary\u00a0digital, technological and computational developments, become an asset to replace the idea of collapse with that of rebirth for thinking and making a new future?\nThe DAHSS schedule is divided into three different types of sessions: plenary sessions, coffee talks and track sessions. We will also give the DAHSS participants the opportunity to explore the cultural and historical life of the city, offering a package with museum and historical site tickets.\nThe course is organized around five tracks. Each participant can only join one of the tracks. During your application, you should select the tracks in your preferred order.\nTrack A:\u00a0Digital\u00a0Display Spaces, Niemeyer will work with participants in configuring\u00a0digital\u00a0spaces for exhibitions on virtual platforms such as newart.city and modzilla hub. Techniques include basic modeling and animation, .fbx or .glb file format, spatial strategies for virtual engagement, data visualization and local sound synchronization in virtual spaces. Track A participants will create content and curate content produced in the other Tracks to cumulate in an online virtual exhibit about DAHSS 2021.\nTrack B: Data Science. Cultural data\u2013well used, managed and analysed\u2013is of immense value for the understanding of\u00a0art\u00a0history\u00a0and its impact on society. Open data is an opportunity to engage the public with cultural heritage, foster diversity and create knowledge. In this track, led by Harald Klinke (LMU Munich), we will investigate open data sources, learn the fundamentals of cultural data analysis, and use simple but powerful computational tools. No prior experience is necessary. Bring your own data. You can find more information at:\u00a0http://dahss22.harald-klinke.de/\nTrack C:\u00a0 3D Data, Modeling, and Rendering. This track will explore 3D data acquisition techniques, such as photogrammetry and laser scanning, and their use in VR and related virtual environments.\u00a0 We will experiment with different ways of exploring virtual space and will see how we might use augmented and virtual reality to practice\u00a0Digital\u00a0Art\u00a0History. We will also ask ourselves how to best design visualizations and historical reconstructions for these environments.\nTrack D: Computer Vision, Machine Learning, AI. Track D, led by Leonardo Impett (University of Cambridge), will think about applications of AI and computer vision to the\u00a0history\u00a0of\u00a0art\u00a0and visual studies. Thinking about \u2018the visual\u2019 is a major difference between\u00a0digital\u00a0art\u00a0history\u00a0and \u2018digital\u00a0humanities on\u00a0art\u00a0history\u2019. We will look at the long\u00a0history\u00a0of the computer analysis of images from the late 1980s to today, as well as thinking about the implicit theories of vision that underpin computer vision systems today. We\u2019ll learn to use some basic image processing tools and more sophisticated AI and machine learning algorithms to search within, organise, or study large image sets. Using tools like Scikit-Image, Tensorflow, and ImageGraph (a visual AI tool which we wrote specifically for DAHSS), we will build systems that deal with genuinely big image datasets. For the first time, we will also look at AI systems that generate images like DALL\u00b7E, and ask how we might use them as\u00a0art\u00a0historians.\nTrack E: Natural Language Processing (NLP), led by Yadira Lizama Mu\u00e9 (CulturePlex Lab, Western Ontario University) will explore the applications of NLP to understand what textual big data can tell us about\u00a0art. By combining the power of linguistics and computer science, NLP considers the guidelines and structure of language and creates intelligent systems that comprehend, break down, and separate meaning from text and speech.\u00a0 We will explore a wide range of NLP topics relevant to the context of\u00a0Digital\u00a0Art\u00a0History, starting with the basics like word tokenization & tagging, semantic similarity, named-entity recognition, topic modelling, and leading to deep learning applications to sentiment analysis, text classification, and human-like text generation. We will gain practical experience using tools such as Spacy, and TensorFlow while exploring collections of\u00a0art-related texts in the H.W. Wilson's\u00a0Art\u00a0Full Text database, Project Muse, Wikipedia, and social media platforms. You are welcome to bring your own data and ask questions about the applications of NLP to your own research.\nPlenary Sessions\nNo matter what track you pick, you will also see what students do in other tracks in our daily plenary session. In the plenary sessions, notable alumni of the DAHSS program will also share feedback and observations about how DAHSS helped them in their work.\nCoffee Talks\nEach day, we will have lighting talks from DAHSS alumni, to promote their projects, research and networking between the current students and the alumni. Over the years, we have settled a strong DAHSS alumni network and community. We also organize online coffee talks during the whole year to continue promoting and building a\u00a0Digital\u00a0Art\u00a0History\u00a0community.\nIntended audience: postgraduate students, academic researchers, independent scholars and professionals related to the following disciplines:\u00a0Art\u00a0History\u00a0and Visual Studies, Fine\u00a0Arts, Graphic Design, Computer Sciences, Media and New Media Studies, Museum Studies, and Humanities.\nFee: 200\u20ac\nThe price includes daily lunch and a special tapas lunch on the last day.\nUnfortunately, we do not provide accommodation, but email us and we are happy to give suggestions and tips on transportation and accommodation while you are planning your stay here.\nPlaces: 40\nImportant dates\n\u00a0\nDeadline: June 15th\nBy June 20th: Notification about accepted applications\nJune 20th \u2013 July 7th: Registration phase\nAugust 28th: Start of Summer School\nSeptember 3th: Closure of the Summer School\nFor more information, please visit:\u00a0https://dahss.iarthislab.eu/2022/index/\n", "Date": "Wednesday, June 15, 2022 - 12:00am", "Location": "M\u00e1laga", "Certificate Event": "no", "Event Type": "Conference, Deadline, Workshop" } }, { "node": { "title": " to 5170V01 Hacking the Humanities: Programming and Analysis by Student, graduate", "I am connected to:": "5170V01 Hacking the Humanities: Programming and Analysis", "Instructor": "Tom Williams", "My connection type is:": "Student, graduate" } }, { "node": { "title": " to Scholars' Lab DH Fellows Final Presentations by Attended", "I am connected to:": "Scholars' Lab DH Fellows Final Presentations", "Instructor": "Emma Dove", "My connection type is:": "Attended" } }, { "node": { "title": " to DH Final Showcase by Attended", "I am connected to:": "DH Final Showcase", "Instructor": "Emma Dove", "My connection type is:": "Attended" } }, { "node": { "title": " to DH 8991 Introduction to Digital Humanities by Student, graduate", "I am connected to:": "DH 8991 Introduction to Digital Humanities", "Instructor": "Ren Caasi Capucao Jr.", "My connection type is:": "Student, graduate" } }, { "node": { "title": "UC Berkeley DH Fair", "Body": "The UC Berkeley Digital Humanities Fair is an annual event that offers the UC Berkeley community and beyond the opportunity to share projects at various stages of development, receive invaluable feedback from peers, and reflect on the field more broadly.\nUC Berkeley Digital Humanities Fair\nTue, May 3, 2022 (virtual)\nRegister:\u00a0http://ucblib.link/dh-fair-2022\u00a0\nSchedule at a Glance:\n1:10pm\nKeynote:\u00a0Viewing at Scale: DH and Image Analysis\nProfessor Lauren Tilton\nOnline: Zoom\n2:40pm\nVirtual Poster Session & Social Event\nOnline: Gather\n\u00a0\nFull Program\nKeynote:\u00a0Viewing at Scale: DH and Image Analysis\nLauren Tilton, Associate Professor of Digital Humanities, University of Richmond\nWhat might be possible if we explore images as data in DH?

Such complex material and poetic compositions prompt an examination of the publishing landscapes that put forth this type of work. In this talk, I provide a brief history of print-digital literary publishing that reveals how these practices are both stimulated and hindered by recurring cycles of enthusiasm and retrenchment regarding the potential of digital technologies to \u2018revolutionize\u2019 the book and literature since the mid 1980s. Throughout these decades, the challenges to make print-digital publishing scalable as a new standard or format have, with very few exceptions, pushed the practice into institutional and independent presses where it has found a quiet niche. In a period when, beyond the e-book, it is still not clear if the digital will yield a new standard form of the book, examples like ABRA and Permanente obra negra give us a glimpse into the recent past to understand why the impetus to make hybrid books continues to be creatively current yet commercially unfulfilled.\n\u00c9lika Ortega\u00a0is assistant professor in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese at the University of Colorado Boulder.

Trying to use data science approaches to understand the complexity of human emotional experiences can lead to challenges and ethical issues. In this talk we'll explore how design research methods can help address these challenges and ethical issues by enabling humans to take a more active role in emotional meaning-making with their own data. We'll examine how realtime interactive biodata displays that leverage unusual materials, such as color-changing fabric or sonic furniture, can invite more social, sensitive, and nuanced forms of biodata analysis. Finally, we'll discuss what role design research can play in imagining and striving for more hopeful, just, and affirmative biopolitical possibilities with biodata.\nNora Howell\u00a0is an assistant professor in Digital Media at Georgia Tech. She completed her PhD at the University of California, Berkeley, where she was a member of the BioSENSE lab. Previously she has worked as a human-centered designer and engineer at the MIT Media Lab, Intel Labs, Microsoft, and The Echo Nest. Her design research explores biodata--data about human bodies and behaviors--and in particular biodata pertaining to emotions. What can (and can't) biodata reveal about how people feel, and how might biodata reshape sense of self and social relations? How might biodata technologies better accommodate the richness and diversity of lived emotional experiences? Howell's work investigates this through designing, building, and deploying interactive realtime biodata displays that invite alternative forms of emotional meaning-making with biodata.\nThis program is presented by the\u00a0Scholars\u2019 Lab\u00a0in co-sponsorship with UVA Library's\u00a0Research Data Services.

Bromley,\u00a0anneb@virginia.edu\u00a0\n\n\nRuss Bahorsky,\u00a0rsb5x@virginia.edu\n\nMore than 40% of the world\u2019s languages are in danger of extinction and 28 of those are Mayan languages that are still spoken today, according to the Endangered Languages Project.\nTypically, older speakers pass these Indigenous languages down to younger generations, but as the elderly all over the world have been hit hardest by the COVID-19 pandemic, the rate at which endangered languages are disappearing could be accelerating.\n\u201cLanguage preservation and documentation was important before, but it has a new urgency,\u201d Allison Bigelow, an associate professor in the University of Virginia\u2019s Department of Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese, said recently. \u201cThe communities that we work with have been hit especially hard during COVID, and it has disproportionately taken out elders, or the holders of language and stories.\n\u201cTo the extent that there is an ethical urgency to preserve the language and to make the newest generation of speakers feel connected to it, that\u2019s the importance of our work and that\u2019s why we really need to be doing it now.\u201d\nThe work Bigelow is referring to involves associate professor Rafael Alvarado of UVA\u2019s School of Data Science and a team of UVA scholars, graduate students and undergrads, in Spanish, global studies, linguistics, computer science, and the UVA Library. They are working with Maya researchers in Mexico and Guatemala to bring the \u201cPopol Wuj\u201d \u2013 or Mayan book of creation \u2013 to more people in those communities, with the goal of giving them access to the earliest Mayan mythology and culture via an interactive digital reader.\nThe \u201cPopol Wuj\u201d (also spelled \u201cVuh\u201d) document is an important link to understanding Mayan cultures before the European colonial era, but exists in many versions, not readily accessible in Central America. (Photo by Sanjay Suchak, University Communications)\nBigelow and the team won a special $250,000\u00a0grant\u00a0a few months ago from the National Science Foundation and the National Endowment for the Humanities that will help create the digital resource they have already begun. In a larger sense, this joint project aims to advance scientific and scholarly knowledge concerning endangered human languages, while at the same time help to preserve the endangered Mayan K\u2019iche\u2019 and Yukatek languages specifically, and the unique cultural perspectives that they make possible.\nMaterials to promote language learning and protect against endangerment can be scarce in Central American regions, Bigelow and her Maya colleagues said. This project leverages the latest tools and technologies UVA has access to in order to collaborate with Maya linguists on new editions of the \u201cPopol Wuj.\u201d\n\u201cPopol Wuj\u201d (pronounced \u201cpoh-poh voo\u201d and sometimes spelled \u201cVuh,\u201d following the colonial-era orthography) recounts the mythology and history of Mayan cultures that are documented in Central American paintings and engravings from as early as 200 BCE. The book is the longest and most complete document to survive the conquest of the region by the Spanish in the 16th century, and it is an important link to understanding the unique cultural characteristics of the Mayan people prior to the colonizing influences of the Europeans.\nBigelow, as a University of North Carolina graduate student in English, attended the Duke-UNC Mayan Summer Institute in Yucat\u00e1n, Mexico in 2009 and 2011, which deepened her earlier interest in indigenous studies. Now the Tom Scully Discovery Chair Associate Professor of Spanish, she came to UVA in 2014. She soon heard her graduate students asking for more experience in the innovative field of digital humanities, she said. Undergrads, too, were interested in getting involved in research, digital humanities and community work, so she looked for ways to incorporate this technology, turning to Alvarado with his data science expertise.\nBigelow and Alvarado emphasized the collaborative effort which began several years ago by calling it \u201cMultepal,\u201d\u00a0because it means \u201cjoint rule\u201d in classic Yukatek Maya.\nAs other academic activities shifted online during the pandemic, so too did Multepal. For example, the team organized and participated in a virtual conference last April, sponsored by the UVA Institute of Global Humanities and Cultures. Seven Maya scholars gave presentations. (UVA students translated their slides as part of a translation class taught by Alexa Jeffress, then a graduate student in Spanish and now a program director in UVA\u2019s School of Continuing and Professional Studies.)\u00a0\nBigelow, Alvarado and\u00a0Aldo Ismael Barriente\u00a0(now a fourth-year UVA undergraduate student) explained the significance of the \u201cPopol Wuj\u201d in a recent article, published last year in the journal Ethnohistory, \u201cPopol Wujs: Culture, Complexity, and the Encoding of Maya Cosmovisio\u0301n.\u201d The Spanish term \u201ccosmovisio\u0301n\u201d comes from the philosophical concept of \u201cworldview\u201d \u2013 the network of symbols and meanings embedded in a text.\nThe \u201cPopol Wuj\u201d stories contain \u201csacred, closely guarded rituals [that] sit alongside everyday practices such as farming and child-rearing, which ground and bring coherence to the cosmovisio\u0301n,\u201d they write.\nVersions of the \u201cPopol Wuj\u201d exist in at least 1,000 editions, each with different sections or stories, and different interpretations. The books are often not readily available, however. Even when an edition is, it might not be accessible to Mayan readers.\nTo solve such access problems, the team is evolving its\u00a0digital solution. The team has already begun working with the UVA Library on encoding translations, building the platform\u2019s database and making encyclopedia entries referenced in the book. The site will also include audiovisual content from native speakers and community members. The team will ultimately map texts onto two editions encoded by UVA\u2019s Multepal Project, but they hope others will keep expanding upon their base of knowledge.\n\u00a0\nSpanish associate professor Allison Bigelow (in red and black) emphasized the collaborative effort of this digital project with colleagues, students and cohorts in Mexico and Guatemala. (Photo by Sanjay Suchak, University Communications)\nYukatek Maya colleagues Miguel \u00d3scar Chan Dzul and Irma Yolanda Pomol Cahum of the Universidad de Oriente in Yucat\u00e1n wrote that such a digital edition would offer several advantages over other formats, especially that an audiovisual version of the \u201cPopol Vuh\u201d could be distributed free of charge.\nThey believe the technological infrastructure \u2013 internet, computer and smartphone availability \u2013 is already in place to reach hundreds or even thousands of Indigenous readers.\nScholars in Guatemala, working with a group from three highlands communities and five towns, would like to make the \u201cPopol Wuj\u201d accessible for their audiences \u2013 a more understandable and reliable text that could be taught in public and private school classrooms, as well as be available to the academic community, independent researchers and Maya communities.\nMaya Tz\u2019utujil scholar Ajpub\u2019 Pablo Garc\u00eda Ixmat\u00e1, a professor at the University of Rafael Land\u00edvar in Antigua, Guatemala, and one of UVA\u2019s first class of \u201cGlobal Mentors,\u201d wrote, \u201cThis digital version [will offer] a great opportunity to compare different editions, especially those that have been published by authors and researchers who are not native speakers. It will also facilitate the correction of linguistic and cultural information that have been mistranslated by such authors.\n\u201cOnce completed, [the digital version] will be a dynamic source that will encourage future work in the field, especially work that approaches Maya thought and philosophy in new ways.\u201d\n\u00a0\nUVA Today MEDIA CONTACT\nAnne E.

This event offers an opportunity for these communities to converge.\nThe discourse of \u201cbooks\u201d hinges on inheritances and new possibilities. What do books and bibliography mean in a time of catastrophic climate change and violent political polarizations? And how does technology in its manifold forms present opportunities for conversation, intervention, and activism? We want to confront the numerous problems of a problematic field at a problematic time. Established scholars have made much of eighteenth century archives of the Enlightenment; what will future scholars make of our contemporary values mundane and elevated?\nThe organizers situate this conference as part of a longer and ongoing continuum of the history of the book. The codex has never\u00a0not\u00a0intersected with other media and technology \u2013 from woodcuts and engraving plates, to wood and cast type, to the machinery of industrial print, to the multimodal publications of the present and future. Each of these innovations has required the development of new modes of production, circulation, and readerly engagement, and each now requires innovations in both material and digital preservation. Counter to the canonistic and nationalistic agendas which have been prevalent in digitization projects and are driven by the priorities of governmental funding agencies, we recognize that the urgency of preserving and sharing materials from marginalized and stigmatized groups is not as programmatic as it should be, nor is it well-represented in the fields of book history and in digital humanities. We further acknowledge that the future of the book \u2013 in new and old forms, and as transmedia objects \u2013 is both uncertain and exciting. We believe that the cohort emerging from this event will be well suited to develop a community of practice that centers scholarship, collection and preservation, and sociotechnical innovation in these emerging forms and the literacies that frame them.\nThe planning committee practices intentional inclusion and encourages submissions from researchers, students, librarians, archivists, practitioners of craft and print, information and technology professionals, and data scientists. We welcome perspectives from all individuals and are interested in fostering a dialog of critical, self-reflexive DH invested in different vectors of identity, and we encourage research produced by or concerning vulnerable and marginalized communities, historically or contemporaneously. In keeping with our focus on communities, we encourage submissions on DH praxis grounded in and accountable to the needs and ethics of local communities.\nThis hybrid and distributed event will take place at the partner institutions and online.\u00a0\nSee Full CFP Here\n", "Date": "Friday, April 22, 2022 -

This year\u2019s conference will take place virtually on April 7-9, with in-person components (public health guidance permitting) at NYU\u2019s Washington Square campus.\u00a0\nCulture Mapping 2022 seeks to assemble scholars, students, archivists and information managers, artists, activists, and other practitioners to reflect on the use of archival materials in understanding the information practices that encode and normalize injustice. Informed by the work of scholars like Saidiya Hartman and Jessica Marie Johnson, who have examined the lasting ramifications (\u201cafterlives\u201d) of slavery and its records, as well as those like Safiya Umoja Noble, who explore the ways in which everyday technologies reflect and reproduce systemic violence, we invite proposals that foreground archival practice as a means of investigating the fraught nature of \u201cinformation.\u201d\nWhat roles can archives play in not only the study of historical events, but in learning and teaching the legacies of information and recordkeeping? We ask: How can historical \u201carchives,\u201d loosely construed, illuminate the entanglement of rhetorical and material violence and information storage, processing, and retrieval? What role do archival materials play in information pedagogy in the humanities and social sciences? How does the transformation of archival materials into digital information present or foreclose opportunities for justice-oriented praxis?\nProposals may engage critical, practical, and historical takes on these questions, regardless of discipline. Faculty, librarians, graduate and undergraduate students, staff and administrators, and community members are all encouraged to participate. Potential areas of engagement include but are not limited to:\n\u2022 Media archaeological approaches to cultural study\n\u2022 Intersections of \u201ctraditional\u201d historical / archival research and critical data studies\n\u2022 Automation and information histories of labor\n\u2022 Politics of enumeration; \u201cbanal\u201d and bureaucratic forms of violence\n\u2022 Algorithmic bias and critical AI\n\u2022 Archives and activism\n\u2022 Histories of informatics\n\u2022 Archival and information pedagogy; project- and community-based learning and teaching\n\u2022 Digitization and data-fication of archives; data management and sustainability\n\u2022 Living archives\n\u2022 Resistant, abolitionist, anti-racist, and indigenous epistemologies and archival methods\n\u2022 Archival logics of / and COVID-19\nSubmissions can take the form of traditional paper / project presentations (10-20 minutes), five-minute lightning talks, performances, site or platform demos, virtual art exhibits, or roundtable discussions (30-60 minutes). You may also propose a workshop on a methodology in which you have expertise and which you feel would be of broad interest.

Our work aims to combat the proliferation of online \u201cecho chambers,\u201d abusive language, discriminatory algorithms and mis/disinformation, by fostering critical and creative user practices, and alternative paradigms for connection. A range of disciplines provides rich perspectives on democracy\u2019s ideals and practices in the Internet age. Yet, despite the best efforts of specialists in various disciplines and sectors, the problems of misinformation, radicalization, echo chambers, and abusive language persist. A lack of communication across disciplinary and sectoral boundaries means that insights into these problems may be replicated and not shared, and solutions that may depend on insights from another discipline may not be considered. In addition, the lack of a common vocabulary inhibits the development of shared theoretical frameworks and solutions. The Digital Democracies Institute aims to bridge this gap through interdisciplinary collaboration and knowledge mobilization.\n\u00a0\nBio: Wendy Hui Kyong Chun is Simon Fraser University\u2019s Canada 150 Research Chair in New Media in the School of Communication and Director of the DDI.

Over the past several years, the ADHO DH conferences have seen a steady increase in participation and presentations by scholars from India, Central Asia, Southeast Asia, Taiwan, China, Korea, and Japan. There is a closeness among Asian neighbors not only geographically, but also in terms of shared history, cultural values, and linguistic connections. With this background in mind, DH2022 provides an opportunity to showcase not only DH in Japan, but to also provide a window into the breadth of DH research and teaching throughout the Asian region. At the same time, DH2022 offers the chance for Western scholars to visit the wonderful city of Tokyo, and forge long-lasting relationships with Asian colleagues. The organizers hope to provide a place to meet face-to-face for global communication and collaboration among DH colleagues. Nevertheless, the ongoing worldwide crisis due to the COVID pandemic creates challenges for many scholars to participate in-person in the conference. Therefore, the organizers for DH2022 will support an equitable \u201chybrid\u201d style of conference, with both in-person and virtual forms of presentation and interaction that ensures the high quality of ADHO\u2019s international conference whilst ensuring safety.*\n*changed to an online format due to Covid concerns\n\u00a0\nADHO DH22 website\n\u00a0\n", "Date": "Monday, July 25, 2022 - 12:00am to Friday, July 29, 2022 - 12:00am", "Location": "virtual conference", "Certificate Event": "yes", "Event Type": "Conference" } }, { "node": { "title": "Digital Humanities Summer Institute 2022", "Body": "\"The\u00a0Digital Humanities Summer Institute (DHSI)\u00a0is an annual digital scholarship training institute that takes place at the University of Victoria.

It also makes several novel claims regarding what, at the level of content and form, was required to participate in this \"rise of the Asian American novel,\" and what specific individual works of fiction resisted this rise.

Stay tuned for details about those.\nAs we did last year NYCDH Week 2022 will take place in a fully online format, while continuing to do what it has done for the past six years \u2014 bring together individuals across the region who are interested in digital humanities, offering them opportunities to learn new techniques and skills, to hear about DH projects from across the city, and to connect with a vibrant and diverse community of scholars and practitioners.\nRegister Here\n", "Date": "Monday, February 7, 2022 - 12:00am to Friday, February 11, 2022 - 12:00am", "Location": "virtual event, register at link in description", "Related Link(s)": "NYCDH Week", "Certificate Event": "yes", "Event Type": "Conference, Workshop" } }, { "node": { "title": "Isabel Bielat", "Body": "Isabel Bielat is a second-year PhD student in the Department of History, where she studies\u00a0protest, reform, empire, and\u00a0democratic expression through and beyond the contexts of British imperial history and the global nineteenth century.

In recognizing the 75th anniversary of the Society\u2019s founding, our conference theme offers an opportunity to reflect critically on the past, present, and future of bibliographical studies. The study of books is tied inexorably to the past; we examine the deeply-rooted ways bibliography shapes and reflects the world around it. Yet, our discipline also stands at the threshold of a profoundly uncertain future. Amidst change and transformation, we look ahead to new ways of being and understanding in a mutable world. In so doing, we consider what formative legacies we wish to retain and honour\u2014and which we might usefully move beyond towards the end of building a more vibrant and just world. This paradox evokes the Roman divinity Janus, god of doorways and boundaries, whose two faces look simultaneously at what is coming and what is past.\nWith this image in mind, we invite conference proposals that speak to bibliographic and book history themes of liminality, memory, historicity, futurity, stability, change\u2014and the interstices between them. These might pertain to:\n\u25cf Re-imagining and revision in bibliography and book history\n\u25cf Decentering whiteness within special collections, bibliography, and book history scholarship \u25cf Books and print media as intersections of inclusion, exclusion, identity, and belonging\n\u25cf Innovation, traditionality, maintenance, and longevity in the theory and practise of bibliography and book history\n\u25cf Reflections on ecology, climate change, crisis, and sustainability in book history and bibliography\n\u25cf Language, translation, code-switching, and linguistic fluidity in book and print culture\n\u25cf Critical histories and legacies of book collecting in the institutional and sociological context\n\u25cf Skeuomorphism and the mutability of book form through time, space, and technology\n\u25cf Changing \u201cliteracies\u201d \u2014 plurality in engagement with the text, narrative, and sensory culture 2\n\u25cf Imagination, nostalgia, personality, personas, and whimsy as influences on the material culture of the book\n\u25cf The role of labour, craft, and expertise in the production and dissemination of books\nCongress 2022, as a virtual event, is being held everywhere and nowhere at once. In recognizing this, we invite participants to reflect on what it means to \u201cacknowledge\u201d Indigeneity and geography where they are. What does \u201cacknowledgement\u201d of Indigenous sovereignty and land stewardship look like as a practice? Does it begin and end as a speech act? A meaningful starting place for reflecting on personal and collective participation in enduring legacies of subjugation and dispossession? How could \u201cacknowledgement\u201d include considerations of Indigenous joy, beauty, and cultural attainment? We invite participants to engage sincerely with these questions.

The meeting theme,\u00a0La Politiquera: Recovering Politics/Recovering Political Voices, seeks to highlight voices in the archives that chronicle the agency of individuals and communities in navigating complex political environments and events, especially in the context of barred access to democratic institutions such as the courts and voting. What counts as politics when communities are deemed unrecognizable as a legitimate, enfranchised citizenry? Apart from the politics that appear in contesting the settler policies of a white, nationalist, Anglophone hegemony, what are other debates, controversies and ideologies that inform recovered archives? How do scholars approach and assess archives when politics in the past often underwrote issues, social practices and belief systems our communities no longer uphold?\nArchivists, librarians, linguists, historians, critics, theorists and community members are invited to share examples of the legacy they are recovering, preserving and making available of Hispanic peoples\u2014whether residents, immigrants or exiles\u2014of the United States over the past centuries.\u00a0We seek papers and posters in either English or Spanish that highlight these many contributions, but also offer critical ways to rethink issues of agency, gender, sexualities, race/ethnicity, environmental justice, class and power.\u00a0\nRecently, the end date for Recovery research and topics was adjusted to 1980 in order to give scholars, archivists, linguists and librarians the stimulus needed to begin the recovery of the\u00a0documentary legacy of the 1960s and 1970s.\u00a0 In light of the vulnerability of the civil rights archives from these decades,\u00a0we encourage papers that make use of archival research that provoke a revision of established literary interpretations and/or historiographies.

The ubiquity of the word digital, however, has not allowed us to reach a resolution on this critical query. During the ongoing Covid pandemic the digital has found itself in a range of paradoxes: from simultaneously empowering and unequal online pedagogies to mobile applications for invasive surveillance as well as life-saving vaccinations to fake news infodemics as well as decisive community building measures on social media platforms. The digital in the past few months has therefore self-reflexively challenged its apparent neutrality. Unsurprisingly, the first pandemic of the digital age has been unequivocal in exposing that the digital is indeed in the human.\nFollowing the success of our inaugural 2018 Conference [in our previous avatar as the\u00a0Digital Humanities Alliance of India (DHAI)],\u00a0India\u2019s first DH Twitter conference\u00a0in 2020, as well as the\u00a0DHARTISpeaks! Webinar Series\u2014the 2022 DHARTI Conference would like to provoke challenges to the conventional location of the digital in \u201cdiscrete electronic computing techniques\u201d (Peters). Instead, we focus on how since the evolution of the extensor digitorum muscles, human civilization has inherently been in the \u201cdigital condition\u201d (Heilmann): in the symbolic, indexical, and computational registers.\nFor our second conference, DHARTI invites scholars, artists, practitioners, and diverse stakeholders, especially from marginalized and non-normative communities in the Global South, to join us. Through acknowledging the vertiginous divides, celebrating the productive debates, and encouraging new models of thinking about humanistic inquiry this conference will develop conceptual links between various paradigms of the digital. Reflecting on endeavours like Dr. Sugata Mitra\u2019s \u201cHole in the Wall\u201d/Minimally Invasive Experiment we will try to reimagine the disciplinary contours of \u201cthe digital humanities\u201d in Indian and Global South spaces: beyond the limited lexicon of DH in normative spaces. We hope that the interventions at this conference will show how becoming DH in the Indian landscape\u2014for research, pedagogy, and advocacy\u2014is through an attendant dialectical tension between the making and doing as well as being inherently multilingual: thereby igniting new path(s) forward for an always already rhizomatic teleology of Indian DH.\nPaper/Panel/ Poster/ Workshops/ Hackathon submissions might include (but are not limited to) those that address:\n\nDigital divide and online pedagogy during the Covid pandemic;\nDigital divide and marginalized communities;\nDigital divide in urban, semi-urban and rural areas;\nDigital divide and social media;\nSocial media and Covid pandemic;\nDigital labor, infrastructure and data justice;\nDigital Cultures and Infrastructures in Indian languages;\nComputational approaches and applications in history, literature, archaeology,\ncultural studies etc.\nDigitally enabled surveillance and the \u2018Division of Learning\u2019\nAlgorithmic governance\nVideo Games, Gamification\nDigital Archives, Web Archives and Born Digital Archiving\nDigital Storytelling in/and Oral Histories\n\nProposals may be of four types:\n\nPaper presentation\nPanel\nPoster presentation\nWorkshop/ Hackathon\n\nConference participants may not present more than two interventions at the conference, either as individual papers or as part of a panel.

Please\u00a0register\u00a0to attend**.\nThe\u00a0Praxis Program\u00a0is a radical re-imagining of the annual teaching and training we offer in the Scholars\u2019 Lab. This fellowship supports a team of University of Virginia PhD students from a variety of disciplines, who work collaboratively on a shared digital humanities project. Under the guidance of Scholars\u2019 Lab faculty and staff, Praxis fellows conceive, develop, publish, and promote a digital project over the course of an academic year. Praxis is a unique and well-known training program in the international digital humanities community. Our fellows blog about their experiences and develop increased facility with project management, collaboration, and the public humanities, even as they tackle (most for the first time, and with the mentorship of our faculty and staff) new programming languages, tools, and digital methods. Praxis aims to prepare fellows with digital methodologies to apply both to the fellowship project and their future research.\nOur first two cohorts designed and built\u00a0Prism, a digital tool for crowd-sourced humanities interpretation, visualization, and textual analysis. Our third and fourth cohorts re-imagined\u00a0Ivanhoe, a WordPress\u00a0theme enabling\u00a0collaborative criticism through roleplay.\u00a0Our fifth cohort explored sonification of humanities data with the project\u00a0Clockwork. More recently, cohorts have worked on\u00a0Dash-Amerikan, a social media ecology of the Kardashian family, and\u00a0UVA Reveal, an augmented reality project that layers contextual information on contested public spaces on UVA\u2019s campus, and\u00a0Unclosure, a project that explores the possibilities that the public domain holds for research, pedagogy, and play. Most recently, students developed\u00a0Land and Legacy, a critical history of UVA\u2019s real estate development since the 1980\u2019s, and\u00a0Connection Established, an immersive examination of university teaching, life, and governance during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nBeginning as a\u00a02011-2013 pilot project supported by a grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to UVa Library\u2019s\u00a0Scholarly Communication Institute, the Praxis Program is now\u00a0generously supported by\u00a0UVa Library\u00a0and\u00a0GSAS. The Praxis Program is a core module of\u00a0PHD+, a university-wide initiative to prepare PhD students across all disciplines for long-term career success. The work Praxis Fellows undertake over the course of their fellowship year may be submitted in partial fulfillment of the practicum requirement for UVA\u2019s Graduate Certificate in Digital Humanities.\nThe Praxis fellowship replaces recipients\u2019 teaching responsibilities for the academic year. Fellows are expected to devote roughly 10 hours per week in the Scholars\u2019 Lab.\u00a0Fellows join our vibrant community and have a voice in intellectual programming for the Scholars\u2019 Lab.\nEligibility\nAll University of Virginia doctoral students working within humanities disciplines, on topics demonstrably connected to the humanities, or working in adjacent fields are eligible to apply. The Scholars\u2019 Lab particularly encourages and will prioritize participation of students who are women, Black, Indigenous, people of color, LGBTQIA+, disabled, undocumented, international, first-generation, or from other under-represented groups. We will be working to put together an interdisciplinary and intellectually diverse team.\nApplicants must be enrolled full time in the year for which they are applying. In addition, applicants must be capable of attending weekly in-person meetings in both the fall and spring semesters of their fellowship year (though we are flexible and can certainly accommodate travel needs). We will monitor public health to ensure such meetings are possible\u2013we have successfully held the program remotely during the pandemic.\nApplicants must still be drawing upon their regular funding packages as part of their doctoral program. I.e. students will typically be in years 2-5 of their program\u00a0during the year the fellowship will be held. In the event that a student has already been relieved from teaching duties, either through their regular funding package or in combination with another award, a small summer research fund will be substituted for the standard Praxis Fellowship award. Students in such situations should reach out to\u00a0Brandon Walsh\u00a0to discuss their eligibility.\nN.b.\u00a0- Praxis students are\u00a0not\u00a0expected to come in with particular technical training or experiences - we cover that over the course of the fellowship year! Prior experience with digital technology is only one part of an application and should not keep anyone from applying. Everyone brings something different to the team, and your strengths in critical thinking about media, collaboration, project development, and more could be great ways for an application to shine. Concerned students are encouraged to reach out to\u00a0Brandon Walsh, our Head of Student Programs, to discuss their backgrounds or eligibility.\nHow to Apply\nThe application process for Praxis is simple! You apply individually, and we assemble the team, through a process that includes group interviews and input from peers. To start, we only ask for a letter of intent (roughly 2 pages single-spaced). The letter should include:\n\nthe applicant\u2019s research interests;\nsummary of the applicant\u2019s plan for use of digital technologies in your research;\nsummary of what skills, interests, methods the applicant will bring to the Praxis Program;\nsummary of what the applicant hopes to gain as a Praxis Fellow, both in the short and the long term;\nand your availability on the days and times we\u2019ve identified for group interviews:\u00a0Monday, March 21st from 1-3; Tuesday, March 22nd from 10-12 or 3-4\u00a0(you will only have to participate in one hour-long group interview). Shortly after these group interviews, we will notify applicants who advance to schedule follow-up, individual interviews to take place on March 28th and 29th.\n\nThe best Praxis applications are the ones that go beyond listing the skills and research one hopes to bring or take away from the experience. Instead, focusing on weaving those elements into a narrative of how the program connects to your life plans and how you, in turn, connect to the spirit of the program.\nQuestions about Praxis Fellowships and the application process should be directed to\u00a0Brandon Walsh. Completed application materials are due\u00a0March 1st\u00a0and can be uploaded through the\u00a0GSAS application portal, which will open on January 15th. Please do consider this application to be part of a process - the beginning of a conversation about how we can work together. We highly encourage students to write to\u00a0Brandon Walsh\u00a0to discuss their interest in the program and how the Lab can contribute to their professional development. Together we can begin to discuss how the Lab can be a part of your time here, with Praxis or otherwise.\n", "Date": "Tuesday, March 1, 2022 - 12:00am", "Location": "https://virginia.academicworks.com/", "Related Link(s)": "Praxis Program CFP", "Sponsoring Organization(s)": "Scholars' Lab", "Certificate Event": "no", "Event Type": "Call for Papers" } }, { "node": { "title": "Scholars' Lab Digital Humanities Fellowship Application Deadline", "Body": "Have a digital project you\u2019d like to work on in conjunction with your dissertation?\u00a0Applications are now open for the 2022-2023 Digital Humanities Fellowship cohort.\u00a0The application deadline for fellowships to be held during the 2022-2023 academic year is\u00a0Monday, February 15th, 2022.

The highly competitive Graduate Fellowship in Digital Humanities is designed to advance the humanities and provide emerging digital scholars with an opportunity for growth.\nFellows join our\u00a0vibrant community, have a voice in intellectual programming for the Scholars\u2019 Lab, and participate in one formal colloquium at the Library per fellowship year. As such, students are expected to be in residence on Grounds for the duration of the fellowship.\nThe award provides living support in the amount of $20,000 for the academic year, as well as full remission of tuition and University fees and the student health insurance premium for single-person coverage. Living support includes wages for a half-time graduate teaching assistantship in each semester. A graduate instructorship, particularly one with a digital humanities inflection, may be substituted for the GTA appointment based on availability within the fellow\u2019s department. Applicants interested in such an option should indicate as such in their application and discuss the possibility in advance with\u00a0Brandon Walsh.\nHistory\nSince its beginnings in 2007, the Graduate Fellowship in Digital Humanities has supported a number of students. Past fellowship winners\u00a0can be found on our\u00a0People\u00a0page. In the past, the program itself has been supported by a challenge grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities. The fellowship is currently sustained by the Jeffrey C. Walker Library Fund for Technology in the Humanities, and the Matthew & Nancy Walker Library Fund.\nEligibility, Conditions, and Requirements\n\nApplicants must be ABD, having completed all course requirements and been admitted to candidacy for the doctorate in the humanities, social sciences or the arts at the University of Virginia.\nThe fellowship is provided to students who have exhausted the financial support offered to them upon admission. As such, GSAS students will typically apply during their fifth year of study or beyond for a sixth year of support.1\u00a0The funding packages for Architecture School students operate on a different funding cycle. As such, Architecture PhD students should confirm their eligibility with both\u00a0Brandon Walsh\u00a0and their program director prior to applying.\nApplicants are expected to have digital humanities experience, though this background could take a variety of forms. Experience can include formal fellowships like the\u00a0Praxis Program,\u00a0but it could also include work on a collaborative digital project, comfort with programing and code management, public scholarship, or critical engagement with digital tools.\nApplicants must be enrolled full time in the year for which they are applying.\nA faculty advisor must review and approve the scholarly content of the proposal.\nThe Scholars\u2019 Lab particularly encourages and will prioritize participation of students who are women, Black, Indigenous, people of color, LGBTQIA+, disabled, undocumented, international, first-generation, or from other under-represented groups.\n\nHow to Apply\nA complete application package will include the following materials:\n\na cover letter (roughly 2 pages single-spaced), addressed to the selection committee, containing:\n\na summary of the applicant\u2019s plan for use of digital technologies in his or her dissertation research;\na summary of the applicant\u2019s experience with digital projects;\na description of Scholars\u2019 Lab staff whose expertise will be relevant and useful to the proposed project;\na description of how the fellowship would be transformative for your work and your career;\na short review of relevant digital projects and scholarship with which your proposed work for the year will be in dialogue;\nand, most importantly, a description of what you propose to do with us over the course of the fellowship year. Typically this takes the form of a digital project with an associated research plan or proposed course of study.\n\n\na dissertation abstract (no more than one page);\na brief note (a PDF or screenshot of an email is fine) from the applicant\u2019s dissertation director attesting to the fact that applicant has discussed the project with them and they support the application;\nand your availabilities for a 30-minute interview slot,\u00a0either on Wednesday, February 23rd from 2-4 or on Thursday, February 24th from 10-12. This can be communicated by email or in the cover letter. These time slots will be used for finalist interviews. We\u2019re aiming for a quicker process this year by announcing those interview times in advance, though we can work out alternatives if scheduling difficulties arise. If you are unavailable then, please suggest other times on or around those days.\n\nQuestions about Grad Fellowships and the application process should be directed to\u00a0Brandon Walsh. Applicants concerned about their eligibility, for whatever reason, are strongly encouraged to write as well. Completed application materials can be uploaded through the\u00a0GSAS application portal.

More recently, cohorts have worked on\u00a0Dash-Amerikan, a social media ecology of the Kardashian family, and\u00a0UVA Reveal, an augmented reality project that layers contextual information on contested public spaces on UVA\u2019s campus, and\u00a0Unclosure, a project that explores the possibilities that the public domain holds for research, pedagogy, and play. Most recently, students developed\u00a0Land and Legacy, a critical history of UVA\u2019s real estate development since the 1980\u2019s, and\u00a0Connection Established, an immersive examination of university teaching, life, and governance during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nBeginning as a\u00a02011-2013 pilot project supported by a grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to UVa Library\u2019s\u00a0Scholarly Communication Institute, the Praxis Program is now\u00a0generously supported by\u00a0UVa Library\u00a0and\u00a0GSAS. The Praxis Program is a core module of\u00a0PHD+, a university-wide initiative to prepare PhD students across all disciplines for long-term career success. The work Praxis Fellows undertake over the course of their fellowship year may be submitted in partial fulfillment of the practicum requirement for UVA\u2019s Graduate Certificate in Digital Humanities.\nThe Praxis fellowship replaces recipients\u2019 teaching responsibilities for the academic year. Fellows are expected to devote roughly 10 hours per week in the Scholars\u2019 Lab.\u00a0Fellows join our vibrant community and have a voice in intellectual programming for the Scholars\u2019 Lab.\nEligibility\nAll University of Virginia doctoral students working within humanities disciplines, on topics demonstrably connected to the humanities, or working in adjacent fields are eligible to apply. The Scholars\u2019 Lab particularly encourages and will prioritize participation of students who are women, Black, Indigenous, people of color, LGBTQIA+, disabled, undocumented, international, first-generation, or from other under-represented groups. We will be working to put together an interdisciplinary and intellectually diverse team.\nApplicants must be enrolled full time in the year for which they are applying. In addition, applicants must be capable of attending weekly in-person meetings in both the fall and spring semesters of their fellowship year (though we are flexible and can certainly accommodate travel needs). We will monitor public health to ensure such meetings are possible\u2013we have successfully held the program remotely during the pandemic.\nApplicants must still be drawing upon their regular funding packages as part of their doctoral program. I.e. students will typically be in years 2-5 of their program\u00a0during the year the fellowship will be held. In the event that a student has already been relieved from teaching duties, either through their regular funding package or in combination with another award, a small summer research fund will be substituted for the standard Praxis Fellowship award. Students in such situations should reach out to\u00a0Brandon Walsh\u00a0to discuss their eligibility.\nN.b.\u00a0- Praxis students are\u00a0not\u00a0expected to come in with particular technical training or experiences - we cover that over the course of the fellowship year! Prior experience with digital technology is only one part of an application and should not keep anyone from applying. Everyone brings something different to the team, and your strengths in critical thinking about media, collaboration, project development, and more could be great ways for an application to shine. Concerned students are encouraged to reach out to\u00a0Brandon Walsh, our Head of Student Programs, to discuss their backgrounds or eligibility.\nHow to Apply\nThe application process for Praxis is simple! You apply individually, and we assemble the team, through a process that includes group interviews and input from peers. To start, we only ask for a letter of intent (roughly 2 pages single-spaced). The letter should include:\n\nthe applicant\u2019s research interests;\nsummary of the applicant\u2019s plan for use of digital technologies in your research;\nsummary of what skills, interests, methods the applicant will bring to the Praxis Program;\nsummary of what the applicant hopes to gain as a Praxis Fellow, both in the short and the long term;\nand your availability on the days and times we\u2019ve identified for group interviews:\u00a0Monday, March 21st from 1-3; Tuesday, March 22nd from 10-12 or 3-4\u00a0(you will only have to participate in one hour-long group interview). Shortly after these group interviews, we will notify applicants who advance to schedule follow-up, individual interviews to take place on March 28th and 29th.\n\nThe best Praxis applications are the ones that go beyond listing the skills and research one hopes to bring or take away from the experience. Instead, focusing on weaving those elements into a narrative of how the program connects to your life plans and how you, in turn, connect to the spirit of the program.\nQuestions about Praxis Fellowships and the application process should be directed to\u00a0Brandon Walsh. Completed application materials are due\u00a0March 1st\u00a0and can be uploaded through the\u00a0GSAS application portal, which will open on January 15th. Please do consider this application to be part of a process - the beginning of a conversation about how we can work together. We highly encourage students to write to\u00a0Brandon Walsh\u00a0to discuss their interest in the program and how the Lab can contribute to their professional development. Together we can begin to discuss how the Lab can be a part of your time here, with Praxis or otherwise.\n", "Date": "Tuesday, February 1, 2022 - 10:00am to 11:00am", "Location": "Zoom - Register to Attend", "Related Link(s)": "Praxis Program CFP", "Sponsoring Organization(s)": "Scholars' Lab", "Certificate Event": "no", "Event Type": "Workshop" } }, { "node": { "title": "Scholars' Lab Digital Humanities Fellowship Information Session", "Body": "Interest meeting for those interested in applying to the\u00a02022-2023 cohort of Digital Humanities Fellows in the Scholars' Lab -\u00a0Tuesday, January 18th, 2022 from 10:00-11:00 on Zoom.

The highly competitive Graduate Fellowship in Digital Humanities is designed to advance the humanities and provide emerging digital scholars with an opportunity for growth.\nFellows join our\u00a0vibrant community, have a voice in intellectual programming for the Scholars\u2019 Lab, and participate in one formal colloquium at the Library per fellowship year. As such, students are expected to be in residence on Grounds for the duration of the fellowship.\nThe award provides living support in the amount of $20,000 for the academic year, as well as full remission of tuition and University fees and the student health insurance premium for single-person coverage. Living support includes wages for a half-time graduate teaching assistantship in each semester. A graduate instructorship, particularly one with a digital humanities inflection, may be substituted for the GTA appointment based on availability within the fellow\u2019s department. Applicants interested in such an option should indicate as such in their application and discuss the possibility in advance with\u00a0Brandon Walsh.\nHistory\nSince its beginnings in 2007, the Graduate Fellowship in Digital Humanities has supported a number of students. Past fellowship winners\u00a0can be found on our\u00a0People\u00a0page. In the past, the program itself has been supported by a challenge grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities. The fellowship is currently sustained by the Jeffrey C. Walker Library Fund for Technology in the Humanities, and the Matthew & Nancy Walker Library Fund.\nEligibility, Conditions, and Requirements\n\nApplicants must be ABD, having completed all course requirements and been admitted to candidacy for the doctorate in the humanities, social sciences or the arts at the University of Virginia.\nThe fellowship is provided to students who have exhausted the financial support offered to them upon admission. As such, GSAS students will typically apply during their fifth year of study or beyond for a sixth year of support.1\u00a0The funding packages for Architecture School students operate on a different funding cycle. As such, Architecture PhD students should confirm their eligibility with both\u00a0Brandon Walsh\u00a0and their program director prior to applying.\nApplicants are expected to have digital humanities experience, though this background could take a variety of forms. Experience can include formal fellowships like the\u00a0Praxis Program,\u00a0but it could also include work on a collaborative digital project, comfort with programing and code management, public scholarship, or critical engagement with digital tools.\nApplicants must be enrolled full time in the year for which they are applying.\nA faculty advisor must review and approve the scholarly content of the proposal.\nThe Scholars\u2019 Lab particularly encourages and will prioritize participation of students who are women, Black, Indigenous, people of color, LGBTQIA+, disabled, undocumented, international, first-generation, or from other under-represented groups.\n\nHow to Apply\nA complete application package will include the following materials:\n\na cover letter (roughly 2 pages single-spaced), addressed to the selection committee, containing:\n\na summary of the applicant\u2019s plan for use of digital technologies in his or her dissertation research;\na summary of the applicant\u2019s experience with digital projects;\na description of Scholars\u2019 Lab staff whose expertise will be relevant and useful to the proposed project;\na description of how the fellowship would be transformative for your work and your career;\na short review of relevant digital projects and scholarship with which your proposed work for the year will be in dialogue;\nand, most importantly, a description of what you propose to do with us over the course of the fellowship year. Typically this takes the form of a digital project with an associated research plan or proposed course of study.\n\n\na dissertation abstract (no more than one page);\na brief note (a PDF or screenshot of an email is fine) from the applicant\u2019s dissertation director attesting to the fact that applicant has discussed the project with them and they support the application;\nand your availabilities for a 30-minute interview slot,\u00a0either on Wednesday, February 23rd from 2-4 or on Thursday, February 24th from 10-12. This can be communicated by email or in the cover letter. These time slots will be used for finalist interviews. We\u2019re aiming for a quicker process this year by announcing those interview times in advance, though we can work out alternatives if scheduling difficulties arise. If you are unavailable then, please suggest other times on or around those days.\n\nQuestions about Grad Fellowships and the application process should be directed to\u00a0Brandon Walsh.

C21 Editions is seeking to explore and make a direct contribution to the future of digital scholarly editing and digital publishing. When academics mention \u201cscholarly editions\u201d, they are typically referring to expertly curated textual resources or collections, designed to bring some sense of order or meaning to a particular set of materials. One of the major achievements of the digital humanities is the role its community has played in bringing scholarly editions to digital and web-based platforms, improving their research, pedagogical, and societal value through greater dissemination and access. However, despite all that has been achieved in the three or so decades since DH emerged, the digital scholarly edition is now in danger of becoming obsolete in an increasingly digital world. Most existing digital editions and publishing platforms mimic the structure of books, presenting static content in a page-based structure. This project aims to remedy that situation by engaging with experts and stakeholder groups in order to establish the methods and principles for developing the scholarly digital editions of the future.\nThe ideal candidate will have expertise in scholarly editions and digital scholarly editing or a relevant discipline, as well as a PhD qualification in a relevant field. A background in literary and/or cultural studies is also desirable.

The study of race, class, and gender is one area in which interdisciplinary methods are critical to drive new research questions. We therefore are organizing a series of methods workshops wherein graduate students from different departments introduce major approaches to intersectionality within their fields. This initiative will provide an intellectually rigorous yet low- stakes environment where students from different backgrounds can learn together and collaborate across departments. Furthermore, it will encourage students who do not yet do intersectional research to see the advantages and disadvantages of different theoretical and methodological approaches, enriching and expanding the study of race, class, and gender across fields.\nThis workshop is aimed at both MA and PhD students. We encourage submissions from across the humanities and social sciences.\nThe workshop will meet once monthly at 5pm on the second Wednesday of the month from October-May. One or two graduate students will facilitate a one-hour workshop on methods for studying race, class, and gender within their field, encouraging participants to consider interdisciplinary and intersectional methodological solutions to shared challenges. Following a presentation on methods, the graduate student(s) presiding over each workshop session will facilitate discussion and questions amongst the workshop participants.\nPresenters are not expected to be experts in the topic of their proposed workshop.

Scholars across diverse fields have equally tapped into the potential of digital tools in their research as well as teaching and learning. In furtherance of this, human science researchers from the domain of literature have been engaging the available tools and have also been fashioning out diverse means whereby scholarship in electronic literature can be advanced. It is within this framework that the\u00a0Centre for Digital Humanities University of Lagos (CEDHUL), Nigeria & University Sidi Mohammed Ben Abdellah, Morocco,\u00a0are organising the first of its kind academic gathering of like- minds and interested individuals or groups through the\u00a0First African Electronic Literature Alliance International Workshop Conference (AELAIWC 2021).\u00a0\u00a0\nAfrican Electronic Literature Alliance International Workshop Conference (AELAIWC 2021)\u00a0is an online/in person workshop and lectures designed to train and form all African scholars, electronic literature artists, digital poets and students in the field of African Electronic Literature(AEL), African Diasporic Electronic\u00a0\u00a0literature (ADELI) by providing them with opportunities to learn digital creative writing, connect with peers around the world and established electronic literature experts, and explore computational creativity in literature.\u00a0\u00a0The workshop will be divided into four-day intensive classes.

The social and cultural concerns brought to light with the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic offer a unique window of opportunity; one that forces us to confront power relations that have shaped our political, social, cultural and economic life in contemporary society.\nAs we enter a new era of digital episteme and scholarship, visual culture has become the gateway for the production and dissemination of knowledge. Contemporary approaches to the Humanities have pushed the limits of interdisciplinarity by embracing empirical methods such as Digital/Computational Humanities, Corpus Linguistics, and Computational Social Science. By attempting to bring the old and new theoretical approaches in the Humanities in conversation with each other, and through its focus on visual culture, this special issue of Imaginations seeks to highlight the various ways in which decolonizing knowledge production through contemporary interdisciplinary Humanities has become crucial for the struggle over the future practices of academic institutions.\nPrivileging marginal realities, this issue sets out to challenge prevailing structures of colonial hegemony in this precarious period of global, economic, political and ecological crises. The particular focus of this issue are visual and/or digital media practices that reflect, negotiate, or confront the oppressive forces of neo-colonial regimes embodied in the experience of marginalization through racialisation in its various intersections. Contributors are invited to reflect on the possibilities of decolonial methodologies and praxes that centre resistance, survival, hope and healing for marginalized communities.\nThe issue will consist of contributions in the form of peer-reviewed original essays from scholars, short essays or articles, multimedia and experimental submissions, and reviews (including book reviews and reports). We encourage submissions on the following topics:\n- social, political, philosophical or aesthetic approaches to visual cultures\n- hybrid and experimental web art\n- activism, art and environment\n- community building and mutual aid during the covid-19 pandemic\n- decolonizing knowledge and challenging hegemonic narratives in an online era\n- political ecologies of resistance with growing climate concerns\n- dialectics of liberation; social justice and digital media activism\n- critique of power structures and revolution discourse\n- critical race and ethnic theory, and gendered approaches to recent public health crisis\n\u00a0\nSubmissions are also welcome from the following fields and approaches with a focus on visual culture and praxis (including but not limited to):\n\u25cf critical race and ethnicity studies\n\u25cf critical settler colonial studies\n\u25cf decolonial approaches to various media\n\u25cf digital humanities\n\u25cf disability studies\n\u25cf environmental humanities\n\u25cf health humanities\n\u25cf indigenous studies\n\u25cf liberation studies\n\u25cf post secular studies\n\u25cf post(structuralism)\n\u25cf psychoanalytic theory\n\u25cf religious studies\n\u25cf social justice and activism\n\u25cf visual culture\n\u00a0\nNote on The Decolonized Library Project:\nThe Decolonized Library Project is a grassroots collective that brings together academic scholars, visionaries, and community members, and a counter-platform that seeks to provide a safe space for community discourse, and the production and dissemination of knowledge by the disenfranchised. Through its focus on activism, religion and faith studies using intersectional, postcolonial, feminist, black and indigenous critical theory, the DLP performs the function of a community resource that works to both highlight work from marginalized scholars and decolonize knowledge production.\n\u00a0\nSUBMISSION GUIDELINES\nOriginal research essays should be between 5000-7000 words.

The HistoInformatics workshop series brings together researchers in the historical disciplines, computer science and associated disciplines as well as the cultural heritage sector. Historians, like other humanists, show keen interests in computational approaches to the study and processing of digitized sources (usually text, images, audio). In computer science, experimental tools and methods stand the challenge to be validated regarding their relevance for real-world questions and applications. The HistoInformatics workshop series is designed to bring researchers in both fields together, to discuss best practices as well as possible future collaborations. Traditionally, historical research is based on the hermeneutic investigation of preserved records and artifacts to provide a reliable account of the past and to discuss different hypotheses. Alongside this hermeneutic approach historians have always been interested to translate primary sources into data and used methods, often borrowed from the social sciences, to analyze them. A new wealth of digitized historical documents have however opened up completely new challenges for the computer-assisted analysis of e.g. large text or image corpora.\nHistorians can greatly benefit from the advances of computer and information sciences which are dedicated to the processing, organization, and analysis of such data. New computational techniques can be applied to help verify and validate historical assumptions. We call this approach HistoInformatics, analogous to Bioinformatics and ChemoInformatics which have respectively proposed new research trends in biology and chemistry.

The DAHSS team is convinced that we have an unprecedented opportunity to explore new ways of working together in a real global scenario and at the same time preserve interpersonal exchange. In addition to that, the VI edition inaugurates a new track on NLP led by Yadira Lizama Mu\u00e9 (CulturePlex Lab).\nThe application period is now open (until July 7th, 2021).

The rediscovery of digital / virtual / online exhibitions appears ambivalent: it is expected that this centrality will become a stimulus to promote new avenues for research and experimentation. However, we also run the risk of falling into a certain Adamism that takes us back to debates already overcome. Therefore, it is crucial to focus the attention on the concept and practice of digital/online/virtual exhibitions to reposition their problems within the framework of our post-digital and post-human present.\nDAHSS2020 aspires to delve into the notion of digital exhibitions and their complexity proposing to participants to work together in a common project from different perspectives. The course has a theoretical-practical orientation: theoretical exchange and critical discussions will be combined with practical sessions (lab-based sessions) through which participants will work collaboratively. The results will be publicly presented on the last day of the course.\nThe course is organized around five tracks.\nTrack A: Digital Display Spaces. Led by Greg Niemeyer (UCB), participants will work in configuring digital spaces for exhibitions on virtual platforms such as newart.city and modzilla hub. Techniques include basic modeling and animation, .fbx or .glb file format, spatial strategies for virtual engagement, data visualization and local sound synchronization in virtual spaces. Track A participants will create content and curate content produced in the other Tracks to cumulate in an online virtual exhibit about DAHSS 2021.\nTrack B: Data Science. In this track, led by Harald Klinke (DAHJ), you will learn how to create, analyse and visualise linked open data. We will identify preconditions, gaps and biases in collection data and discuss the transformative effects of historical knowledge generated by digital methods on society. No prior knowledge required.\nTrack C:\u00a0 3D data, modeling, and rendering, lead by Justin Underhill (UCB). We will learn to create 3D models for art-historical purposes, and will experiment with Augmented and Virtual Reality tools for creating interactive exhibitions.\nTrack D: AI + Computer Vision. Track D, led by Leonardo Impett (Durham University), will investigate applications of AI/deep learning - especially computer vision - to problems in art history and visual\nculture. We will look at the long history of the computer analysis of images from the late 80s to today. Through the low-code visual programming environment\u00a0www.imagegraph.cc, developed specifically for DAHSS, we'll learn the basics of computer vision and deep learning in Python, including multimodal text-image models. We'll also talk about how to visualise and interpret big image data in the context of Cultural Analytics, Distant Reading, and contemporary curating. If you have digital image datasets from your own work or research, please bring them along (and don't worry if not).\nTrack E: Natural Language Processing (NLP), led by Yadira Lizama Mu\u00e9 (CulturePlex Lab, Western Ontario Univesity) will explore the power of NLP to study what textual data can tell us about art on a large scale. NLP is a field of Artificial Intelligence that centers around measuring human language to make it intelligible to machines. It combines the power of linguistics and computer science to contemplate the guidelines and structure of language and make intelligent systems fit for comprehension, breaking down, and separating significance from text and speech. We'll learn a wide range of NLP topics, such as regular expressions, word tokenization, named-entity recognition, topics extraction, sentiment analysis, and text classification. We'll also gain practical experience in the use of tools such as Spacy, alongside libraries that utilize deep learning to solve common NLP problems. We will have the opportunity to explore collections of texts related to art included in H.W.Wilson's Art Full Text database, Project Muse, Wikipedia, and hundreds of media articles related to art exhibitions.\nPlenary Sessions\nNo matter what track you pick, you will also see what students do in other tracks in our daily plenary session. In the plenary sessions, notable alumni of the DAHSS program will also share feedback and\nobservations about how DAHSS helped them in their work.\n\nSchedule\nTo accommodate the most possible time zones, the plenary sessions will be conducted daily at 18:00 CEST. Track sessions will be at 16:00 CEST. However, other options could be considered according to the time zones of participants in each track.\nIntended audience: postgraduate students, academic researchers,\nindependent scholars and professionals related to the following\ndisciplines: Art History and Visual Studies, Fine Arts, Graphic Design,\nComputer Sciences, Media and New Media Studies and Museum Studies.\nFee: 100\u20ac\nPlaces: 50\nThe organization will cover the enrollment expenses of 4 participants\nfrom Latin America\nImportant dates\nDeadline: July 7th\nSince July 14th: Notification about accepted applications\nJuly 15th \u2013 31st: Registration phase\nAugust 30th: Start of Summer School\nSeptember 4th: Closure of the Summer School\n", "Date": "Wednesday, July 7, 2021 - 12:00am", "Location": "virtual conference, application link in description", "Certificate Event": "no", "Event Type": "Conference, Deadline" } }, { "node": { "title": "2021 Roma Tre Digital Humanities Summer School Tran(s)missions", "Body": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTRAN(S)MISSIONS: how multimediality shapes interdisciplinary research in the field of Italian and Visual Studies\u00a0\n\u00a0Sept. 10-19, 2021, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Roma Tre\u00a0in collaboration with the Virtual Humanities Lab @ Brown University\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nThe \"digital revolution\" forces us both to rethink the correspondences between art and science and to reconsider the role of technologies in literature. The Summer School\u00a0Tran(s)missions: how multimediality shapes interdisciplinary research in the field of Italian and Visual Culture Studies\u00a0explores the meaning of interdisciplinarity and multimediality using a synergistic approach that combines different methodologies coming from the field of Digital Humanities, from studies on digital cultures and from research methods focused on the materiality of the object. Through the application in a laboratory form of the devices used in digital humanities, the Summer School brings participants closer to the knowledge of the tools suitable for the identification of thematic relationships that affect the computational world from the textual, visual and spatial point of view, as it is presented in different media, forms and literary sources. The inclusion of scholars and artists working in the international field, and coming from different sectors, is seen in a dialogical key to widen the debate around Digital Humanities and digital cultures, in order to encourage a comparison between different methodologies and alternative procedures. Through a series of meetings within the epistemological framework of multimedia,\u00a0Tran(s)missions\u00a0offers the possibility to confront the transformations involving the field of Italian Studies, to be understood in its broader meaning of Cultural Studies.\n\u00a0\nThe program, in hybrid format online and in person at the Department of Humanities of Roma Tre (via Ostiense 234, Rome), includes morning classes and afternoon workshops dedicated to the realization of a research project, a virtual and on-site exhibition. The lessons will be held in Italian and English. Among the proposed activities are round-tables, one-to-one tutorials and group workshops, coffee breaks, recreational activities of Geocaching, gallery walks and visits to institutions and discussions in the form of aperitif on the topics addressed by the Summer School. The visits will take place at the Gagosian, Lorcan O'Neill, Gladstone and Frutta Galleries, the Domus Transitoria, Santa Maria Antiqua, Palazzo Valentini, the Centrale Montemartini and the Giardino degli Aranci, while the exhibition will take place in virtual form on the New Art City Virtual Art Space (https://newart.city/) and on site at Spazio Taverna (Palazzo Taverna). The output of the Summer School includes the publication of the data produced on the GitHub platform. It will also be possible to participate in a conference and produce a special edition in the form of a catalogue with the presentation of the works and theoretical contributions made from the Summer School.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe call to participate in the Summer School is open to students and researchers, artists, curators, library science specialists, engineers, technicians-archivists who conduct interdisciplinary studies in the field of Italian and Cultural Studies, opening their perspectives of investigation to the relationship between word and image, visual culture, media studies, material culture studies, film studies, digital storytelling, creative writing, digital and public humanities, visual arts, art history, history, and computer science.

History as an academic field is undergoing major changes as a result of the transformative impact of digital technologies. These technologies affect the very nature of sources, the practice of data collection and processing, and also how historical knowledge is acquired and disseminated. The task of defining \u201cdigital history\u201d has given rise to much debate and discussion, but developing an understanding of the field and the wide-ranging potential for interaction between history and digital technologies can offer insights into the future development of historical research and education. Analysing the challenges and opportunities of this interdisciplinary union can inform and enrich the various cultures within digital history and beyond.\nSeveral prominent speakers from different cultures of digital history and related disciplines will participate in the round table:\nProf. Leonid Borodkin\u00a0is a Professor of the History Faculty of Lomonosov Moscow State University, the Chair of Department for Historical Information Science, Corresponding Member of the Russian Academy of Science (Russia).\nProf. Hannu Salmi\u00a0is a Professor of Cultural History at the University of Turku and has been Academy Professor since 2017 (Finland).\nProf. Peter Gautschi\u00a0is a Professor of History Education, Head of the Lucerne Institute of History Education and Memory Cultures, UTE Lucerne (Switzerland).\nProf. Val\u00e9rie Schafer\u00a0has been a Professor in Contemporary European History at the C\u00b2DH (Luxembourg Centre for Contemporary and Digital History) at the University of Luxembourg since February 2018.\nDr. Mareike K\u00f6nig\u00a0is a deputy director of the German Historical Institute in Paris.

Participants do not need to have any experience with digital humanities or computational analysis, but should be prepared to come to the workshop with a broad research topic in mind. With specific attention to the digital collections of DLOC, participants will be guided to use primary sources as the catalyst to turn ideas into research questions, then into more formal projects.\nDuring the workshop, participants will be introduced to and work with digital concept mapping with Miro software to create a subject or keyword matrix. We will explore the interfaces of DLOC and Chronicling America, and use select data sets from these including Dominica Herald, Abeng (Jamaica) and Barbados Mercury to discuss connections and themes emerging from the matrix in order to refine research questions.

Choices of scale\u2014in terms of data, tools, or teams\u2014influence not only project outcomes but also research methods and processes. This year, we invite work around (but not limited to) the following questions:\n\n\nLarge scale approaches have been said to easily ignore context, to fetishize size and inflate their technical and scientific capabilities, which they rarely deliver. How can we mitigate these issues and effects of scale for existing large scale data infrastructures?\n\n\nWhat other motivating factors should be taken into account regardless of scale? Are \u201cvolume, velocity and variety\u201d our defining challenges, or should we deliberately shift the problem characterization in humanities projects towards data scarcity, sparsity, polysemy, uncertainty, historicity, quality, and contextuality?\n\n\nWhat goes unseen when we look at massive datasets and large trends? How can information visualization techniques assist in bridging small and large scale findings?\n\n\nHow can we envision small data, small processes, small impact for visualization in the humanities?\n\n\nWhat trade-offs in visibility (and in-visibility) are made when we consider different scales in projects at the intersection of visualization and the humanities research?\n\n\nHow can research at the intersection of visualization and the humanities counteract the dangers of data colonialism and of excluding marginalized positions?\n\n\nWe invite papers at the intersection of visualization and (digital) humanities that provide both theoretical and applied perspectives around these and other questions.\nFor our paper track we are seeking works from scholars in visualization, the humanities, social science, and the arts who use visualization as part of the process of analyzing and interrogating human culture. Submissions will present original research ideas or results as they relate to visualization for the digital humanities. Each submission should clearly state its specific contribution to this growing field of research.\nSubmission format\nSubmissions will take the form of short (4-6 page - excluding references) papers. Submissions are meant to describe and critically discuss works at the intersection of visualization and humanities research, including applied case studies and empirical results and/or theoretical perspectives. We welcome works that highlight the difficulties (and proposed solutions) of designing visualizations in the context of humanities research and/or applying concepts from humanities research to foster visualization research and design.\nAuthors of accepted papers will be invited to present their paper at the workshop as a pre-recorded video plus online discussion. All presentations will be followed by a lively discussion with workshop participants. The archiving and publication options for VIS4DH 2021 are still under development and will be detailed soon.\nSubmitting a paper\nPaper submissions should be in PDF format following the two-column IEEE TVCG Conference Style Template\u00a0(http://junctionpublishing.org/vgtc/Tasks/camera.html).\nPapers should be submitted via\u00a0PCS. Submission deadline will be\u00a0July 23, 2021\u00a0(5pm PST). Notifications will be sent on August 16, 2021. Deadline for submitting a video of the pre-recorded talk is on September 1, 2021.\nSubmissions to the Paper Tracks will be optionally double-blind. Authors wishing to submit their work double-blind should remove author information from the cover page of their submitted document, and take care to avoid identifying information in the submission itself.\n", "Date": "Friday, July 23, 2021 - 12:00am", "Location": "virtual workshop", "Certificate Event": "no", "Event Type": "Workshop, Call for Papers" } }, { "node": { "title": "Ms. Allison Mashell Mitchell ", "Content Type": "People", "Email": "amm8dg@virginia.edu", "Featured Image": { "src": "https://dh-dev.library.virginia.edu/system/files/Headshot_.JPG", "alt": "Ms. Allison Mashell Mitchell " }, "UVA ID": "amm8dg", "Name": "Ms. Allison Mashell Mitchell " } }, { "node": { "title": "Employing Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in Cultural Institutions", "Body": "This workshop will be held\u00a0online\u00a0and hosted by Loughborough University and Dublin City University on\u00a07th July 2021,\u00a0from\u00a012:00\u00a0to\u00a017:30\u00a0GMT.\nTitle: \u201cEmploying Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in Cultural Institutions: How can these and other methods be leveraged to help organise, search, and understand digital collections?\u201d\nTO ATTEND THE WORKSHOP:\nThe number of guests able to attend the workshop will be limited.

It was intended to modernize copyright law for the digital age. Instead, it made it much worse.\nOrdinary activities in the physical world -- like loaning a copy of something, giving it away, or reselling it -- are prohibited in the digital world. As media becomes increasingly digital, we can\u2019t share things as we once did, and we don\u2019t own our digital copies, we license them. This has hurt libraries and other public institutions by preventing their ability to purchase, share, and preserve creative works for the future.\nIt isn\u2019t just media that\u2019s become digital, but our devices as well. This means that in order to repair and sometimes even fully use our devices, digital locks must be broken. To do that lawfully, the Copyright Office has to grant an exemption, which only lasts three years.\nLawful activities, like reselling, repairing, and remixing have become significantly stifled. Unfortunately, what we predicted 20 years ago has come true; copyright law has failed to account for the role that technology plays in our everyday lives.\nFighting for the public\u2019s right to use and own digital works has been a cornerstone of Public Knowledge\u2019s work over the past 20 years.

But while web archiving practice and tools have grown over the past twenty-five years, it is a cost prohibitive archiving activity and presents access and resource challenges that prevent large sectors of the archives profession and especially Black collecting organizations from fully engaging in the practice. At the same time, web-archiving practice has developed mostly within an exclusive network of professionals working in well-resourced primarily white academic institutions and national libraries in the United States and Europe. The\u00a0Archiving the Black Web\u00a0national forum is an urgent call to action to address these issues with the goal of establishing a more equitable and accessible web archiving practice that can more effectively document the Black experience online. Additionally, as you will learn from the brilliant speakers during this event, Black people have always been early adopters of technology and the internet is no exception. Black people have been involved in the technical and cultural development of the web from the beginning and have always leveraged the digital space to advance personal and community agendas.

It will first attempt to frame what a history of digital history might look like, by focusing on hybridity as a key characteristic of historical research, seen as some form of integrating newly emerging tools, technologies, materials, and/or practices in historical research, and mapped and qualified according to the main phases of historical research. My main argument here is that, in order to ground our current \u2018digital\u2019 practices and learn from past experiences and expertise, we need an answer to the question: what were, and are, the continuities and ruptures in the use and uptake of new technologies in historical research, and in the debates that accompanied them?\nThe paper will then proceed to outline what groundwork is necessary to explore digital history\u2019s forgotten roots: a basic overview of the field\u2019s different spatio-temporal trajectories and the networks of computing historians in the pre-PC and early PC period. A key focal point for such a reconstruction are the DH conferences that took place in the 1960s and 1970s, either as singular events or strands of bigger conferences such as the International Congress of Historical Sciences in Moscow in 1970, and later those that were organised under the aegis of the Association for History and Computing (AHC, 1987-2001) and its national member organisations. By studying which scholars attended and where they came from, and by linking that to the topics and methods that were discussed, it will be possible to chart, over time, shifting geographical, topical and methodological developments.\nIn the second part of my paper, I will provide the first results of a concrete case study which is part of this broader endeavour, namely a web archaeology of the old AHC website and H-NET Discussion List for History and Computing (now: H-DigitalHistory).\"\nRegister Here\n", "Date": "Wednesday, June 9, 2021 - 11:00am to 1:30pm", "Location": "Zoom, please register for link", "Certificate Event": "yes", "Event Type": "Seminar" } }, { "node": { "title": "The Web Archives Long View", "Body": "\"This research seminar aims to explicitly consider that research happens in context. This presentation proposes to address the topic of born-digital heritage and in particular of web archives in context. It aims to question the past, present and future paths of research based on the plethora of born-digital sources that developed from the mid-1990s. Analysis of web archives requires both taking into account the very shaping of these archives - e.g. web archiving in context - and placing research on these web archives in context, from the early studies of the 2000s which focused on the nature of web archives themselves and the methods for studying them to current research that takes them as sources for exploring digital cultures. Thus, the first two parts of our presentation, devoted respectively to the history of web archiving and of web archives in research, will explore the multiple contextual elements at work. These may be related to the Web itself and its evolution, to institutional policies, or to crawling and analysis tools, and understanding them is crucial for addressing the current and future challenges that will arise for researchers, whether they concern transnational approaches, ethical issues or a claim for enhanced contextualization.

Please\u00a0register\u00a0to attend. You are, of course, welcome to write to\u00a0Brandon Walsh\u00a0separately and/or sooner for an individual meeting to discuss your application.\nThe\u00a0Praxis Program\u00a0is a radical re-imagining of the annual teaching and training we offer in the Scholars\u2019 Lab. This fellowship supports a team of University of Virginia PhD students from a variety of disciplines, who work collaboratively on a shared digital humanities project. Under the guidance of Scholars\u2019 Lab faculty and staff, Praxis fellows conceive, develop, publish, and promote a digital project over the course of an academic year. Praxis is a unique and well-known training program in the international digital humanities community. Our fellows blog about their experiences and develop increased facility with project management, collaboration, and the public humanities, even as they tackle (most for the first time, and with the mentorship of our faculty and staff) new programming languages, tools, and digital methods. Praxis aims to prepare fellows with digital methodologies to apply both to the fellowship project and their future research.\nEligibility\nAll University of Virginia doctoral students working within or committed to humanities disciplines are eligible to apply. We particularly encourage applications from women, LGBT students, and people of color, and will be working to put together an interdisciplinary and intellectually diverse team.\nApplicants must be enrolled full time in the year for which they are applying. In addition, applicants must be capable of attending weekly in-person meetings in both the fall and spring semesters of their fellowship year.\nApplicants must still be drawing upon their regular funding packages as part of their doctoral program. I.e. students will typically be in years 2-5 of their program\u00a0during the year the fellowship will be held. In the event that a student has already been relieved from teaching duties, either through their regular funding package or in combination with another award, a small summer research fund will be substituted for the standard Praxis Fellowship award. Students in such situations should reach out to\u00a0Brandon Walsh\u00a0to discuss their eligibility.\nN.b.\u00a0- Praxis students are\u00a0not\u00a0expected to come in with particular technical training or experiences - we cover that over the course of the fellowship year! Prior experience with digital technology is only one part of an application and should not keep anyone from applying. Everyone brings something different to the team, and your strengths in critical thinking about media, collaboration, project development, and more could be great ways for an application to shine. Concerned students are encouraged to reach out to\u00a0Brandon Walsh, our Head of Student Programs, to discuss their backgrounds or eligibility.\nHow to Apply\nThe application process for Praxis is simple! You apply individually, and we assemble the team, through a process that includes group interviews and input from peers. To start, we only ask for a letter of intent (roughly 2 pages single-spaced). The letter should include:\n\nthe applicant\u2019s research interests;\nsummary of the applicant\u2019s plan for use of digital technologies in your research;\nsummary of what skills, interests, methods the applicant will bring to the Praxis Program;\nsummary of what the applicant hopes to gain as a Praxis Fellow, both in the short and the long term;\nand your availability on the day and times we\u2019ve identified for interviews -\u00a0March 22nd 2-4; March 23rd 10-2; or March 24th 10-11. We\u2019re aiming for a quicker process this year by announcing those group interview times in advance, though they may be subject to change if scheduling difficulties arise.\n\nThe best Praxis applications are the ones that go beyond listing the skills and research one hopes to bring or take away from the experience. Instead, focusing on weaving those elements into a narrative of how the program connects to your life plans and how you, in turn, connect to the spirit of the program.\nQuestions about Praxis Fellowships and the application process should be directed to\u00a0Brandon Walsh.

It is organised by the\u00a0Institute for Romance Studies\u00a0together with the\u00a0Forum Digital Humanities Leipzig\u00a0(FDHL).\u00a0\nInterest in the ESU DH C&T can be expressed already by creating an account with the ConfTool of the Summer University\u00a0\u200bhttps://www.conftool.org/esu2021/. Applications for a place at the Summer University are welcomed between 5 April 2021 and 15 May 2021. Information on how to apply can be found here:\u00a0https://esu.fdhl.info/application/.\nThe Summer University takes place across 11 whole days. The intensive programme consists of workshops, teaser sessions, public lectures, regular project presentations, a poster session and a panel discussion.\nEach workshop consists of a total of 18 sessions or 36 week-hours. The number of participants in each workshop is limited to 10. Workshops are structured in such a way that participants can either take the two blocks of one workshop or two blocks from different workshops.\nThe \"workload\" of the active participation in the European Summer University corresponds to 6 ETCS points.\nLike in the former years the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) makes available generous support to up to 20 alumni / alumnae of German universities. As soon as other scholarships are confirmed, we will send out a separate announcement.\nThe Summer University is directed at 60 participants from all over Europe and beyond. It wants to bring together (doctoral) students, young scholars and academics from the Arts and Humanities, Library Sciences, Social Sciences, the Arts and Engineering and Computer Sciences as equal partners to an interdisciplinary exchange of knowledge and experience in a multilingual and multicultural context and thus create the conditions for future project-based co-operations.\nThe Leipzig Summer University is special because it not only seeks to offer a space for the discussion and acquisition of new knowledge, skills and competences in those computer technologies which play a central role in Humanities Computing and which determine every day more and more the work done in the Humanities and Cultural Sciences, as well as in publishing, libraries, and archives etc., but because it tries to integrate also linguistics with the Digital Humanities, which pose questions about the consequences and implications of the application of computational methods and tools to cultural artefacts of all kinds.\nIt is special furthermore because it consciously aims at confronting the so-called Gender Divide, i.e. the under-representation of women in the domain of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in Germany, Europe and many parts of the world, by relying on the challenges that the Humanities with their complex data and their wealth of women represent for Computer Science and Engineering and the further development of the latter, on the overcoming of the borders between the so-called hard and soft sciences and on the integration of Humanities, Computer Science and Engineering.\nFor all relevant information please consult the Web-Portal of the European Summer School in Digital Humanities \u201cCulture & Technology\u201d\u00a0https://esu.fdhl.info/\u00a0which will be continually updated and integrated with more information as soon as it becomes available.

What are the advantages of data sharing? How can the creators of data receive credit through academic publications? Over the past few years the interest in data publication best practices for Humanities research has increased significantly, also thanks to the growth of data journals dedicated to Humanities research like the Journal of Open Humanities Data. Within the Humanities, linguistics has a long tradition in data creation, curation, and management. The Linguistics Data Interest Group of the Research Data Alliance has recently worked to identify specific issues related to data in the discipline of linguistics. The Troms\u00f8 Recommendations on Data Citation in Linguistics were produced by the Linguistics Data IG to help scholars navigate the complexity of linguistic data and form accurate citations, thereby fostering reproducibility and greater exposure of linguistic data. A crucial and related effort to generate greater recognition of the value of linguistic data is the development of standards for the assessment of data collections.\nThis second Open Humanities Data Forum will explore the broader view of data sharing and publishing in Humanities research, and provide an introduction to the Journal of Open Humanities Data (JOHD). It will also present the journal\u2019s upcoming special collection Language Documentation: Assessment and Recognition, which aims to outline what an effective peer-review process for linguistic data might look like, and how such a system would foster better recognition for these materials in academic evaluation systems such as in hiring, promotion, and tenure.

In this virtual program, Dr. Noelle Morrissette will explore the legacy of Anne Spencer\u2019s life and work. Dr. Morrissette received a 2014 Lillian Gary Taylor visiting fellowship at UVA for her forthcoming biography on Anne Spencer; her lecture will discuss how the University\u2019s collection proved vital to her research. Attendees will also hear from Anne Spencer\u2019s granddaughter Shaun Spencer-Hester, Executive Director of the Anne Spencer House & Garden Museum in Lynchburg.

We are creating a \u201cdetective algorithm\u201d that combines various NLP computing techniques to parse and process the narrative, and output the predicted identity of the guilty suspect along with a prediction score. First, the sentiment analysis of the text surrounding each character mention was collected to see how that character is discussed by the author and other characters and to ascertain if the context surrounding the mention of their name may have a unique pattern or connotation. Next, network analysis was used to provide a representation of the interconnectedness of the characters in the story arc, based on how many contexts they were involved together in, whether that be a mention or real time conversation. Network patterns across narratives are compared to identify patterns in how the guilty suspect is interconnected with the other characters in the story. We are currently investigating our algorithm on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle\u2019s\u00a0Return of Sherlock Holmes\u00a0collection and hope to apply it to deduce the guilty party in other stories. Our project helps strengthen the bridge between the fields of computing and literature, as it explores the capabilities of an algorithm to be fine-tuned to predict human behavior in stories. Creating a \u201cdetective algorithm\u201d also provides more insight into how predictable the mystery genre is, creating a new lens through which literature can be studied.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nSelecting Low-Risk Digital Self-Control Interventions for the Web Browser\nRob Schwartz\nA variety of potential interventions can be used to modify a user's web browsing experience for the purpose of reducing their per-site usage.

They constitute a significant body of global cultural heritage, and are being scanned at a rapid pace in the US and UK. However, most critical investigation of maps continues on a small scale, through close \u2018readings\u2019 of a few maps. Individual maps communicate through visual grammars, supplemented by text. But text on maps is an almost entirely untapped source for understanding how knowledge of place is constructed. Investigating map content at scale can teach us about what has been preserved and omitted in the cartographic record. Such knowledge is a key starting point for understanding why using map text to enrich collection metadata may be advisable (when collection records lack any, or only the most superficial, geographic or locational information) or potentially harmful (for example, when map text replicates colonial power structures).\nWe envision a future where map collections can be searched based on their spatial content, similar to the way that digitised newspaper collections enable full-text searching across scanned pages. This project contributes to reversing the fortunes of historic map collections. MRM will enable researchers and cultural institutions to generate and analyze map text data across collections and institutions, contributing to metadata creation and decolonization efforts, and enhancing accessibility and discoverability of un- or minimally-catalogued sheets.\nAdvancing software tools for handling new types of maps is essential to making text extraction a method that can be used in libraries and archives around the world. MRM generates data from scanned map collections and builds community among map and data curators, metadata and digital scholarship specialists, historians, and geographic information and data scientists. Working with partners at the National Library of Scotland, British Library, and the Library of Congress, this work unites research questions about the spatial experience of industrialization in 19th-c. Great Britain and social change in US cities during the 20th c. with GIScience methods for processing historical maps at scale.\nRole Description:\nMachines Reading Maps is looking for a Research Associate (18 months) to work on creating and reading map text datasets. The candidate may be a historian with a background in spatial analysis or who has used maps as primary sources, or a digital humanist, GLAM professional, or data scientist with experience working with computational methods to process map collections or other geospatial data. Our goal is to find a colleague who can think critically about scanned map collections and how collecting text from maps can transform humanities research.\nYou will work closely with the UK PI (Dr. Katherine McDonough) as well as the US Project Director (Deborah Holmes-Wong, USC) and US Co-Director (Prof. Yao-Yi Chiang). There will be opportunities to collaborate with the whole team, cultural heritage partner organisations, as well as the humanities and data science community at the Turing. Beyond this, you will build community with international researchers and GLAM professionals with an interest in our methods. You will play an active role in shaping and sharing our method for unlocking text on maps, including data acquisition, developing and writing up research articles, and teaching GLAM and humanities audiences how to use these methods.\nThis is a collaborative, trans-Atlantic research project, and so it is crucial that you enjoy working with others (synchronously and asynchronously) and are responsive within an iterative research process. You will have an opportunity to develop a research project using map text data, under the mentorship of the UK PI and other project leaders. Opportunities and support for professional development will be available within the Turing and externally.\"\n", "Date": "Saturday, March 20, 2021 - 8:00pm", "Location": "questions may be directed to Kate McDonough at kmcdonough@turing.ac.uk", "Related Link(s)": "Job Opening at the Alan Turing Institute", "Certificate Event": "no", "Event Type": "Deadline" } }, { "node": { "title": "UVA Externship for Diversity, Inclusion, and Digital Humanities", "Body": "Tentative.

This research is characterized by the use of formal methods and the construction of explicit, computational models. This includes quantitative, statistical approaches, but also more generally computational methods for processing and analyzing data, as well as theoretical reflections on these approaches. Despite the undeniable growth of this research area, many scholars still struggle to find suitable research-oriented venues to present and publish computational work that does not lose sight of traditional modes of inquiry in the arts and humanities. This is precisely the scholarly niche that the CHR conference aims to fill. More precisely, the conference aims at:\n\u00a0\n- Building a community of scholars working on humanities research questions relying on a wide range of computational and quantitative approaches to humanities data in all its forms. We consider this community to be complementary to the digital humanities landscape.\n- Promoting good practices through sharing \u201cresearch stories\u201d. Such good practices may include, for instance, the publication of code and data in order to support transparency and replication of studies; pre-registering research design to present theoretical justification, hypotheses, and proposed statistical analysis; or a redesign of the reviewing process for interdisciplinary studies that rely on computational approaches to answer questions relevant to the humanities.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTopics of interest:\nWe invite original research papers from a wide range of topics, including \u2013 but not limited to \u2013 the following:\n- Applications of statistical methods (machine learning) to process, enrich and analyse \u00a0humanities and cultural heritage data;\n- Hypothesis-driven humanities research;\n- Development of empirical methods for humanities research;\n- Modeling bias, uncertainty, and conflicting interpretation in the humanities;\n- Evaluation methods and development of standards;\n- Statistical evaluation of categorization / periodization;\n- Explanatory models for humanities research;\n- Theories for quantitative methods and computational humanities approaches;\n- Translation and transfer of methods from other disciplines, approaches to bridge humanistic and statistical interpretations.\n\u00a0\nTo gain further insight into paper topics, please also refer to CHR2020 proceedings:\u00a0http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2723/\n\u00a0\nSubmission types:\n- Long Papers: up to 6000 words (ca. 12 pages, references, abstract and tables/illustrations excluded), long papers report on completed, original and unpublished results.

Editions of texts by members of underrepresented groups are particularly welcome, including texts related to the Harlem Renaissance. The resulting edition will be published as the second title in a new series of digital scholarly editions published at IOPN under the\u00a0Windsor & Downs Press\u00a0imprint.\nThe writer of the successful proposal will receive two semesters of research assistant support at 33% time to support the project, funded by a library strategic initiative grant in partnership with the University of Illinois Department of English. The RA appointment would take place in spring and fall of 2022, with a goal of having a \u201cbeta\u201d version of the digital publication prepared to share with the public for feedback at the end of the RA appointment or shortly after. The RA will be staffed by a graduate student in the Department of English at the University of Illinois.\nA beta version is now available for the first publication in this series, an edition of\u00a0Anita Loos\u2019s\u00a0Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. This is available as an example for reference, but the chosen project may use a different IOPN platform or have a different structure depending on the specific needs of the edition.\nWhile there are a wide variety of types of digital edition projects, we particularly seek scholarly digital editions in the vein of \u201ccritical editions.\u201d Such editions facilitate further teaching and research by providing a reliable version of a particular text with appropriate critical apparatus, including accounting for variants between different published editions (i.e., the text as it appeared in periodicals vs in a book format). The edition should provide a way into the text that encourages readers to go deeper into its production, reception, and constitutive versions, and offer readers a way through the text and out again into its social context. While the shape of digital scholarly editions varies widely and it is expected the nature of the work and the primary source material will drive the project, in most cases IOPN anticipates features as described below.\n\nA digital edition should offer at minimum one full text reading view that minimizes the distraction of the critical apparatus. IOPN digital editions will also provide facsimile digitized images of the original published versions as referents to the original historical documents, but the edition provides its own reading text. Other views of the text typically show variants between the published versions to show how the text was changed by the author, publisher, or other agents. Known unpublished variants may also be accounted for in the edition if the researcher can secure the necessary permissions for use of unpublished material that remains protected by copyright.\nIOPN editions typically will include additional related primary source material as context for interpretation, with some explication. These may involve book reviews, documentation of historical/cultural references, or other primary sources that give insight into the production or reception of the work. Typically, editors provide a short biography of the author and other key figures such as illustrators as applicable, and a short editorial essay explaining the editorial principles used in producing the edition and challenges particular to the work and its publication history.\nIOPN digital editions may include specific digital features that relate to the content of the text and are determined by the editor depending on the timeframe of production. For example, a text with many locations may be accompanied by an interactive map. Depending on the nature of the edition, a simplified print-on-demand version may be published as well to facilitate additional use.\n\nPriority for the selection of the text for the edition will based on the following criteria:\n\nPublished in the United States between 1923-26 (inclusive) preferred.\nLack of an existing in-print scholarly edition for this text.\nExistence of multiple original published/unpublished versions of the text that will be used to produce the edition, which accounts for differences between the versions. However, editions where only one published version of the text exists may be considered if the text is fully out of print and there is a clear scholarly rationale for importance and the utility of an edition approach, or if the currently available print copy is clearly insufficient for teaching and research for reasons explained in the application (including that the current printed edition misrepresents the text in important ways).\nAvailability of existing print copies of all key versions from the previous bullet, particularly print copies which may be used for digitization. Available print copies in the collections of the University of Illinois Library are particularly helpful to facilitate this process. Alternately, if a text has already been digitized and the digitized copy is not restricted by a vendor license as a condition of access, that may be used.\nAbility of IOPN platforms or interoperable tools to meet the needs of the specifically digital components of the edition. IOPN staff can advise on this issue if the researcher is not aware of what digital tools are available.\nA work by an individual from an underrepresented group will be strongly preferred.\"\n\n", "Date": "Saturday, July 31, 2021 - 12:00am", "Location": "CV and proposal submissions may be emailed to dtracy@illinois.edu ", "Related Link(s)": "IOPN Call for Papers", "Certificate Event": "no", "Event Type": "Call for Papers" } }, { "node": { "title": "Noelle Morrissette Lecture", "Body": "Dr. Noelle Morrissette will be presenting a lecture on her latest work, a biography of Harlem Renaissance poet Anne Spencer on\u00a0March 26, afternoon time TBD.\u00a0Further registration/attendance information forthcoming.

Although most research presented had a strong data-driven component, the focus of the workshop was primarily on methods, techniques, and computational analyses in humanities research. Thus, the challenges of the underlying humanities data for computational research remained relatively underexposed, but are at least as important. This special collection aims to highlight the challenges of humanities data for computational research. This special collection of the\u00a0Journal of Open Humanities Data\u00a033\u00a0is open to both authors who presented at the CHR2020 workshop and intend to submit a paper highlighting the aspect of humanities data and to new authors.\nFor this special collection we invite submissions of two varieties:\n\n\nShort data papers\u00a0contain a concise description of a computational humanities research object with high reuse potential. These are short (1000 words) highly structured narratives that conform to the\u00a0data paper template\u00a036. A data paper does not replace a traditional research article, but rather complements it.\n\tCHR2020 authors: If you have already published a paper in the CHR2020 proceedings and your research includes the creation of a dataset with potential for reuse, you are welcome to submit a short data paper that complements your CHR2020 proceedings paper.\n\tNew authors: If you are a new author and have created a dataset relevant to computational humanities research, you are invited to submit a paper in this category.\n\n\nFull-length research papers\u00a0discuss and illustrate methods, challenges, and limitations in the creation, collection, management, access, processing, or analysis of data in computational humanities research. These are intended to be longer narratives (between 3000 and 6000 words + references), which give authors the ability to contribute to a broader discussion.\n\tCHR2020 authors: If you have already published a paper in the CHR2020 proceedings, you are welcome to submit a paper in this category focussing on the specific features and challenges of the humanities datasets used in your research.\n\tNew authors: If you are a new author you are welcome to submit a paper in this category focussing on the specific features and challenges of the humanities datasets.\n\n\nTopics of focus\u00a0are the features and challenges of humanities data for computational research, including scale and size, sampling and representativeness, data complexity, multidimensionality, multimodality, diachrony, as well as the challenges of preparing data for computational humanities inquiries.\nHumanities subjects of interest to JOHD include, but are not limited to Art History, Classics, History, Linguistics, Literature, Modern Languages, Music and musicology, Philosophy, Religious Studies, etc. Research that crosses one or more of these traditional disciplinary boundaries is highly encouraged.\nThe deadline for submissions to this special issue is\u00a01 March 2021. Manuscripts will be sent for double-blind peer review after editorial consideration, and accepted papers will be published online in the journal\u2019s special collection.

The name reflects the fact that there is always\u00a0one more voice\u00a0to recover from the archives. The non-European contributions take multiple forms and appear in multiple genres, including travel narratives, autobiographies, letters, diaries, testimonies, interviews, treaties, maps, oral histories, genealogies, and vocabularies. One More Voice attempts to offer a critical and systematic evaluation of these rich and diverse materials by using interpretive approaches and digital preservation techniques that expand existing scholarship on the topic.\u00a0\nIn this talk\u00a0Professor Adrian S. Wisnicki\u00a0(University of Nebraska-Lincoln), lead developer and lead scholar for One More Voice, will take up two lines of discussion. First, Professor Wisnicki will explore the development of One More Voice, with attention to its objectives as a minimal computing project and its practices in terms of accessibility, agile publication, peer review, and digital recycling. Along these lines, Professor Wisnicki will also reflect on the origins of the project, especially its links to the long-running Livingstone Online project (https://livingstoneonline.org/), a peer-reviewed digital humanities initiative that Professor Wisnicki directs, and the conceptual rootedness of One More Voice in 15 years of Professor Wisnicki's research in African, Victorian, postcolonial, and travel writing studies.\u00a0\n\n\nSecond, as part of the talk Professor Wisnicki will engage with students in the UVa English Department's current course on\u00a0\u201cUncovering 19th- and 20th-Century British Writers of Color\u201d (ENGL\u00a02599-001). This course is led by\u00a0Professor Indu Ohri, a One More Voice collaborator, and is both using the site for part of its course content and as the focus of its final, collective student project. In speaking with students, Professor Wisnicki will address questions posed by the students while also reflecting on how One More Voice intervenes in Victorian Studies and speaks to the present moment\u00a0 in the United States, especially on the topics of social justice and racial equality.\"\nZoom link for the talk is here:\u00a0https://virginia.zoom.us/j/97079105933?pwd=QUNvbE82Q0w1UUZZQkNtT1RkU2hjUT09\u00a0\nMeeting ID: 970 7910 5933\u00a0\nPasscode: 294826\n\n", "Date": "Friday, February 19, 2021 - 9:00am to 10:00am", "Location": "Zoom link in description", "Sponsoring Organization(s)": "English Department", "Certificate Event": "yes", "Event Type": "Lecture" } }, { "node": { "title": "Python for Humanists Workshop", "Body": "We are thrilled to offer another Python for Humanists workshop which will take place May 24-28, 2021.

The diners were shaded by a pergola, often covered in grapevines invoking the god Bacchus, whose wine they also enjoyed. Scents of flowers and fruit trees of the garden wafted through the air, accompanied by the smell of food cooking on the hearth. In the background, one might hear the gentle strumming of a lyre, the whistle from a pan flute, or the clacking of castanets. As the diners conversed, their attention may have shifted from the bubbling water fountains to the frescoes of extended garden scenes or hunts, or to the altars, niches, and statues of the gods that adorned the outdoor space. These are the Garden Dining Spaces created by the inhabitants of ancient Pompeii in their houses, inns, restaurants, and tombs.\n\u201cVirtual Garden Dining in Pompeii\u201d explores the physical, visual, and phenomenological aspects of dining outdoors in the gardens of Pompeii in the 1st century AD. Using virtual reality to rebuild several of Pompeii\u2019s Garden Dining Spaces, the 3D reconstructions will create an integrated and immersive experience in which to explore the spaces and better understand their use and significance to the people of the ancient city.\n\nJanet Dunkelbarger is a PhD student in the Art and Architectural History department.

While a number of approaches in DH may indeed be characterized as being rather theory poor, there are also many examples that apply theory in one way or another. In fact, the concept of theory is interpreted very broadly in DH, ranging from the application of concrete reference theories from the humanities (for instance structuralism, critical theory, etc.) to forays into the philosophy of science and also the implementation of theories as statistical models.\nIn consideration of such controversial and ambiguous views of the role and function of theory in DH, this special issue seeks to bring together scholars from different disciplines to re-think the perspective of theory and its meaning for computational cultural analytics. Instead of continuing the narrative of the deficient status of theory, we suggest to study existing \u201ctheorytellings\u201d in Digital Humanities research. This way, \u201ctheorytellings\u201d \u2013 on the one hand \u2013 become a methodology for an active reporting and narrating of the manifold theoretical undertakings in DH, including the supposedly \u201cuntellable\u201d and \u201cuntold\u201d stories of DH theory. On the other hand, the concept serves as a tool for re-evaluating existing narratives in DH. Following Lyotard\u2019s approach of meta-narratives, we claim that narratives essentially constitute and reproduce scientific discourses of legitimacy. Hence, we encourage contributors to discuss the evolution and consequences of epistemic narratives and counter-narratives in DH.\nThe overall goal of the special issue \u201cTheorytellings: Epistemic Narratives in the Digital Humanities\u201d is to discuss the theoretical foundation of DH research as an epistemic perspective that adds to the current focus on research practices in DH, which have traditionally been focused on data and modeling issues as well as digital methods, tools and infrastructures. We invite new procedures and perspectives of knowledge production that are first and foremost derived from theoretical reflection. The special issue will be published in the open-access Journal of Cultural Analytics. Guest editors are Manuel Burghardt (Leipzig University), Jonathan D. Geiger (Academy of Sciences and Literature, Mainz), Rabea Kleymann (Leibniz-Zentrum f\u00fcr Literatur- und Kulturforschung Berlin) and Mareike Schumacher (Hamburg University / University of Darmstadt). We invite submissions that address the following topics:\n\nTheorytellings, including main- and counter-narratives of using theories in DH\nStudies on definitions and different understandings of central concepts and terminology used in DH theory\nRequirements for theoretical frameworks in Digital Humanities and reflections of epistemic differences to theories from more traditional humanities disciplines\nInterdisciplinary theoretical frameworks and their applicability / value for DH\nCritical / theoretical reflection of established methods, tools and data in the Digital Humanities\nUse cases that showcase how theoretical assumptions are made (or explicitly avoided) in existing DH research projects\n\nPlease, send your abstracts (300\u2013400 words) and short bios to Rabea Kleymann (kleymann@zfl-berlin.org) by March 31st, 2021.

This editorial,\u00a0 curatorial, theoretical, and analytical work is profoundly entangled in the history and\u00a0 persistence of inequity as well as the rhetoric of division and alliance. Whose textual\u00a0 legacies are preserved? Which texts are reformatted and reproduced? How is textual\u00a0 reception shaped by access to cultural markets? How do the material and labor\u00a0 conditions of textual production influence meaning-making? How are creation,\u00a0 composition, publication, and audience conceived? These and similar questions prompt\u00a0 us to direct our inquiries both outwardly, to the people and texts we examine, and\u00a0 inwardly, to our field\u2019s construction and history.\u00a0\nThe theme of the 2021 STS conference, \u201cReckonings, Recoveries, and Transitions,\u201d\u00a0 invokes critical analysis of the past, reflection on the present, and speculation about the\u00a0 future of textual scholarship, as we transit through a period of multi-dimensional, global\u00a0 upheaval. We invite proposals related to this theme and on other aspects of textual\u00a0 scholarship. This conference, hosted by The New School, NYC, will be entirely virtual\u00a0 and aims to welcome new participants and encourage disciplinary assessment and\u00a0 exploration.\u00a0\nPossible topics include:\u00a0\nReckonings\u00a0\n\u2022 Textual scholarship and racism\u00a0\n\u2022 Textual scholarship and sexism\u00a0\n\u2022 Textual scholarship and activism\u00a0\n\u2022 Textual scholarship and ableism\u00a0\n\u2022 Textual scholarship and politics\u00a0\n\u2022 Textual scholarship and violence\u00a0\n\u2022 Reckoning as computation\u00a0\n\u2022 Reckoning with the history of textual scholarship\u00a0\nRecoveries\u00a0\n\u2022 Textual recoveries, discoveries, and \u201cdiscoveries\u201d\u00a0\n\u2022 Preserving marginalized textual traditions and materials\u00a0\n\u2022 Textual scholarship and health or illness\u00a0\n\u2022 Queer textual scholarship\u00a0\n\u2022 Feminist textual scholarship\u00a0\n\u2022 Anti-racist textual scholarship\u00a0\n\u2022 Who and what does textual scholarship serve in the twenty-first century?\u00a0\nTextual scholarship is an established discipline, but STS is an interdisciplinary\u00a0 organization and so is our conference and journal, Textual Cultures (edited by Marta\u00a0 Werner). We bring together scholars and practitioners from diverse disciplines,\u00a0 including literature, history, musicology, classical and biblical studies, theology,\u00a0 philosophy, art history, legal history, the history of science and technology, computer\u00a0 science, library and information science, lexicography, epigraphy, paleography,\u00a0 codicology, cinema studies, new media studies, game studies, theater and performance\u00a0 studies, linguistics, gender and sexuality studies, race and ethnicity studies, indigenous\u00a0 studies, disability studies, and textual and literary theory. We share an interest in the\u00a0 recovery and analysis of the material traces of the textual past broadly defined, and the\u00a0 creation of a community of interpreters sharing knowledge and methods to that end. As\u00a0 an organization, STS is committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion.\u00a0\nSession Formats\u00a0\nWe welcome proposals tailored to the four session formats below, designed to\u00a0 maximize opportunities for real-time connection and conversation, leverage the\u00a0 affordances of virtual platforms, minimize screen fatigue, and reduce barriers to\u00a0participation.\u00a0\nPanels\u00a0\nA panel consists of two or three 15-minute presentations followed by discussion. \u2022 Individual proposals will be organized thematically into groups by the\u00a0 conference program committee.

(ACH plans to host an in-person conference with a virtual component in 2022 in Houston, Texas.)\nConference Description\nACH is the United States-based constituent organization in the Alliance for Digital Humanities Organizations (ADHO). The ACH 2021 conference, in partnership with the University of Houston\u2019s US Latino Digital Humanities (USLDH) program and University Libraries, Texas Southern University, Rice University, Texas A&M College Station, Texas A&M Prairie View, UH Clear Lake, UH Downtown, and Houston Community College,\u00a0 provides a forum for conversations on an expansive definition of digital humanities in a broad array of subject areas, methods, and communities of practice.\nACH recognizes that this work is inherently and inextricably sociopolitical, and thus especially welcomes proposals that emphasize social justice in the context of\nanti-racist work, Black studies, Latinx studies, Indigenous studies, cultural and critical ethnic studies, intersectional feminism, postcolonial and decolonial studies, and queer interventions in digital studies.\nAreas of engagement include but are not limited to:\n\nSocial justice\nDigital surveillance\nEnvironmental humanities & climate justice\nComputational and digital approaches to humanistic research and pedagogy\nDigital pedagogy, research, and activism during COVID-19\nDigital media, art, literature, history, music, film, and games\nDigital librarianship\nDigital humanities tools and infrastructures\nHumanistic research on digital objects and cultures\nKnowledge infrastructures\nPhysical computing\nResource creation, curation, and engagement\nUse of digital technologies to write, publish, and review scholarship\n\nAs an organization committed to cross-disciplinary engagement, we welcome interdisciplinary proposals. We also are especially interested in receiving proposals from participants with a range of expertise and from a variety of roles, including alt-ac positions, employment outside of higher education, and graduate students. We further invite proposals from participants who are newcomers to digital humanities.\nConference Proposals\nProposals will be submitted using ConfTool. Please create a new account to submit your proposal.\nGiven that ACH2021 is a virtual conference, we especially encourage those proposing sessions to consider formats beyond the traditional 20-minute paper panels, such as roundtables, multi-speaker panels, digital posters, lightning talks, installations, and performances. When proposing a session, we ask that you describe your session type and indicate a preferred time length for the session. Suggestions are below, but we encourage proposers to move beyond them and to think creatively about other possibilities. Finally, in an effort to maximize a diverse set of participants, we will limit presenters to two events (panels/roundtables/workshops).\nProposals should include:\n\nAbstract: 250-word abstract for individual submissions and 500-word proposals for multi-speaker submissions.\nRequested time length\nList of participants\nAudience\nFormat for the session\n3-5 keywords\n\nWhile proposals should be clearly linked to existing scholarly debates, formal citations are not required except for direct quotation. Submissions will be evaluated using fully anonymous peer review, so please omit identifying information, including author name and affiliation, in the narrative of the proposal when you upload to ConfTool.\nWhile our CFP has been released in English, Spanish, and French, we welcome proposals for contributions in other languages. Proposals will be reviewed in the language of submission. Regardless of the language of your proposal, please ensure that your five keywords are in English to facilitate program scheduling.\nPlease note that for the purposes of scheduling, we may suggest an alternative length or collaboration between related proposals. While there is no limit on the number of submissions, the committee will not normally schedule more than two presentations from one primary author.\nSuggested Proposal Types and Duration\nThe proposal types and durations below are suggestions. We eagerly welcome alternatives.\nWorkshops\u00a0(3 hours to full-day to take place the day before first conference day): In-depth hands-on sessions led by presenters with expertise, technical or otherwise, in an emerging topic or methodology of broad interest to the ACH community.\nPanels\u00a0(1 hour): Engaging sessions that facilitate dialogue between presentations that are largely independent, highlighting connections between projects, methods, or themes.\nPapers\u00a0(10-15 minutes): Dynamic presentations that share experiments, works in progress, or sustained reflections and outcomes of more complete projects while engaging a range of participants and fostering connections and dialogue.\nRoundtables\u00a0(1 hour): Sessions for which speakers provide brief interventions or framing on a cohesive set of issues, keywords, methods, and/or themes, followed by open discussion among speakers and the audience.\nLightning Talks\u00a0(5 minutes): Highly-focused presentations that succinctly introduce a topic, method, tool, project, or work-in-progress to catalyze ideas and foster follow-up discussion.\nPosters\u00a0(poster session): Poster proposals present work on any relevant topic or offer project tool, and software demonstrations in any stage of development.\nInstallations and Performances\u00a0(prerecorded): Art work, creative data visualizations, performances, demonstrations, and other critical interventions that engage conference issues, methods and themes.\nProposal Review and Notification\nACH 2021 submissions will undergo double-blind peer review.

Digital data sets have become commodities in the global media industry. The knowledge obtained from digital data sustains the flow of knowledge on the users\u2019 choices, governing production and consumption processes. Although algorithmic data appears to be computationally generated, it is bound with actors, networks, businesses and their ways of thinking and imagining the world. A line of research focuses on how the algorithmic calculation of taste data in film, sound and television have transformed and possibly subverted the mediums. Hence, algorithms are objects of critical cultural and political analyses.\nAlgorithms shape and condition not only ways of knowing but also ways of storytelling. Although the use of algorithms (which can be traced back to early editing) is not new in film studies, their increasing use in the production of film, including footage organization and cutting as well as dramatic writing raises questions about new ways of storytelling. To illustrate with a few examples, companies such as Scriptbook in Belgium and Vault in Israel use algorithmic software to foresee films\u2019 box office performances by analyzing scripts. Likewise, artificial intelligence that is used to produce images from texts is used in the production process of film. In 2018, the BAFTA-nominated director Oscar Sharp teamed up with an artificial intelligence expert to create the ~7-minute film\u00a0Zone Out.\nUtilisation of algorithms in sound and music is also more and more visible in various forms. Regarding popular music consumption, algorithmic engines used by music streaming platforms such as Spotify and Apple Music to offer personalised recommendations is among the prominent of these applications. Similarly, there are attempts to build an algorithmic deep-learning tool called AutoFoley, that can design synchronised sound for videos.\nAgainst this background, this conference invites submissions that examine new ways of knowing and storytelling in film, sound and television that are in connection with algorithms in digital visual spaces.\n\nPossible topics\u00a0may include, yet not limited to:\n\ndifferent frameworks to study algorithms\nalgorithms and storytelling in film and television\nalgorithms and streaming platforms\nthe aesthetics of the image\nnew visual spaces\nalgorithms and scriptwriting\ncross platform interactions\nalgorithm and user interaction\nalgorithm and production cultures\nalgorithm and creative processes\nalgorithm and transnational adaptations\nalgorithm and genres\nracial and gender biases in algorithms\nalgorithm and sound cultures\n\nSubmission Requirements\n\nPlease direct all inquiries and submissions to Can T\u00fcre\u00a0can.ture@bilgi.edu.tr\u00a0by\u00a0March 1, 2021.\nParticipants will be notified of acceptance by March 15, 2021.\nPaper proposals\u00a0must include a 300-500 word abstract, a bibliography with up to 5 entries, and a brief author bio.\nRoundtable panel proposals\u00a0must include a ~500 word abstract describing the goal of the panel, a bibliography with around 5 entries and bios and contact information for each of the participants.

We\u2019re still thinking about 2020, but it\u2019s never too early to think about next year.\u00a0Applications are now open for the 2021-2022 Praxis Program cohort. Applications are due March 1st, 2021. Consider spending some time with us next year!\nIf you\u2019re interested in learning more about the fellowship or have questions about anything you read below, please consider attending the information session for the 2021-2022 cohort -\u00a0February 2nd, 2021 from 2:00-3:00 on Zoom. Please\u00a0register\u00a0to attend.\nThe\u00a0Praxis Program\u00a0is a radical re-imagining of the annual teaching and training we offer in the Scholars\u2019 Lab. This fellowship supports a team of University of Virginia PhD students from a variety of disciplines, who work collaboratively on a shared digital humanities project. Under the guidance of Scholars\u2019 Lab faculty and staff, Praxis fellows conceive, develop, publish, and promote a digital project over the course of an academic year. Praxis is a unique and well-known training program in the international digital humanities community. Our fellows blog about their experiences and develop increased facility with project management, collaboration, and the public humanities, even as they tackle (most for the first time, and with the mentorship of our faculty and staff) new programming languages, tools, and digital methods. Praxis aims to prepare fellows with digital methodologies to apply both to the fellowship project and their future research.\nOur first two cohorts designed and built\u00a0Prism, a digital tool for crowd-sourced humanities interpretation, visualization, and textual analysis. Our third and fourth cohorts re-imagined\u00a0Ivanhoe, a WordPress\u00a0theme enabling\u00a0collaborative criticism through roleplay.\u00a0Our fifth cohort explored sonification of humanities data with the project\u00a0Clockwork. More recently, cohorts have worked on\u00a0Dash-Amerikan, a social media ecology of the Kardashian family], and\u00a0UVA Reveal, an augmented reality project that layers contextual information on contested public spaces on UVA\u2019s campus, and\u00a0Unclosure, a project that explores the possibilities that the public domain holds for research, pedagogy, and play. Recent projects include\u00a0Land and Legacy, a critical history of UVA\u2019s real estate development since the 1980\u2019s, and a project on critical approaches to DH education.\nBeginning as a\u00a02011-2013 pilot project supported by a grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to UVa Library\u2019s\u00a0Scholarly Communication Institute, the Praxis Program is now\u00a0generously supported by\u00a0UVa Library\u00a0and\u00a0GSAS. The Praxis Program is a core module of\u00a0PHD+, a university-wide initiative to prepare PhD students across all disciplines for long-term career success. The work Praxis Fellows undertake over the course of their fellowship year may be submitted in partial fulfillment of the practicum requirement for UVA\u2019s Graduate Certificate in Digital Humanities.\nThe Praxis fellowship replaces recipients\u2019 teaching responsibilities for the academic year. Fellows are expected to devote 10 hours per week in the Scholars\u2019 Lab.\u00a0Fellows join our vibrant community, have a voice in intellectual programming for the Scholars\u2019 Lab, and can make use of a dedicated graduate space in the Lab offices.\nEligibility\nAll University of Virginia doctoral students working within or committed to humanities disciplines are eligible to apply. We particularly encourage applications from women, LGBT students, and people of color, and will be working to put together an interdisciplinary and intellectually diverse team.\nApplicants must be enrolled full time in the year for which they are applying. In addition, applicants must be capable of attending weekly in-person meetings in both the fall and spring semesters of their fellowship year.\nApplicants must still be drawing upon their regular funding packages as part of their doctoral program. I.e. students will typically be in years 2-5 of their program\u00a0during the year the fellowship will be held. In the event that a student has already been relieved from teaching duties, either through their regular funding package or in combination with another award, a small summer research fund will be substituted for the standard Praxis Fellowship award. Students in such situations should reach out to\u00a0Brandon Walsh\u00a0to discuss their eligibility.\nN.b.\u00a0- Praxis students are\u00a0not\u00a0expected to come in with particular technical training or experiences - we cover that over the course of the fellowship year! Prior experience with digital technology is only one part of an application and should not keep anyone from applying. Everyone brings something different to the team, and your strengths in critical thinking about media, collaboration, project development, and more could be great ways for an application to shine. Concerned students are encouraged to reach out to\u00a0Brandon Walsh, our Head of Student Programs, to discuss their backgrounds or eligibility.\nHow to Apply\nThe application process for Praxis is simple! You apply individually, and we assemble the team, through a process that includes group interviews and input from peers. To start, we only ask for a letter of intent (roughly 2 pages single-spaced). The letter should include:\n\nthe applicant\u2019s research interests;\nsummary of the applicant\u2019s plan for use of digital technologies in your research;\nsummary of what skills, interests, methods the applicant will bring to the Praxis Program;\nsummary of what the applicant hopes to gain as a Praxis Fellow, both in the short and the long term;\nand your availability on the days we\u2019ve identified for interviews - to be announced on the official CFP. We\u2019re aiming for a quicker process this year by announcing those group interview times in advance, though they may be subject to change if scheduling difficulties arise.\n\nThe best Praxis applications are the ones that go beyond listing the skills and research one hopes to bring or take away from the experience. Instead, focusing on weaving those elements into a narrative of how the program connects to your life plans and how you, in turn, connect to the spirit of the program.\nQuestions about Praxis Fellowships and the application process should be directed to\u00a0Brandon Walsh. Completed application materials are due\u00a0March 1st\u00a0and can be uploaded through the\u00a0GSAS application portal, which will open on January 15th. Please do consider this application to be part of a process - the beginning of a conversation about how we can work together. We highly encourage students to write to\u00a0Brandon Walsh\u00a0to discuss their interest in the program and how the Lab can contribute to their professional development. Together we can begin to discuss how the Lab can be a part of your time here, with Praxis or otherwise.\n", "Date": "Monday, March 1, 2021 - 12:00am", "Location": "Scholars' Lab", "Related Link(s)": "Official CFP", "Sponsoring Organization(s)": "Scholars' Lab", "Certificate Event": "no", "Event Type": "Deadline" } }, { "node": { "title": "Scholars' Lab DH Fellowship Deadline", "Body": "The application deadline for Scholars' Lab Graduate Fellowships in DH\u00a0to be held during the 2021-2022 academic year is\u00a0Monday, February 15th, 2021.

The highly competitive Graduate Fellowship in Digital Humanities is designed to advance the humanities and provide emerging digital scholars with an opportunity for growth.\nFellows join our\u00a0vibrant community, have a voice in intellectual programming for the Scholars\u2019 Lab, make use of our dedicated grad office, and participate in one formal colloquium at the Library per fellowship year. As such, students are expected to be in residence on Grounds for the duration of the fellowship.\nThe award provides living support in the amount of $20,000 for the academic year, as well as full remission of tuition and University fees and the student health insurance premium for single-person coverage. Living support includes wages for a half-time graduate teaching assistantship in each semester. A graduate instructorship, particularly one with a digital humanities inflection, may be substituted for the GTA appointment based on availability within the fellow\u2019s department. Applicants interested in such an option should indicate as such in their application and discuss the possibility in advance with\u00a0Brandon Walsh. The call for applicants is issued annually in August.\nHistory\nSince its beginnings in 2007, the Graduate Fellowship in Digital Humanities has supported a number of students. Past fellowship winners\u00a0can be found on our\u00a0People\u00a0page. In the past, the program itself has been supported by a challenge grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities. The fellowship is currently sustained by the Jeffrey C. Walker Library Fund for Technology in the Humanities, and the Matthew & Nancy Walker Library Fund.\nEligibility, Conditions, and Requirements\n\nApplicants must be ABD, having completed all course requirements and been admitted to candidacy for the doctorate in the humanities, social sciences or the arts at the University of Virginia.\nThe fellowship is provided to students who have exhausted the financial support offered to them upon admission. As such, GSAS students will typically apply during their fifth year of study or beyond for a sixth year of support.1\u00a0The funding packages for Architecture School students operate on a different funding cycle. As such, Architecture PhD students should confirm their eligibility with both\u00a0Brandon Walsh\u00a0and their program director prior to applying.\nApplicants are expected to have digital humanities experience, though this background could take a variety of forms. Experience can include formal fellowships like the\u00a0Praxis Program,\u00a0but it could also include work on a collaborative digital project, comfort with programing and code management, public scholarship, or critical engagement with digital tools.\nApplicants must be enrolled full time in the year for which they are applying.\nA faculty advisor must review and approve the scholarly content of the proposal.\n\nHow to Apply\nA complete application package will include the following materials:\n\na cover letter (roughly 2 pages single-spaced), addressed to the selection committee, containing:\n\na summary of the applicant\u2019s plan for use of digital technologies in his or her dissertation research;\na summary of the applicant\u2019s experience with digital projects;\na description of Scholars\u2019 Lab staff whose expertise will be relevant and useful to the proposed project;\na description of how the fellowship would be transformative for your work and your career;\na short review of relevant digital projects and scholarship with which your proposed work for the year will be in dialogue;\nand, most importantly, a description of what you propose to do with us over the course of the fellowship year. Typically this takes the form of a digital project with an associated research plan or proposed course of study.\n\n\na dissertation abstract (no more than one page);\n2-3 letters of nomination and support, at least one being from the applicant\u2019s dissertation director who can attest to the project\u2019s scholarly rigor and integration within the dissertation;\nand your availabilities for a 30-minute interview slot,\u00a0either on Wednesday, February 24th from 9-12 or 3-4 or on Thursday, February 25th from 9-11. This can be communicated by email or in the cover letter. These time slots will be used for finalist interviews. We\u2019re aiming for a quicker process this year by announcing those interview times in advance, though we can work out alternatives if scheduling difficulties arise. If you are unavailable then, please suggest other times on or around those days.\n\nQuestions about Grad Fellowships and the application process should be directed to\u00a0Brandon Walsh. Applicants concerned about their eligibility, for whatever reason, are strongly encouraged to write as well. Completed application materials can be uploaded through the\u00a0GSAS application portal.

Crushed by the Germans in World War I, Russia declined economically and demographically.\nDuring the revolutions of 1917 and the ensuing civil war, the country fell to pieces. And yet, despite the bitter suffering, this was a time of remarkable creative expression, when all levels of Russian society were alive with literary and artistic invention. While political, social, and military perspectives on this period of Russia\u2019s war, revolution, and civil war naturally focus on institutions, leaders, parties, and battles, \u201cMapping Poetic Geographies of Revolutionary Russia\u201d expands our picture with rich geographical subjectivities-that emotional sense of belonging to place that is a fundamental marker of identity.\nThis project is grounded by a database of poetry and short prose actually composed during these war years. It includes over 500 works by seventy writers from the most varied walks of life, some world-class poets and some only recently literate. This cross section allows us rare insight into ordinary Russians dealing with extraordinary upheaval, and it helps us capture a shifting sense of self and attachment to a place. An interactive website will offer access to poetic texts and allow users to search for place-related concepts and toponyms, and to plumb the variety of emotional resonance. Users will be able graph word frequency and shifts of usage over the nine years of war and revolution. The database will also provide available biographical information on these writers, and accompanying maps will correlate actual war zones and areas of writing and publishing activity.

Katherine Hayles, \"Addressing Space: Augmented, Enfolded and Exfolded Hybrid Models and Their Implications\"", "Body": "Addressing Space: Augmented, Enfolded and Exfolded Hybrid Models and their Implications\n\u00a0\nRanjodh Singh Dhaliwal argues that \u201caddressability\u201d\u2014the ability to address and be addressed\u2014is the foundational requirement for computability.\u00a0 Addressability, whether for houses, analogue computers, von Neumann architectures, or quantum devices, consists of mechanisms that establish a stable relation between a physical location and a symbolic/iconic marker.\u00a0 This talk will explore three modes of addressing computational space, using some literary examples.\u00a0 The best known is augmented reality, where physical proximity (as indicated by a GPS device, for example) serves as a key to unlock a virtual gate to a projection, narrative, or other historical or locative-specific information.\u00a0 Enfolded models operate on the inverse principle, using virtual markers (for example, QR codes on a cell phone) to unlock gates to physical locales.\u00a0 Using the example of Shanghai, where QR codes are ubiquitous as analyzed by Anna Greenspan, the talk will explore how QR markers are integrated into financial transactions, data doubles, and user identities to create powerful surveillance potentials; in addition, the addressing mechanism here achieves extreme mobility, no longer tied to a specific physical address.\u00a0 The last example of exfolded models focuses on projects that use wearable EEG devices to record users\u2019 reactions to architectural settings in New York City, as analyzed by Melissa Littlefield.\u00a0 Here embodied internal information, in the form of brain activity, is \u201cexfolded\u201d (I.e., externalized) through recordings and uploaded into databases.\u00a0 Now the relation between physical locale and virtual device transcends the lock-and-key paradigm altogether, creating addressing relations between physical locales and computational information that are not only mobile but that operate below the threshold of a user\u2019s consciousness.\u00a0 The trajectory traced by the three models shows the relation reaching deeper and deeper into a user\u2019s performance of identity.\u00a0 This ties back into the historical origins of addressability, when in 18th\u00a0\u00a0century Vienna physical addresses were assigned to buildings to facilitate the state\u2019s forced conscription of an occupant into the military.\u00a0 The implications here show that addressability, computability and architectural hybridity are deeply entangled together, with the result of interpellating the human subject ever more deeply into the bureaucratic/corporate state.\nN.

Novels, newspapers, journals, blog posts, emails, tweets, and metadata are all examples of unstructured text. Text analysis methods aid researchers in sifting through large text corpora to identify patterns and make connections.\nWhat is distant reading and how is it different from close reading?\nDistant reading refers to the use of computers to ingest and analyze large text corpora \u2014 more than would otherwise be possible for a single person. As opposed to close reading which prioritizes focusing on the details of a certain text, distant reading facilitates observation and analysis of recurring patterns and concepts that recur over time in large text corpora. In literary studies and comparative literature, distant reading and text analysis are closely aligned in their meaning.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTools for Text Analytics Projects\n\n\nMallet \u00a0(machine learning applications to text)\n\n\nBeautiful Soup \u00a0(Python library designed for screen scraping)\n\n\nTAPoR \u00a0 (Xml, Html, and plain text analysis)\n\n\nJuxta \u00a0 (comparison/collation tool)\n\nWordSeer \u00a0(comparison tool)\n\n\u00a0\nCurrent Journals\u00a0\n\n\nDigital Humanities Quarterly\n\n\nDigital Literary Studies\n\n\nDigital Scholarship in the Humanities\n\n\nDigital Studies\n\n\nInternational Journal of Humanities and Arts Computing\n\n\nJournal of Data Mining and Digital Humanities\n\n\nJournal of Digital Humanities\n\n\nJournal of the Text Encoding Initiative\n\n\nCurrent Research in Digital History\n\n\n\u00a0\nArticles for Reference\n\n\nBenito-Santos, A. and Sanchez, R.T., \u201cA Data-Driven Introduction to Authors, Readings, and Techniques in Visualization for the Digital Humanities,\u201d IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications IEEE Comput.

The online workshop will run for five days, from January 11-15, 2021. On each day, the learner will participate in two 90-minute Zoom meetings -- one in the morning and one in the afternoon. Throughout the week, faculty and expert text analytics practitioners will offer 30-45 minute presentations focused on their research, courses, or projects demonstrating to participants\u00a0the various ways\u00a0their text analytics skills can be implemented in their own academic careers.. Participants will work on hands-on activities between the meetings. Participants may supply their own text corpus in advance, or they may use ones provided.\u00a0\nBy the end of the week, participants will propose and scope out a text analytics research project pertaining to their own research or teaching. Throughout the following semester, follow-up office hours with the instructor will occur weekly in support of these individual projects: help for high-performance computing facilities will also be ongoing. Participants will also have the option of forming a working group to provide camaraderie and support.\n", "Date": "Monday, January 11, 2021 - 10:00am to Friday, January 15, 2021 - 5:00pm", "Location": "Zoom live", "Sponsoring Organization(s)": "Institute of the Humanities and Global Cultures, Humanities Informatics Lab", "Tools": "Python ", "Certificate Event": "no", "Event Type": "Workshop" } }, { "node": { "title": "Open Data: A Resource Page for Digital Humanists", "Body": "By Rennie Mapp\nThis resource is a work in process.\u00a0 Feel free to contact me at mapp@virginia.edu with suggestions and questions.\nGeneral Information about Open Data\n\n\nWikipedia article\n\n\nStandards\n\nCIDOC-CRM\u00a0home page\n\nInternational Committee for Documentation (CIDOC)\nContent Reference Model (CRM)\n\n\n\nRDF\n\nW3C RDF 1.1 Primer\n\nLinked Open Data\nSemantic Web\n\nTechnology stack diagram\n\n", "Content Type": "Resources" } }, { "node": { "title": "Humanities Informatics Lab Final Showcase: Network-Corpus", "Body": "https://humanities-informatics.as.virginia.edu/\n", "Date": "Friday, September 25, 2020 - 2:00pm to 3:30pm", "Location": "TBA", "Sponsoring Organization(s)": "Humanities Informatics Lab, Institute of the Humanities and Global Cultures", "Certificate Event": "no", "Event Type": "Conference" } }, { "node": { "title": "Humanities Informatics Lab Final Showcase: Smart Environments", "Body": "https://humanities-informatics.as.virginia.edu/\n", "Date": "Friday, September 18, 2020 - 3:30pm to 6:30pm", "Location": "TBA", "Sponsoring Organization(s)": "Humanities Informatics Lab, Institute of the Humanities and Global Cultures", "Certificate Event": "no", "Event Type": "Conference" } }, { "node": { "title": "Humanities Informatics Lab Final Showcase: Surveillance and Infrastructure", "Body": "https://humanities-informatics.as.virginia.edu/\n", "Date": "Thursday, September 17, 2020 - 4:00pm to 5:30pm", "Location": "TBA", "Sponsoring Organization(s)": "Humanities Informatics Lab, Institute of the Humanities and Global Cultures", "Certificate Event": "no", "Event Type": "Conference" } }, { "node": { "title": "Humanities Informatics Lab Final Showcase: Human/Machine Intelligence", "Body": "The Zoom link for this event is available here.\u00a0\nThe Human and Machine Intelligence Group was formed three years ago with a few interested participants.

Klosko and Lauren Massari, IATH\u2019s multimedia specialist, led the planning and execution of the vital tasks of measuring, counting, packing up, and reusing equipment and furniture in IATH\u2019s new space in Zehmer Hall, where the IATH team will remain until the completion of Alderman\u2019s renovation in 2023.\u00a0The IATH team made quick work of assembling boxes, labels, and packing tape throughout the fall and into the spring semester, leading to a smooth and painless move. Before anyone had a chance to unpack any boxes however, COVID-19 compelled the University to enact work-from-home measures in March, so after a few mad dashes to retrieve laptops and office plants, IATH began its remote operations. System Administrator Shayne Brandon kept digital and physical resources running and accessible, a critical task that took on particular significance as IATH\u2019s community relied solely on virtual networks to maintain collaborations.\nResidential Fellows\nEdith Clowes, the 2019 IATH Residential Fellow, began regular meetings with IATH and her project staff to develop and plan Mapping Poetic Geographies of Revolutionary Russia: 1914-1922. This collaboration began in 2018 with an Associate Fellowship, developed out of meetings between IATH Director Worthy Martin and Prof. Clowes, and now includes graduate students and Cindy Girard, an IATH IT Specialist. This particular collaboration looks to build databases and maps to explore multi-lingual textual and emotional artifacts from another time of dramatic political, social, and cultural change.\nIATH\u2019s first-ever dual Residential Fellowship, awarded to Mona Kasra and Luke Dahl in 2018, has supported ongoing work on Experiencing Embodied Cultural Practices through Motion Capture and Immersive Media: A Hybrid Research/Practice Collaboration Across Disciplines. In the midst of its second fellowship year, the team was preparing for a long-planned trip to Australia to work with an aboriginal community in the Northern Territories. Funds had been secured, calendars had been painstakingly aligned, and equipment was being purchased, all of which came to an abrupt halt in the wake of COVID-19, much to everyone\u2019s dismay.\nOther pandemic frustrations beset the Digital Yoknapatawpha project, which had planned to officially launch its project web site at the University of Mississippi\u2019s 47th Annual Faulkner & Yoknapatawpha Conference in July. The event was cancelled, although the project was able to participate in a virtual reading initiative with the William Faulkner Society, and \u2014\u00a0thanks in part to dedicated work from Programmer Analyst Doug Ross\u00a0\u2014\u00a0announce a new index for locations in Faulkner\u2019s fictional Yoknapatawpha County.\nScholars\u2019 Lab, Woodson, and Collaborations Beyond Grounds\nBeyond its fellowship program, IATH collaborates with their counterparts in Scholars\u2019 Lab and other Library units as well as with faculty and staff across Grounds. Shayne Brandon has been working with Will Rourk from Scholars\u2019 Lab on several 3D projects, most recently a 3D visualization effort of University Hall, the former athletic arena demolished in 2019. Lauren Massari contributed digital models of the UVA Academical Village to the Chrysler Museum of Art in Norfolk, VA, as part of an exhibit on \u201cThomas Jefferson, Architect: Palladian Models, Democratic Principles, and the Conflict of Ideals.\u201d The models came out of her visualization work for the JUEL project (Jefferson\u2019s University\u2014Early Life Project, 1819-1870), which is taking an in-depth look at the theory and the practice of Jefferson\u2019s vision. These models have been critical in understanding how the architecture both supported and tainted the ideals of his new secular university.\u00a0\nProfessor Marlene Daut has been collaborating with IATH since 2018 (initially as an Associate Fellow) on her La Gazettte Royale d\u2019Hayti: A Digital Journey Through Haiti\u2019s Early Print Culture research, and that project received a Garfinkel Prize in Digital Humanities from the American Studies Association.\nTwo external collaborations with independent scholars secured grant funds to continue their work. The Virginia Emigrants to Liberia site began work in 2006 with Virginia Center for Digital History, looking at the American Colonization Society\u2019s work in 19th century Virginia to encourage and support emigration of enslaved and free African Americans to the new colony of Liberia. The project directors, Deborah Lee and Jane Ailes, have been working with IATH to revitalize the project for the past few years, a partnership that yielded a $126,000 NEH award to improve and expand on the original project.\nIndependent scholar Anne Leader first brought her study of tomb registries and the social and economic underpinnings in medieval and Renaissance Florence to IATH in 2016 as a Visiting Fellow, and since then has worked closely with their staff to migrate her project data to a more stable and accessible platform and database. In 2019, Digital Sepoltuario: The Tombs of Renaissance Florence received grants from the Kress Foundation and the Richard Lounsbery Foundation for both technical development and collaboration with scholars at Washington & Lee University.\nEditor's Note: September 2, 2020\nA previous version of this article was published on Monday, August 31, 2020.

Faculty, staff, and graduate students at the UVA School of Architecture work on the Landscape Studies Initiative\u00a0(LSI).\u00a0With Elizabeth Barlow Rogers\u2019 classic textbook,\u00a0Landscape Design: A Cultural and Architectural History, as the project\u2019s intellectual foundation, LSI\u00a0spans the humanities, biophysical and social sciences, and design disciplines. Drawing upon text, archival sources, field work, and digital images, the project, led by Architecture professors Beth Meyer and Michael Lee,\u00a0will utilize topic modeling, natural language processing, computer vision, and other DH methods to produce a relational database\u00a0as part of a public website that will be accessible to researchers and members of the public.\u00a0\nRogers is widely credited with spearheading the revitalization of Central Park in her role as head of the Central Park Conservancy, founded in 1980. Through public-private partnerships, Rogers and her collaborators returned Central Park to its status as the world\u2019s greatest public park over the course of her 16-year tenure as head of the Conservancy. The Landscape Studies Initiative seeks to develop a number of digital humanities projects based on chapters from Rogers\u2019 2001 textbook, which explores how humans have shaped the natural environment across cultures and millennia. The initiative\u2019s pilot projects focus on Central Park in New York City and Park Muskau in Germany. Meyer\u00a0and LSI project manager Allison James hope to produce a comprehensive, interactive database that deepens understandings of \u201centanglements between the human and non-human world.\u201d\u00a0\nThe Landscape Studies Initiative is a collaboration between a number of UVA entities and organizations beyond Grounds. Collaborators include:\n\n\nthe UVA School of Architecture\n\n\nthe Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities\n\n\nthe UVA College of Arts and Sciences\u00a0\n\n\nthe UVA Libraries\n\n\nThe Mellon Foundation\n\n\nJefferson Trust\n\n\nUVA Office of the Provost\n\n\nDAAD (German Academic Exchange Service)\n\n\nOak Spring Garden Foundation\n\n\nThe New York Botanical Garden\n\n\nFor the Initiative\u2019s pilot projects in Germany\u2019s Park Muskau and Central Park, students and other participants have been at work constructing a relational database rooted in the aggregation of vast amounts of metadata, audio clips, video recordings, sketches, and still photos. In August of 2018, 12 students traveled to Germany to conduct fieldwork in Park Muskau under the direction of Architecture faculty Michael Lee and Beth Meyer. The students also visited the Bauhaus and Park\u00a0 W\u00f6rlitz (Dessau), Sanssouci and Charlottenhof (Potsdam), and the Tiergarten and the Berlin Wall (Berlin). Unlike a typical database of still images and primary documents, these pilot projects strive to provide users with immersive experiences and to display the interconnections between different points of information including sound and visual imagery.\u00a0\nMeyer says that she first started writing a grant for the Landscape Studies Initiative in 2016 as new research emerged about Monticello. Then, after the events of August 11 and 12, 2017 in Charlottesville, she\u00a0wanted to \u201cthink about Charlottesville in terms of a larger cultural landscape.\u201d Meyer\u00a0remarked\u00a0that the Central Virginia region serves as a prototype of places that have \u201cerased landscapes of labor for leisure,\u201d adding that the history of design and architecture in Charlottesville from 1865 to 1965 is \u201cas sordid as its antebellum history.\u201d She\u00a0hopes that one function of the initiative will be to demonstrate the ways in which landscapes mask and cloak power. Through the \u201cRacialized Topography of Jeffersonian Landscapes\u201d project within LSI, researchers and the general public will be able to explore questions including but not limited to: what makes a good public space?; who has the right to loiter and linger in public spaces?; how do the various positionings of the built environment enable or hinder access?\u00a0\nIn the fall of 2019, the Center for Cultural Landscapes hosted the Sara Shallenberger Brown Colloquium + Workshops: Towards a Charlottesville Cultural Landscape Atlas at UVA School of Architecture.

Her\u00a0teaching and research are both especially committed to fathoming the Russian utopian mind (i.e. what polity do Russians imagine for themselves?). For the last 15-20 years, embracing all these kinds of Russian writing, her\u00a0focus has turned toward the question of \u201cimagined geographies\u201d in Russian writing culture. Specifically, the ways a cultural community envisions the cultural-geographical terrain which they claim as their own tells us a great deal about identity (who am I and where do I belong?) and mentality (what sets of values do I bring to major decision-making and to action plans?). In this area she has\u00a0three books (Russia on the Edge\u00a0(2011),\u00a0Area Studies in the Global Age\u00a0(2016),\u00a0Russia's Regional Identities: The Power of the Provinces\u00a0(2018) and a special number of the journal,\u00a0Region\u00a0(2016).\nOver the last 6 years she has\u00a0gained basic proficiency in digital literary cartography. Her first project was called \u201cRussian Virginia,\u201d which used free WordPress to map all Russian-related venues and businesses in Virginia. \"Mapping Imagined\u00a0Geographies of Revolutionary Russia (1914-1922)\" is her\u00a0second digital project. In 2014, she taught literary cartography at the University of Heidelberg. Since then, with research support from the Hoover Archives at Stanford University and UVA's IATH, she\u00a0assembled the basic corpus of works (which will be expanding into the future as we gain access to rare works) and, working with the IATH team, we have built the database, repository, and web site for\u00a0\"Mapping Imagined\u00a0Geographies of Revolutionary Russia (1914-1922),\" which can be found here:\u00a0http://maprr.iath.virginia.edu/\u00a0\nKevin Driscoll\u00a0(ked5d@virginia.edu)\nKevin Driscoll is an assistant professor in the Department of Media Studies where he specializes in technology, culture, and communication.

His most recent\u00a0projects are concerned with soliloquy, poetic diction, puzzles, and citation.\nLisa Reilly\u00a0(lar2f@virginia.edu)\nLisa Reilly's chief research interest is in medieval visual culture. Her most recent book,\u00a0The Invention of Norman Visual Culture: Art, Politics, and Dynastic Ambition, published by Cambridge University Press,\u00a0establishes a new interpretive paradigm for the eleventh and twelfth-century art and architecture of the Norman world in France, England, and Sicily\u00a0Recently she and Kevin Murphy co-edited a collection of essays,\u00a0Skyscraper Gothic, which was published by UVA press. \u00a0They are co-curating a related exhibit at the Fralin Museum which will open in September 2020. Lisa Reilly has previously published books on\u00a0Peterborough Cathedral\u00a0\u00a0and\u00a0Vassar College\u00a0(with colleague Karen Van Lengen). \u00a0\u00a0She is currently writing a\u00a0Corpus Vitrearum\u00a0volume on the\u00a0stained glass of the late medieval parish church, St. Michael le Belfrey, together with Mary Shepard. Ms. Reilly is a leading early user of digital humanities technology. She was a fellow at the Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities at the University of Virginia (2006-08). Her ongoing\u00a0research project\u00a0investigates the medieval design process using digital analysis.\nIn 2018 she was awarded the\u00a0Jefferson Scholars Foundation Award for Excellence in Teaching. Ms. Reilly held the NEH/Horace Goldsmith Distinguished Teaching Chair of Art and Architectural History (1999-2002) and frequently offers workshops on teaching. She was awarded a hybrid challenge grant by the Office of the President to redesign the architectural history survey using digital tools. Students in her course\u00a0On Hajj with Ibn Jubayr: Reconstructing the 12th Century Mediterranean, created digital exhibitions using\u00a0Neatline.\u00a0More recently, she has taught a new course,\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThe Visible Past\u201d.\u00a0This new course, which is part of\u00a0\u00a0the Digital Humanities (DH) certificate,\u00a0\u00a0explored what was visible at different historical moments throughout medieval Europe through a study of textual and visual evidence from the past with the aim of considering how more localized antique remains and their presentation may have influenced art and architectural production. Students produced digital projects using\u00a0Storymaps\u00a0to present their research\u00a0\u00a0some of which have been posted to the\u00a0public site, which is in the early stages of development.\u00a0She also teaches the required digital humanities course for M.A. students in architectural history.\u00a0In spring 2017 she taught an innovative new course,\u00a0Strategies of Interpretation: Highland\u00a0in which an interdisciplinary group of students developed interpretation proposals for James Monroe\u2019s house,\u00a0Highland. Together with Matthew McLendon, director and chief curator at the Fralin Museum of Art , she will offer a course in spring 2020 on museum collecting with the support of a fellowship from the Jefferson Trust.\u00a0\nEx Officio Members of the Committee\nSuzanne Moomaw, Director of the University of Virginia Press\u00a0\nMoomaw's research specialty is post-industrial communities, particularly, communities that have depended on manufacturing, extraction, textiles, and agriculture as economic mainstays. On the local and regional scales, she works in Charlottesville on design equity issues and with Southwest Virginia towns on the economic revitalization of their main streets. Nationally and internationally, her research interest is the revitalization ad sustainability of local and regional economies. In 2015, she launched a new project to analyze a subset of the nation\u2019s largest cities beginning in 1956. This research resulted in a book project,\u00a0Cities Without Work: The Long Road from Boom to Bust\u00a0(Harvard University Press forthcoming), which situates the 17 post-industrial cities in the United States that had the highest rates of unemployment in 1960 along a fifty-year trajectory.

With the goal of being the standard bibliography and short-title catalog (RLO-STC) of the University's Rotunda Library, RLO allows users to enter the Rotunda's world through its earliest descriptions, catalogs, and lists.\nThe RLO database is written in PHP and MySQL and currently supports keyword searching and single-facet browsing. The database is supplemented by an evolving suite of digital appendices that reconstruct the early Rotunda Library in an immersive and interactive web environment (see 'Appendices'). For example, our\u00a0Featured Books\u00a0page offers investigative and expository essays on individual RLO titles and points of provenance. These essays, concise yet nuanced and always illustrated, form an evolving showcase of our provenance, archival, and bibliographical research. As of December 2018, metadata refinement and site development are ongoing. Stay tuned.\nOne of RLO's principal goals is to identify original Rotunda Library books that survive at the University of Virginia. While scholars have long assumed that the Rotunda Library collection was destroyed in an 1895 fire, our research shows that a substantial portion of the Rotunda's books survive in the University of Virginia's Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library today. As seen in the\u00a0RLO-STC, green icons mark original Rotunda books that survive; flame icons mark books that were presumably lost in the 1895 fire and do not survive; and\u00a0icons mark unidentified books.\nBut how does RLO identify original Rotunda Library books? The process is painstaking, yet straightforward: over countless hours in the University of Virginia's Special Collections Library, RLO staff have sought out shelf mark and other distinctive provenance evidence (bindings, book stamps, book plates, etc.) that can be used to prove an individual book's Rotunda Library, and ultimately Jeffersonian origin. By collating this evidence with early booklists and catalogs, we have successfully identified over 1,300 original Rotunda Library books that survive. For an overview of this provenance evidence, see our blog-post,\u00a0\"Identifying Early Shelf-Marks from the Rotunda Library.\"\u00a0Occasionally, this evidence does not survive\u2014books are rebound, and title pages and spines that once bore shelf marks or stamps are lost. In this case, copies of books listed in early Rotunda catalogs extant in Special Collections are designated 'potential survivors'\u2014in other words, these books\u00a0may\u00a0be original Rotunda Library copies, but lacking physical provenance evidence, this tentative designation cannot be proved. These potential survivors are marked with a grey diamond icon in the RLO-STC.\nRLO is compiled, designed, and edited by\u00a0Neal D. Curtis,\u00a0Samuel V. Lemley,\u00a0&\u00a0Madeline Zehnder, PhD students in English at the University of Virginia. Early development of RLO was generously funded by the William R. Kenan Endowment Fund of the Academical Village and the Buckner W. Clay Endowment for the Humanities at the Institute of the Humanities & Global Cultures at the University of Virginia (IHGC).\nTo say that one is 'reconstructing' a library or a collection (digitally or otherwise) is to use a metaphor signaling participation in a genre of scholarly research; it is not unique phrasing, nor does it describe a unique methodology or approach. Countless researchers of historical collections and libraries have used this same metaphor to describe their projects, and one scholar\u2019s reconstruction does not preclude subsequent attempts at reconstruction in different forms or with different emphases. It is this very condition of variability that guarantees humanistic study a dynamic and open future. We offer the following sampling of admirable 'reconstruction' projects to illustrate our point: The effort to catalog and reassemble books listed in the 1828 catalog by John Cook Wyllie, Louise Savage, and University of Virginia librarians in the 1940s and 50s; E.S. Campbell's reconstruction of the Rotunda's collection of books on art and architecture (1927-1950); E. Millicent Sowerby's Catalogue of the Library of Thomas Jefferson (1952-59); the ongoing Library of Congress effort to reconstruct Thomas Jefferson's Library (1999-); the Thomas Jefferson's Libraries project at the International Center for Jefferson Studies-Monticello (2004-); the Viseyes (UVa) reconstruction and data analysis of the University of Virginia's first library (2010); The Wolf Law Library's 'Wythepedia' and Wythe Library project at the College of William and Mary (2005-); and the 1828 Catalogue First Law Library Project, which reconstructs and studies the first collection of law books at the University of Virginia (2014-).

Combining traditional close reading with computational methods, Buysse produced a website that allows users to generate\u00a0grammar diagrams of varying lengths. Buysse says that diagramming provides a line of sight into how Stein and her contemporaries were trained to approach composition in addition to providing \"a better technical vocabulary for closely reading the mechanics of Steinese.\" DIagramming waned as a form of writing pedagogy\u00a0in the 1960s, but automating the process as Buysse has done offers opportunities for human readers of texts to glean patterns in sentence structure and writing that might otherwise be missed. The demo for Buysse's Django-based grammar parsing tool is available here.\nMiller's reseach focused on immersive ecologies in video games, examining the ways in which these virtual environments alter the player's relationship to space. She argues that through specific design choices, video games with immersive ecologies create a \"field of possibility\" in which mulitple experiences of time and material conditions become possible. She further suggests that through playing these video games, players enter a liminal ontological space in which they become both subject and object, creating\u00a0\"a back and forth flow of subjectivity,\" as Miller writes in her Scholars' Lab blog. \n\nThese games change our fundamental understandings of space, time, material conditions, and place at the same time that\u00a0our understandings from the real world inform our movements and experiences of the virtual world in the game. Miller also worked with Scholars' Lab 3D Visualization Specialist Arin Bennett and 3D Data and Content Specialist Will Rourk to create virtual worlds that visualize and guide users\u00a0through ideas Miller draws upon from architectural theory. See Miller's Scholars' Lab\u00a0blog\u00a0post for more information on the underpinnings of her research as a DH Fellow.\nCultural Heritage Informatics, Makerspace, and Manufacturing Masks\nUnlimited Dimensions\nStudents participating in Scholars' Lab's Cultural Heritage Informatics Internship program recently launched Unlimited Dimensions, a website exploring\u00a0the influence of the Italian Renaissance architect Andrea Palladio on Thomas Jefferson's architectural vision and design. Working under the supervision of Scholars' Lab 3D Data and Content Specialist Will Rourk, students drew upon data gathered from \"Palladio's Villa La Rotonda\" which received a 3Cavaliers Grant from the Office of the Vice President for Research in 2018. Together, Rourk and his interns produced 3D scans of Villa La Rotonda, the Academical Village, UVA's Rotunda, and Jefferson's personal retreat, Poplar Forest, assembled in a series of ArcGIS StoryMaps.

Throughout western Europe and around the Mediterranean, the Roman past has been visible through archaeological remains, drawings, prints and texts although the use of the antique past in later art and architecture is often discussed exclusively with regard to what remains in Rome itself. Some, such as Hadrian\u2019s Wall, has remained visible throughout time, while others such as Vindolanda have only been uncovered in the past century while still others, such as the Temple of Claudius provde the foundations for Colchester Castle. Stonework from over 20 individual monuments was embedded in Hexham Abbey and the Venerable Bede provides accounts of Roman remains in his 8th century History of the English People. This course will explore what was visible when throughout the region through a study of textual and visual evidence from the past with the aim of considering how more localized antique remains and their presentation may have influenced art and architectural production. Assigned readings will focus on the antique in England, with a particular interest in the medieval period but students will be free to develop research projects on any time period or place in relation to the classical past. This seminar is being offered in conjunction with a new digital humanities project which seeks to map information concerning the evidence for the antique past across time and place in Great Britain. The seminar will feature discussion of how to develop a digital humanities project using Design Thinking methodologies.\nRequirements:\nClass meetings will center on the discussion of related texts, websites, digital projects, short lectures and student presentations. Each student will be asked to give one major presentation (30 minutes) on a topic developed in conjunction with the instructor and develpp a digital project on the same topic using arcgis and Storymap.

Mellon Foundation \nPress release published in full from the Center for Digital Editing (Contact: Katie Blizzard, kblizzard@virginia.edu)\nCharlottesville, Va.\u2014 The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation has awarded $1 million toward a groundbreaking digital publishing enterprise at the University of Virginia (UVA).\n\u00a0\nThe funding will support the Virginia Digital Publishing Cooperative, a partnership between the Center for Digital Editing (CDE) and University of Virginia Press that developed out of an NHPRC-Mellon planning grant awarded in 2017. The new award, issued in December 2019, will promote the creation of an accessible, robust, and sustainable system for publishing the work of scholars who transcribe and annotate records of historical importance.\n\u00a0\nThe grant was made possible through a partnership between The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and the National Historical Publications and Records Commission. In 2017, the NHPRC-Mellon Digital Edition Publishing Cooperatives initiative was developed in response to \u201cthe urgent need of scholars and documentary editors for reliable, sustainable, authoritative, and field-driven outlets for publication and discovery of digital editions.\u201d\n\u00a0\nFor the next three years, individuals and organizations from around the globe will collaborate on building the technical and human infrastructures necessary to make such a publishing pipeline possible. More than 30 leaders from the fields of textual editing, history, and digital humanities are participating, including Ron Hutchins, vice president of information technology at UVA; John Unsworth, dean of libraries at UVA; and the following organizations:\n\n\n\nAmerican University\nBoston University\nBucknell University\nBrumfield Labs, LLC\nCenter for Digital Editing (CDE) at the University of Virginia\nCentre for Information Modelling in the Austrian Centre for Digital Humanities at the University of Graz\nConstitutional Sources Project\nCumberland University\nDolley Madison Digital Edition/Founding Women at the University of Virginia\nHampshire College \nHarvard University\nFilson Historical Society\nJohns Hopkins University\nRamapo College of New Jersey\nSUNY Old Westbury\nUniversity of Kentucky\nUniversity of Mary Washington\nUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill\nUniversity of South Carolina\nUniversity of Virginia Libraries\nUniversity of Virginia Press/Rotunda\nWheaton College\n\n\nJennifer Stertzer, director of the Center for Digital Editing and principal investigator on the grant, explained that these contributors were carefully chosen for their insight into the challenges of preparing and publishing scholarly editions. \u201cMembers of this cooperative have long advocated for a robust digital editing ecosystem that provides editors with the tools, platforms, resources, and expertise necessary to advance the field of documentary editing and its goal of making the humanities accessible.\u201d\n\u00a0\nCurrently, there are only a handful of publishing platforms available to editors. Most notable of these is Rotunda, the electronic imprint of UVA Press. Rotunda was created to publish original digital scholarship along with newly digitized versions of previously published editions of critical and documentary works in the humanities and social sciences.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRotunda\u2019s established reputation in publishing digital editions, and its available scholarship and expertise, will allow the cooperative to offer the electronic imprint as an attractive option for peer-reviewed publication. An additional option that will be made available includes a more customizable platform modeled after the digital editions developed by the CDE. The Virginia Digital Publishing Cooperative will help editors choose from among these options according to the needs and goals of their project. Ultimately, the cooperative\u2019s package of consulting services and publication options should simplify digital publishing while accommodating editorial vision.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe University of Virginia Press has worked closely with the Washington Papers and the Center for Digital Editing since the mid-2000s on our Rotunda digital edition of\u00a0The Papers of George Washington, and for decades with the documentary editing community as the publisher of editions of George Washington, James Madison, John Jay, and other major figures,\u201d said David Sewell, manager of digital initiatives at UVA Press. \u201cWe are pleased that our collaboration will now expand to enable a wider universe of documentary editors to take advantage of digital preparation and publication for their projects.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe Digital Publishing Cooperative will make digital editing and publishing more accessible by providing myriad modes of access and discovery; it will also enhance our understanding of history and advance scholarly research,\u201d added Christian McMillen, associate dean of UVA\u2019s College of Arts and Sciences. \u201cThe NHPRC-Mellon award confirms what we have long known: The University of Virginia Press and the Center for Digital Editing are leaders in the field of digital publishing.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFor more information about the grant, contact Katie Blizzard at kblizzard@virginia.edu.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAbout the Center for Digital Editing\n\u00a0\nThe Center for Digital Editing (CDE) promotes innovative digital advances in the field of scholarly editing.

Wils McCreight, a fourth-year computer science major, and Sydney Kennedy, a second-year classical archaeology major, arrived on Grounds in January for a one-to-two day externship under the aegis of DH@UVA and managed by DH Communications Specialist Logan Heiman. Heiman organized the externships so that each student could participate\u00a0in a shadowing experience tailored to their academic and professional interests.\u00a0 Faculty, graduate students, and staff across UVA's\u00a0myriad DH academic units welcomed the externs and related their own work to the externs' specific interests.\u00a0 \u00a0Working with Rennie Mapp, Project Manager for Strategic DH Initiatives, Heiman conceived of the externship as a prototype program that could eventually become a way to introduce DH\u00a0to students from groups that are underrepresented in humanities graduate programs.\u00a0\nMcCreight expressed\u00a0interest in digital humanities scholarship and activity at UVA\u2019s newest school, the School of Data Science. He brought to the program extensive experience in a number of programming languages and had participated in a summer program at the University of Cambridge with a focus on Shakespeare\u2019s Renaissance and British dialects in film and television. At the \u201cSchool Without Walls,\u201d he met with Professor and Program Director Rafael Alvarado and Master of Science in Data Science graduate student Melissa Phillips. McCreight initially conceived of the digital humanities as the use of technology to solve complex social problems such as public health and privacy and disinformation. Alvarado provided a sweeping history of the digital humanities\u2019 origins stretching back to the 1980s, explaining that the intent of DH methodologies and approaches initially emerged as a way to preserve and extend significant cultural artifacts into the future.\u00a0\nAlvarado noted that McCreight\u2019s initial conception of digital humanities was not completely off the mark. DH tools and methods have been put to use for both scholarly and social purposes in the past, a fact that came up in discussion of a project led by Alex Gil, presently Digital Scholarship Librarian at Columbia University and a 2012 alumnus of the UVA English Department. In 2018, Gil created the Torn Apart/Separados project together with scholars, librarians, and activists to generate GIS data and visualizations documenting the Trump Administration\u2019s \u201cZero Tolerance Policy\u201d for asylum seekers at US ports of entry and the humanitarian crisis that ensued.\u00a0\nKennedy participated in the externship looking to explore UVA\u2019s offerings in the digital humanities, particularly in classical archaeology. She first experienced the possibilities of DH tools in high school when she used 3D scanning equipment and software to build a digital collection for her high school\u2019s war museum. At the College of William and Mary, Kennedy continued to gain exposure to DH tools including with GIS and Omeka software as she developed interest in a career in classical museum collections. Kennedy took advantage of the externship to discuss prospects for graduate school with Fotini Kondyli, Assistant Professor of Byzantine Art and Archaeology in the McIntire Department of Art. She also sat in on a work session with graduate students holding fellowships with the Scholars\u2019 Lab\u2019s Praxis Fellows program followed by coffee and a Q&A session arranged by Scholars\u2019 Lab Head of Student Programs Brandon Walsh.\u00a0Kennedy remarked that her externship experience exposed her to the opportunities and challenges of the digital humanities along with the ethical considerations of computing in the humanities.\n\"DH@UVA has encouraged me to think anew about\u00a0DH methodologies and tools -- including data visualization,\u00a0virtual reality as a means of site reconstruction, and 3D scanning and printing of artifacts -- and how they might be harnessed to communicate effectively with both scholars and the general public about new research. I hope to apply the insights I've gained\u00a0as I continue my Classical Archaeology degree and, later, pursue graduate studies,\" she said.\nMcCreight said he was struck by the intelligence and drive of UVA's DH faculty and staff who catalyze\u00a0innovation in their respective fields. \"I left Grounds with a more tangible understanding of the digital humanities and a personal commitment to incorporate it into my own career,\" he said.\u00a0\nBoth Kennedy and McCreight met with representatives from constituent units of the DH community at UVA including from Scholars\u2019 Lab, IATH, and DH@UVA.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n", "Image": { "src": "https://dh-dev.library.virginia.edu/sites/digitalhumanities.virginia.edu/files/Externs%20without%20gray%20box.JPG", "alt": "" }, "Subtitle": "By Logan Heiman" } }, { "node": { "title": "For Online DH Course Instructors, More Help with Assignments, Syllabi, and Readings", "Body": "Please visit our updated DH Pedagogy pages\u00a0to find an expanded bibliography, assignments, and a searchable DH syllabus database.\u00a0 While Covid-19 is presenting the DH community with extraordinary challenges, we hope that these new resources will\u00a0mitigate some of the stress of taking your courses online.\nPlease contact Rennie Mapp at mapp@virginia.edu with suggestions or corrections.\n\nDH@UVA is made possible through\u00a0the collaborative sponsorship\u00a0of\u00a0Ron Hutchins, Vice President for IT, and John Unsworth, Dean of the Library and University Librarian.\u00a0\u00a0\n", "Image": { "src": "https://dh-dev.library.virginia.edu/sites/digitalhumanities.virginia.edu/files/New%20Pedagogy%20Resources%20News%20image-1.png", "alt": "" } } }, { "node": { "title": "Find DH Assignments to Inspire Your Students", "Body": "\u00a0\nDeveloping DH assignments for your syllabus can be both exciting and daunting.\u00a0 This list of resources provides inspiration and models.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nBarnett, Fiona and Hastac Scholars.\u00a0The Pedagogy Project.

Can the transience of digital content provide occasion to reject the notion of \u201clost\u201d Black histories? Sonya Donaldson answered these questions and more in a presentation at the Scholars\u2019 Lab entitled, \u201cEphemeral Archives: Curating Black Knowledges in the Digital Age\u201d in December.\u00a0Donaldson, Associate Professor of English at New Jersey City University, is currently working on a digital humanities project entitled \u201cSinging the Nation Into Being\u201d which examines videos and metadata to extract information that might provide insights into Black subjectivities, nation, and diaspora. In the fall of 2019, her work was supported by a Virginia Humanities fellowship.\nDonaldson\u00a0focuses on YouTube video performances of \u201cLift Every Voice and Sing,\u201d originally written in 1899 as a tribute poem to Abraham Lincoln before it became a hymn known widely as the \u201cBlack national anthem.\u201d She examined various professional and amateur renditions, mashups, and remixes of the hymn, describing them as expressions of Black identity formation and \u201csites of memory.\u201d Donaldson opened the talk with an anecdote about her time as a UVA graduate student when Amiri Baraka made an appearance on Grounds. After a performance of \u201cLift Every Voice and Sing\u201d by student group Black Voices, Baraka said, \u201cThere\u2019s more to that song. There\u2019s a lot more.\u201d The cryptic comment prompted Donaldson and her fellow graduate students to ask, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we sing it anymore?\u201d She eventually learned that the hymn continued to hold a key position in Black Southern culture well into the 21st century.\u00a0 She added that the question said more about her and her cohort\u2019s relationship to their identity and culture than about the hymn\u2019s endurance in Black communities.\u00a0\nDonaldson cited the role of Toni Morrison\u2019s notion of \u201crememory\u201d in allowing her to devise a methodology for rebuilding, recovering, and reconstituting Black knowledges. She nodded to the possibilities that platforms like YouTube, Soundcloud, and Vimeo afford, facilitating Black expression, identity formation, and memory building. Searching for a YouTube video performance she had previously viewed, Donaldson encountered a black screen with a notice that the content had been removed due to a copyright infringement. The video\u2019s disappearance brought Donaldson\u2019s research focus on digital ephemera into sharp focus.\u00a0\nDonaldson listed a number of forces that contribute to the transitory nature of digital content including copyright law, privacy-related issues, and shifting business models. Yet, even as technology transforms digital performances into ephemera, Donaldson sees value in the transmutability of Youtube videos and other digital content as they take on new meaning in the form of fragments and mashups.\u00a0\nIn an illuminating example, Donaldson played a mashup of an interview with famed American soprano Leontyne Price which segued into a performance of \u201cLift Every Voice and Sing.\u201d By placing Price\u2019s trenchant commentary on race relations in America alongside her performance, Donaldson said the mashup effectively reconstituted digital fragments to produce a coherent whole that reflected Price\u2019s politics.\nShe later discussed consent and ethical considerations involved in digital data collection. A number of the Youtube performances of \u201cLift Every Voice and Sing\u201d\u00a0 featured minors while still others performed their pieces in personal spaces. Donaldson pixelated the faces of minors that appeared in a sampling of her collection during the\u00a0talk, and she walked the audience through her thought process as she weighed privacy concerns against the aims of her research.\nIn a tweet, Amanda Visconti, Managing Director of the Scholars\u2019 Lab, described Donaldson\u2019s presentation as a \u201cskillful blending of theory and generous citation +\u00a0 a roadmap of how this scholarly project was inspired through honing in on its current arguments + sharing and analyzing the practical processes of doing this DH scholarship.\u201d Alison Booth, Academic Director of the Scholars\u2019 Lab, echoed Visconti, remarking that the talk was \u201cmajestic and humble\u201d and \u201ca great mashup of accessibility and theory.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n", "Image": { "src": "https://dh-dev.library.virginia.edu/sites/digitalhumanities.virginia.edu/files/555C6BE0-BAFC-4103-B213-CFEBAD7DE95A.jpg", "alt": "" }, "Subtitle": "By Logan Heiman" } }, { "node": { "title": " to Voyant by Interested", "I am connected to:": "Voyant", "Instructor": "Rennie Mapp", "My connection type is:": "Interested" } }, { "node": { "title": " to  Introduction to Digital Humanities by Student, graduate", "I am connected to:": "ENGL 668K  Introduction to Digital Humanities", "Instructor": "Catherine L Addington", "My connection type is:": "Student, graduate" } }, { "node": { "title": " to James English to lecture on \"Bad Habits on Goodreads?

Please\u00a0subscribe\u00a0to the Scholars\u2019 Lab newsletter or check back here for further information.\nIf you\u2019re interested in learning more about the fellowship or have questions about anything you read below, please consider attending the information session for the 2020-2021 cohort on\u00a0Wednesday, February 19th from 11AM-12PM in New Cabell Hall 236.\nThe\u00a0Praxis Program\u00a0is a radical re-imagining of the annual teaching and training we offer in the Scholars\u2019 Lab. This fellowship supports a team of six University of Virginia PhD students from a variety of disciplines, who work collaboratively on a shared digital humanities project. Under the guidance of Scholars\u2019 Lab faculty and staff, Praxis fellows conceive, develop, publish, and promote a digital project over the course of an academic year. Praxis is a unique and well-known training program in the international digital humanities community. Our fellows blog about their experiences and develop increased facility with project management, collaboration, and the public humanities, even as they tackle (most for the first time, and with the mentorship of our faculty and staff) new programming languages, tools, and digital methods. Praxis aims to prepare fellows with digital methodologies to apply both to the fellowship project and their future research.\nOur first two cohorts designed and built\u00a0Prism, a digital tool for crowd-sourced humanities interpretation, visualization, and textual analysis. Our third and fourth cohorts re-imagined\u00a0Ivanhoe, a WordPress\u00a0theme enabling\u00a0collaborative criticism through roleplay.\u00a0Our fifth cohort explored sonification of humanities data with the project\u00a0Clockwork. More recently, cohorts have worked on\u00a0Dash-Amerikan, a social media ecology of the Kardashian family], and\u00a0UVA Reveal, an augmented reality project that layers contextual information on contested public spaces on UVA\u2019s campus, and\u00a0Unclosure, a project that explores the possibilities that the public domain holds for research, pedagogy, and play.\nBeginning as a\u00a02011-2013 pilot project supported by a grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to UVa Library\u2019s\u00a0Scholarly Communication Institute, the Praxis Program is now\u00a0generously supported by\u00a0UVa Library\u00a0and\u00a0GSAS. The Praxis Program is a core module of\u00a0PHD+, a university-wide initiative to prepare PhD students across all disciplines for long-term career success. The work Praxis Fellows undertake over the course of their fellowship year may be submitted in partial fulfillment of the practicum requirement for UVA\u2019s Graduate Certificate in Digital Humanities.\nThe Praxis fellowship replaces recipients\u2019 teaching responsibilities for the academic year. Fellows are expected to devote 10 hours per week in the Scholars\u2019 Lab.\u00a0Fellows join our vibrant community, have a voice in intellectual programming for the Scholars\u2019 Lab, and can make use of a dedicated graduate space in the Lab offices.\nEligibility\nAll University of Virginia doctoral students working within or committed to humanities disciplines are eligible to apply. We particularly encourage applications from women, LGBT students, and people of color, and will be working to put together an interdisciplinary and intellectually diverse team.\nApplicants must be enrolled full time in the year for which they are applying. In addition, applicants must be capable of attending weekly in-person meetings in both the fall and spring semesters of their fellowship year.\nApplicants must still be drawing upon their regular funding packages as part of their doctoral program. I.e. students will typically be in years 2-5 of their program\u00a0during the year the fellowship will be held.\nN.b.\u00a0- Praxis students are\u00a0not\u00a0expected to come in with particular technical training or experiences - we cover that over the course of the fellowship year! Prior experience with digital technology is only one part of an application and should not keep anyone from applying. Everyone brings something different to the team, and your strengths in critical thinking about media, collaboration, project development, and more could be great ways for an application to shine. Concerned students are encouraged to reach out to\u00a0Brandon Walsh, our Head of Graduate Programs, to discuss their backgrounds or eligibility.\nHow to Apply\nThe application process for Praxis is simple! You apply individually, and we assemble the team, through a process that includes group interviews and input from peers. To start, we only ask for a letter of intent (roughly 1-2 pages single-spaced). The letter should include:\n\nthe applicant\u2019s research interests;\nsummary of the applicant\u2019s plan for use of digital technologies in your research;\nsummary of what skills, interests, methods the applicant will bring to the Praxis Program;\nsummary of what the applicant hopes to gain as a Praxis Fellow;\nand your availability on the days we\u2019ve identified for sixty-minute group interviews -\u00a0March 23rd from 1-3pm or March 24th from 10-11. We\u2019re aiming for a quicker process this year by announcing those group interview times in advance, though they may be subject to change if scheduling difficulties arise.\n\nQuestions about Praxis Fellowships and the application process should be directed to\u00a0Brandon Walsh. Completed application materials can be uploaded through the\u00a0GSAS application portal. Please do consider this application to be part of a process - the beginning of a conversation about how we can work together. We highly encourage students to write to\u00a0Brandon Walsh\u00a0to express their interest and (once an application has been submitted) to let us know you have applied. Together we can begin to discuss how the Lab can be a part of your time here, with Praxis or otherwise.\n", "Date": "Sunday, March 1, 2020 - 5:00pm", "Location": "Scholars' Lab", "Related Link(s)": "Praxis Program CFP", "Sponsoring Organization(s)": "Scholars' Lab", "Certificate Event": "no", "Event Type": "Deadline" } }, { "node": { "title": "CANCELLED: Workshop: All Research is About Stories: Connecting Your Academic Work to Public Conversations", "Body": "\n\nDue to travel guidance from UVA related to COVID-19, this event has been cancelled and will be rescheduled for fall 2020.

More broadly, she is interested in the 20th and 21st century American literature, verbal-visual studies, scholarly communication and digital humanities.\n", "Date": "Friday, November 8, 2019 - 10:00am to 11:30am", "Location": "Alderman Library, Room 421", "Related Link(s)": "UVA Library Event Page, Project: Revising Ekphrasis", "Sponsoring Organization(s)": "Scholars' Lab", "Certificate Event": "yes", "Event Type": "Lecture" } }, { "node": { "title": " to DH Mixer by Attended", "I am connected to:": "DH Mixer", "Instructor": "Spyros Simotas", "My connection type is:": "Attended" } }, { "node": { "title": " to DH Project Scoping Panel by Professor", "Instructor": "Prof. Alison Booth", "My connection type is:": "Professor" } }, { "node": { "title": " to DH Project Scoping Panel by Professor", "Instructor": "Prof. Alison Booth", "My connection type is:": "Professor" } }, { "node": { "title": "University of Virginia Centro de las Am\u00e9rica/Americas Center Symposium, \"From the Mouth of a Shark: Causes and Consequences of the Central American Refugee Crisis\"   ", "Body": "no one leaves home unless\nhome is the mouth of a shark\u00a0\nyou only run for the border\u00a0\nwhen you see the whole city\u00a0running as well\u00a0\n\u2014\"Home,\" Warsan Shire\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n1:00PM Introductions\nThomas Klubock (Department of History/UVA Latin American Studies Program)\nMicheline Aharonian Marcom (Department of English/Creative writing)\n\u00a0\n1:15-3:00PM Causes and Consequences of the Central American Refugee Crisis\nAnthony Fontes (School of International Service, American University):\u00a0Moderator\nMike Anastario (Sociologist, El Salvador)\nMolly Molloy (Southwest Asylum & Migration Institute, New Mexico)\nVictoria Sanford (Center for Human Rights and Peace Studies, Lehman College/Department of Anthropology, Graduate Center, City University of New York)\n\u00a0\n3:15-4:15PM Journalism and Documentary Work on Migration\nTomas Ayuso (Photojournalist Honduras) will present photos and discuss his project:\n\u00a0\"The Right to Grow Old\"\n\u00a0\n4:30-5:15PM Storytelling in Response\nFederico Cuatlacuatl (Department of Studio Art, University of Virginia) will show and discuss his film made with UVA students and Micheline Aharonian Marcom (Department of English/Creative Writing) will show and discuss with Erin K\u00f6kdil (Documentary and NASP filmmaker) and videos from the New American Storytelling Project (NASP).\n\u00a0\nClosing Remarks\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nParticipant Bios\n\u00a0\nMike Anastario\u00a0is a sociologist who conducts research on agrarian worlds and human health in El Salvador. In 2019, he published Parcels: Memories of Salvadoran Migration with Rutgers University Press. This work explores memory and forgetting relative to a rural Salvadoran diaspora. As a 2018-2019 US Fulbright Scholar, he collected data on the implementation of science and technology in Salvadoran agriculture and psychiatry. He is interested in the emerging ways in which remittances and deportations shape everyday life in these contexts.\n\u00a0\nTomas Ayuso\u00a0is a Honduran writer and documentary photojournalist. He seeks to bind the disparate threads of communities into the grand interlinked story of the Western Hemisphere. In covering the different types of violence facing the region\u2019s people, Ayuso hopes to create a record of both continental struggles and local successes. He is a fellow of the Open Society Foundations, and continues to cover the Honduran collapse and its far-reaching consequences as the country's youth struggle for survival in a project called The Right to Grow Old. He is also a National Geographic Explorer developing a semi-autobiographical project about the Palestinian diaspora in Latin America, of which he is a part. Ayuso was recently awarded the 2019 James Foley Award for Conflict Reporting for his unflinching coverage of conflict in Latin America as it relates to the drug war, forced displacement and urban dispossession.\n\u00a0\nFedericoCuatlacuatl, born in Cholula, Puebla, Mexico, is an indigenous artist based in Virginia. He\u00a0grew up in Indiana and received his MFA in 2015, specializing in Digital Arts from Bowling Green State University.\u00a0 Federico's work is invested in disseminating topics of Latinx immigration, social art practice, and cultural sustainability. Building from his own experience growing up as an undocumented immigrant and previously holding DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals), Federico\u2019s research is primarily concerned with pressing realities in current social, political, and cultural issues that Latinx undocumented immigrants face in the U.S. \u00a0Federico\u2019s\u00a0independent productions have\u00a0been screened in various national and international film festivals.\u00a0As founder and director of the Rasquache Artist Residency in Puebla, Mexico, he actively stays involved in socially engaged works and binational endeavors.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnthony W.

His award-winning book,\u00a0Mortal Doubt\u00a0(University of California Press 2018),\u00a0explores the rise of extreme peacetime violence in Central America\u2019s Northern Triangle, illuminating the blurred boundaries between the underworld, the state and law-abiding society, and the ways the region\u2019s struggle with violence and poverty is intimately linked to its relationship with the United States. He has conducted extensive ethnographic fieldwork in Central American prisons, gang-dominated neighborhoods, and along migration and drug-trafficking routes across the region. Currently, he is engaged in multi-sited fieldwork for a new book on the \"Central American migration crisis\" and what it means for Central America, the Central American diaspora and US society more broadly. He has received numerous fellowships and grants from the Open Society Foundation, the Andrew Mellon Foundation, and the HF Guggenheim Foundation, among others.\u00a0\u00a0His work has also appeared in Newsweek, Salon, and the New York Times.\n\u00a0\nErin Semine K\u00f6kdilis an Oakland-based storyteller interested in building solidarity and inciting social change through film.

Under a tent festooned with banners featuring the school's informal motto, \"A School Without Walls,\" newly-appointed Dean Phillip E. Bourne offered remarks alongside President Jim Ryan and Provost Liz Magill outside the Dell 1 building on Central Grounds. The launch event drew a number of affiliates from UVA's digital humanities community with curricular and disciplinary ties to what was previously the Data Science Institute.\nDean Bourne spoke enthusiastically about how the digital humanities contribute to the School of Data Science's research and teaching mission.\n\"Digital Humanities (DH) has long been an important area of active collaborations across the University and the new School of Data Science (SDS) intends to join in those collaborations,\" Bourne said. He noted existing collaborations in the areas of education and medicine and expressed his intent to explore joint DH/SDS faculty and staff hires and research ventures based on shared academic values.\n\"At UVA, data science and the arts and humanities are well situated to reinforce one another,\" said Alison Booth, Professor of English and Academic Director of UVA Library's Scholars' Lab. She heralded SDS's interdisciplinary reach and the school's potential to capitalize on UVA's existing strengths including those in DH. \"Many of the leaders in digital humanities today got their start here, and we have IATH, Scholars\u2019 Lab, the DH Graduate Certificate, and the Humanities Informatics Lab (SIF-funded through 2019). We\u2019re ready to help form a DH/SDS collaboratory and to coordinate cluster hires that serve Data (Arts and) Humanities/Science.\"\nWorthy Martin, Associate Professor of Computer Science and Acting Director of IATH echoed the excitement about future partnerships between SDS and the DH community. \"Digital Humanities (DH) scholarship is, in the vast majority of cases, a deeply collaborative endeavor between faculty, students and technologists. In that respect, DH is very similar to \"computational science\", e.g., computational biology. Extending these DH collaborations to include participation by members of the School of Data Science (SDS) community is an exciting possibility.\"\nRennie Mapp, Administrative Director of the DH Graduate Certificate program at UVA, highlighted curricular opportunities for DH Certificate students at the School of Data Science. \"It's the good fortune of DH Certificate students to be able to take courses at SDS like Rafael Alvarado's\u00a0Exploratory Text Analytics course.\u00a0Collaborations between the School of Data Science and the Graduate DH Certificate program create opportunities that are absolutely unique among graduate-level digital humanities programs in North America.\"\nPre-dating its transformation into UVA's 12th school, the Data Science program at Virginia has a longstanding commitment to ethical and responsible data science. With the promise of a full complement of programming that includes UVA's DH partnerships, the SDS is poised to become one of UVA's most versatile institutions focused\u00a0on both the future of technology and data and the humanistic concerns and questions they generate.\n", "Image": { "src": "https://dh-dev.library.virginia.edu/sites/digitalhumanities.virginia.edu/files/AA85935E-048A-41AF-9181-016DCBF50A76.jpg", "alt": "Man standing at a podium with large banner in the background" }, "Subtitle": "By Logan Heiman", "Image (caption)": "School of Data Science Dean Phil Bourne offers remarks with UVA President Jim Ryan and Provost Liz Magill looking on.\r\n" } }, { "node": { "title": " to Virginia Humanities by Funded", "I am connected to:": "Virginia Humanities", "Instructor": "Ren Caasi Capucao Jr.", "My connection type is:": "Funded" } }, { "node": { "title": " to DH@UVa by Student, graduate", "I am connected to:": "DH@UVa", "Instructor": "Ren Caasi Capucao Jr.", "My connection type is:": "Student, graduate" } }, { "node": { "title": "Ren Caasi Capucao Jr.", "Add Link to Blog": "ePortfolio", "Add Other Links": "New Exhibit Uncovers the History of Filipino Nurses in Virginia ", "Add Publication Links": "Filipino Nurses and the US Navy at Hampton Roads, Virginia: The Importance of Place, For the Love of Family: The Filipina/o Nurse Diaspora, Beyond Western Expectations: Filipina Nurse Leaders Anastacia Giron-Tupas and Julita Villaruel Sotejo, 1910-1950", "Body": "\u00a0\nHello, my name is Ren, and I am a nurse historian and registered nurse.

Once she completed the programming boot camp, she transitioned into the private sector but soon found that she wanted to be in an environment that made direct use of her doctoral training. \nWhat follows is a Q&A with Klosko about her academic background, research interests, and what\u2019s on her mind in the early days of her IATH tenure. Some responses have been edited for brevity and clarity.\nQ&A with Susanna Klosko, IATH Project Manager and Designer:\nHeiman: What makes IATH uniquely appealing to you as an experienced digital humanist?\nKlosko: I wanted a job where it felt like I was able to use my PhD more fully. My dream to get involved with digital humanities projects and to work with faculty in a wide range of disciplines is exciting to me. I also really like the people at IATH. They\u2019re very smart, on top of things, but also laid back and relaxed. They all have interesting and creative ideas about how to mix technology and humanities.\nHeiman: What will your responsibilities as IATH project manager be and what are some of the key project management lessons and experiences that you\u2019ll bring to this new role?\nKlosko: I get to use programming languages like Ruby on Rails that I have a good amount of experience with, and I\u2019m starting to jump in on a variety of projects all at different stages. For example, we\u2019re in the midst of diagnosing a bug that affects The Scottish Court of Session project. IATH also has a partnership with the Digital Archaeological Archive of Comparative Slavery (DAACS), which has an affiliation with Monticello. It allows archaeologists from the American South to access archaeological artifacts. I spend most of my time on this project. Additionally, I\u2019m working closely with IATH Fellows Luke Dahl in the McIntire Department of Music, Mona Kasra in Drama, and Edith Klaus in Slavic Languages and Literatures Department \u2013 all of whom work on projects utilizing IATH\u2019s capabilities. \nHeiman: Does your DH background \u2013 or do the humanities, period - prepare you in some way to be IATH\u2019s Project Designer/Manager?\nKlosko: My background as a historian allows me to recognize how technology can help present information in new ways. I plan to pursue research on behalf of IATH hopefully writing journal articles about digital humanities topics. There\u2019s also the possibility of incorporating what I learn on the job into my personal research. For now, my main focus is getting up to speed on all of IATH\u2019s projects. I think a web or social media presence could be good.\nHeiman: What are your thoughts on digital preservation and the life cycle of DH projects? \nKlosko: One thing that has come up is that we have 20-30 years of DH projects at UVA and a question everyone will have to face is how do you make sure this stuff doesn\u2019t just vanish or disappear? How do you make sure these projects are still relevant? It\u2019s a challenge that every DH practitioner must face but to my knowledge, it hasn\u2019t deterred faculty from continuing to pursue digital projects.\nHeiman: In a soundbite, how do you think DH approaches add value to humanistic inquiry writ large?\nKlosko: I love the way DH allows you to aggregate information and draw these huge connections between seemingly unconnected events, words, or ideas. The IATH fellows we have this year are working on spatial representation of cultural heritage and it demonstrates the ability to use digital humanities to represent information in a novel format. \nHeiman: Tell me more about your work with the Scottish Court of Session project. \nKlosko: The Scottish Court of Session was a strongly historical research project looking at the development of Scottish law, society, and people and I was fascinated by the context of judges and advocates who were writing in the context of the Scottish enlightenment. The DH component of the project allowed me to see linkages between Scottish enlightenment philosophers and judges and advocates in the Scottish legal system.\nHeiman: It\u2019s been a pleasure to learn so much about your background and the important work ahead of you at IATH. Thank you for your time.\nKlosko: Thank you.\n", "Image": { "src": "https://dh-dev.library.virginia.edu/sites/digitalhumanities.virginia.edu/files/susanna%20klosko%20with%20Rennies%20edits%20%283%29.jpg", "alt": "Woman seated on a bench with a library and tree in the background" }, "Subtitle": "By Logan Heiman" } }, { "node": { "title": "DH 201/COMP LIT 290 Introduction to Digital Humanities: Humanistic Knowledge, Disciplines, and Institutions in the 21st Century", "Body": "The purpose of this graduate seminar is to introduce students to the key concepts, methods, theories, and emerging practices in the \"Digital Humanities.\" The seminar will provide a historical overview of the field from its beginnings in the post-World War II era to the present, highlighting the major intellectual problems, disciplinary paradigms, and institutional challenges that are posed by Digital Humanities.

But what might we gain if we begin to use the computer to do something that only it can do? How would it change our understanding of a novel if we laid it out in geographical space? What would it mean to look at every frame of a film at once? What could we discover if we read everything a prolific author wrote, in just two weeks? And what would we learn if we turned the tables and decided to look at digital objects the same way we typically look at novels or films?

Their DH work reflects Jefferson\u2019s conviction that astronomy should be a vital part of UVA\u2019s founding curriculum. He foresaw the Rotunda utilized, in part, as a planetarium with a sky blue interior adorned with gilded stars in the form of constellations. In his notes on the Rotunda's interior design, Jefferson writes, \u201cThe concave ceiling of the Rotunda is proposed to be painted sky-blue and spangled with gilt stars in their position and magnitude copied exactly.\u201d \nA scholarly symposium to take place November 1, 2019 from 2-8 pm will usher in the Rotunda Planetarium.\nThereafter, UVA students, faculty, staff, and will be able to view the night sky\u00a0through an array of carefully calibrated digital projections in the Rotunda Dome Room. The Rotunda Planetarium \u00a0projections will be available to UVA affiliates for viewing on a nightly basis beginning at sunset from November 1, 2019, onward.\u00a0Lemley notes that he and his collaborators plan to make the projections available for viewing by the general public\u00a0twice monthly with further details about dates and times\u00a0to come.\nRotunda Planetarium\u00a0revives the conception of the University library as an instrument and location\u00a0of interdisciplinary learning and discovery for the entire University community, according to Lemley. Jefferson had grand and largely impractical plans for what the Rotunda could be. Those plans ultimately gave way to\u00a0the whims of the University\u2019s first faculty who had the final say regarding the purpose and usages of\u00a0the iconic UVA structure. But thanks to the Planetarium and its allied project Rotunda Library Online, Jefferson's outlines and sketches, part of a trove of documents written by him over the course of decades,\u00a0will see new light.\u00a0\nAlso led by Neal Curtis, Samuel Lemley, and Madeline Zehnder, the Rotunda Library Online got off the ground thanks to funding from a Kenan grant. As of July 7, RLO (pronounced ar-low) comprised 2,996 short-title entries including 1,130 Rotunda Library titles that survive in UVA Special Collections.\nCurtis and Zehnder presented the fruits of their labor at the Society for the History of Authorship, Reading, and Publishing (SHARP) Conference in Amherst, Massachusetts, which ran from July 15-19. The Rotunda Planetarium masterminds\u00a0also hope to produce a book based on the archive they have compiled through Rotunda Library Online.\nAccording to Lemley, he and the Rotunda Planetarium co-founders performed much of if not all of the technical work that went into assembling the images that will ornament the Dome Room ceiling this fall. The first question confronting them at the outset of the project:\u00a0\u201cHow do we take a 360\u00b0 image, split it between five different projectors, and reassemble those pieces coherently onto the interior surface of a dome?\u201d Undaunted, the Rotunda Planetarium trio plunged ahead. For RLO, Lemley learned the scripting\u00a0language PHP and SQL, which allows for the manipulation and management of databases. Lemley says four months elapsed between the start of their image preparation and the successful final test of the projectors in June 2019. \nIn the midst of the University's bicentennial, Rotunda Planetarium represents a timely manifestation of Jefferson's architectural and curricular vision for the Rotunda and for the University of Virginia. Relatedly, Rotunda Planetarium made its star turn\u00a0in the University\u2019s official communications. In anticipation of the October 11-12 public unveiling\u00a0of the\u00a0University's upcoming capital campaign, \"Honor the Future: the Campaign for the University of Virginia,\" University Communications released a stirring promotional video\u00a0on September 27. The clip features\u00a0Lemley at the 0:26 mark gazing up at constellations projected onto the interior of the Rotunda Dome Room.\u00a0\nThe introduction of the Planetarium project\u00a0also presents an opportunity for the University community and the public to ponder the limits and failures of Jefferson's moral imagination as it relates to enslaved people.\u00a0\nIn a blog post on the Rotunda Planetarium website entitled \u201cThe First Test,\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Madeline Zehnder writes that she and her collaborators intend to wrestle with \u201cthe Rotunda\u2019s legacy as a space in which these opportunities to learn so often depended on the exclusion and labor of others, including the enslaved people who constructed the Rotunda.\u201d Additionally, Ms. Zehnder is working on a project on Thomas Jefferson\u2019s correspondence with famed African-American farmer and astronomer Benjamin Banneker. Lemley hopes the Rotunda Planetarium projectors can also be used in conjunction with the opening of the Memorial to Enslaved Laborers scheduled for April 2020.\nEditors' Note:\u00a0October 3, 2019\nAn earlier version of this article incorrectly\u00a0indicated that the Rotunda Planetarium projections would\u00a0be available twice monthly to UVA affiliates and the general public.\u00a0The projections will be available to UVA affiliates for viewing on a nightly basis beginning at Sunset from November 1, 2019, onward. The general public will be able to view the projections twice monthly with dates and times to be determined.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n", "Image": { "src": "https://dh-dev.library.virginia.edu/sites/digitalhumanities.virginia.edu/files/RotundaPlanetarium.PNG", "alt": "" }, "Subtitle": "By Logan Heiman" } }, { "node": { "title": "HMI Lunch: Beyond Importance: Exploration as an Attention Norm", "Body": "We regularly evaluate how people direct their attention.

Yet it is unclear what attention norms underlie those evaluations. We might start with an Importance Norm: one should attend to what is practically, epistemically, or morally important. Yet the Importance Norm cannot explain what has gone wrong during\u00a0attentional impasses, where one is unaware of important information in one\u2019s practical, epistemic, or moral situation. Depending on how we make the Importance Norm precise, we either a) cannot explain why attentional impasses are bad or b) provide a norm that humans cannot follow. I argue that we should overcome attentional impasses by following the\u00a0Explore\u2013Exploit Norm: over time, one should balance between exploration and exploitation when allocating one\u2019s attention.

Defining \u201cart\u201d broadly to include film, literature, music, visual culture and performance, the UVA Symposium on Art and Confrontation in the Americas / Las Am\u00e9ricas provides a forum for discussing the intersections between art, civic life and activism throughout the hemisphere.\nKeynote speakers Juan Manuel Echavarr\u00eda, Fernando Grisalez and Gabriel Ossa will open the symposium on Sunday, September 29 at 7:00pm with a discussion of their artistic work and activism in Colombia. Echavarr\u00eda, an artist committed to confronting the difficult realities of a country that has experienced decades of civil war, uses visual art to recover memory and make visible experiences that have been rendered invisible by the normalization of violence. Politically, Echavarr\u00eda\u2019s art intervenes in the contradictory space between official peace narratives and the violent realities that still affect many parts of Colombia, seeking ultimately to reconstruct a social body dismembered by war. Through his non-profit foundation Fundaci\u00f3n Puntos de Encuentro, Echavarr\u00eda also produces collective projects in which he steps aside as an individual creative agent to let others tell their stories and shape how the Colombian conflict is perceived in broader society.\nThe keynote remarks will be followed by two days of symposium presentations.

Digital humanities scholarship continues to be driven by work at the intersections of a range of distinct disciplines and an ethical commitment to preserve and broaden access to cultural materials. In celebration of the 10th anniversary of MSU's Cultural Heritage Informatics Program, we particularly encourage proposals along that theme, but as always we strive to showcase DH work in all its forms.\nAlongside the expansion of digital humanities in under-resourced and underrepresented areas, a number of complex issues surface, including, among others, questions of ownership, cultural theft, virtual exploitation, digital rights, endangered data, and the digital divide. DH communities have raised and responded to these issues, pushing the field forward. This symposium is an opportunity to broaden the conversation about these issues. Scholarship that works across borders with foci on transnational partnerships and globally accessible data is especially welcome. Additionally, we define the term 'humanities' rather broadly to incorporate the discussion of issues that encourage interdisciplinary understanding of the humanities.\nFocused on these issues of social justice, we invite work at the intersections of critical DH; race and ethnicity; feminism, intersectionality, and gender; and anti-colonial and postcolonial frameworks to participate.\nThis symposium, which will include a mixture of presentation types, welcomes 300-word proposals related to any of these issues, and particularly on the following themes and topics by Friday, November 1, midnight in your timezone:\n\n\u00a0 *\u00a0 \u00a0Critical cultural studies and analytics\n\u00a0 *\u00a0 \u00a0Cultural heritage in a range of contexts, particularly non-Western\n\u00a0 *\u00a0 \u00a0DH as socially engaged humanities and/or as a social movement\n\u00a0 *\u00a0 \u00a0Open data, open access, and data preservation as resistance, especially in\na postcolonial context\n\u00a0 *\u00a0 \u00a0How identity categories, and their intersections, shape digital humanities\nwork\n\u00a0 *\u00a0 \u00a0Global research dialogues and collaborations within the digital humanities\ncommunity\n\u00a0 *\u00a0 \u00a0Indigeneity - anywhere in the world - and the digital\n\u00a0 *\u00a0 \u00a0Digital humanities, postcolonialism, and neocolonialism\n\u00a0 *\u00a0 \u00a0Global digital pedagogies\n\u00a0 *\u00a0 \u00a0Borders, migration, and/or diaspora and their connection to the digital\n\u00a0 *\u00a0 \u00a0Digital and global languages and literatures\n\u00a0 *\u00a0 \u00a0Digital humanities, the environment, and climate change\n\u00a0 *\u00a0 \u00a0Innovative and emergent technologies across institutions, languages, and\neconomies\n\u00a0 *\u00a0 \u00a0Scholarly communication and knowledge production in a global context\n\u00a0 *\u00a0 \u00a0Surveillance and/or data privacy issues in a global context\n\u00a0 *\u00a0 \u00a0Productive failure\n\u00a0Presentation Formats:\n\u00a0 *\u00a0 \u00a05-minute lightning talk\n\u00a0 *\u00a0 \u00a015-minute presentation\n\u00a0 *\u00a0 \u00a090-minute workshop\n\u00a0 *\u00a0 \u00a090-minute panel\n\u00a0 *\u00a0 \u00a0Poster presentation\n\u00a0 *\u00a0 \u00a0There will be a limited number of slots available for 15-minute virtual\npresentations\nPlease note that we conduct a double-blind review process, so please refrain from identifying your institution or identity in your proposal.\nSubmit a proposal here:\nhttp://www.msuglobaldh.org/submit-a-proposal/\nNotifications of acceptance will be given by December 9, 2019\n", "Date": "Friday, November 1, 2019 - 12:00am", "Location": "Online", "Certificate Event": "no", "Event Type": "Call for Papers" } }, { "node": { "title": "Monuments Working Group Combats White Supremacy with DH Tools", "Body": "Justin Greenlee\u00a0deploys the critical lens of an art historian and the technologies of a digital humanist in response\u00a0to an upsurge in white supremacist groups appearing at Confederate sites in Virginia. \u201cI wanted to use digital tools to increase local knowledge about monuments, memorials, and public art in Charlottesville and Richmond,\u201d says Greenlee, a doctoral student in the McIntire Department of Art. The Monuments Working Group aims to spur reflection on how Confederate monuments valorize racist histories in Richmond and Charlottesville, Virginia while obscuring the contributions of enslaved people to the development of those communities, the colony and state of Virginia, and the nation.\nAlready, the Monuments Working Group has spun out a number of projects available online including:\n\nA Zotero repository of primary and secondary sources related to public art, monuments, and memorials at UVA, UNC, and in the cities of Charlottesville and Richmond\nAdobe Spark and Medium presentations on Thomas Preston and his history as a slave-owner along with a presentation on a court decision concerning a Confederate monument in Alabama\nArchived Twitter threads intended to inform ongoing debates about the renaming of Charlottesville\u2019s Preston Avenue and a recent decision handed down by Judge Michael Graffeo in Jefferson County, AL related to a wooden screen that was put around the Soldiers and Sailors Monument in Montgomery\n\nA future DH project will provide a repository of digitized images on JStor Forum supporting scholars at UVA interested in teaching and researching the history of race and place. Greenlee further notes that he maintained a Flickr photostream journal containing images that \u201cpertain to ongoing historical research, collaborations with community groups, and excursions to relevant sites.\u201d \n\u201cThe photostream currently includes about 1,200 images and it\u2019s my hope that the archive can be made available to students and scholars at UVA with similar interests,\u201d he continued.\nThe Monuments Working Group\u2019s mission aligns with events and actions that led to the toppling of the Silent Sam statue on the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill campus on the night of August 20. 2018. Citing protesters\u2019 chants of \u201cNext up, Charlottesville\u201d after the fall of Silent Sam, Greenlee alluded\u00a0to institutional similarities between traditional rivals UVA, UNC, and Duke that attract the attention of white supremacists. Taking care not to make direct comparisons between UNC\u2019s Silent Sam statue and the Monument to the Confederate Dead at UVA, Greenlee makes the case\u00a0that these elite, Southern universities are obligated to examine the monuments on their campuses against the backdrop of institutional ties to the Confederacy, slavery, racism, and discrimination against marginalized communities. \nAt UVA, Greenlee focuses his activism on the Monument to the Confederate Dead located in the University\u2019s Confederate Cemetery. Unlike Silent Sam, which occupies a position of high visibility at UNC, UVA\u2019s Confederate Cemetery lies off Alderman Road and McCormick Road, virtually out of sight of the majority of foot traffic on Grounds. Despite the cemetery\u2019s inconspicuous location\u00a0at UVA, Greenlee contends that the Monument to the Confederate Dead merits attention from everyone in the University community. In Greenlee\u2019s telling of the monument\u2019s history stretching back to 1893, the statue symbolizes the university\u2019s past glorification of Confederate soldiers and \u201cLost Cause\u201d ideology.\nGreenlee\u2019s activism with the Monuments Working Group and efforts to educate the public parallel UVA\u2019s exploration of its relationship to slavery and segregation dating back to 2013 when UVA President Teresa Sullivan unveiled the President\u2019s Commission on Slavery at the University. That initiative was followed by the President\u2019s Commission on UVa in the Age of Segregation launched in February 2018. After the events of August 11-12, 2017, Greenlee took to Twitter to discuss commemorative justice, public art, and other topics arising out of the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville. Of the Monuments Working Group\u2019s mission, Greenlee notes, \u201cIt was always the goal [\u2026] not to create something new but to support the work of UVA being at the forefront of studying slavery and the history of racism in America, and a lot more could be done to that effect.\u201d\nHe cites a number of scholars and activists as inspiration for the work of Monuments Working Group including Religious Studies Professor Jalane Schmidt, Ana Edwards, Phil Wilayto, Joseph Rogers, Marc Cheatham, and Charlottesville-based anti-racist activist Matthew Christensen. Greenlee says the Monuments Working Group will support their efforts with research, financial contributions, and \"showing up\" wherever activism against white supremacists might happen.\nBeyond Grounds, Greenlee is involved with a Richmond-based project to re-tell the history of the Shockoe Bottom neighborhood and to construct a memorial to enslaved people traded at auction on the site in the antebellum period. In collaboration with the Sacred Ground Historical Reclamation Project, the Monuments Working Group is providing support for a conference planned for this fall that, according to their website, will focus on \u201ctruth, conciliation, and examining 400 years of Africans and African Americans in the colony and state of Virginia.\u201d\nMonuments Working Group and the Sacred Ground Historical Reclamation Project will turn to state politics to alter Virginia\u2019s commemorative landscape. One obstacle to effecting change lies in the fact that decision-making authority over Virginia monuments rests at the level of the state legislature. Greenlee says \u201cthe work remains unfinished\u201d after a failed effort in the General Assembly to pass a local authority measure in January 2019. Greenlee and his collaborators will be working throughout the fall lobbying the Albemarle County Board of Supervisors for support. In the meantime, the group will devote its energy toward the Shockoe Bottom conference planned for November. \nMonuments Working Group is a division of the Public Humanities Lab in the Institute for Humanities & Global Culture at the University of Virginia.\n", "Image": { "src": "https://dh-dev.library.virginia.edu/sites/digitalhumanities.virginia.edu/files/48200754936_66257d4795_o_0.jpg", "alt": "" }, "Subtitle": "By Logan Heiman" } }, { "node": { "title": "Prof. S.

The Leadership Alliance Mellon Initiative (otherwise known as LAMI) is a national effort aimed at boosting the ranks of demographically underrepresented groups in graduate programs, particularly in the humanities, social sciences, and education. Selected students receive guidance and mentorship from UVA faculty, graduate students, and staff as they gain exposure to research methods and digital tools, a curricular emphasis unique to UVA.\u00a0\nOf the eight American universities that host a LAMI program, UVA stands apart for its efforts to train participants in digital research methods. Scholars' Lab has played a central role in supporting and training the five LAMI cohorts that have thus far come to Grounds. University of Virginia English professor and Scholars' Lab Academic Director Alison Booth has mentored LAMI fellows since 2015.\u00a0\u201cThis summer\u2019s group gave such enthusiastic commitment to their own projects and to each other\u2019s that everyone who mentored, taught, or collaborated with them felt inspired and hopeful. With smart people like these devoting their thoughts and talents to social science and humanities questions, we all face a brighter future,\" Booth said.\u00a0\nKeisha John, who now serves as\u00a0Associate Dean for Diversity and Inclusion\u00a0in the College and Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, spearheaded the effort to bring LAMI to UVA in the summer of 2015 when she began her tenure as\u00a0Director of Diversity Programs for UVA\u2019s Office of Graduate and Postdoctoral Affairs. Jasmine Crenshaw succeeded Dr. John in April 2019. With Ms. Crenshaw, Katrina Richardson, UVA\u2019s Program Coordinator for Diversity Programs, oversees the LAMI program. The group of undergraduates worked on projects across the humanities and social sciences.\nAleyshka Estevez, an English major at the University of Puerto Rico, examined location-based narratives in her research. \"It was actually one of the weekly workshops from the Scholar's Lab that gave me the tools to create our initial timeline for the Anne Spencer project,\" Estevez said, noting a project she worked on with Professor Booth.\nLewis Rincon Castano of the University of Central Florida looked at the evolution of civics education in modern Argentina. He says that learning how to deploy text analysis and visualization tools coupled with immersion in UVA's research environment \"let me discover how to improve my storytelling beyond plain text and a picture.\"\nParis Godfrey, a rising junior at Spelman College, researched the white savior trope in film, comparing rates of consumption and frequency of the trope's appearance in films released between the end of the Obama administration and the beginning of the Trump administration. \"I am very interested in how digital humanities tools can work to bridge the gap between academia and the larger community.\"\nZenab Youssef, an International Relations and Middle Eastern Studies major at Brown University, focused her research on tensions between queer identity and Muslim diasporic beliefs.\u00a0\nNathan Carbajal explored theories of cultural assimilation in the context of neoliberal ideology in the United States. He sought to uncover the ways in which racism and white supremacy interact with the identity-forming experiences and views of American Hispanic and LatinX communities.\nPrior to presenting their research in Alderman Library's Makerspace on their last day in the LAMI program, the group had an opportunity to reflect on issues of diversity and inclusion in graduate education. The students met informally with Rennie Mapp, Administrative Director of the DH Graduate Certificate, and Logan Heiman, Communications Specialist for DH@UVA, to discuss digital humanities research, sensitivities related to researching marginalized communities, and other related topics. \nYoussef expressed gratitude for finding community in her LAMI cohort and for the chance to think about the viewpoints she and her group might bring to the academy.\u00a0 \"As a low-income student Muslim and a first-generation daughter of immigrants, even the prospect of grad school has been new and foreign to me,\" she said.\u00a0\"I also greatly appreciated conversations with my LAMI cohort about the transformations we hope to see in academia as underrepresented people of color from communities we deeply care for.\"\nBrandon Walsh, Head of Student Programs at Scholars\u2019 Lab, worked closely with this year\u2019s LAMI cohort, collaborating with a team of librarians and technical specialists to shepherd\u00a0the students\u00a0through their 8-week research program. \u201cWorking with the LAMI students is a highlight for the Scholars\u2019 Lab every year,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re consistently blown away by the caliber of their work.

The digital spaces created by AR thus assume an openness and mobility that is lacking in physical space,1\u00a0which may be controlled or limited by socio-economic and political reasons. Nonetheless, these spatial boundaries can seemingly be circumvented in digital spaces, and users can move rapidly across zones that they would be unable to otherwise.\u00a0UVA Revealis thus designed to explore how real spaces can be experienced through changing, mobile technologies that enable spatial and temporal augmentation.

At that time, Rome had reached the peak of its population, and major Christian churches were just beginning to be built. After this date, the capital of the empire left Rome for Constantinople and so few new civic buildings were built.

The notional date of the model is June 21, 400 A.D.\nThe purpose of the modeling project was to spatialize information and theories about how the Forum looked at this moment in time, which was more or less the height of its development as Rome's civic and cultural center. The digital model includes over twenty features (buildings and major monuments) filling up the western zone of the Roman Forum from the Temple of Vesta and Temple of Antoninus and Faustina on the east to the Tabularium facing the western slope of the Capitoline Hill.\nThanks to archaeological campaigns that started in the early nineteenth century and which continue to the present day, these features can be seen in Rome today and constitute one of the city's most important archaeological sites. Their state of preservation varies from fair to poor; and the ruins seen today represent a mixture of different phases in the life of the Forum. As a result, understanding the Forum is a challenging task not only for tourists but also for scholars. Almost as soon as the new excavations started bringing the ancient remains to light, archaeologists such as Canina, Huelsen, Gatteschi, and Gismondi started to create graphic and physical reconstructions of how the Forum might have looked at specific moments in time. The CVRLab digital model, created with the help of an international Scientific Advisory Committee, is the latest example of this perennial project.\nFrom the time the modeling project was conceived, the investigators intended to present their results to students, scholars and the general public. The digital model of the Forum can be viewed on various hardware and software platforms. These range from simple static views that can be displayed on a computer monitor to dedicated visualization theaters costs hundreds of thousands of dollars or more.\nWith generous support from the National Science Foundation, the CVRLab was able to create this Web site about the digital Forum model from 2002 to 2005. The purposes of this site are: (1) to use the Internet to permit free use and easy viewing of the digital model by people all over the world; (2) to provide documentation for the archaeological evidence and theories utilized to create the model; and (3) to offer basic information about the individual features comprising the digital model so that their history and cultural context can be readily understood.\n", "Content Type": "Projects", "Display Name": "DRF", "Featured Image": { "src": "https://dh-dev.library.virginia.edu/system/files/RomanForum.PNG", "alt": "" }, "Project URL": "Digital Roman Forum", "Technical Approach": "virtual reality" } }, { "node": { "title": "The Samantabhadra Project", "Body": "From the website:\nThe\u00a0Collected Tantras of the Ancients\u00a0(rnying ma rgyud \u2019bum) is a canon of esoteric scriptures revered by the Nyingma (rnying ma) or \u201cAncient\u201d school of Tibetan Buddhism. The collection is unique in three important respects. First, its Tibetan translations are the only extant version of many Indian Buddhist texts otherwise unavailable. Second, the canon reflects a syncretic assimilation of literary influences from Buddhist traditions across India, China and Central Asia. Finally, The Collected Tantras represent an important body of indigenous Tibetan works that reflect original Buddhist literary traditions, including the Great Perfection (rdzogs chen), arguably the last great philosophical development of South and Central Asian Buddhism. There is recent consensus among a small but growing corps of modern scholars that this corpus contains materials vital for understanding Tibetan Buddhism from the eighth to fourteenth centuries and for reconstructing Buddhism's history in India and Central Asia between the eighth and tenth centuries. This latter period is one for which our knowledge from other sources is particularly fragmentary.

Although the first step in this process is digitization, the ECDA is more than a digitization or cataloging initiative. Rather, we aim to enable users\u2014both scholars of the Caribbean as well as students\u2014to understand the colonial nature of the archive and to use the digital archive as a site of revision and remix for exploring ways to decolonize the archive.\n\u00a0\nProject History\nThe inspiration for the project came during a symposium of the Early Caribbean Society in fall 2011. One of the important issues that came out of this international meeting of scholars from a variety of disciplines working on Early Caribbean studies, were problems of accessibility to the texts of this era. Documentary materials, particularly about the colonial Caribbean, are often located in archives and collections in various former colonial metropoles in Great Britain, France, Germany, Denmark, Spain, and the Netherlands. Neo-colonial consolidation has transmitted other archives and collections to the United States. In addition, although many of the contemporary archives in Caribbean countries are accessible, some are not, and other documents remain in private hands scattered across the globe. With these difficulties at the forefront of our minds, Nicole Aljoe and Elizabeth Maddock Dillon wrote and received an interdisciplinary program development seed grant from Northeastern University to create a digital archive of early colonial Caribbean texts. Working initially with scholars from a number of departments across campus as well as graduate students, we envision the archive as an open-access, interdisciplinary project that brings together scholars of literature, history, library science, network science, digital humanities, and public humanities. By making these texts more readily accessible, it is our hope that more scholars will engage with these texts and contribute further to the international scholarly project of understanding colonial Caribbean cultures and literary histories.\nThe ECDA\u2019s archive currently holds 57 early Caribbean texts, including novels, travel narratives, natural histories, colonial documentation, obeah narratives, and slave narratives. 30 of these archival items are prefaced with scholarly introductions, which provide an overview of the production and reception history of the text as well as the text's significance in current scholarship.\n", "Content Type": "Projects", "Display Name": "ecda", "Featured Image": { "src": "https://dh-dev.library.virginia.edu/system/files/ecdalogos-3.png", "alt": "Early Caribbean Digital Archive: ECDA" }, "Funding Organization": "American Council of Learned Societies (ACLS)", "Project URL": "Early Caribbean Digital Archive at Northeastern University", "Sponsoring Organization(s)": "Northeastern University" } }, { "node": { "title": "Opportunities", "Content Type": "Resources" } }, { "node": { "title": "GSAS Orientation Panels & Resource Fair", "Date": "Wednesday, August 21, 2019 - 12:00pm to 5:00pm", "Location": "Newcomb Hall", "Sponsoring Organization(s)": "Office of the Dean of the School of Arts and Sciences", "Certificate Event": "no", "Event Type": "Panel" } }, { "node": { "title": "DH Mixer", "Body": "Our next DH Mixer will be held on Thursday, October 10 from 5-7 in Brooks Hall (RSVP here, please).

This course gives you a chance to explore these new methods. We begin with a focus on the basic theoretical and technological issues involved in creating and analyzing digital texts, before moving on to a series of hands-on exercises in analyzing words and interrogating the results. By the end of the semester, students will understand the history, theory, and technology of digital textual analysis and produce a 15-page paper applying these new methods to material relevant to their own interests or analyzing examples of digital-based criticism. The field of DH values collaborative work far more than most other forms of scholarship in the humanities. This is because every DH project involves a collection of many discrete skills, far more than any one person can generally master. In this course, students will be encouraged to work collaboratively where possible. Part of the course will be devoted to discussing the nature of collaborative work and how it differs from \u201cgroup work,\u201d so that students learn how to work together in productive and positive relationships.

But the practice of establishing \u2013 what some might call superficial \u2013 friendships through written correspondence has a long history that extends beyond the surviving material record. Yet, we do have an abundance of evidence about the history of \u201cfriending\u201d preserved in manuscript archives throughout the world, which maintain collections of earlier modes of epistolary exchange, or what we now call \u201csocial networking.\u201d While such letter writing stretches back into antiquity, the form and function of such correspondence experienced a revolution in twelfth- and thirteenth-century Italy, when medieval teachers began instructing their students in the rhetorical forms of written persuasion called the artes dictaminis. These treatises, the first of their kind in the western world, survive in manuscripts and early printed books that not only explain the art of establishing social networks through letter writing, but also include marginal glosses written by later readers, which indicate how the practice was evolving over time. Additionally, these manuals were often accompanied by the works of the ancient Roman rhetorician Marcus Tullius Cicero, whose theories about speaking were adapted for written communication throughout the Middle Ages and well into the Renaissance. In particular, the prevalence of his treatise On Friendship indicates that establishing friendships and letter writing were increasingly considered to be complementary activities. The archival record 2 demonstrates that letter writers were actively \u201cfriending\u201d each other to establish social networks beyond the scriptorium. This course will examine the literary, cultural, and material life of written correspondence from the poetic epistle to the snarky tweet. And while we will be reading and analyzing epistolary literature (both fiction and nonfiction) such as Ovid\u2019s Heroides, Bram Stoker\u2019s Dracula, and Alice Walker\u2019s A Color Purple, we will focus our efforts on \u201creal\u201d letters of writers that are held in the Rare Books Room of the Boston Public Library.

As we examine this life of letters, we will consider the rhetorical principles that shape authors and audience over time, as well as their implications for our understanding of the past, present, and future of epistolary friendship.

Increasingly, however, we see signs of what a 2011 volume of Continental philosophy named the speculative turn\u2014or better, perhaps, acknowledging the Latin root speculat- (\u201cto observe from a vantage point\u201d), a speculative situation. Yet that situation is not one of philosophy only. \u201cSpeculation\u201d is widely (if nebulously) understood as the root cause of the turmoil in the global financial markets of 2008. The speculative equally calls into view the data-driven forecasting whose scenarios of what-might-be have come to inform our daily experience of everything from the outcomes of elections to tomorrow\u2019s weather. In literature, meanwhile, speculative fiction has emerged to name an increasingly prominent mode of writing that encompasses aspects of science fiction, environmentalism, and political and social critique. \u00a0\nTo constitute or construe this speculative situation for ourselves we will initially read deeply into the new speculative realist philosophy and accompanying\u2014sometimes antagonizing\u2014discourses such as the New Materialism, vitalism, feminist science studies, and object-oriented ontology. This reading will take up roughly the first half of the course. We will then look at a sampling of speculative fiction, including Octavia Butler\u2019s The Parable of the Sower and Kim Stanley Robinson\u2019s New York 2140, as well as selections from popular non-fiction works like Alan Weisman\u2019s The World Without Us and Nate Silver\u2019s The Signal and the Noise.

Carpenter, Katherine Hayles, Nick Srnicek, Benjamin Bratton, and the anonymous collective known as Uncertain Commons, among others, as well as Kant, Heidegger, and Deleuze and Guattari.\nThroughout we will seek to foster awareness of the non-inevitability of the historical turn in literary and cultural studies, while also asking what is at stake in the current project of the speculative. History, nature, systems (and networks), and worlding will all be constant themes, as will what possibilities remain for acting, or simply living.

What methods are most appropriate for grappling with the enormous, and enormously messy, world of digitized literary texts and data about literature? This course pursues two aims in parallel: to engage with the history and current practice of literary data analysis, and to introduce the foundational skills of literary data analysis in the R programming language.

Using five main themes \u2013 canon, transnationality, transactionality, fragmentariness and fandom as the framework for our exploration we will read, analyze, and discuss five seminal works of the Spanish early modern period, from which we will tease out an interdisciplinary understanding of the cultural and aesthetic forces that shaped their critical interpretation and their international fame. In turn our approach will offer insights into the shaping of our own cultural and personal attitudes towards the role of literature and the arts in our lives. By focusing our attention on the challenged and changing meanings of literary fiction, this course aims to strengthen your skills of critical analysis. The course is organized in modules. Each module is composed of the same four blocks, respectively addressing a different dimension of the study of literature.\n\u2022 Block 1 is a historical introduction to the work we are studying.\n\u2022 Block 2 is an in-class close reading and textual analysis of selected excerpts from the work.\n\u2022 Block 3 presents a critical essay by an expert in the field and asks the students to discuss it.\n\u2022 Block 4 integrates the previous three by offering a panoptic view of the cultural influence that the work has had from the time of composition to today.\nWithin a module, each block exposes students to a different style of teaching and a different approach to studying humanities topics in general and Spanish literature in particular.\n\u2022 Block 1 requires students to listen to a general introduction, usually -but not always!- via a PowerPoint. Information provided in block 1 can be found in any textbook or in Wikipedia.\n\u2022 Block 2, the close reading, confronts students with understanding and interpreting excerpts of the original work. Preparatory reading of the assigned text is compulsory. All technology is forbidden in class.\n\u2022 Block 3 works like a graduate seminar. Students will have read a critical essay in advance and will come to class prepared to discuss the critic\u2019s interpretation. No technology.\n\u2022 Block 4 opens our works to their context, and it heavily relies on internet search and the ability to integrate disparate information.\nThe course leverages on the deep-learning principles promoted by inquiry-based, project-based and experiential education. Every Friday our lesson will be conducted as a \u201cmaking Lab\u201d where we will use digital tools to design and build learning resources on Spanish literature and culture. In addition, the lab will serve as a primer to introduce students to the the process of devising and carrying to completion a digital project. Class flow and materials have been carefully chosen to fit your level of understanding. Thus, students are expected to come prepared for class according to the block\u2019s required format. In my role as instructor, I will provide you with background information to the readings, make connections, clarify difficult concepts and ideas. I will not summarize the texts, since this is part of your job. However, if you do feel that you have trouble understanding any section, let me know and we will work through it together. A large percentage of the final grade is based on in class participation. In addition, we will have five \u2018module preparation responses\u2019 (MPR) during the course of the semester that will allow me to follow each student\u2019s individual progress. The third portion of your grade depends on your performance as part of a collaborative team and on the completion of your final individual portfolio.\u00a0\n", "Conceptual Difficulty": "1", "Course Number": "SPAN 371", "Department": "Spanish", "discipline": "Spanish", "MAO Materials": "Textual", "Semester": "Fall", "Syllabus Link": "Survey of Medieval and Renaissance Spanish Literature", "Taught By": "Lucia Binotti", "Technical Difficulty": "1", "university": "University of North Carolina Chapel Hill", "UVa Course": "no", "Year": "2016" } }, { "node": { "title": "SPAN 260 Introduction to Spanish Literature", "Body": "Course Summary:\u00a0General Expectations Like all other Spanish courses, Span 260 is a lot of work!

You will be reading literary texts, in their original language and form, and some of these might be challenging. Therefore, you are expected to work on the material on a daily basis and to schedule yourself so that you have time to read the complete text, assimilate the material and participate in class. However, it is worth the work because it will help you solidify the background you built in previous Spanish courses and it will prepare you for future Spanish courses. Span 260 will be very helpful when you take more advanced literature and culture courses at UNC. In addition, please read carefully: 1. This will be a course with a Project Based Learning Component (PBL). What that means in practice is that throughout the semester part of our work will be conducted collaboratively towards the creation of an end of semester project. 2. A good percentage of the course-work, inside and outside of class will entail peer review and assessment. For each one of our modules there will be a session in which you will edit and correct your work collaboratively. 3. This course takes a Design Thinking/Digital approach to learning. For each one of our modules there will be a Lab session where we will learn to \"think\" digitally and to \"design\" with an end user in mind.

Nowhere is this questioning more acute, sophisticated, and nuanced than in the burgeoning field of the book arts, an umbrella term encompassing artists\u2019 books, book sculpture, zines, and print-oriented forms of electronic poetry. This is an inherently collaborative and interdisciplinary field. Its practitioners skirt the thresholds between visual art and literature, technology and philosophy, producing uniquely bookish artifacts that defy easy categorization. These are artworks made not for the white walls of a gallery, but to be read and used; they are works of literature that engage the visual, tactile, and even olfactory senses. Difficult to reproduce in print editions or literary anthologies, they challenge our expectations of the codex as a platform for delivering and consuming textual information. Despite the diversity of the book arts, what brings these practices together is a shared interest in the potential of the book to model radical new forms of creativity, subjectivity, and political engagement. \u201cif i can sing through my mouth with a book,\u201d writes El Lissitzky in a treatise on book design, \u201di can show myself in various guises.\u201d Working directly with the Sloane Art Library\u2019s extensive collection of artists\u2019 books, this course will trace the book arts from their emergence as a semi-coherent set of avantgarde practices at the beginning of the twentieth century to their resurgence today with digital technologies. Because the book arts have not developed along a straightforward chronology, our route through time will not be linear. Rather, we will proceed by navigating the various social, political, and formal vectors that book artists have explored. Understanding how each artist situates her/himself along these vectors, and 2 what that placement can teach us about her/his aesthetic affiliations, will be the task of this course. When relevant, we will also be reading short stories, poems, and novels that address similar themes. By the end of the course, these vectors will together form a map detailing where the book has been, what it means to literary culture today, and the directions it is headed in the near future.\n", "Conceptual Difficulty": "2", "Course Number": "ENGL 311H", "Department": "English", "discipline": "English", "MAO Materials": "Textual", "Semester": "Fall", "Syllabus Link": "The Art of the Book in the Digital Age", "Taught By": "Whitney Trietten", "Technical Difficulty": "3", "university": "University of North Carolina Chapel Hill", "UVa Course": "no", "Year": "2016" } }, { "node": { "title": "ENGL 709 Technologies of Literary Production", "Body": "This course has two complementary goals.

The second goal is to examine how digital media are transforming scholarly publishing and communication by reflecting upon our own writing practices and their attendant technologies.

Today both his poetry and visual art in several media are admired by a global audience. In the broadest terms, the William Blake Archive is a contemporary response to the needs of this dispersed and various audience of readers and viewers and to the corresponding needs of the collections where Blake's original works are currently held.\nA free site on the World Wide Web since 1996, the Blake Archive was conceived as an international public resource that would provide unified access to major works of visual and literary art that are highly disparate, widely dispersed, and more and more often severely restricted as a result of their value, rarity, and extreme fragility. A growing number of contributors have given the Archive permission to include thousands of Blake's images and texts without fees.\nThrough intensive collaboration, initially between the editors and the Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities (IATH) and now between the editors and the Carolina Digital Library and Archives (CDLA), the Archive has been able to achieve exceptionally high standards of site construction, digital representation, and electronic editing that are, we believe, models of their kind. Advanced principles of design allow the Blake Archive to integrate editions, catalogues, databases, and scholarly tools into one electronic archival resource. We supply reproductions that are more accurate in color, detail, and scale than the finest commercially published photomechanical reproductions and texts that are more faithful to Blake's own than any collected edition has provided. To accomplish this with equally high standards, we publish works in Standard Mode and Preview Mode. For fully published works in the Archive, we supply a wealth of contextual information, which includes full and accurate bibliographical details and meticulous descriptions of the content of each image. Works published in our Preview Mode lack descriptions of Blake's pictorial designs and image-search capabilities but offer all the other features of fully published works. Finally, users of the Archive can attain a new degree of access to these works through the combination of powerful text-searching and (for the first time in any medium) advanced image-searching tools that are made possible by the editors' controlled vocabulary, detailed image descriptions, and innovative software, including two custom-designed Java applets.

The reading text, newly transcribed and annotated, has been digested under the main milestones of the printed text and made navigable on phones, tablets, and laptops as well as desktop computers. Thumbnail images to the right of the text link to archive-quality, high-resolution scans of two unique and historical objects that are now among the holdings of the University of Virginia's\u00a0Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library.\nOne set of scans reproduces a\u00a0copy\u00a0of\u00a0Notes on the State of Virginia\u00a0that Jefferson had privately printed in Paris in 1784 and that was presented to the Revolutionary War hero the Marquis de Lafayette. (Jefferson's\u00a0inscription\u00a0to Lafayette appears on the book's flyleaf.)\nThe second set of scans is taken from Jefferson's own\u00a0copy\u00a0of the first published edition, which was printed for the London publisher John Stockdale in 1787. This copy contains hundreds of annotations, corrections, and revisions in Jefferson's own handwriting, many of them interlineated in the text or set off in the margins; other additions appear on scraps of paper that were later inserted when the copy was rebound in the twentieth century.\nIt is this second, personal artifact that supplies our copy text. What the scanned pages reveal is that Jefferson never thought of his\u00a0Notes\u00a0as a finished book. Indeed, filled with marginalia and manuscript inserts (newly transcribed and reproduced here), Jefferson's personal copy of the\u00a0Notes\u00a0strains against received notions of the book as printed, fixed, and standardly paginated, and therefore lends itself well to study in a digital environment.\nThis site also publishes the large\u00a0map\u00a0that was folded up and bound in with Jefferson's personal copy of the text. The map, engraved for the Stockdale edition and based in large part on one that had been published by Joshua Frye and Thomas Jefferson\u2019s father Peter Jefferson in 1753, is another means by which the book attempts to represent Virginia and surrounding areas in print. In this edition, the original map has been georectified and overlaid on to a modern digital map of the world.

We have found that while many external tutorials offered by the tool developers themselves are helpful in learning how the tool works and what it does, they are not helpful in explaining how we might use those tools in our coursework. For example, a text-analytics service might offer a remarkably thorough how-to guide which explains how the scholar might become competent in the use of the tool, but using the tool will not yield any special insights if the scholar does not go into the process with a question on which the service might bear. It is in this way that many of the how-to guides of the common tools in DH are lacking; they speak more to cultivating literacy\u00a0within the tool rather than what we might do with it once we have achieved competency in it. Moreover, some of these guides assume that their users have a working knowledge that might overwhelm or exclude the newly interested individual. So we at DH@UVA have set to developing our own guides for some tools which we hope will provide a more generally applicable strategy for learning and applying new DH tools in the classroom. \nThat being said, the external tutorials for the common tools used in DH are still helpful for learning the tool itself, and links to these tutorials can be accessed through our Common Tools\u00a0page.\nIf you have any individually developed tutorials for how to use a particular tool practically in the classroom that you'd like to share, please contact the site manager, Rennie Mapp at mapp@virginia.edu, or an active member of the DH@ UVA team to collaborate with us.\n" } }, { "node": { "title": "Check Out Our Bibliography of Online Works and Resources for DH Pedagogy", "Body": "\u00a0\nBelow is a list of online resources that focus on DH pedagogy.\u00a0 Links requiring\u00a0UVA Library authentification are *marked with an asterisk; the rest are freely available.\n\u00a0\n*Apollon, Daniel, et al.

Much of what would be considered digital literacy are things that many of us take for granted in\u00a0modern classroom and university settings. But digital literacy admits of levels as well. Some of us are more digitally literate than others, and that is okay. You don\u2019t have to be the most digitally literate person to start introducing digital humanities (DH) into your classroom. Why? The simplest answer is that digital literacy and DH come apart in an important way. \nWhile the boundary between digital literacy and DH is still contested, we think it is safe to say that the most obvious difference between them is that DH adds the component of critical engagement with digital methods and mediums. When the activity of reflection becomes a part of the individual or the classroom interaction with the digital, we cross the boundary between digital literacy and DH. As a result, DH enhances our interactions with our course material by offering us a new method of examining the same thing. Were the conclusions you\u2019d drawn about an author\u2019s development over time challenged by the text-analytic results you got when you asked the same question but derived the answer computationally? How were your biases reflected in your twitter data mining? Digital literacy gives us the capacity to employ these tools in our classrooms and research, while DH gives us the space to reflect critically about the process as well as the product derived from using such tools.\n--Elyse Oakley, DH@UVA Pedagogy Specialist (2019)\n" } }, { "node": { "title": "Syllabus Collection Project", "Body": "The syllabus collection project has two primary functions: 1) to gather those syllabi that contain Digital Humanities elements in one easily accessible, regularly maintained place and 2) to aid those interested in integrating DH into their classrooms in the process by giving examples of coursework in their respective field that interacts with the same kinds of materials. \nThe goal of this project is for scholars of all levels of interest and knowledge in DH to come to the collection, select a \u201clevel of difficulty in integration\u201d and see representative syllabi presented in tandem with suggested methods and suggested resources to facilitate the incorporation of DH into their classroom.

Listed as DH 8991, this core course is required for all DH Certificate students.\u00a0It is offered each spring semester.\u00a0\n\n\nOne\u00a0practicum course\u00a0(three credits)\u00a0The DH practicum (DH 8000), Professor Alison Booth instructor of record, offered fall and spring semester. Usually a student enrolls in this course when planning to complete the portfolio and graduate. This S/U course certifies a student's credit for the practicum (60 hours), the colloquium requirements, and the final portfolio, which is necessary for credit in the practicum course as well as completion of the Certificate. The practicum focuses\u00a0on the hands-on work\u2014often but not necessarily technical\u2014that is usually involved in DH projects; in the final portfolio, students will include evidence of completing 60 hours of hands-on work in DH, along with access to any digital projects in which the student took part or that the student completed. The student also needs to have attended the colloquium component, that is, events and workshops related to DH offered at this university or elsewhere; with reflections on at least two such events per semester toward the degree.

Shermeyer, a former dramaturg, theater director, producer, and current doctoral student in the English department, began the proceedings with a presentation entitled, \u201cDigital Skriker: New Directions for Archival Practices and Performance.\u201d Sean Tennant, a doctoral student in the McIntire Department of Art, presented \u201cQuantifying the Roman House,\u201d in which Tenant used network analysis and quantitative methods to track ancient Roman cultural influences in northwest and northwestern Europe through shifts in domestic spatial arrangements.\nIn Shermeyer\u2019s view, AR and VR technologies are put to best use when they are deployed in service of making storytelling more accessible, truthful, and resonant to audiences.\u00a0 Her analysis of motion capture technologies coincides with her aim to enhance storytelling and forge new ways of generating surprise, delight, and wonder for theater-goers. Without suggesting that large budgets and corporate backing are necessary, Shermeyer seeks to contest the notion that \u201ctheater is dying,\u201d a notion which plays an outsize role in driving increased usage of AR and VR technologies in theatrical productions.\u00a0\nA dance course in UVA\u2019s Drama Department prompted Shermeyer to think anew about the consequences of archiving motion capture, and the conversations that drive increased usage of augmented reality in the theater\u2014 especially community theaters without large budgets. In her presentation she reviewed recent plays that have utilized AR and VR technologies, including productions from the Royal Shakespeare Theatre Company and Andy Serkis\u2019s production company, \u201cThe Imaginarium.\u201d She then turned to her own work with motion capture technology in her treatment of Caryl Churchill\u2019s \u201cThe Skriker\u201d which features wordless scenes of human and fairy interaction in the background. Shermeyer experimented with three motion capture suits, evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of each as she considered how they blur the boundaries between performance, film, archiving, and gaming. In the interest of making augmented reality manageable for community theaters, she evaluated factors such as range of motion, body type accommodation, and data-feed stability and conversion.\n[Shermeyer's] analysis of motion capture technologies coincides with her aim to enhance storytelling and forge new ways of generating surprise, delight, and wonder for theater-goers. \n\nSean Tennant focused on two key questions in his research: 1) how to explain the leap from people living in round houses to Roman villas? and 2) how to glean patterns of ancient Roman cultural diffusion as it\u00a0 applies to Northwestern European architecture during this time period? From a final data set that included 265 distinct archaeological sites in 357 unique contexts, Tennant quantified the architectural shift in Northwestern Europe from round houses to widespread adoption of Roman villas across the time period spanning the first century A.D. to the fourth century A.D.\u00a0\nTennant\u2019s application of network analysis to architecture is relatively rare in the discipline of archaeology. Other methodologies he used like space syntax analysis\u00a0are controversial among archaeologists who argue that it removes the human element from architectural analysis, but Tennant counters that ancient Roman textual sources offer intact, quantifiable data about the ways in which ancient Romans visualized and conceptualized their domestic spaces, enabling his DH approach to yield an important insight into the history of European homes. \u00a0Tennant said he expected a sharper distinction between patterns of spatial arrangement in Roman Britain and Northwestern Europe but found that Roman Britain began adopting Roman patterns of living before Romans had ever arrived there.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n", "Image": { "src": "https://dh-dev.library.virginia.edu/sites/digitalhumanities.virginia.edu/files/F85C0509-F5D1-4256-AC6D-0FA72F2B4FA0.jpg", "alt": "" }, "Subtitle": "By Logan Heiman", "Image (caption)": "Pictured: (left) Kelli Shermeyer displays an AR-produced dancing devil; (right) Sean Tennant presenting &quot;Quantifying the Roman House&quot;\r\n" } }, { "node": { "title": "Humanities Informatics Speaker: Cameron Buckner, Philosophy, University of Houston, \"Representation in Deep Neural Networks\"", "Date": "Friday, October 25, 2019 - 3:30am to 5:00am", "Location": "Gibson Room, Cocke Hall", "Sponsoring Organization(s)": "Humanities Informatics Lab", "Certificate Event": "no", "Event Type": "Lecture" } }, { "node": { "title": "Symposium: Burning the Library of Life: Species Extinction and the Humanities", "Body": "Keynote: Sept 26 at 4:30pm: Ursula K.

Riffing on the word \u201cenclosure,\u201d the Praxis Fellows arrived at the project title \u201cUnclosure\u201d which aims to push back against any notions of cultural enclosure and to reignite interest in materials in the public domain. Mathilda Shepard, a doctoral student in the Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese department said that the project focused on answering two core questions: \u201cWhat does it mean for a work to enter the public domain?\u201d and \u201cWhat does it mean to engage the public domain digitally?\u201d\nTo that end, the fellows selected Robert Frost\u2019s \u201cNew Hampshire,\u201d the titular poem from his Pulitzer Prize-winning collection, as a case study for their working theory of public domain pedagogy. As a canonical work of poetry, the Praxis Fellows considered \u201cNew Hampshire\u201d an ideal candidate for testing hypotheses about what constitutes the cultural commons and how existing conceptions of those commons can be changed to be more inclusive of authors, subjects, and cultures that have historically been underrepresented in the Western literary canon. Thus, a large part of the project\u2019s aim is to encourage both scholars and the general public to push past epistemological biases that exist along the dimensions of race, gender, geography, and more. \nGetting to the substantive core of the project, Praxis Fellow Christopher Whitehead explained that \u201cNew Hampshire\u201d allowed him and his collaborators to engage with a text that was both in the public domain and restricted to a discrete, physical domain. These two aspects of the poem generated possibilities for exploring the limits of cultural and epistemological boundaries shaped by canonical works and for contending with what Mathilda Shepard described as \u201cepistemological violence.\u201d By this latter term, Shepard referred to the absence of Indigenous representation in Frost\u2019s poem and the lack of reference to Abenaki tribal claims on the land that is now known as the state of New Hampshire. \n\nInterrogating \u201cNew Hampshire,\u201d the Fellows deployed a suite of methodological interventions including: storymapping, sonic interventions, text mining, translation, typeface interventions, and the construction of the project website. Notably, the Praxis Fellows aimed for transparency throughout the process and expressed humility about the limitations of their efforts. In his remarks, Whitehead made ample reference to those limitations. For instance, the Praxis Fellows reached out to members of the Abenaki tribe in New Hampshire seeking collaboration, but time constraints and distance ultimately impeded such collaboration. \nTo assist future scholars interested in working on materials in the public domain, the Fellows took a number of steps to ensure anyone can construct a more \u201copen, respectful, and ethical public domain.\u201d The Fellows opted to use the software platform Jekyll which allows for easy transfer of control between users and, additionally, is non-proprietary and has comprehensive documentation. Catherine Addington used the platform Calligraphr for the typeface intervention she applied to the text of \u201cNew Hampshire.\u201d The font Addington produced is released under a public domain license \u201cso that others may freely build upon, enhance and reuse the work for any purposes without restriction.\u201d She also produced a \u201cweb font kit\u201d which offers a tutorial on how to retrace her steps. \nBroadening their circle of collaboration, the Fellows presented their website at the \u201cDecolonizing the Digital Humanities: Indigenous Arts, Histories, and Knowledges from the Material to the Screen\u201d symposium held at the University of Virginia. Leading scholars like Margaret Bruchac, Assistant Professor of Anthropology and Coordinator for Native American and Indigenous Studies at the University of Pennsylvania, offered useful critique and feedback on \u201cUnclosure.\u201d Bruchac pointed out at least two projects encompassed under the \u201cUnclosure\u201d website that she says would have constituted an act of violence against Native women or actively undermined efforts of Native groups like the Western Abenaki of New Hampshire to preserve their own cultures and histories. The Fellows were responsive and receptive to such concerns and consequently chose to omit or else rework any projects that might be construed to violate the sovereignty or intellectual property of Indigenous and Native groups.\nThese critiques played a role in the Fellows\u2019 selection of tools that will enable Indigenous scholars and practitioners to apply interventions and engage critically with \u201cNew Hampshire\u201d and other works that will eventually enter the public domain. Notably, none of the Praxis Fellows are scholars of North American Indigenous literature and to their credit, they constructed their website with an eye toward making their pedagogical tools open and accessible to those with the appropriate expertise and background to fulfill objectives that had to be excluded from the final project due to constraints of time and resources. Ultimately, the Praxis Fellows\u2019 experience working on \u201cUnclosure\u201d offers a strong template for others who wish to incorporate public domain materials in their pedagogy and, more specifically, for those wishing to expand the scope of authors and texts in the cultural commons.\n", "Image": { "src": "https://dh-dev.library.virginia.edu/sites/digitalhumanities.virginia.edu/files/IMG_1299_0.jpeg", "alt": "Person extends hand toward projection screen" }, "Subtitle": "By Logan Heiman", "Image (caption)": "Praxis Fellow Catherine Addington shares her typography contributions to &quot;Unclosure.&quot;\r\n" } }, { "node": { "title": " to Office of the Vice President for Information Technology by Staff", "I am connected to:": "Office of the Vice President for Information Technology", "Instructor": "Logan Heiman", "My connection type is:": "Staff" } }, { "node": { "title": "DH@UVA Team", "Body": "The DH@UVA team was created in 2018 to provide website support to the DH community at UVA, with particular emphasis on providing resources for the DH Graduate Certificate Program and cultivating DH networks\u00a0across the University.\n\u00a0\nActive Members\n\nRennie Mapp,\u00a0Editor and Site Owner\nPatricia Searl, Consulting Developer\nHannah Young, Research and Communications Assistant\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nAlumni\n\n\nLogan Heiman, Communications Specialist\n\n\nChristian Howard, Project Manager\n\n\nElyse Oakley, Pedagogy Specialist\n\nJordan Buysse, Workshop Specialist\n\n", "Image": { "src": "https://dh-dev.library.virginia.edu/sites/digitalhumanities.virginia.edu/files/DHatUVATeam%20page-1.png", "alt": "The 2018-2019 DH@UVA team posing outside the east wing of Alderman Library" } } }, { "node": { "title": "Grounds for Celebration of the Digital Humanities Community", "Body": "The University of Virginia breeds\u00a0innovative leaders in digital humanities research and scholarship, leadership which was on full display in Brooks Hall on May 7.

This course will introduce students to the issues and goals that have shaped public history as a scholarly discipline, but the focus of the course will be on the contemporary practice of public history, with a focus on the public history of slavery.\nField trips to local sites and a final class project involving field work in several Reconstruction-era African American cemeteries are major components of this course.\u00a0Readings, assignments, and tours of local historic sites will investigate the range of scholarly issues most relevant to the practice of public history today. Those include the challenges of presenting slavery as public history; enlarging the scope of historic sites to include the less powerful, especially women and enslaved workers; and ongoing debates about the difference between history and heritage. Who is the \u201cpublic\u201d in public history? Whose history gets told, and how? Throughout the semester, students will work closely with the librarians and curators at Special Collections; the GIS specialists in Scholars\u2019 Lab; and community members from Buckingham County to research and present hidden or erased histories of African American life in the nineteenth century.\nTours of local historic sites and museum exhibits are a key element of this class.

The symposium was timely and pertinent in light of UNESCO\u2019s declaration of 2019 as the \u201cYear of Indigenous Languages.\u201d The purpose of the symposium was \u201cto explore the possibilities and limits of decolonization within the context of Indigenous artworks, histories, and knowledges.\u201d The presentations and sessions at the symposium addressed both infrastructural issues related to DH approaches in Indigenous Studies \u2013 for instance mapping and visualization of indigenous communities, as well as\u00a0intellectual concerns i.e. preserving indigenous languages and formal aspects of indigenous cultural forms and expression. \nThe morning session of the symposium\u2019s first day focused squarely on the infrastructural side of the \u201cDecolonizing\u201d theme. Entitled \u201cSpace, Power, and the Limits of Visualization in Indigenous Communities of the Global South,\u201d the session featured three speakers as follows: Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Afanador-Llach of La Universidad de los Andes (\u201cDigitization, Mapping and the Reconstruction of Erased Indigenous Places\u201d); Kasey Keeler of the University of Wisconsin-Madison (\u201cMapping Native People: The Intersection of Individual Privacy, Tribal Sovereignty, and Academic Research\u201d); and Kent Morris (CEO, The Torch, Indigenous Arts in Prisons and Community Program). \nThe afternoon session entitled \u201cIndigenous Media and Forms in Latin America and Latinx Communities\u201d also featured three speakers as follows: \u00c9lika Ortega Guzm\u00e1n of Northeastern University (\u201cLiterary mestizajes \u2013 Print-Digital Books from Latin America\u201d); Amalia I.

Margaret Bruchac closed the day\u2019s proceedings with a keynote address entitled \u201cVoices Carry: Reflections on Animacy in Indigenous Collections.\u201d The second day of the symposium was devoted to a roundtable and discussion of what steps could be taken to advance digital Indigenous studies based on the proceedings of the symposium. The second day of the symposium was devoted to discussion of the challenges and opportunities that accompany DH approaches. Invited speakers like Margaret Bruchac of the University of Pennsylvania alluded to the ways in which DH methodologies may be at odds with Indigenous communities\u2019 notions of sovereignty, privacy, and intellectual property.\n\u201cDecolonizing\u201d co-organizer Allison Bigelow\u2019s own experience as an 18th century Colonial Studies scholar helped spark the symposium. Bigelow, Assistant Professor of Spanish at UVA, notes, \u201cMy interest in DH came from graduate students. They wanted a course in DH and we had nothing from indigenous studies. We worked with Rafael Alvarado at DSI [the University of Virginia\u2019s Data Science Institute], [and in the midst of this collaboration] I noticed methodological tensions \u2013 [for example] native communities that didn\u2019t want everything documented by outsiders.\u201d She said that her foray into scholarship on indigenous communities came up against issues of sovereignty, representation, and repatriation. Further to that point, co-organizer Douglas Fordham, Associate Professor in the McIntire Department of Art, indicated that the increased visibility digital humanities research sometimes brings to indigenous communities can also entail infringements on these communities\u2019 autonomy among other \u201cunintended consequences.\u201d \nThe \u201cDecolonizing\u201d symposium was made possible thanks to the funding of the Page-Barbour Foundation, the Buckner W.

How do cultural and societal forces shape our understanding of what constitutes data and the ways we deploy it? Whom and what must we consider if we are to expand and deepen our understanding of data and the information systems they ultimately construct? These questions and more served as topics of exploration at \u201cFeminist DH@UVA II: Intersectionality and Doing Justice To/With Data,\u201d a symposium of feminist scholars engaged in the digital humanities. \nThe event took place on Friday, March 29, 2019 at the UVA Scholars\u2019 Lab and it highlighted the myriad ways in which data and technology advance the study of gender\u2019s influence on society. Invited speakers hailed from Dartmouth College, the University of Maryland, the College of William and Mary, and the University of Virginia. The conference organizer, English Professor Alison Booth, Academic Director of the Scholars\u2019 Lab, spoke of the \u201cwidespread effects of generosity,\u201d specifically that of co-sponsors, UVA\u2019s Department of Women, Gender, and Sexuality, the Carter G. Woodson Institute, and the English Department, and the speakers, distinguished leaders of feminist and African and African American studies in the field of digital humanities. Generosity, too, is the spirit of intersectional feminist DH, she said, as the event\u2019s speakers already collaborate in their research initiatives.\nHeld in Alderman Library, Room 421, the day\u2019s events began with a presentation by Marlene Daut, Associate Professor and Associate Director of the Woodson Institute, entitled \u201cDigital Print Culture and Accessibility: the Case for Haiti.\u201d Daut deplored the erasure of Haitians\u2019 own historical scholarship and print culture, even as recently as the major exhibit on Haiti at the British Museum in 2018. Collaborating with various digital projects to edit and share rare materials such as the Haitian Declaration of Independence, Daut noted the difference between decolonizing and democratizing; for the Haitian public, a printed book may be cheaper and more accessible than a digital archive.\nElizabeth Losh, Associate Professor of English and American Studies at the College of William and Mary, led a discussion tackling the collision of gender and technology in the 2016 United States presidential election. Losh argued that Hillary Clinton\u2019s stunning defeat in the election could be attributed, in part, to gendered notions of technology and privacy as they relate to the former Secretary of State\u2019s usage of a private email server while leading the State Department. Losh also contended that Donald J. Trump\u2019s usage of emojis in tweets (as well as that of his followers) could serve as a useful tracking mechanism for his performance of masculinity as a presidential candidate.\nIn the following session, \u201cMy Feminism is Black and Digital,\u201d Catherine Knight Steele of the University of Maryland defined digital Black feminism, extending the research of her doctoral dissertation, \u201cThe Digital Barbershop\u201d into the arena of the beauty shop. Steele asserted the unique role of Black feminism, defining \u201cBlack feminist technoculture\u201d as one that does not further white supremacist culture and is not derivative of white culture. The fourth speaker, Jacqueline Wernimont, Distinguished Chair of Digital Humanities and Social Engagement & Associate Professor of Women\u2019s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies at Dartmouth, presented \u201cEarly Data Bodies and Anglo-American Empire,\u201d sharing her research from her recent book, Numbered Lives. From mortality tables in plague-ridden London to early maps, pedometers, and insurance, an aesthetic control of quantified populations and national spaces has served imperial interests, diminishing lives of women and enslaved people.\nThe conference concluded with a lively round-table dialogue among Alison Booth and the day\u2019s speakers, sparked by brief presentations by Allison Bigelow, Assistant Professor of Spanish, on traces of Quecha in colonial Latin American texts; Doug Meyer, Assistant Professor of Women, Gender, and Sexuality, on the framing of the mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub as homophobic, anti-Latinx, or terrorist; and James Perla, Managing Director of the Citizen Justice Initiative, Woodson Institute, on the Institute\u2019s digital projects documenting and mapping African American histories. \n", "Image": { "src": "https://dh-dev.library.virginia.edu/sites/digitalhumanities.virginia.edu/files/IMG_1226.jpg", "alt": "" }, "Subtitle": "By Alison Booth and Logan Heiman", "Image (caption)": "Pictured (from left): Alison Booth, Professor of English and Academic Director of Scholars&#39; Lab; Elizabeth Losh, Associate Professor of English and American Studies at William &amp; Mary; Jacqueline Wernimont, Distinguished Chair of Digital Humanities and Social Engagement and Associate Professor of Women&#39;s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies at Dartmouth College; and Catherine Knight Steele, Assistant Professor in the Department of Communication at University of Maryland and Director of the African American Digital Humanities Initiative (AADHum); not pictured, Marlene Daut, Director of the Woodson Institute and Associate Professor in African and African American Studies at UVA\r\n" } }, { "node": { "title": "HIST 5501 Historical Geospatial Visualization: Mapping Indigenous Worlds", "Body": "Thursdays 2:00-4:30 p.m. in New Cabell Hall 038\nThis workshop introduces advanced undergraduate and graduate students to a variety of methods and platforms for digital research featuring geospatial data.\u00a0 Students will contribute to a series of common research projects as they learn geospatial visualization methods using using ArcMap, ArcGIS Online, Story Map, MapScholar, and VisualEyes.\u00a0 We will read historical scholarship as well as primary sources with an eye firmly fixed on how to visualize spatial ideas and experiences and spend time debating the value of doing so.\u00a0 We will also read about visualization more generally as we think creatively about how digital tools might enable us to make our own research more innovative and compelling.\u00a0 This course counts as an elective for the Graduate Digital Humanities Certificate program.\n\u00a0\n", "Course Number": "HIST 5501", "Department": "History", "DH Certificate requirement ": "Elective", "discipline": "History", "MAO Materials": "Geospatial, Images", "Related Tools": "Neatline", "Semester": "Fall", "Syllabus File": " Syllabus_HIST5501_ F19 (1).docx", "Taught By": "Max Edelson", "university": "University of Virginia", "UVa Course": "yes", "Year": "2019" } }, { "node": { "title": "Symposium: Rotunda Planetarium: Science & Learning in the University of Virginia's First Library", "Body": "In 1819, Thomas Jefferson sketched plans for a planetarium spanning the dome of the University of Virginia\u2019s Rotunda library.\u00a0\u201cThe concave ceiling of the Rotunda,\u201c\u00a0he wrote,\u00a0\u201cis proposed to be painted sky-blue and spangled with gilt stars in their position and magnitude copied exactly.\u201c\u00a0As designed, the Rotunda\u2019s ceiling would represent the night sky in real time: mock constellations (moved by an operator perched on an elevated seat)\u00a0would trace their annual progress across a wood-and-plaster firmament.

The confluence of these enormous crowdsourced data can contribute to an inexpensive, sustainable and large-scale decision support system that has never been possible before. The main obstacle in building such a system lies in the problem of information veracity, i.e., it is hard to distinguish true or accurate information from false or inaccurate ones. In this talk, I will present our efforts towards solving information veracity challenge when crowdsourced data are ubiquitous but their reliability is suspect. We model the task as an optimization problem that jointly searches for source reliability and true facts without any supervision.\u00a0 We showed how our proposed models handle different kinds of data, including data with long-tail distributions, data of heterogeneous types, spatial-temporal data, streaming and distributed data, and how they can support a wide range of applications, including crowdsourcing question answering, knowledge base construction and environmental monitoring. To motivate crowd users to contribute high-quality data, we designed effective budget allocation and privacy preservation mechanisms. At the end of the talk, I will briefly introduce my other work, which is the integration of complementary views for improved inference for fake news detection on social media data as well as several decision making tasks in healthcare and transportation domains.\u00a0\nAbout the speaker:\u00a0\u00a0Jing Gao is an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University at Buffalo (UB), State University of New York. She received her PhD from Computer Science Department, University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign in 2011, and subsequently joined UB in 2012. She is broadly interested in data and information analysis with a focus on information integration, crowdsourcing, social media analysis, misinformation detection, knowledge graphs, multi-source data analysis, anomaly detection, transfer learning and data stream mining. She enjoyed collaborating with researchers across multiple disciplines, including healthcare, transportation and cyber security. She has published more than 150 papers in referred journals and conferences. She is an editor of ACM Transactions on Intelligence Systems and Technology, and serves in the senior program committee of ACM KDD and CIKM conferences.

As our notions of what reality is undergo fundamental transformation due to advances in technology, how might concepts of the digital and the analog be applied philosophically to descriptions of reality? Introduced by the Institute of the Humanities & Global Cultures Director Debjani Ganguly at a talk held at IHGC in UVA\u2019s Wilson Hall, NYU Steinhardt Professor of Media, Culture, and Communication Alexander Galloway tackled these questions and other topics at the intersection of technology and mediation in an IHGC-sponsored talk on\u00a0Monday, March 18, 2019. Galloway foregrounded his discussion with a sweeping history of theorists who have previously grappled with technology and mediation.\nSituating current discourse about networks in a poststructuralist context, Galloway pondered the question of where the analog fits in a theoretical space that over time has come to be dominated by the digital. To address this issue, Galloway drew upon mathematical concepts, philology and etymology, and intellectual history. Meditating on the meanings of the terms logos and analogos and mapping them on to the digital-analog dichotomy, Galloway claimed that the digital is a close cousin to quantification. Galloway\u2019s most recent books include \u201cLaruelle: Against the Digital\u201d (University of Minnesota Press, 2014) and \u201cThe Interface Effect\u201d (Wiley, 2012). \n", "Image": { "src": "https://dh-dev.library.virginia.edu/sites/digitalhumanities.virginia.edu/files/32AEE73B-417C-4C6B-836D-560E9863B364.jpg", "alt": "" }, "Subtitle": "By Logan Heiman", "Image (caption)": "Alexander Galloway, left, fields questions from the audience with IHGC Director &amp; UVA Professor of English Debjani Ganguly, right, facilitating (Logan Heiman/DH@UVA)\r\n" } }, { "node": { "title": "DH@UVA Grad Student Mixer", "Body": "Come chat about the Liaison program, Praxis, DH Fellowships, and other exciting opportunities in the digital humanities at UVa.\nCome and go as you please.

When news surfaced of migrant detainments by ICE and CBP officials under President Donald J. Trump\u2019s immigration law enforcement policies in the spring of 2018,\u00a0Gil\u00a0spearheaded the usage of satellite imagery in collaboration with other humanists around the United States to locate detainees who had been separated from their families, organizing what he describes as \u201cnimble tents.\u201d Under this model, scholar-activists are able to use digital tools to disseminate information, distribute resources, and disband once the group\u2019s objective is complete. A further example of the \"nimble tent\" model can be found in the Puerto Rican mapathon project which came about in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in September 2017. Working with scholars from twenty-five institutions including the University of Virginia, digital humanists provided the Red Cross with the largest map resource on the internet, supporting critical aid efforts in the wake of the most devastating natural disaster in Puerto Rican history.\nGil's opening remarks gave way to a vigorous Q&A session with members of the DH@UVA community. One conversation addressed the opportunities and challenges of scholar-activist projects within academic library systems along with the need to maintain a balance between research, university service, and personal projects. Other questions prompted Gil\u00a0to meditate on the contending perspectives of journalists who he says tend to provide two competing viewpoints\u00a0in any given story while academics lean toward offering multiple perspectives in their presentation of events. While\u00a0Gil\u00a0hinted at the structural challenges the academy poses to digital humanists seeking to advance social justice, he expressed overall enthusiasm and optimism about forging pathways for scholars to meet the professional demands of academic institutions while generating innovative solutions to problems in the broader world.\u00a0Gil\u00a0closed his remarks with a plea to the audience to continue harnessing digital humanities scholarship to solve problems inside and outside of the academy.\n", "Image": { "src": "https://dh-dev.library.virginia.edu/sites/digitalhumanities.virginia.edu/files/79F9E8EF-0E28-427E-AE0E-B88E53D0D8D0.JPG", "alt": "" }, "Subtitle": "By Logan Heiman", "Image (caption)": "Columbia digital humanities scholar Alex Gil explains the concept of &quot;nimble tents&quot; in Alderman Library (Logan Heiman/DH@UVA)\r\n" } }, { "node": { "title": "Decolonizing the Digital Humanities: Indigenous Arts, Histories, and Knowledges from the Material to the Screen", "Body": "Please join us from April 5-6 for a symposium with Indigenous artists and digital humanities (DH) practitioners, \"Decolonizing the Digital Humanities: Indigenous Arts, Histories, and Knowledges from the Material to the Screen.\nFor program information and registration, visit http://spanitalport.as.virginia.edu/decolonizing-digital-humanities-indigenous-arts-histories-and-knowledges-material-screen-0.

Students must enroll in this S/U course, and approval of the portolio and dossier is needed for Satisfactory completion of this course, which does not have scheduled class meetings.\n\nWhen is the Practicum Course offered, and when should I take it?\nThe Practicum Course will be offered every fall and spring semester. Students generally should enroll in the Practicum Course during their last semester at UVA. Note that the course does not meet as such, and that the 60 hours of hands-on work may be completed at other times rather than entirely during the semester in which the student is enrolled.\n\nWhat counts toward the 60 hours of hands-on DH work?\nHands-on DH work may include coding (or learning to code, e.g. in a short non-credit course on Python at a DH institute); digital categorization or archiving of source materials; data collection, analysis, and visualization, whether of small or extensive sets of data; text editing, annotation, or \u201cmining\u201d for quantifiable data; and spatial technologies such as photogrammetry, VR, 3D printing, or mapping. This is not an exhaustive list, and the student is encouraged to use a wide variety of tools and approaches. It should, however, be noted that hands-on work is time that the student spent actively contributing to a projec or learning technical practices. Thus, some events or meetings related to DH count as colloquium participation but not Practicum because hands-on skills are not engaged. Similarly, reading and theorizing about what constitutes DH work does not count toward this requirement.\u00a0\nHands-on DH work may be undertaken as part of a Research Assistantship (RA assignment) and/or may include projects for which the student received a fellowship or other source of funding (such as the Praxis Program or DH Fellowships through the UVA Scholars\u2019 Lab).\nImportant Exceptions: Please note that projects completed as part of a DH course do not count toward the 60 practicum hours.\n\nWhere can I find a list of upcoming DH events and lectures at UVA that count toward the Practicum requirement?\nAll upcoming DH colloquia, lectures, forums, and other events are posted on the Event Calendar on the DH@UVA website. You can also find DH@UVA Colloquia events under the DH Certificate tab on the DH@UVA website. It is also wise to subscribe to the Scholars' Lab newsletter and consult their list of events and workshops.\n\nHow many DH colloquia, lectures, and other events do I need to attend to satisfy the Practicum Course?\nThere is no exact number of colloquia and other events that students must attend; however, it is suggested that students attend at least two DH-related events or lectures per semester once the student has applied for the Graduate Certificate in Digital Humanities. These events may be held at other institutions or virtual. The best practice is to include notes about events in the final dossier as part of the portfolio.\n\nWhat is the portfolio for the Graduate Certificate in Digital Humanities?\nThe portfolio demonstrates the student\u2019s involvement with DH work, and in particular, it stands as evidence that the student has completed the other two aspects of the Practicum course (i.e., 60 hours of hands-on DH work, and attendance at DH@UVA colloquia and other events). Think of this as a showcase of your DH work to prospective employersor colleagues. The portfolio consists of: I.) a public website or webpage, II.) a dossier documenting fulfillment of the Certficate requirements.\nStudents are also required to create a profile on the DH@UVA website (www.dh.virginia.edu) as soon as he or she decides to enter the Certificate program. During the student\u2019s last semester at the University, he or she should link his or her portfolio site to this profile. The profile and planning of the portfolio should be begun as soon as the student begins the Certificate.\u00a0 For instance, reflections on DH events should not be recollected months after the fact.\nI. COMPONENTS OF THE PORTFOLIO--ONLINE SITE\n\u00a0 \u00a0 A. Introduction or Overview: Address potential readers, from Advisory Committee to future employers or colleagues. Introduce yourself and offer a brief narrative telling the story of your research interests and development as a person working with digital tools as well as other methods of your disciplines. You may write particular reflections on methods as part of\n\u00a0 \u00a0 B. Body of Portfolio: Exhibit all the DH projects that you\u2019ve worked or collaborated on, including in course assignments (though as noted, the latter are not counted as Practicum hours).\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a01. Project Exhibits in Collaboration, for Practicum:\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0a. An image and access in some form to the project (a link to the project website or GitHub page) and a brief description of the project and its significance.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0b. The student\u2019s contribution to the project, and links to any blog posts you may have written about the project.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a02. Exhibits for Any Course Assignments, whether solo or collaborative, that relate to DH. Include a. and b. as stated for 1 in the Body of the Portfolio.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a03. Any relevant written work, for instance a researched seminar paper, that you wish to post rather than to publish with a journal (which would entail copyright). That said, you may decide that some of the projects you list should be simply described in words; these might include projects that you are not a leading collaborator for (it is not yours to \u201cpublish\u201d), or preliminary plans for projects not yet prototyped.\nII: DH Dossier\nDocumentation of the requirements fulfilled for the Certificate. Clearly guide the Advisory Committee members evaluating your portfolio as to how you completed the timeline you planned. It may be a clearly-linked page shared on the public portfolio site, but we assume that your general portfolio audience is less concerned with how you fulfilled the requirements for this certificate. This document should include:\n\na statement certifying that he or she has completed all 60 practicum hours required for the Certificate;\na breakdown of how many of the 60 practicum hours were spent on each project;\nlist of courses taken: core, two electives\nevidence of the student\u2019s contribution and involvement in the DH projects that count toward their practicum hours (we can consider a statement by a supervisor; images, examples of work done); [note that this can be a summary and refer to more substantial account (like a final report) shared in the public portfolio]\nbrief descriptions and evidence of any other DH projects that the student completed through their coursework (NB: projects completed as part of a DH course do not count toward the 60 practicum hours but may be more fully represented in the public portfolio and summarized in the dossier)\nbrief reflections on DH colloquia and other community events (including DH courses taught and DH conferences attended) in which the student participated during their graduate tenure at UVA; include dates, names of speakers if any, the topic or title, some response to the issues or methods\nany relevant reflective writing or scholarly work that you do not wish to present on the public website. For instance, you may have written a response paper for the core course that articulates your own views about an issue or method in digital humanities\n\nThe DH committee will evaluate this dossier in conjunction with the public portfolio to determine the student\u2019s eligibility to graduate with a Graduate Certificate in Digital Humanities.\n\nWhen should I start working on my portfolio?\nStudents should begin putting their portfolios together as soon as they decide to obtain a Graduate Certificate in Digital Humanities. During the final semester, or the semester in which the student enrolls in the Practicum course, the student submits a draft, usually a month before the November or April due dates for graduation--a thesis, like a final portfolio, will be due in time to contact the registrar that the student has earned the Certificate. It is never too early to seek consultation with Alison Booth, Rennie Mapp, your DH Certificate advisor, and/or a Library subject librarian or Scholars' Lab staff member on the scope and design of a portfolio.\n\nWhat services can I use to create and host my public website?t\nProbably the most favored option is to work with UVA Create to set up your own domain that can serve you wherever you go; as a member of UVA, your annual fee is $15. The University's arrangement with Reclaim Hosting includes access to software that helps you easily create a website or manage your data, including WordPress, MediaWiki, Drupal, Scalar,\u00a0Omeka, and more.\u00a0 Each platform has advantages and challenges.\u00a0 Some technical support comes with your fee, and we are glad to help refer you for consultation.\nThere are a number of website creation and hosting options that also charge a fee, including Wix and SquareSpace, which are easy-to-use and frankly have less of the aura of specialist know-how.\n\u00a0There are other free options for UVA students:\n\nGitHub Pages - a personal website hosted directly from your GitHub repository.\u00a0\n\nBenefits: Signing up for GitHub is free, and each user is able to host one website through his or her GitHub account. Many free templates and designs are available through the GitHub and Jekyll communities. You can create and link a custom URL to your GitHub page. This site is not administered by UVA, and users can continue to update and change their websites beyond their time at the university. GitHub is commonly used by advanced technology teams.\nDrawbacks: Using GitHub requires basic knowledge of Git and HTML/CSS.\n\n\nDigication ePortfolio -\u00a0a web-based platform designed to support the creation and sharing of electronic portfolios by and among individuals as well as groups and in courses.\n\nBenefits: Freely available to UVA students in the College of Arts & Sciences. Digication offers technical, design, and pedagogical support for students, and provides a number of ready-made templates that require no coding skills.\u00a0\nDrawbacks: While users will be able to access and share their ePortfolios even after they graduate from UVA, updating and maintaining portfolios after a student's graduation will only be available to those who choose to purchase an individual\u00a0ePortfolio account.\u00a0\nThe A&S Learning Design & Technology team will establish a Digication account for you. Contact the Digication Help Desk\u00a0and inform them of your reason for creating a portfolio.\u00a0\n\n\nWordPress - a personal website or blog featuring multiple, customizable themes. Many serviceable websites have been made using WordPress. It has been supported at UVA as a feature in Collab that is hosted by SHANTI; this will not be a permanent or highly supported platform.\u00a0\n\nIf you have questions about which platform would be best suited to your needs, please set up an appointment with Alison Booth, Rennie Mapp, or scholarslab@virginia.edu.\n\nWhere can I find portfolio templates and examples?\nPublic Website Examples\n\nBrandon Walsh, Head of Student Programs at the University of Virginia's Scholars' Lab\nAmanda Visconti, Managing Director of the University of Virginia's Scholars' Lab\nAnnie Swafford, Digital Humanities Specialist at Tufts University\n\nDH Dossier Examples\n\nsee Portfolios of graduates of the Certificate program: links from the profiles of Christian Howard, Catherine Addington, Zaina Ujayli, Justin Greenlee, Maayan Ornath.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n", "Image": { "src": "https://dh-dev.library.virginia.edu/sites/digitalhumanities.virginia.edu/files/DH%20Practicum%20%26%20Portfolio%20.png", "alt": "Architecture professor presenting to graduate students at a DH project scoping panel" } } }, { "node": { "title": "Logan Heiman", "Body": "Since February 2019, Logan Heiman has served as Communications Specialist for DH@UVA.

As this new economic logic permeates our writing and communication technologies, digitally-mediated academic writing represents at once two forms of intelligence: the academic intelligence as intended by the author, and an alienated form of intelligence about that author to be mined, analyzed, instrumentalized, and indefinitely archived by IT companies in their quest for the accumulation of capital.\nWhile this alienation may seem to have no bearing on our intellectual processes, Erin Rose Glass argues that it constitutes an \u201cinvisible discipline\u201d that \u201cteaches\u201d the academic community to passively accept digital technology as neutral and inevitable. Such passivity not only contributes to the broader normalization of surveillance capitalism but also freezes our capacity, as academics, to explore exciting new intellectual, social, and political possibilities for our academic writing technologies and practices.\nIn this talk, Glass offers a framework for thinking about writing in an age of alienated intelligence and discuss a variety of ways academics can hack our writing tools, practices, and information capital to generate new forms of intellectual community and processes. To demonstrate this approach, she will discuss experimental projects including Social Paper, #SocialDiss, and KNIT R&D that attempt to demonstrate the exciting potential of reclaiming and redirecting the alienated intelligence of our academic communities.\nErin Rose Glass\u00a0is the Digital Scholarship Librarian at UC San Diego, where she facilitates the\u00a0Digital Humanities Research Group.

In some cases the the principles may in fact be contradictory in practice (for instance, supporting large-scale immediate analysis) and compromises must be found. Working through those challenges is one of the aspects that make Voyant a worthy intellectual challenge.\nHyperPo and TAPoRware are the tools with the strongest affinities to Voyant. but we have devoted considerable thought and attention to improving existing web-based tools in ways further described below.\nScalability. Whereas HyperPo and Taporware can readily handle book-length texts for micro-analysis, both reach their practical limits when corpora grow to beyond a couple of megabytes. In contrast, Voyant is designed to handle much larger corpora (dozens of megabytes and beyond). There is still a practical (though undefined) limit to the size of corpora for Voyant given that it seeks to enable immediate micro-analysis, but the Voyant architecture is desiged with scale in mind. There will always be a tension between indexing speed and retrieval speed: the more time is available for indexing, the faster retrieval tends to be. As such, text analysis tools that require pre-indexing (Philologic, Monk, etc.) will almost always operate faster because pre-processing can be done over the course of hours or even days (building very large relational databases, for instance). In contrast, Voyant seeks to strike a balance between indexing and retrieval speed: ideally both should happen in a timeframe that seems reasonable in a web-based context. The ever-evolving pace of computing power and the promise of high performance computers obviously make the actual capabilities a moving target.\nUbiquity. As useful as text analysis tools like HyperPo and Taporware may be, we recognize a need to allow content providers and producers (like bloggers) to quickly and easily integrate functionality into their own space. The previous model was limited to users bringing their own texts to our tools, we now wish to also allow users to also bring our tools to their texts. In some cases users will wish to have static results, in which case we can provide a mechanism for easily copying and pasting results that can be directly embedded in other content. However, much of the most compelling functionality of Voyant is interactive and requires considerable client-side scripting: our current approach is to provide a tiny snippet of HTML that is essentially an IFRAME that contains the necessary HTML elements. This approach allows Voyant code to remain separate from its host while satisfying security limitations of cross-browser scripting. There are of course other challenges inherent to code embedded elsewhere, including version management (supporting legacy syntax) and cacheing of data (both the corpus and results).\nReferenceability. The status of text analysis tools as academic resources has been a point of debate over the years. Scholars feel compelled to cite ideas and texts that come from other authors, but they are much less likely to recognized tools that have contributed to their work (and we would probably not want every scholar to cite search engines such as Google that have been used during research). We feel strongly that text analysis tools can represent a significant contributor to digital research, whether they were used to help confirm hunches or to lead the researcher into completely unanticipated realms. In any case, we have designed Voyant to be conducive to citation in various ways, including a general citation to Voyant and citations for static or dynamic results. An important component of academic knowledge is reproducibility, and providing scholars with more information on the processes followed during research \u2014 including the use of text analysis tools \u2014 is sure to be useful.\nUltimately, Voyant is an attempt to learn from the strengths and weaknesses of past tools, to recognize current user needs (ex: working with much larger corpora), and to anticipate future practices (ex: referencing text analysis tools and results). We believe that the potential for tools in the interpretive process merits continual rethinking of tool design and functionality, and as such, Voyant is of course a work in progress.\nPrivacy Statement\nThe developers of Voyant Tools gather data from the site about what tools are invoked and with what parameters (IP addresses are also logged in order to be able to identify multiple requests during a same session).

Computationally Identifying Intertextuality and Machine-Classifying Its Source in a Late Imperial Chinese Corpus,\u201d Paul Vierthaler employed a new approach to the well-established DH technique of stylometry, suggesting a way to identify where certain texts have supplied phrases that are inherited or borrowed in other texts.\nTo trace how the politically powerful Chinese eunuch Wei Zhongxian (1568-1627) is described across a large set of historical and fictional texts,\u00a0Vierthaler used a form of\u00a0stylometry that\u00a0he calls \"automated intertextuality detection.\"\u00a0 Hypothesizing that \"a\u00a0quote\u00a0should\u00a0look more like the text it came from than the rest of the text into which it is inserted,\"\u00a0Vierthaler then applied intertextuality detection across a corpus of texts sharing descriptions of Wei Zhongzian, finding that the machine correctly guessed which was the\u00a0origin quote and which was the borrowed quote in\u00a018 out of 19 shared quotes.\nVierthaler bases automated intertextuality detection\u00a0on BLAST,\u00a0a tool more commonly used in bioinformatics.\u00a0 When applied to Chinese texts,\u00a0he is able to establish\u00a0that two texts are either quoting from one another or quoting from the same source if the quote is at least ten characters long and at least 90% the same.\u00a0 While string-length\u00a0requirements vary for different languages, his technique can be used to identify textual reuse\u00a0across almost any text corpora.\u00a0\u00a0\nPaul Vierthaler's talk took place on Thursday, October 11, at the University of Virginia. On Oct. 12, Vierthaler led a workshop in which he demonstrated how participants could apply his stylometric method to their own textual corpora. Vierthaler's talk and workshop were sponsored by the Network/Corpus group of the Humanities Informatics Lab; the Institute of the Humanities and Global Cultures; Ron Hutchins, Vice President for IT; John Unsworth, Dean of the Library; Brie Gertler, Interim Associate Dean of Arts and Humanities in the Graduate School of Arts & Sciences; and Archie Holmes, Vice Provost for Academic Affairs.\u00a0\nPaul Vierthaler joined the Leiden Institute for Area Studies and Leiden University Centre for Linguistics in Fall 2016 to help found the Leiden University Centre for Digital Humanities, and he is a University Lecturer (Assistant Professor) of the Digital Humanities at Leiden University in the Netherlands.

Conference proposals are also due October 15 so we encourage you to apply to both!\nHASTAC Scholars is a student-centered network of PhD, Masters, and some undergraduate students who are interested in engaging the intersections of technology and learning. HASTAC Scholars apply this interest in varied ways, both in-person and online: by writing about their own work\u2014their research questions; by amplifying amazing things happening on their respective campuses and regions; and by helping to develop online conversations, hosting local events, and representing HASTAC at other events. Scholars organize Twitter chats and host webinars to share tools, expertise, and resources. Taken together, these activities provide opportunities not only to share knowledge with others, but also to learn from peers about various technologies and tools, all while gaining expertise in particular skill sets, such as in conducting interviews, writing reviews, and participating in other intellectual, artistic, or community-based conversations.\nAll graduate and undergraduate students are welcome to apply. Scholars who identify as members of historically underrepresented or marginalized groups are especially encouraged to apply, as are groups of students who are part of the same program. The application is not lengthy, and the program connects students with a valuable network of peers across the country.\nScholars will be admitted for a two-year cycle. During their second year, Scholars are encouraged to take on greater leadership and peer mentoring roles. We think that this extended timeline will go a long way toward building peer mentorship structures and keeping consistent activity and energy on the site year-round.\nWe are also delighted to welcome two people to the HASTAC Scholars leadership team:\n\nRaven Gomez, HASTAC Scholars Coordinator, Fall 2018\nAdashima Oyo, HASTAC Scholars Director beginning Spring 2019\n\nPlease don't hesitate to email us with any questions at scholars@hastac.org.\n", "Date": "Monday, October 15, 2018 - 12:00am", "Location": "online", "Related Link(s)": "HASTAC application form" } }, { "node": { "title": "Paul Vierthaler Workshop:  \u201cVisualizing Stylometric and Intertextual Relationships in Large Textual Corpora\u201d", "Body": "In this workshop, Paul will demonstrate how to perform and\u00a0visualize two important techniques for exploratory document analysis.

expand or collapse this sectionIn many elective courses, your instructor will provide a dataset.\u00a0\nFrom the papers of George Washington to archives of late nineteenth-century maps, there is online data available in every research area within the discipline. Your first step, then, is locating data that interests you. (Alternatively, you may have already have unique dataset of your own, or your instructor may provide a dataset.)\nRemember that data comes in all forms. It can be textual (books, ephemera, letters, manuscripts, newspapers, periodicals, and transcripts), visual (artworks, blueprints, illustrations, maps, photographs, or films), or auditory (music, recordings, and speeches).\nIf this is your first DH project, you might want to stick to one dataset or type, although there are some rich possibilities when you mix and match. For example, if you are investigating the national response to the Civil Rights Movement, you could gather datasets of American news articles and personal letters between key political figures, and compare the public and private conversations about the Movement. Once you have located your dataset(s), in most cases you should save it in a widely-accepted format (e.g. .csv, .txt, or .xml).\n\n\u00a0\n2. Select your research methodology.\nClick here to expand or collapse this sectionYour data type will largely determine your methodology. For example, if you are using map data, then visualization is a strong option. If you are analyzing linguistic changes over a period of time, however, then computational textual analysis is more fitting (although you may decide to visualize your results later on to highlight linguistic trends more clearly). Use the following diagram as a guide to decide what approach you want to take with your data:\n\n\u00a0\nFor certificate program students, this stage is a good time to approach your professor and Dr. Rennie Mapp for advice, and to submit an MoU about the type of DH project that you want to complete.\n\n\u00a0\n3. Choose your tool, and learn how to use it. \nClick here to expand or collapse this sectionYour next step is choosing a tool for your investigation, and then learning how to use it. Some tools that have been especially useful for past Historians are:\n\n\nVisualEyes: a platform that allows researchers to weave together different data types to create dynamic visualizations.\n\nMapScholar:\u00a0a platform that allows researchers to create visual atlases.\n\nFor more, you can consult our\u00a0list of Tools and Resources. (This is under construction.)\nAfter choosing your tool, familiarize yourself with its features, and check that the tool supports the data types that you have chosen.

Here's the\u00a0Quick-start checklist!\n\u25cf Identify your dataset \u25cf Select methodology \u25cf Choose your tool\u00a0 \u25cf Execute your project \u25cf Present your project\u00a0\u25cf\nDH Project Guidelines\n \n1. Identify a dataset (or datasets).\nIn many elective courses, your instructor will provide a dataset.\nFrom the papers of George Washington to archives of late nineteenth-century maps, there is online data available in every research area within the discipline. Your first step, then, is locating data that interests you. (Alternatively, you may have already have unique dataset of your own, or your instructor may provide a dataset.)\nRemember that data comes in all forms. It can be textual (books, ephemera, letters, manuscripts, newspapers, periodicals, and transcripts), visual (artworks, blueprints, illustrations, maps, photographs, or films), or auditory (music, recordings, and speeches).\nIf this is your first DH project, you might want to stick to one dataset or type, although there are some rich possibilities when you mix and match. For example, if you are investigating the national response to the Civil Rights Movement, you could gather datasets of American news articles and personal letters between key political figures, and compare the public and private conversations about the Movement. Once you have located your dataset(s), in most cases you should save it in a widely-accepted format (e.g. .csv, .txt, or .xml)\n \n2. Select your research methodology.\nYour data type will largely determine your methodology. For example, if you are using map data, then visualization is a strong option. If you are analyzing linguistic changes over a period of time, however, then computational textual analysis is more fitting (although you may decide to visualize your results later on to highlight linguistic trends more clearly). Use the following diagram as a guide to decide what approach you want to take with your data:\n\nFor certificate program students, this stage is a good time to approach your professor and Dr. Rennie Mapp for advice, and to submit an MoU about the type of DH project that you want to complete.\n \n3. Choose your tool, and learn how to use it. \nYour next step is choosing a tool for your investigation, and then learning how to use it. Two UVA-developed\u00a0tools that have been especially useful for past historians are:\n\n\nVisualEyes: a platform that allows researchers to weave together different data types to create dynamic visualizations.\n\n\nMapScholar:\u00a0a platform that allows researchers to create visual atlases.\n\n\nFor more, you can consult our\u00a0list of Tools and Resources. (This is under construction.)\nAfter choosing your tool, familiarize yourself with its features, and check that the tool supports the data types that you have chosen. Many digital tools often provide informative documentation or tutorials to help you through this stage, although you can also consult the DH Calendar to see if anyone is hosting a workshop on the tool that you have selected.\n \n4.

His dissertation, \u201cA Revolutionary Gospel: Secular Transpositions of Orthodox Narrative and the Post-Christian New Soviet Person (1905-1917)\u201d investigates how pro-revolution literature recontextualized elements of traditional Christian written culture (Bible, hagiographies, Church Fathers) to create a novel, secular cultural narrative for a post-revolutionary, post-Christian society. In addition to providing evidence for its literary arguments, the project aims to contribute a digital methodology and platform for understanding intertextuality and characterization in fiction using Machine/Deep Learning approaches.\nIn addition, he is currently working as a research assistant on Mapping Imagined Geographies of Revolutionary Russia (1914-1922), an IATH-supported project on changing place-based identity around the territories of the Russian Empire during World War I, the 1917 Russian Revolution, and the Russian Civil War. Aaron is also helping develop the first completely digital Russian-language textbook using the H5P suite of tools.

How, following Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw, are such practices intersectional? How do they correspond with what Grace Dillon calls Indigenous Futurisms?

As the profession has expanded, so have the subjects, which now encompass the sciences, medicine, philosophy, religion, and the arts as well.\nThe majority of editing done on ADE-associated projects is carried out by university-based editors, researchers, and faculty members. Some are multi-volume editions that are being compiled by full-time staffs, while others are solo projects.\nThe projects represented by the ADE are working to publish edited texts so that they can be more readily available and accessible, in the expectation that they will be then be widely used. The most common form of publication is the letterpress (book) edition, which ranges in scope from a highly selective single volume to more comprehensive projects that produce multi-volume sets. Virtually all of these editions, both the single and the multi-volume ones, are published by university presses. These editions consist of transcripts of the original documents, together with annotation to provide context.\nMost major university libraries have the majority of these volumes and sets. College libraries and larger public libraries are likely to have some of them. Finding sets of the microfilm editions may be more problematic, although many libraries can request both the microfilm and printed volumes from other repositories through the interlibrary loan service.\nAnother form of publication is image-based. In earlier years this generally meant microform, but increasingly such editions have been delivered on CD-ROM and the Internet. Image-based editions, usually not text-searchable, rely on context provided by the editors such as indexes or descriptions of the documents to locate relevant material.\nADE members are also working on a new generation of editions, delivered on the Internet that combine the strengths of both media. Some of these editions offer both image and transcribed documents, while others offer text-searchable versions of letterpress editions.\nSource:\u00a0https://www.documentaryediting.org/wordpress/?page_id=4\n\u00a0\n", "Content Type": "Organizations", "Home Page URL": "website for ADE", "Organization Type": "Non-UVa Organization" } }, { "node": { "title": "Center for Digital Editing", "Body": "We are continuously exploring\u00a0and developing\u00a0new resources and insights as they relate to the following four elements: research and development, engagement, project consultation and development, and education. \u00a0As a result, the CDE provides a\u00a0distinct concentration of resources, knowledge, and solutions essential to the conceptualization and development of digital editing projects as well as advancement of the field.\n", "Content Type": "Organizations", "Home Page URL": "Center for Digital Editing Website", "Organization Type": "UVa Organization" } }, { "node": { "title": "Conference in Spain:  Technological Ecosystems for Enhancing Multiculturality", "Body": "The 6th\u00a0edition of the\u00a0Technological Ecosystems for Enhancing Multiculturality\u00a0(TEEM) conference will be held at Salamanca, Spain, from\u00a0October 24 to 26, 2018.

Some projects catalogue and share oral histories, others analyze historical social networks, and still others build databases of artifacts from art history or archeology. Other strengths at UVA lie in photogrammetry of cultural heritage sites such as the Lawn, large-scale histories such as the Civil War, and bibliographies of printed books or documents.\u00a0 Some practitioners at UVA develop algorithms to analyze digitized texts, and others collaborate with students on annotated, authoritative online editions of literary works.\u00a0 \nDH Examples: Humanists from many departments at UVa have implemented innovative digital approaches to their own subject areas in collaboration with computer scientists and technologists. This history of practical success will serve as a foundation for graduate student recruitment and education. For example, Collective Biographies of Women (CBW)\u2014an ongoing, NEH-funded project arising from the collaboration of an English department faculty member with computational experts at two of UVa\u2019s DH units as well as graduate student research teams\u2014utilizes database and XML markup technologies to produce new insights into short-form biographical narratives of women.\u00a0 Another example is Jefferson\u2019s University\u2026the early life (JUEL), which combines the expertise of faculty from the history, computer science, art history, and architectural history departments, has employed a large number of graduate research assistants, and depends on 3D modeling and database technologies to provide insights into the day-to-workings of the Academical Village in its early years. A further example is the Tibetan Himalayan Library, which originated at UVa in 2000 as a collaboration between a religious studies professor, the Library, and a DH unit, and now promotes the global, interdisciplinary integration of knowledge and communities of expertise about the Tibetan plateau and southern Himalayan regions.

These conditions present an opportunity to\u00a0explore\u00a0the capacity of mass-digitized collections to transform how we approach and understand literary history.\u00a0Analyzing Trove uncovered more than 21,000 novels, novellas, and short stories published in Australian newspapers between 1865 and 1914. This fiction encompasses canonical works, alongside many hundreds of previously unrecorded titles, and represents titles from around the world, with extensive publication of British, Australian, and American stories, significant amounts of French and German literature in translation, as well as fiction from as far afield as Austria, Canada, Holland, Japan, South Africa, Sweden, Russia, and beyond.\nBode\u2019s research considers the new insights into past literary cultures, as well as the new practices for present and future literary history, that mass-digitized collections enable. She first explores how these discoveries expand the transnational history of American literature, by investigating the publication and reception of American fiction in 19th-century\u00a0Australia. Bode then suggests new research practices that mass-digitized collections necessitate and enable for literary history. In her lecture, she will focus on the approaches to data required of literary history in the digital age, as well as the new collaborations and publics for literary history that data-rich research makes possible.\n\u00a0\nAbout Katherine Bode\nKatherine Bode is Associate Professor of Literary and Textual Studies in the School of Literature, Languages, and Linguistics at the Australian National University in Canberra.

Of course, repurposing is not unique to the Caribbean, but it does happen with a certain degree of obstinacy and persistence that it can be considered a strong enough cultural resistance to planned obsolescence. In addition, we never backed away from understanding the legacies of the plantation society and still struggle with it. Scholars understand the role in which these plantation societies were themselves socio-technical developments that involved industrial machinery, labor management, and explicit violence. We operate in a world where violence is now hidden, but it is still apparent within seemingly gentle working environments. Caribbean scholars can see things like this because they are steeped in a history that perpetuates itself in the strangest ways until today.\n\u2013 Alex Gil for HASTAC\n* \u00a0 \u00a0 * \u00a0 \u00a0 *\n\nNathan H. Dize\u00a0is\u00a0a PhD student in the Department of French and Italian at Vanderbilt University where he specializes in Haitian theater, poetry, and revolutionary poetics during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In 2014-2015, Nathan was a lecteur d\u2019anglais in the Centre de Langues at the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure de Lyon where he taught Master 1 and 2 courses in 21st Century World Literature as well as courses on written expression and TOEFL preparation. At Vanderbilt, Nathan teaches introductory French language and is a teaching assistant for introductory Haitian Creole. Nathan\u2019s other areas of specialization are Digital Humanities and Translation Studies. He is a content curator, translator, and editor of\u00a0A Colony in Crisis: The Saint-Domingue Grain Shortage of 1789.\u00a0 He is also the co-editor of the H-Haiti series \u201cHaiti in Translation.\u201d Nathan has published articles, reviews, and translations in journals such as\u00a0sx archipelagos, the Journal of Haitian Studies, Contemporary French Civilization, and\u00a0sx salon.\nMy entry-point into the Digital Humanities (DH) was by way of the plantation society of colonial Haiti. Trained in French Studies, I first saw the machinery, tools, and technologies to which Alex refers as elements of Diderot and Dalembert\u2019s Encyclop\u00e9die, as visual representations of violence and colonialism. It was not until we began working on\u00a0A Colony in Crisis: The Saint-Domingue Grain Shortage of 1789\u00a0that I began to fully grapple with the written archive of French slavery. By building this site, through project design and collaboration, DH became for us the means of \u2018repurposing\u2019 a French language archive to tell a Caribbean story.\u00a0Working as an undergraduate student, I saw the elements of the archive from a unique perspective. I was in charge of compiling the spreadsheet to catalogue the 12,000 pamphlets in the archive for the project entitled \u201cRevealing La R\u00e9volution\u201d; essentially, I saw the Haitian Revolution eclipsed by the French first-hand. Our goal from the beginnings of A Colony in Crisis was to intervene in 18th century French Studies to recount Haitian history. DH was our vehicle for critique, decolonization, and access to archival power. To achieve these three aspirations, we sought to bring the archive to as many people as possible in translation\u2013\u2013this started out as French to English and has since shifted to translation in Haitian Creole.\u00a0As a literature student my only exposure to primary source work was with Laurent Dubois and John Garrigus\u2019s\u00a0Slave Revolution in the Caribbean, a volume that brought together some of the most important primary and secondary sources in Caribbean history from the Code Noir to Haitian independence. With the non-historian reader in mind, we sought to translate and curate the colonial archive of Haiti in order to involve as many people as possible in the telling of this tale. The open-access website enables anyone with an Internet connection access to professionally curated content and historical sources.\u00a0For me personally, the Digital Humanities gave me a field; it introduced me to Haitian Studies. Interfacing with reviewers, sharing work and references via email and Twitter, was how I met most of the invitees to this very conference. In a sense, DH oriented me towards the field of Haitian Studies as a result of collaborative co-working. The Digital Humanities is, for me, the 21st iteration of konbit.

Her research focuses on the early independence period in Haiti and seeks to understand the connections between Haiti and other Atlantic colonies, countries, and empires in the early 19th century. She is the author of\u00a0Haitian Connections in the Atlantic World\u00a0(2015), winner of the Mary Alice and Philip Boucher Book Prize, French Colonial Historical Society in 2016, and is the editor of\u00a0The Haitian Declaration of Independence\u00a0(2016).\u00a0She is the editor of the website\u00a0Haiti and the Atlantic World.\u00a0@JuliaGaffield\nIn\u00a0Silencing the Past: Power and the Production of History\u00a0(1995), Michel-Rolph Trouillot posited that historical silencing occurs at four moments in the production of historical narratives. Each of these moments represents an instance of historical violence in \u201cseemingly gentle working environments,\u201d to use Alex Gil\u2019s phrasing: 1) when sources are created, 2) when these sources are collected in archives, 3) when the sources are retrieved from the archives by researchers, and 4) the moment of retrospective significance (making history). Today, all four are increasingly becoming digital moments that amplify their consequences in multiple ways. Moreover, new technologies are foregrounding a fifth important moment of silencing of the past and that is the preservation and accessibility\u2014or lack thereof\u2014of the archives. Which nations or communities get to preserve and make available, physically and virtually, their historical record? Whose sources are beautifully preserved in acid-free boxes and digitized according to international standards? Whose records are organized and made accessible at repositories and online? And whose evidence gets literally eaten by bugs, destroyed by fire, lost in earthquakes before any work is done to ensure their future? Whose history is uncataloged and therefore inaccessible to scholars and to publics because of chronic underfunding? As illustrated by the example of Haiti in the larger context of archives in the Atlantic World, digital technologies offer unprecedented ways both to lessen and increase these disparities, thereby profoundly affecting the \u201cretrospective significance\u201d of each historical narrative.\n\u00a0\nMarlene L. Daut\u00a0specializes in early Caribbean, 19th-century African American, and early modern French colonial literary and historical studies. Her first book,\u00a0Tropics of Haiti: Race and the Literary History of the Haitian Revolution in the Atlantic World, 1789-1865, was published in 2015 by Liverpool University Press' Series in the Study of International Slavery. Her second book,\u00a0Baron de Vastey and the Origins of Black Atlantic Humanism, appeared in fall 2017 from Palgrave Macmillan\u2019s series in the New Urban Atlantic. She is \u00a0also working on a collaborative project entitled,\u00a0An Anthology of Haitian Revolutionary Fictions (Age of Slavery). Daut is the co-creator and co-editor of H-Net Commons\u2019 digital platform,\u00a0H-Haiti, and she has developed an online bibliography of fictions of the Haitian Revolution from 1787 to 1900 at the website\u00a0http://haitianrevolutionaryfictions.com.\u00a0@FictionsofHaiti\nThe vast majority of the books about Haiti published outside of Haiti today are about the Haitian Revolution (1791-1804) or about the U.S. Occupation (1915-1934). What this means is that those looking to learn about Haiti have comparatively few opportunities to encounter the Haiti and Haitians who sit between the Revolution and the Occupation. Although, on its face this may seem benign, what this has meant for scholarship produced outside of Haiti (and in the popular imagination) is that we are often incapable of fully thinking about the kind of Haiti where Haitians appear as people, individuals, with political dreams and desires all their own. In other words, a Haiti that is not over-determined by its past colonial relationship to France or to its future/current neo-colonial subjugation in the U.S. and European world-systems.\nBut we have arguably never found ourselves in a better position to think about Haiti\u2019s development and contribution to the history of\u00a0American\u00a0hemispheric sovereignty. In 1983, David Geggus penned an article entitled, \u201cUnexploited Sources for the History of the Haitian Revolution.\u201d In this article Geggus focused upon describing the \u201cvast quantity of neglected manuscript material [in Spain, Great Britain, the Caribbean, and the United States] that concerns\u201d what he called, \u201cthis unique and profound event.\u201d Archival recovery work of the stripe that Geggus promoted so long ago is as equally critical to preserving, learning from, and contributing to the archive of Haitian sovereignty, or Haiti after the Revolution, as it has been for Haitian revolutionary studies.\nArchival work, then, is crucial work, but it is also dangerous work:\nAbdul JanMohamed and David Lloyd have written that \u201cArchival work, [i]s a form of counter-memory that is essential to the critical articulation of minority discourse.\u201d However, because archives, like other kinds of texts, reflect the worldview of both their creators and those who write about them/use them as sources, the archivist working to articulate \u201cminority discourse\u201d must be careful not to reproduce patterns of domination or cultural exploitation (to use with much irony the word from the title of Geggus\u2019 essay).\nFor Haiti, this means that we must work against the idea that the abundant historical resources now made readily (and often freely) available by various digitization projects (including HATHI Trust, Gale\u2019s Slavery and Anti-Slavery Database, BNF, BPL, archive.org), means that Haiti represents \u201chistory\u2019s new frontier\u201d for research, to quote Philippe Girard. Seeing Haiti as a \u201cfrontier,\u201d not only calls forth the terrible legacy of the conquest of the Americas, but encourages the notion that the country is \u201copen for business\u201d (of course, this is the language of Haitian president Michel Martelly), reflecting the economics of disaster capitalism that have so plagued Haiti in the twentieth century, and especially since the 2010 earthquake.\u00a0(Indeed, Bloomberg TV aired a special on January 12, 2015, called\u00a0Haiti: Open for Business?).\u00a0 In\u00a0 her remarks at the 28th annual meeting of the Haitian Studies Association in Montr\u00e9al, Canada, Nad\u00e8ve M\u00e9nard astutely reminded us, however, that Haiti has always been open for business where the world powers are concerned.\nThinking about how to approach this vast archival terrain with respect for the peoples and cultures of Haiti as I complete my own digital archiving projects (see,\u00a0http://lagazetteroyale.com) has led me to think about and question the vocabulary that we are using to describe this moment in Haitian studies (where the digital collides with renewed interest in Haiti) and how our efforts (those of outside of Haiti, I mean) to illuminate Haitian contributions to the world-system might be framed differently, so as to generate new, decolonial ideas about Haiti rather than merely rehashing the age-old, colonial ones.\n", "Date": "Thursday, April 12, 2018 - 4:00pm to 5:30pm", "Location": "Minor Hall", "Related Link(s)": "Enduring Questions, New Methods: Haitian Studies in the 21st Century", "Sponsoring Organization(s)": "Institute of the Humanities and Global Cultures, Carter G.

Benjamin Gorham, DH Prototyping Fellow\n\n\tBen is a doctoral candidate in the Mediterranean Art and Archaeology program of the McIntire Department of Art and Architectural History, completing his dissertation on non-elite houses and urbanism at Pompeii under the guidance of Professor John Dobbins. A lifelong student of Classical languages, history, culture, and art, Ben took his BA in Classics from UNC-Chapel Hill in 2008 and his MA in Classical Archaeology from the University of Arizona in 2012. Over the past decade Ben has worked on excavations throughout Italy, including the Etruscan site of Poggio Civitate, the Roman cities of Pompeii and Ostia, as well as the Hellenistic city of Morgantina in Sicily. He is also one of the founding members of the Ostia Connectivity Project, examining social connectivity of the cult landscape of Rome\u2019s port city, and has worked with the Harvard Yard Archaeological Project, building 3D models of active trenches to be used by undergraduates both in the classroom and in Augmented Reality platforms on campus. At UVA, Ben is a Jefferson Fellow of Art History, and helps represents the University of Virginia at the Archaeological Institute of America as a member of the Geospatial Interest Group.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\tBen\u2019s Project Incubator Fellowship is a two-parter. In pursuit of rounding out his dissertation work, Ben has transformed his GIS data and cartography of Pompeii into a webmap through consultation with our GIS specialists. This map details the long-overlooked number of non-elite, or middle- and lower-class houses which made up the lion\u2019s share of the city\u2019s urban composition, and identifies never-before-seen patterns of clustering and dispersal that indicate discrete neighborhoods throughout the ancient city. In pursuit of his excavation work and aided by the expertise of the Scholars\u2019 Lab\u2019s own 3D specialists, Ben has also built a Virtual Reality experience of the agora at Morgantina, drawing on the work of multiple teams on site to recreate the city\u2019s marketplace as it would have been in the 4th Century BCE. This platform provides an innovative space in which to visualize the ancient world and embed short lessons about archaeology and Greek life for students and amateurs alike.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\tJoseph Thompson, DH Prototyping Fellow\n\n\tJoey Thompson is a PhD candidate in 20th Century U.S. history. His dissertation, \u201cSounding Southern: Music, Militarism, and the Making of the Sunbelt,\u201d uses popular music to analyze the cultural and political impact of the military-industrial complex on the U.S. South after World War II. He argues that music offers a way to hear people working out the meanings of race, politics, and region in response to the South\u2019s economic reliance on defense spending as it transformed pockets of the Deep South and Southwest into islands of white Sunbelt prosperity. \u201cSounding Southern\u201d follows a variety of performers, from the nationalistic themes of Cold War country music singers to the revolutionary politics of Gil Scott-Heron, to reveal how different artists and genres have voiced ways for audiences to imagine their relationship to the defense spending strategies that remade the nation\u2019s political culture in the late twentieth century.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\tThrough the Digital Humanities Prototyping Fellowship, he has experimented with ways to integrate sound and spatial analysis for public history projects.

Max Edelson\nHistory\nThis seminar-based workshop introduces advanced undergraduate and graduate students to a variety of methods and platforms for digital research featuring geospatial data. Students will contribute to a common research project as they learn geospatial visualization methods using ArcGIS Online, MapScholar, Neatline, and VisualEyes. Tutorials with visualization experts, discussions of common readings, and independent projects will be featured. Prerequisite: Graduate student or College 3rd or 4th year.\n\nSpring 2019\n\nDigital Literary Studies\nAlison Booth and Brandon Walsh\nEnglish\nHow do you measure a book? Can machines read? Do we read prose texts now the way people read them in 1919 or in 1819? We are swimming in textual data that could change our understanding of the written word - if you have the right tools and know how to access and work with it. What could you learn to do with all these different forms of textuality, with all this data? Can you find connections between your current interests in literature and the perspectives that technology opens up, or the goals of your career? This course is meant to give you practice with a variety of methods and real-world scenarios to help you participate in digital projects, using both prepared materials and your own. The course fulfills an elective in the Graduate Certificate in Digital Humanities (DH). We want to introduce you to literary computational methods as part of digital humanities, no matter what previous familiarity you might have. You will find any of your previous studies of literature highly relevant and useful for participating in this course. No one needs to be or to become a programmer. You will begin with your own interests and skills and help us encounter, together, specific methods of digital reading or ways to analyze and visualize the data of texts, including topic modeling and XML markup. There is room in our plans for us to consider how our methods could be applied for selected writers or literary works or genres that you want to write about or work on, or that you have encountered in other courses or personal reading. A focus on literary DH in this course doesn\u2019t cover the entire spectrum of possibilities for digital research. We hope you will be interested to inquire further, and follow your paths with different tools and methods beyond this course.\n\nExploratory Text Analytics\nRafael Alvarado\nData Science\nExploratory text analytics concerns the application of computational and statistical methods to the interpretation of large collections of digitized written documents. The field is motivated by the research of scholars from the humanities and human sciences interested in understanding the semantic, cultural, and social dimensions of texts from historical and contemporary sources, such as novels, newspapers, and social media. The course comprises three main sections: (1) an overview of text interpretation theory combined with information theory to introduce the domain knowledge required for making inferences in this area; (2) a hands-on introduction to methods for converting unstructured textual content into both graph and vector-space representations; and (3) the application and discussion of algorithms from natural language processing and text mining approaches, including term frequency measures, topic models, and sentiment analyses, to address the classic problems of text classification and clustering as well as new areas, such as social event detection, computational narratology, and data-driven approaches to structuralist poetics. There are no hard prerequisites for the course, but students should be comfortable with combining qualitative and quantitative approaches, have some experience programming in Python, and be familiar with basic statistics and probability theory.\n\nHacking for Humanists\nBrad Pasanek\nThis is a course for English majors (and other students) that introduces the basics of computer programming, text analysis, text encoding, and statistics as experimental methodologies that promote new kinds of reading and interpretation. The aim is to move from \u201ccomputation into criticism.\u201d We\u2019ll work, primarily, with a Shakespeare play, poetry by William Blake, and a Jane Austen novel. Students will find these works at the bookstore alongside manuals on Text analysis in R. NO prior familiarity with coding required; indeed, advanced computer science majors are discouraged from applying, as they will likely find the professor\u2019s halting and lame way with the algorithmic course content comic at best. The term \u2018hacking\u201d, the humanist will note, has to apposite senses at least.\n\u00a0\n\nColonial British America\nS. Max Edelson\nHistory\nThis colloquium offers an introduction to themes, regions, and debates in the history of colonial and Revolutionary America. It will focus on colonization, development, and cultural encounter in early North America, West Indies, and the Atlantic World in the early modern period, ca. 1600-1800, from a variety of historical approaches. The instructor is open to digital projects, especially those that focus on geospatial visualization.\n\nA Critical Approach to Digital Humanities\nLisa Reilly\nArchitectural History\n\u00a0\n\nFall 2018\n\nThe Making of Sacred Spaces\nFoteini Kondyli\nDepartment of Art and Art History\nThis course explores the nature of sacred spaces and processes involved in their construction. While our case studies are primarily from the Mediterranean, we take a cross-cultural perspective to better appreciate how sacred spaces reflect both universal and culturally-specific characteristics. We focus on the study of sacred geography and the role of monumentality, performance and memory to explore how sacred spaces were conceptualized and experienced by different social groups. Students will complete digital projects, including digital mapping and 3D modeling and printing applications\n\nDigital Caribbean Studies\nMarlene Daut\nCarter G Woodson/ American Studies\nIncreasingly, we access, share, and create information in digital forms, and this has been referred to as a digital revolution. But how does \u2014 or how should \u2014 this revolution in the way we teach, learn, and conduct research also change the way we do scholarly work in the classroom? The digital humanities investigates how new media and digital tools are changing the way we produce knowledge in the humanities, by enabling us to share not only information, but sound, visualizations, and even performances using new platforms. This class will provide an introduction to some of these formats and tools, along with immediate critical reflection and discussion about their value to the academy. Since information technology has become one of the key ways in which the peoples of the Caribbean and its diasporas both communicate with one another and gain access to global conversations, alongside this exploration of digital tools, in general, this class will likewise study how the internet can help people in marginalized spaces to engage with crucial social problems and to express their political ideals and aspirations. As the creators of the Digital Caribbean website have attested, \u201cthe Internet is analogous in important ways to the Caribbean itself as dynamic and fluid cultural space: it is generated from disparate places and by disparate peoples; it challenges fundamentally the geographical and physical barriers that disrupt or disallow connection; and it places others in relentless relation.\u201d This class will therefore both introduce students to the digital humanities and to the Caribbean as an apt space for exploring the potential of the internet to confront and disrupt many of the more traditional structures of dominance that have traditionally silenced marginalized voices.\n\nSustainable Local Economies\nSuzanne Moomaw\nUrban and Environmental Planning\n\u00a0\n" } }, { "node": { "title": "Heurist", "Body": "\n\tFrom the website:\u00a0\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\tHEURIST\u2019s research-driven data management system allows any confident researcher or data manager to design, create, manage, analyse and publish their own richly-structured database(s) within hours, through a simple web interface, without the need of programmers or consultants.\n\n\t\u00a0 Use Sydney University\u2019s free service to build a new database in minutes and a complete application in hours.

Woodson Institute for African-American and African Studies", "Body": "\n\tFounded in 1981, the University of Virginia's Carter G. Woodson Institute for African-American and African Studies is named in honor of native Virginian Carter Godwin Woodson. Born in 1875 in Buckingham County to parents who were formerly enslaved, Woodson went on to earn a Ph.D. in History at Harvard University in 1912, only the second African-American to receive a Harvard doctorate, his predecessor being the eminent scholar, W.E.B. DuBois. Woodson was instrumental in bringing professional recognition to the study of African-American history during a period when most historians held the opinion that African Americans were a people without history. He founded the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History in 1915 (later to be re-named the Association for the Study of African American Life and History) and its scholarly journal, The Journal of Negro History (now the Journal of African-American History), in 1916. Under his leadership, Negro History Week (now Black History Month) was inaugurated in the United States as an annual celebration of African-American achievement.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\tThe Woodson Institute's founding director, historian Armstead L. Robinson, began his tenure with a two-fold mandate: to enhance the research and teaching of African-American Studies in the schools and departments of the University of Virginia and to establish an African-American Studies Research Center which would make important contributions to scholarship and learning at this major southern university. Since its inception, the Institute has promoted interdisciplinary and collaborative research and interpretation of the African and African-American experience in a global context. The Woodson Institute administers the undergraduate major/minor degree in African-American and African Studies (AAS). This program offers students the opportunity to explore African and African American studies in an interdisciplinary curriculum, raising awareness of its significance as an integrated area of study and of its key role in transforming the face of the U. S. Higher Education over the past quarter century. We also offer a Distinguished Majors Program (DMP) for fourth-year students who wish to conduct intensive research culminating in a thesis, and sponsor limited opportunities for study abroad in Africa. The program's minor in African Studies (AS) was initiated in 2007.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\tThrough its internationally acclaimed residential fellowship program, the Woodson Institute offers Pre- and Post-doctoral scholars pursuing research of topical interest a diverse intellectual community promoting scholarly exchange and support. Selected through an intense international competition, the Woodson fellows are a diverse group of young scholars from different disciplines in the humanities and social sciences who work on a wide array of topics in African American and African Studies and related fields. Over the course of its twenty-five year history, the Institute has sponsored more than 125 scholars whose work has appeared in numerous books and articles published by the foremost university presses and academic journals. In addition to advancing the research goals of the Institute, the presence of these fellows has enriched the number and range of course offerings available within the undergraduate curriculum and has been instrumental in faculty recruitment at U.Va.\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\tGoing forward, our primary goal at the Carter G. Woodson Institute is to continue the pioneering work of our namesake through an active program of undergraduate teaching and curriculum development; original interdisciplinary research; institutional and financial support of scholars (while the institute assists in securing appointments for Visiting Scholars, we are currently unable to provide financial support for such appointments.); conferences and colloquia; publications and public outreach projects.\n", "Content Type": "Organizations", "Home Page URL": "Carter G Woodson Institute for African-American and African Studies", "Organization Type": "UVa Department" } }, { "node": { "title": "AAS 3500-001 Digital Caribbean Studies", "Body": "Increasingly, we access, share, and create information in digital forms, and this has been referred to as a digital revolution.

It will also provide a prototype for similar analysis for other medieval sites as well as the architecture of other times and places. It will begin with a case study of Southwell Minster to explore the feasibility and utility of this type of modeling for the study of medieval architecture.\nSouthwell Minster is typical of many English medieval churches in combining building fabric from a variety of periods. At Southwell, the Norman east end was replaced by Archbishop Walter de Grey of York (1216-55), an ambitious architectural patron who may have sought to increase the prestige of Southwell though the construction of a larger and more up to date east end. Later medieval architecture in England, commonly referred to as Gothic, is usually in the form of a later addition to an earlier Romanesque building. The earlier building may possibly be damaged due to fire; tower collapse or, as at Southwell, the patron may simply have sought an updated appearance for part of the building. Usually this modernization takes place in the east end of the building, its liturgical focus. Elsewhere the Gothic fabric may be the final stage of a prolonged building campaign. While the fact that Gothic architecture in England is chiefly represented by additions to Romanesque buildings is widely acknowledged, the implications of this piece of information for the design process have not been analyzed.\n", "Content Type": "Projects", "Featured Image": { "src": "https://dh-dev.library.virginia.edu/system/files/Dixon_Drawing_A3aSmb_large.jpg", "alt": "Ground plan of Southwell Minster." }, "Project URL": "English Medieval Architecture", "Sponsoring Organization(s)": "IATH" } }, { "node": { "title": "Silk Road: The Path of Transmission of Avalokitesvara", "Body": "The Silk Road is a network of trade routes that provided a bridge between the east and the west.

Unlike most presidential homes, Montpelier had undergone extensive changes. In the 140 years since Dolley Madison sold Montpelier in 1844, stucco was applied to the home's brick exterior, interior walls were moved, large additions were built and extensive changes were made to the landscape. Yet throughout all of these changes the core of the Madisons' home survived. To unravel Montpelier's construction history, an intensive investigation was undertaken in 2001 and demonstrated that the home that James Madison knew could be authentically restored. Based on this study, and nearly 20 years of experience attempting to present Montpelier's history to the visiting public, the Montpelier Foundation and the National Trust jointly determined that the home should be restored. The work was finished in 2009, revealing the historic exterior and interior of James Madison's Montpelier again after over 150 years. Significantly, the restored Montpelier now functions as a historic museum that allows the public to achieve a deeper understanding of Madison and his contributions by experiencing the home he helped design.\nThrough the restoration project, the Montpelier Foundation accumulated one of the largest digital archives of data relating to the restoration of a historic site ever assembled and one of the first to be entirely digital. The archive includes over 80,000 digital photos; scans of historic maps and photographs; over 1,000 digital measured drawings; tens of thousands of pages of text documents; over 100 gigabytes of cloud point data; and over 500 gigabytes of digital video.

It also offers great opportunities in each of these areas. New media enable oration, graphics, objects, and even embodied performance to supplement existing forms of scholarly production as well as to constitute entirely original platforms. Textual artifacts have been rendered literally and figuratively three-dimensional; opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration have expanded exponentially; information has been made more accessible and research made more efficient on multiple levels. Scholars are called upon, with some urgency, to adapt their research and pedagogical methods to an academic climate deluged by a superabundance of information and analysis. This has created opportunities for open-ended and multiform engagements, interactive and continually updating archives and other databases, cartographic applications that enrich places with historical information, and online dialogues with peers and the public.\nThe need for such engagements is especially immediate among the people of the Caribbean and its diasporas. Information technology has become an increasingly significant part of the way that people frame pressing social problems and political aspirations. Moreover, the Internet is analogous in important ways to the Caribbean itself as dynamic and fluid cultural space: it is generated from disparate places and by disparate peoples; it challenges fundamentally the geographical and physical barriers that disrupt or disallow connection; and it places others and elsewheres in relentless relation.\u00a0Yet while we celebrate these opportunities for connectedness, we also must make certain that the\u00a0digital\u00a0realm undermine and confront rather than re-inscribe forms of\u00a0silencing\u00a0and\u00a0exclusion\u00a0in the\u00a0Caribbean.\nFollowing on our\u00a02014,\u00a02015, and\u00a02016\u00a0events, the panel presentations and discussions that comprise this iteration of \u201cThe Caribbean Digital\u201d further\u00a0reflects on the challenges and opportunities presented by the media technologies that evermore intensely reconfigure the social and geo-political\u00a0contours of the Caribbean and its diasporas. Presenters consider, specifically, the affordances and limitations of the digital with respect to their particular methodologies, disciplines, and passions.\n", "Date": "Friday, December 1, 2017 - 9:00am to 7:00pm", "Location": "The Colonnade Club (Thursday) and The Inn at Darden (Friday)", "Related Link(s)": "Schedule for Digital Caribbean IV, Digital Caribbean IV homepage", "Event Type": "Conference, Panel" } }, { "node": { "title": "The Countryside Transformed: The Railroad and the Eastern Shore of Virginia 1870-1935", "Body": "\"The Countryside Transformed: The Railroad and the Eastern Shore of Virginia, 1870-1935\" is a digital archive of maps, photographs, manuscripts, newspapers, public documents, and other media. \"The Countryside Transformed\" shows how the coming in 1884 of the railroad to the counties of Accomack and Northampton profoundly changed the physical and mental landscapes in which the people of the region lived, worked, and traveled.\n\"The Countryside Transformed: The Railroad and the Eastern Shore of Virginia, 1870-1935\" is a collaborative effort of the Eastern Shore Public Library and the Virginia Center for Digital History of the University of Virginia.

The ruins of the Chaco Culture National Historical Park hold great meaning and importance to many Native American groups of the Southwest as ancestral sites. Having stood the test of time, the ruins of Chaco Canyon entered the broader public consciousness in the late nineteenth century as a vivid symbol of the cultural resources of the United States. In June of 2002, a group of southwestern archaeologists met to examine the potential for creating an on-line Chaco research archive to significantly enhance our ability to answer key research questions by improving access to the full record of surveys and excavations. It was envisioned as a \u201cvirtual\u201d collection of the scattered Chaco information, to be integrated in a manner such that scholars could more easily assemble the types of data most relevant to a variety of important research issues. Through generous funding from the Andrew Mellon Foundation, the mission of chacoarchive.org is to ensure that the early archaeological research records are preserved for and accessible to future generations.

Few, if any Christians, however, have gone to the lengths or the literalism of Mormonism in comprehending salvation within kinship and investing kin with priestly saving powers. Among first generation of Latter-day Saints especially, marital \"sealings\" and spiritual adoption rites created large families that became a pervasive, if not permanent, feature of social interaction.\nUsing computational techniques, this project analyzes early Mormonism's construction of extended kinship ties through temple marriage and adoption practices. The goal of the project is to represent digitally the inner logic of early Mormon polygamy, its familial order and gendered meanings. The resulting database will be publicly accessible for scholarly research. Ultimately, our hope is that providing the means to analyze the social facts of early Mormon \"plural marriages,\" as well as the tribe-like families they created, will contribute to a better understanding of American marital and domestic norms. Specifically, it is hoped that these same computational techniques will encourage the representation and analysis of the variety of alternative marriage practices sponsored by radical religious and utopian economic communities in ante-bellum America.\n", "Content Type": "Projects", "Featured Image": { "src": "https://dh-dev.library.virginia.edu/system/files/NauvooTemple.jpg", "alt": "Photo of Nauvoo Temple" }, "Project URL": "Early Mormon Marriage", "Sponsoring Organization(s)": "IATH", "Technical Approach": "database" } }, { "node": { "title": "Voting Viva Voce: Unlocking the Social Logic of Past Politics", "Body": "This website explores the lives of the residents of two nineteenth century American cities: Alexandria, Virginia in 1860 and Newport, Kentucky in 1870.

We studied data and models associated with multi-label object classification and visual semantic role labeling, and found that (a) datasets for these tasks contain significant gender bias and (b) models trained on these datasets amplify those bias.\nFor example, the activity cooking is over 33% more likely to involve females than males in a training set, and a trained model further increases the disparity to 68% at test time. We propose adding corpus-level constraints that calibrate existing structured prediction models and designing an algorithm based on Lagrangian relaxation for collective inference. Our method results in almost no performance loss for the underlying recognition task but decreases the magnitude of bias amplification by 47.5% and 40.5% for multi-label classification and visual semantic role labeling, respectively.\n", "Date": "Friday, December 8, 2017 - 2:00pm to 3:00pm", "Featured Image": { "src": "https://dh-dev.library.virginia.edu/system/files/Tianlu.jpg", "alt": "" }, "Location": "Alderman 421", "Sponsoring Organization(s)": "IATH, Scholars' Lab, SHANTI", "Event Type": "Lecture" } }, { "node": { "title": " to Cities Without Work: The Long Road from Boom to Bust by Interested", "I am connected to:": "Cities Without Work: The Long Road from Boom to Bust", "Instructor": "John Alexander", "My connection type is:": "Interested" } }, { "node": { "title": " to English Department by Student", "I am connected to:": "English Department", "Instructor": "Christian Howard", "My connection type is:": "Student, graduate" } }, { "node": { "title": " to Circulating Spaces: Podcast Series  by Principal Investigator", "I am connected to:": "Circulating Spaces: Podcast Series ", "Instructor": "Christian Howard", "My connection type is:": "Principal Investigator" } }, { "node": { "title": "Gerald Roche Lecture: New Views of Tibet's Linguistic Diversity", "Body": "Tuesday,\n        December 5, 2017 4:00 PM\n          -\n        5:30 PM\n\n        Where: Nau Hall 342; ;  \n\n        Cost: Free\n\n        Description: Gerald Roche will present his current research in a talk entitled \u201cNew Views of Tibet\u2019s Linguistic Diversity.\u201d\nResearch on Tibet\u2019s linguistic diversity in the West dates back to at least the mid-nineteenth century.

However, the use of topic models remains narrowly conceived, and the method continues to raise epistemological concerns. In this presentation, Prof. Alvarado will demonstrate an interactive topic model browser designed to address one of these concerns, the problem of topic reference. \u00a0Do topics refer to anything in the world, such as collective representations, or do they merely provide a convenient means of dimensionality reduction for users of large text databases? Drawing from various corpora, including online newspapers of various nationalist movements, he will present some conclusions on how to make sense of topics and how we might integrate these models into scholarly arguments.\n*In natural language processing,\u00a0latent Dirichlet allocation\u00a0(LDA) is a generative statistical model that allows sets of observations to be explained by unobserved groups that explain why some parts of the data are similar.\n", "Date": "Friday, November 3, 2017 - 1:30pm to 2:30pm", "Location": "Alderman Library 317 (west wing)", "Related Link(s)": "link to DSI event page", "Sponsoring Organization(s)": "IATH", "Event Type": "Lecture" } }, { "node": { "title": "Coding Studio LInks", "Body": "https://code.org/\n", "Content Type": "Resources" } }, { "node": { "title": " to English Department by Alum", "I am connected to:": "English Department", "Instructor": "Rennie Mapp", "My connection type is:": "Alum" } }, { "node": { "title": "Postponed--DH@UVa Code Studio: Getting Started with Python for the Digital Humanities", "Body": "\n\tIt doesn't matter how rudimentary or advanced your coding skills are.\n\n\tIt's important to dedicate time to your coding.\u00a0\nThe DH@UVa Code Studio happens in Alderman 317 on Friday afternoons from 2-4.\u00a0 The first hour is usually instructional: a volunteer consultant will be on hand and will offer a brief lesson and/or answer questions.\u00a0 The second hour is free-form.

The forthcoming website will include an illustrated digital catalogue of the city's tomb monuments that recreates the memorial landscape of the pre-modern city. Florence's extensive commemorative culture was developed and propagated through often elaborate and beautifully decorated tombs. Personalized sepulchers were intended both to encourage prayers to ease the passage of the dead through Purgatory and to preserve and promote the family name for eternity.\nUnpublished tomb registries, known as\u00a0sepoltuari\u00a0in Italian, record the hundreds of chapels and altars and thousands of tomb monuments that were installed in Florence's churches between the mid-thirteenth and mid-seventeenth centuries. These important documents of Renaissance memorial culture are currently available only to specialists who can physically access Florence's archival repositories and those churches that have preserved their sepulchral heritage.\u00a0Digital Sepoltuario\u00a0transcribes, translates, and analyzes the content of these often-fragile manuscripts and publishes them online together with original photographs of the hundreds of monuments that still grace the floors, walls, and courtyards of Florence's churches.\u00a0Digital Sepoltuario\u00a0also includes the many tombs that have been moved, fragmented, or destroyed and reconstructs their topography through ground plans and maps.\nDigital Sepoltuario\u00a0seeks to answer numerous questions, including: How did Florentines decide on their final resting places? What led them to their choices about tomb placement, form, and decoration? Though many Florentines found their final rest together with siblings, spouses, and children in an ancestral parish tomb, and many more in common parochial graves, numerous individuals chose to build separate monuments in one of the city's friaries, monasteries, convents, or the cathedral, often far removed from kinfolk and to the great dismay of local parishes that relied on burying their dead as a steady source of income.\nDigital Sepoltuario's relational database allows systematic analysis of Florence's tombs, which visualized personal and corporate identities. The project advances new approaches to understanding the fabric of Renaissance urban life and the artistic patronage that shaped it. Beyond gathering in a single, public website visual and textual information regarding Florence's tomb sculptures and the architectural spaces that contained them,\u00a0Digital Sepoltuario\u00a0provides researchers with biographical, genealogical, political, and social data concerning the families and individuals responsible for commissioning chapels and tombs as well as the many additional men and women interred in ancestral burial plots. Related material on the artists responsible for carving and installing stone monuments as well as painting family crests, banners, and commemorative altarpieces and frescoes, enriches art historical understanding of Florence's burial economy, ever present and continually producing, yet relatively unrecognized in traditional histories of Renaissance art.\u00a0Digital Sepoltuario\u00a0will give users both raw data and interpretive framing, thereby making Florence's memorial culture accessible to a wide range of English-speaking scholars, teachers, and learners. Moreover,\u00a0Digital Sepoltuario\u00a0aspires to be a model for the creation of new virtual cemeteries for other locations in pre-modern Europe, thus enabling important cross-cultural comparison of European commemorative practices over time.\nSupport for\u00a0Digital Sepoltuario\u00a0has been provided by the American Philosophical Society, ARTstor, the Harvard University Center for Italian Renaissance Studies at Villa I Tatti, and the Renaissance Society of America.\n\n\nPublished by the\u00a0Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities.\u00a0\n\t\tCopyright 2016\u00a0Anne Leader\u00a0and the\u00a0University of Virginia\n\n\u00a0\n", "Content Type": "Projects", "Featured Image": { "src": "https://dh-dev.library.virginia.edu/system/files/DigSep_image.jpg", "alt": "Photos of tombs in Florence" }, "Funding Organization": "Harvard University Center for Italian Renaissance Studies at Villa I Tatti, American Philosophical Society", "Project URL": "Digital Sepoltuario", "Sponsoring Organization(s)": "IATH" } }, { "node": { "title": "Inhabiting Byzantine Athens", "Body": "Inhabiting Byzantine Athens\u00a0is an archaeological project that challenges traditional approaches to Byzantine urbanism and to Byzantine Athens in particular. Focusing on the area of the Athenian Agora, the project will trace architectural and functional changes in the city from the 4th c. to the 15th c. AD, so as to better understand the topography, spatial layout and living conditions of Byzantine and Frankish Athens. It seeks to reconstruct the built environment of the Byzantine city, paying particular attention to the residential areas and open/public spaces that remain largely unknown, as very few Byzantine structures besides churches have been preserved and studied.\nWe know very little about Byzantine Athens: traditional scholarship paints a picture of a small and insignificant town, a backwater of the Byzantine Empire that paled in comparison to its glorious ancient past. We also know very little about the people who lived there, their houses, and the daily living conditions during this period. Instead, our understanding of Byzantine cities is shaped by a top-down focus on the role of the Emperor and his court as city builders. While this supports scholars' fascination with elite-sponsored religious architecture and monumental structures, it offers little space for a much-needed study of non-elites and their role in the built environment and city-making processes. The project aims to begin countering this by exploring the lives and experiences of the city's inhabitants, studying their living conditions, habitats, and socio-economic activities.\nThe project relies on the archaeological data recovered by the\u00a0Athenian Agora Excavations, particularly the Agora's \"legacy data\", i.e. its archival and printed material -- field notes, maps, photos, drawings and artifacts dating from the prehistoric to the Early Modern period -- accumulated since excavations began in 1931. The excavations, run by the American School of Classical Studies at Athens (ASCSA), have brought to light a large Byzantine and Frankish residential area overlaying the ancient Greek Agora and its famous monuments, as well as hundreds of Byzantine houses and thousands of Byzantine artifacts, including pottery, coins, sculptures, most of which remains understudied and unpublished. More recently ASCSA has started a colossal undertaking to digitize their archives in order to create a single integrated and coherent digital archive of all its archaeological resources that will allow greater and easier access to the legacy data and support its study and publication.\nBuilding upon the Athenian Agora Excavations' digital initiatives, this project will employ computational methods to identify and systematically extract information from the excavation archives pertaining exclusively to the Byzantine and Frankish periods. Such methods will also allow the project to inter-relate different types of information (artifacts, maps, notes) and integrate different media (text, images, 3D reconstructions, video etc.) that will in turn\u00a0 \u00a0support a detailed study, visualization and interpretation of the excavation results. \u00a0Existing paper site maps, floor plans and drawings of Byzantine buildings will be updated and re-created in 2D and 3D environments to clearly display changes in spatial organization, use of space and architecture, and contribute to the reconstructing of the Byzantine settlement in the area of the Agora which is now destroyed and completely lost. The project will eventually provide access to its research results and tools on the web to enhance communication, collaboration and dissemination of knowledge across different audiences while remaining respectful to ASCSA's terms and conditions regarding their archives' use and publication.\nThe digital tools designed in collaboration with the specialist at IATH will provide new and effective ways to analyze and synthesize large and heterogeneous datasets that form the basis of the project's study on the relation between human behavior, spaces and objects in Byzantine cities. We also hope that the project can provide new solutions in dealing with legacy data that can be replicated and used by other archaeological projects that face similar challenges in making their archival collections more usable and accessible. Finally the tools developed during the fellowship will provide the foundation for future research on creating content for portable devices and apps that will allow visitors at the archaeological site to engage with the Athenian Agora's diachronic history and monuments in interesting and engaging ways.\n", "Content Type": "Projects", "Featured Image": { "src": "https://dh-dev.library.virginia.edu/system/files/1997.09.0035.jpg", "alt": "" }, "Project URL": "Inhabiting Byzantine Athens", "Sponsoring Organization(s)": "IATH" } }, { "node": { "title": "Cities Without Work: The Long Road from Boom to Bust", "Body": "Depressed, post-industrial U.S. economies crystalized after World War Two as labor costs, information technology, and changing demand took hold. Initially considered to be sporadic or temporary, persistent and substantial job losses began as early as the 1920s in some cities and were most pronounced in communities whose fortunes had been long associated with coal, textiles, manufacturing, and steel.\u00a0Cities Without Work: The Long Road from Boom to Bust\u00a0is the collective narrative of the seventeen American cities with the highest rates of unemployment in 1960. While the decline in these cities was years in the making, the true depth of their circumstances and the systemic causes took time to realize and accept.\nThe cities cut a broad geographical and population swath: Evansville, IN; Fall River, New Bedford, and Lowell, MA; Detroit and Flint, MI; Atlantic City, NJ; Altoona, Erie, Johnstown, Pittsburgh, Scranton, and Wilkes-Barre, PA; Providence, RI; and Charleston, Huntington, and Wheeling, WV. Today, more than half have rebounded and created new economic trajectories, but the others are still struggling. This almost sixty-year window provides insights into the economic winners and the losers, deconstructing the popular notion that the decline began much later, and places current circumstances in a larger economic and historical context.\nThe shared narrative of the study reflects the confluence of forces\u2014technology, social, environmental, political\u2014that precipitated the decline of labor-intensive sectors and bolstered or thwarted revitalization efforts in these cities. Fundamental questions guide this research: why did persistent and substantial unemployment occur in these cities and what were the signs of decline? What local, regional, and national policies or investments had the most significant and sustainable impact in recovery efforts? How can a sustainable economy be developed in light of rapidly changing political, social, and economic systems? In other words, how can local economic decision making and national policies be more strategic and resilient to external forces and rapid technological change?\n\nThis project develops a new historical narrative and tools of analysis for discussions concerning the revival of the manufacturing sector, the market and non-market policy and regulatory interventions, and the role that local decisions have played in attracting replacement industries. We are using quantitative analysis and mapping technologies, qualitative methods, and archival research, and will illustrate the geographic shift of jobs and the clustering of industries and sectors through the lens of these seventeen cities.\n", "Content Type": "Projects", "Featured Image": { "src": "https://dh-dev.library.virginia.edu/system/files/index_illustration_01.jpg", "alt": "B&W photo of a store going out of business" }, "Project URL": "Cities Without Work", "Sponsoring Organization(s)": "IATH" } }, { "node": { "title": "Digital Humanities Organizations at UVA", "Body": "IATH (Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities)\nDirector: Worthy Martin (Computer Science Department)\nSupported by: The Office of the Provost\nStaffed by: A six-person team of full-time technical experts\nMajor current activities:\n\n\nA resident fellowship program providing humanities researchers with consulting, technical support, applications development, and networked publishing facilities\n\n\nCultivating partnerships and participating in humanities computing initiatives with libraries, publishers, information technology companies, scholarly organizations, and others\n\n\nEmploying student researchers as collaborators on fellowship projects\n\n\nUsers: Fellowships available by application to UVA faculty and, in some cases, independent scholars.\nStrengths: Developing larger-scale or longer-term faculty projects that need a lot of support from technologists, project managers, and experienced DH innovators.

This collection of eighteenth-century metaphors of mind serves as the basis for a\u00a0scholarly study\u00a0of the metaphors and root-images appealed to by the novelists, poets, dramatists, essayists, philosophers, belle-lettrists, preachers, and pamphleteers of the long eighteenth century. While the database does include metaphors from classical sources, from Shakespeare and Milton, from the King James Bible, and from more recent texts, it does not pretend to any depth or density of coverage in literature other than that of the British eighteenth century.\n\u261e The database was assembled and taxonomized and is maintained by\u00a0Brad Pasanek.\nThe database supports keyword searching and faceted browsing. The facets are explained\u00a0here. If you're interested in \"fancy searching\" (boolean syntax, proximity searches, etc.), you might read about Lucene's\u00a0Query Parser Syntax.\nAn original bulk of metaphors was collected during Brad Pasanek's graduate school career in the English department at Stanford University. An early version of this database, built in Filemaker, served as the basis for his dissertation titled,\u00a0Eighteenth-Century Metaphors of Mind, A Dictionary\u00a0(Stanford: 2006).\nI/Brad continue to add to the database and edit entries. I enter new metaphors that are sent to me by email and credit contributors. In 2008 and 2009, Suzanne Morgen, my research assistant at the University of Virginia, proved a particularly tireless editor, contributing new metaphors and editing hundreds of old ones. In 2010, P.C. Fleming likewise contributed many new and interesting metaphors, edited entries, and worked with me on the administrative backend of the database. More recently James Ascher, Annie Rowlenson, and Kelly Fleming have helped edit entries. In spite of all this careful, corrective work, one should be aware that not all references are complete and that the database remains a work in progress. My typos and mistakes are mixed with the more recently edited entries. For years, I've cleaned up entries as I compile, but I don't catch all my mistakes--and I make a lot of mistakes.\nFinally, it should be emphasized that this electronic collection of snippets is, above all, an effort in search and text mining. Which means it is more of a heap or helter-skelter anthology than online archive (for examples of which see\u00a0The Blake Archive,\u00a0The Willa Cather Archive,\u00a0The Rossetti Archive, or\u00a0The Walt Whitman Archive).\nDictionary and Database. Lev Manovich describes the database as the \"symbolic form\" of the computer age, and although I am a digital humanist and a reader of Manovich's media theory, I collect and make these metaphors public for early modern reasons. The tables of this relational database, arrayed in phpMyAdmin, look (to me) not unlike a kind of commonplace book. Encoding and sharing snippets is characteristic of the way we read now, online, but in considering the\u00a0longue dur\u00e9e\u00a0of scholarship and information management, I am inspired by Ann Blair's discussion of early modern note-taking in\u00a0Too Much to Know. My practice is further informed by Walter Benjamin's experiments with literary montage, Raymond Williams' study of keywords, and Franco Moretti's\u00a0Distant Reading. In collecting and taxonomizing metaphors I would model my efforts on the prodigious note-taking of Keith Thomas. His charming description of the \"Oxford method\" in the\u00a0London Review of Books\u00a0is a must-read for commonplacers and note-takers.\nScope and Textual Sources. I aim at a very long eighteenth century (1660-1819); outside this span of years my efforts at collection are necessarily eclectic and miscellaneous. Moreover, the user should be aware that a majority of the entries have not been given scrupulous bibliographical treatment. Catch as catch can, I promiscuously employ a wide variety of sources ranging from ECCO and EEBO to Project Gutenberg, from Google Books to Chadwyck-Healey. I read university press editions but also visit special collections. While I currently draw from an uneven variety of print and electronic sources, I do hope in the future to apply a more consistent policy for recording textual variants and transcribing spelling and punctuation. For a few works in languages other than English, I have tried to provide bilingual text.\nI try to choose the earliest available edition for my copy-texts. In the last two years, I've been checking my bibliographical citations against the English Short Title catalogue (ESTC) and cross-referencing my metaphors with the earliest printings I can locate in Early English Books Online (EEBO), Eighteenth Century Collections Online (ECCO), and Google Books. When I consult the ESTC regarding a specific title, I make an effort to include new information in the database about the popularity of the text and the number editions printed in the eighteenth century.\nAcknowledgments. When I began this project at Stanford, Matt Jockers helped me plan the structure of the original database. Matt, Nicole Coleman, Glenn Worthey, and Jeremy Sabol all provided invaluable technical support and advice during these grad-school years. When I left Stanford in 2006 for the University of Southern California, I met a USC undergraduate named Casey Stark--a whiz and a credit to research assistants everywhere!--who freed the metaphors from their original Filemaker format and helped me build a new relational database in MySQL. For a year or two I tried tweaking and building on top of Casey's PHP-MySQL assemblage but found I was not equal to the task.\nI now teach at the University of Virginia, and the database has shed its PHP scripts and been reinvented in a Ruby-on-Rails framework. Not long after I arrived in Charlottesville in 2008, Bethany Nowviskie set in motion an impressive programming effort involving Jack Kelly, Matt Mitchell, and Wayne Graham at UVa's Scholars' Lab. Wayne and Matt helped me reimagine my database. I am delighted with the outcome. Wayne Graham, in particular, patiently initiated me into the workings of Ruby, Solr, and Subversion. He continues to help keep the bugs at bay. I have been oppressed by his benefactions. He was extremely generous with his time as I edited Ruby scripts and installed and upgraded packages and libraries on my laptop.\nIn 2013, IATH took over hosting and maintenance of the site; as a result, Worthy Martin, Douglas Ross, and Shayne Brandon are my current patrons. This past year, as I copyedited my book and prepared charts and tables, Douglas generously and ingeniously equipped me with a set of PHP tools for checking and recasting my data. (The hotlinked bibliography is his.) This coming summer I will be writing in more detail about my dataset in the \"blog-like\" pages attached to the main site and hope to show off several of Douglas's contributions.\n\nOn the Contents of the Database\nThere are over 14,000 metaphors in the database as of April, 2015. I've hundreds more marked in books and scribbled on notecards, and I am typing those up -- slowly, surely. It's much easier to cut and paste.\nMy method for finding metaphors may be classified as \"hunt-and-peck,\" but a few years ago I collaborated with\u00a0D. Sculley, formerly of Tufts University's Department of Computer Science and now at Google Pittsburgh, on a search protocol informed by machine-learning techniques. We trained a computer to label metaphors and non-metaphors correctly. Our experiments suggest one might be able to automate much of my daily drudgery by using a classifier trained on a seed set of 100-200 labeled metaphors and non-metaphors. This hand-curated database of metaphors could then be put to work in bootstrapping efforts, repurposed as training data for automated classifiers sent forward and backward in history, departing from the eighteenth century in order to collect Renaissance and Victorian metaphors.\nShould we eventually build an automated metaphor-classifier and charge it with exploring the great unread collections of electronic literature, I would be more confident in presenting a statistical picture of eighteenth-century discourse. In the meantime, two papers we've written on the subject have been published in Oxford's\u00a0Literary and Linguistic Computing.\nI still spend a fair amount of time conducting proximity searches for two character strings. I search one term from a set list (\"mind,\" \"heart,\" \"soul,\" \"thought,\" \"idea,\" \"imagination,\" \"fancy,\" \"reason,\" \"passion,\" \"head,\" \"breast,\" \"bosom,\" or \"brain\") against another word that I hope will prove metaphorical. For example, I search for \"mind\" within one hundred characters of \"mint\" and find the following couplet in William Cowper's poetry:\n\n\"The\u00a0mind\u00a0and conduct mutually imprint\nAnd stamp their image in each other's\u00a0mint.\"\n\nWhat follows is a rough breakdown of the database's contents:\n\nProvenance (last updated July, 2013)\nMore than 5,980 of the metaphors were found keyword searching Chadwyck-Healey through the Stanford Humanities Digital Information Service\u00a0SULAIR\u00a0search interface.

Many Arapesh villagers today use Papua New Guinea's creole lingua franca, Tok Pisin, as their medium of communication in daily life. In some cases, middle aged adults can understand but not speak the language, and their children have almost no knowledge of their ancestral tongue at all.\nThe core of the archive consists of transcribed audio recordings and a lexicon; these represent Arapesh varieties spoken on or near the coast in the villages of Wautogik, Woginara, Dogur, and Balam. It is hoped that these and other materials brought together in the archive will serve as a useful resource for anyone interested in Arapesh, including scholars, students, and Arapesh people themselves.\nWe are grateful to the National Endowment for the Humanities for financial support, through the Documenting Endangered Languages program, that has made this project possible.\n", "Content Type": "Projects", "Display Name": "Arapesh", "Featured Image": { "src": "https://dh-dev.library.virginia.edu/system/files/Arapesh_01_082.jpg", "alt": "Photo of Lise Dobrin with village elders Clement and Lusia Hayin (left), Arnold and Margaret Watiem (right)" }, "Funding Organization": "National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH)", "Project URL": "Arapesh Grammar and Digital Language Archive", "Sponsoring Organization(s)": "IATH", "Technical Approach": "text markup" } }, { "node": { "title": "Institute of the Humanities and Global Cultures", "Body": "The\u00a0Institute of the Humanities and Global Cultures\u00a0offers a vision at once local and global, and a mission both academic and socially engaged.

In partnership with faculty around the world, the Institute will assemble leading scholars to discuss the present state and future prospects of the humanities: methods of research and circumstances of teaching, institutional openings and constraints, self-assessments and proposals for new engagements.\nThe humanities today are critically oriented towards generating new universals of human belonging even as they negotiate vast terrains of cultural difference locally and globally. The \u2018human\u2019 in the humanities today is indelibly colored by the \u2018ethnos\u2019 of the global others, even as it strives to articulate its provenance through a language of the \u2018commons\u2019 in the name of our planetary fragility and a post-human consciousness.

While drawing on every kind of local expertise available, these goals will be informed throughout by a deep commitment to addressing pressing global issues that give new meaning to Thomas Jefferson\u2019s founding vision for the University of Virginia as \u2018the future bulwark of the human mind in this hemisphere.\u2019 \u00a0\nHumanists are primed to offer historical insights that situate contemporary knowledge worlds in a continuum with deep reflections across centuries about the nature of the human sciences, of philosophy, philology, rhetoric, the arts and letters; about civic responsibility; about distinctions between nomothetic and ideographic forms of knowledge, between\u00a0poesis\u00a0and mimesis, the expressive and the pragmatic. The IHGC is committed to offering a vibrant platform for exploring the historical lineages of contemporary globalization.\nAs humanists we constantly negotiate the sensitive terrain between expertise on the one hand and performative expectations in the public realm on the other. Irrespective of whether it accords with our taste or temperament as scholars, the various publics around the world do appear to increasingly feel they have a stake in fully grasping what we humanities scholars do. Our Institute will play a critical role in navigating this expectation and translating to worlds at large the value of what we do.\nThe humanities serve to define our world in myriad ways: its intellectual and cultural aspirations, its aesthetic values, its comprehension of the past that formed it, and its central ethical, moral, and theological dilemmas. With an enduring commitment to the humanities as both a domain of research innovation and an idiom of institutional self-scrutiny, the Institute seeks to play a leading role in the shaping of higher education on the global stage.

We propose offering a certificate in the Digital Humanities for MA and PhD students, in order to encourage and reward student involvement in the Digital Humanities, with a transcriptable graduate credential.\u00a0The certificate would be hosted by the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and administered by the Library, as a cooperative venture that takes advantage of resources already in place.\n\n\t\tDefinition of Digital Humanities\nDigital Humanities (DH) seeks to understand human life and culture using critical and computational methods in concert. It employs technology for research and teaching in the humanities, arts, and interpretative social sciences. It is often interdisciplinary and collaborative, involving innovative methods and tools that advance a field in ways not otherwise feasible. Its practitioners tend do this work reflectively, with a commitment to critical engagement. \u201cDH\u201d as a term refers both to the use of computational methods in the humanities and to research on technology itself; in both senses its investigations are framed in a manner consonant with the questions that humanists find most pressing.\nThe \u201ccomputational methods\u201d tradition in DH has a surprisingly long history, one that arguably goes back to the beginning of the 20th century, given that computational methods preceded what we now think of as computers. Much of that history has been philological and linguistic in its research orientation. Digital humanists normally date the field to the work of Father Busa, who in 1949 conceived of using an IBM computer to conduct philological research on the works of Thomas Aquinas. Current DH research in text mining, often found in literature studies and exemplified by the work of scholars such as Ted Underwood (Illinois), is built on this tradition. Sometimes, this work looks like corpus linguistics or information science. \u00a0Other DH threads\u2014practiced in disciplines such as archeology, history, and landscape architecture\u2014include versions of spatial representation and analysis that augment scholarship and teaching. In language departments as well as departments of history, anthropology, and sociology, DH work can involve linguistic data, oral histories, studies in sound, network analysis, and multi-media storytelling. Across the disciplines, DH practitioners perform information design and network analysis, and develop the vital digital archives that underpin a good deal of scholarship done in the academy today.\nMore specifically, the technical approaches used in this computational-methods tradition of DH include modes of textual study such as markup, which indicates metadata about literary form or other features; natural language processing (NLP), which teaches the computer to detect proper names and other entities; stylistic analysis for author attribution; and distant reading methods, which use statistical approaches to identify and interpret the collocation of words across many segments of texts. Spatial approaches include GIS, 3D modelling and printing, and visualizations of dynamic data on populations or events across time. \u00a0Databases and content management platforms are the workhorses of DH scholarship, and their architectures and interfaces are ever increasing in sophistication.\nThe \u201ccritical methods\u201d tradition of digital humanities also has a long history\u2014critiques of the value of quantitative approaches in the humanities go back to the 18th century. \u00a0This tradition looks more like cultural criticism, and it emphasizes understanding the social impact of technology, the way human bias affects the design of technologies, the genres of experience that we have when interacting with different technologies, etc. \u00a0\nAdjacent fields such as\u00a0infrastructure studies and humanities informatics intersect productively with the critical methods tradition in DH, bringing ethnographic tools and information theory, respectively, to help defamiliarize and interrogate interwoven cultural and technological formations.\u00a0 Critical studies of software, AI, and games can help bring to the surface the hidden cultural norms that metadata and algorithms embed in daily life.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\t\tBENEFITS\nGraduate students have been important members of the digital humanities community at the University of Virginia since the field\u2019s inception. In positions as fellows, research assistants, and collaborators in the Scholars\u2019 Lab, the Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities (IATH), and SHANTI, students have made significant intellectual contributions and gone on to notable permanent positions related to the digital humanities. This history of involvement is the foundation for a certificate program that provides students with advising, curricular structure, and committee oversight. A graduate certificate will help its recipients demonstrate digital humanities experience, something that is potentially relevant to a broad range of futures, including further graduate study, postdocs, \u201calt-ac\u201d and library positions, as well as work in the tech sector, in publishing, and in media more generally. \u00a0\nFaculty across the disciplines will benefit from increased collaboration and community as they develop and extend pedagogies for interpretive and computational DH. And as supervisors of research projects providing DH practicum experience, faculty will also find value in the expertise and commitment of graduate-level research contributors. Additionally, the university community as a whole will benefit from the events programming and communication efforts that underlie the program\u2019s practicum requirements.\nIn the US and around the world, institutions are offering graduate programs and (more commonly) certificates in the Digital Humanities. While UVa\u2019s strong DH reputation and Scholars\u2019 Lab fellowships currently attract graduate students to our humanities departments, this certificate program will ensure that we continue to offer the strongest qualifications to students who have overlapping commitments to studies in the humanities and the digital.\n\u00a0\n\n\t\tSCOPE\nGraduate students (MA and PhD) in Arts and Sciences may apply to this certificate program with the permission of their director of graduate studies, and may enroll if their application is accepted by the DH certificate committee. Graduate students from other UVa schools may enroll with permission from their academic dean or dean\u2019s designee and acceptance by the certificate committee.\u00a0 At the time of application to the DH certificate program, doctoral students are expected to articulate a plan approved by their DGS for completing the certificate requirements within the standard candidacy deadline and graded credit requirements for their program.\n\n\t\tPROPOSED REQUIREMENTS FOR THE GRADUATE CERTIFICATE IN DIGITAL HUMANITIES\n12 CREDITS TOTAL\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One core course\u00a0(three credits) on the history and theory of digital humanities.

Each practicum will have a faculty supervisor of record and a new DH mnemonic will be created for this course. The practicum course includes attendance at the DH colloquium, 60 hours of hands-on work in DH, and a portfolio.\no\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The practicum course may include (but is not limited to) a research assistantship on a faculty DH project, participation in fellowships from Scholars' Lab, an independent study with an instructor of record, or participation in a DH summer institution such as the Digital Humanities Summer Institute or the Humanities Intensive Learning and Teaching workshop.\no\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The 60 hours of practical work for the practicum course must be approved by the student's departmental advisor and the DH certificate administrator, who will consult regularly with the DH committee. While the core course and electives are expected to involve a significant intellectual contribution from the student, practicum work will focus more specifically on the hands-on work\u2014often but not necessarily technical\u2014that is usually involved in DH projects. Each practicum will have a faculty supervisor of record. The portfolio will document students' DH work done throughout their time at the university and will require a reflective portion and a presentation.\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Two\u00a0electives\u00a0(three credits each) with a significant DH component, either intrinsic to the course or as an instructor-approved project by the student.\u00a0Departments may develop specific standards regarding these electives in collaboration with the DH committee. Certificate-qualifying elective courses will retain the mnemonic and instructors of their home departments. Qualifying electives are:\no\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u200bA course in the student\u2019s home department or an outside department designated in advance by the DH committee as qualifying for the DH certificate.\no\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A course within the student's home department or another department that does not have the DH certificate designation but for which the student completes a DH assignment. Permission of the instructor and the DH committee is required. \u00a0\no\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 An independent study with an instructor of record who agrees to oversee a DH project either in the student's home department or outside, with the permission of the student\u2019s director of graduate studies and the DH committee.\n\n\t\tADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURE\nThe DH certificate will be hosted in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and administered through the Office of the Dean of the Library. A DH committee provides the academic oversight to the certificate (see membership below), while a small faculty advisory committee will be appointed to run the certificate. An administrative director of the program will support the activities of the DH committee and of the faculty advisory committee, maintain an events schedule to provision the colloquium portion of the practicum course, encourage collaboration among DH and related organizations at the University, and advance the DH certificate program\u2019s interests in terms of funding and promotion.\nStudents in master\u2019s programs will apply to the certificate program by the conclusion of their first semester of enrollment, and doctoral students will apply by the conclusion of their first year of enrollment.\u00a0 Waivers for later application may be granted in some circumstances (such as for those students who have achieved high levels of DH proficiency and experience before the official start of the certificate program), as long as they can incorporate the DH requirements into their master\u2019s degree or PhD candidacy requirements.\n\n\t\tMEMBERS OF THE DIGITAL HUMANITIES COMMITTEE\nJohn Unsworth, Dean of Libraries and University Librarian\nFrancesca Fiorani, Associate Dean for Arts and Humanities and Professor of Art\nAlison Booth, Academic Director of Scholars\u2019 Lab and Professor of English\nWorthy Martin, Acting Director, Institute of Advanced Technology in the Humanities and Associate Professor of Computer Science\nDavid Germano, Director of SHANTI and Professor of Religious Studies\nRon Hutchins, Vice President for Information Technology\nMark Saunders, Director of the University of Virginia Press\nRafael Alvarado, Research Faculty in the Data Science Institute\nAmanda Visconti, Managing Director of Scholars\u2019 Lab\nDaniel Pitti, Director of Social Networks and Archival Context Cooperative, UVa Library\nRennie Mapp, Project Manager for Strategic DH Initiatives, Office of the Vice President for Information Technology and the Office of the Dean of Libraries\n\n\t\tCONTACT INFORMATION\n\u00a0 This proposal is not final and will go through several stages of University approval.\u00a0 Please contact Rennie Mapp, DH certificate project manager, at\u00a0mapp@virginia.edu\u00a0if you have questions or comments.\n\n\t\tANTICIPATED START DATE\nSeptember 2018\n\n\u00a0\n\n\t\u00a0\n\u00a0\n" } }, { "node": { "title": "DH certificate proposal ready for community input", "Body": "Spearheaded by John Unsworth, a recent initiative to develop a graduate digital humanities certificate at UVa has resulted in a public proposal that calls for 12 credit hours of work, including one core DH course, two electives, and a practicum course that will require students to perform hands-on DH project work, attend DH colloquia, and produce a final portfolio. \u00a0Questions and comments may be directed to Rennie Mapp, project manager, at DH@UVA.\u00a0\nThe full proposal is linked here. \u00a0\n", "Image": { "src": "https://dh-dev.library.virginia.edu/sites/digitalhumanities.virginia.edu/files/JohnUnsworth_0_0.jpg", "alt": "Photo of John Unsworth" }, "Subtitle": "DH@UVa to provide public resources for students, faculty, and staff" } }, { "node": { "title": "UVA's Graduate Certificate in Digital Humanities", "Body": "Why study DH at Virginia?\u00a0\nGraduate students have been important members of the digital humanities community at the University of Virginia since the field\u2019s inception in the 1990s.\u00a0\u00a0As a global leader in the digital humanities, UVA's resources enable students to pursue humanities research with\u00a0innovative technical approaches, including textual editing, databases and online projects recovering archives, community heritage, complex careers or movements, or multimedia artifacts; text mining; mapping; virtual and augmented reality; sound studies; AI or machine learning; social media; surveillance, data, and security; accessibility; and environmental humanities.\u00a0\u00a0\nGraduate students in humanities and related departments unite humanistic approaches with insight into the practical workings of the digital age, including collaboration, project management, and grant-funded projects.

In this workshop, we\u2019ll explore how much more can we learn about a book once we\u2019ve endowed it with tiny digital prosthetics that document ever so much more of its history. Properly preserved and maintained, a book outfitted with sensors could enhance book history as a field of study by magnifying our ability to tell a story about its past, such as the precise date, time, and place it was opened or read aloud or subjected to the mishaps of a careless reader who spilled coffee on it. At the same time, by registering detailed information about human lives, such sensing books raise potentially troubling issues around privacy and surveillance.\n\t\u00a0\n\tThrough discussion, scenario building, and prototyping, we\u2019ll investigate four inter-related questions: 1.) What types of sensors are the most interesting and revelatory to embed in physical books?\u00a0 2.) What can we infer about the past by analyzing the activity traces captured by these sensors? 3.) What are the most compelling ways to visualize and display sensor data collected from books? 4.) How we can ensure that anti-surveillance values are reflected in the design of such digitally augmented books? Participants will have the chance to experiment with a variety of sensors, including those detecting motion, temperature, sound, and humidity. We\u2019ll also go beyond the usual repertoire of commercially available technologies by examining some non-digital sensors, as well as a few gadgets that have achieved notoriety as \u201cghost tech,\u201d such as ultra-sensitive vibration and electrostatic sensors: the \u201cstrange frequencies\u201d of the workshop title.\n\t\u00a0\n\tKari Kraus is an associate professor in the College of Information Studies and the Department of English at the University of Maryland.

During the workshop, I will hand out \u201cpatch kits\u201d made of a board loom, conductive fabric, yarn, and beads (in place of the original wire and ferrite cores). After participants weave their patches, they plug their patches into the electronic textile quilt to unlock our archive of first-hand accounts of core memory production. The quilt plays audio clips from our archive and tweets from our @lolweavers Twitter account. I developed the project with the hope of examining the forms of gendered craftwork and its valuation as technical work over time \u2014 exploring and to some extent challenging the prevailing purification of high status cognitive labor associated with male engineers from the ostensibly unthinking and unskilled practices of women\u2019s hands.\nDaniela Rosner is an Assistant Professor in Human Centered Design & Engineering (HCDE) at the University of Washington.

JUEL is funded by\u00a0The Jefferson Trust, an Initiative of the University of Virginia Alumni Association, and the University of Virginia.\n", "Content Type": "Projects", "Display Name": "JUEL", "Featured Image": { "src": "https://dh-dev.library.virginia.edu/system/files/JUEL2.jpg", "alt": "" }, "Funding Organization": "Jefferson Trust", "MAO Materials": "3D", "Project URL": "JUEL", "Sponsoring Organization(s)": "IATH, University of Virginia Library", "Technical Approach": "georeferencing, virtual reality", "Tools": "Autodesk 3ds Max, Adobe Premiere Pro, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Autodesk AutoCAD", "Featured Image (caption)": "JUEL is a place to encounter what life was like in the first years of the University of Virginia.\r\n" } }, { "node": { "title": " to Social Networks in Archival Contexts (SNAC) by Director of", "I am connected to:": "Social Networks in Archival Contexts (SNAC)", "Instructor": "Worthy Martin", "My connection type is:": "Director" } }, { "node": { "title": "American Council of Learned Societies (ACLS)", "Content Type": "Organizations", "Home Page URL": "http://www.acls.org/", "Organization Type": "Non-UVa Organization" } }, { "node": { "title": " to The Tibetan and Himalayan Library by Staff of", "I am connected to:": "The Tibetan and Himalayan Library", "My connection type is:": "Staff" } }, { "node": { "title": "American Academy of Religion", "Content Type": "Organizations", "Home Page URL": "https://www.aarweb.org/", "Organization Type": "Non-UVa Organization" } }, { "node": { "title": "The Shelley and Donald Rubin Foundation", "Content Type": "Organizations", "Home Page URL": "http://www.sdrubin.org/", "Organization Type": "Non-UVa Organization" } }, { "node": { "title": "British Academy", "Content Type": "Organizations", "Home Page URL": "http://www.britac.ac.uk/", "Organization Type": "Non-UVa Organization" } }, { "node": { "title": "U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)", "Content Type": "Organizations", "Home Page URL": "https://www.usaid.gov/", "Organization Type": "Non-UVa Organization" } }, { "node": { "title": "U.S. Department of State's Bureau of Education and Cultural Affairs Exchange Programs", "Content Type": "Organizations", "Home Page URL": "https://exchanges.state.gov/", "Organization Type": "Non-UVa Organization" } }, { "node": { "title": "U.S. Department of Education", "Content Type": "Organizations", "Home Page URL": "https://www.ed.gov/", "Organization Type": "Non-UVa Organization" } }, { "node": { "title": " to The Tibetan and Himalayan Library by Director of", "I am connected to:": "The Tibetan and Himalayan Library", "Instructor": "David Germano", "My connection type is:": "Director" } }, { "node": { "title": "The University of Virginia Press", "Content Type": "Organizations", "Home Page URL": "http://www.upress.virginia.edu/", "Organization Type": "UVa Organization" } }, { "node": { "title": " to Rare Books School by Director of", "I am connected to:": "Rare Books School", "My connection type is:": "Director" } }, { "node": { "title": "Rare Books School", "Content Type": "Organizations", "Home Page URL": "http://rarebookschool.org/", "Organization Type": "UVa Organization" } }, { "node": { "title": "Virginia Humanities", "Body": "From the Virginia Humanities website:\u00a0\nVirginia Humanities is the state humanities council. We\u2019re headquartered in Charlottesville at the\u00a0University of Virginia, but we serve the entire state.\nWe aim to share the stories of all Virginians\u2014or, better yet, find ways for people to share their own stories. We want Virginians to connect with their history and culture and, in doing that, we hope we\u2019ll all get to know each other a little better.\nToward that end, in 2019 we created a\u00a0new strategic plan. It unifies our work around three important themes that will connect our programs, guide our partnerships, and help us make the humanities part of the daily life of all Virginians.\nAmplifying Virginia\u2019s Stories\nAs we seek to celebrate and share Virginia\u2019s stories, we also highlight and explore experiences traditionally left out of mainstream narratives.\nEquity and Democracy\nIn all times, we must consider how our nation can strive to become a more perfect union and move toward the noble, but imperfectly expressed ideal that \u201call men are created equal.\u201d Our programs encourage civic dialogue, facilitate the exchange of experiences and perspectives, and investigate ways that American democracy both advances and inhibits the equality of all people.\nCultures in Transition\nToday we are all confronting economic, environmental, and technological change that at times feels unprecedented. Our programs help all Virginians understand how these major shifts in our world affect us and our future.\n2020-2023 Strategic Goals\nIn addition to using these themes to better focus, understand, and communicate the work of Virginia Humanities, we\u2019ve also established four major strategic goals to shape how we do our work.\n\nIdentify and help document\u00a0under-told and lesser-known stories in Virginia.\nSeek and engage\u00a0Virginians outside of Virginia Humanities\u2019 traditional and core audiences.\nCreate a new organizational structure\u00a0at Virginia Humanities that makes us more cohesive, responsive, and efficient across programs.\nAchieve significant increases\u00a0in individual, corporate, and philanthropic contributions.\n\n", "Content Type": "Organizations", "Home Page URL": "Virginia Humanities", "Organization Type": "Non-UVa Organization" } }, { "node": { "title": " to Social Networks in Archival Contexts (SNAC) by Staff of", "I am connected to:": "Social Networks in Archival Contexts (SNAC)", "Instructor": "Sarah Wells", "My connection type is:": "Staff" } }, { "node": { "title": " to Text Encoding Initiative Markup Language (TEI) by Other", "I am connected to:": "Text Encoding Initiative Markup Language (TEI)", "Instructor": "Sarah Wells", "My connection type is:": "Other" } }, { "node": { "title": " to Collective Biographies of Women by Other", "I am connected to:": "Collective Biographies of Women", "Instructor": "Sarah Wells", "My connection type is:": "Other" } }, { "node": { "title": " to The Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities by Staff of", "I am connected to:": "IATH", "Instructor": "Sarah Wells", "My connection type is:": "Staff" } }, { "node": { "title": " to The Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities by Staff of", "I am connected to:": "IATH", "Instructor": "Eva Lucy Alvarado", "My connection type is:": "Staff" } }, { "node": { "title": " to SHANTI by Associate Director of", "I am connected to:": "SHANTI", "Instructor": "John Alexander", "My connection type is:": "Associate Director" } }, { "node": { "title": "Fralin Art Museum", "Content Type": "Organizations", "Home Page URL": "Fralin Art Museum", "Organization Type": "UVa Organization" } }, { "node": { "title": " to Scholars' Lab by Sponsored by", "I am connected to:": "Scholars' Lab", "Instructor": "Collective Biographies of Women", "My connection type is:": "Sponsored" } }, { "node": { "title": " to English Department by Sponsored by", "I am connected to:": "English Department", "Instructor": "Collective Biographies of Women", "My connection type is:": "Sponsored" } }, { "node": { "title": "Institute of Museum and Library Sciences (IMLS)", "Content Type": "Organizations", "Home Page URL": "https://www.imls.gov/", "Organization Type": "Non-UVa Organization" } }, { "node": { "title": " to Office of the Dean of the Library by Staff of", "I am connected to:": "Office of the Dean of the Library", "Instructor": "Rennie Mapp", "My connection type is:": "Staff" } }, { "node": { "title": " to Office of the Vice President for Information Technology by Staff of", "I am connected to:": "Office of the Vice President for Information Technology", "Instructor": "Rennie Mapp", "My connection type is:": "Staff" } }, { "node": { "title": " to SHANTI by Staff of", "I am connected to:": "SHANTI", "Instructor": "Rennie Mapp", "My connection type is:": "Staff" } }, { "node": { "title": "The Tibetan and Himalayan Library", "Body": "The Tibetan and Himalayan Library (THL) is a publisher of websites, information services, and networking facilities relating to the Tibetan plateau and southern Himalayan regions.

In addition to more typical academic projects, THL promotes participatory knowledge that is created by and benefits local communities, while including contributors from all walks of life around the world. Data includes text, audio-video, images, maps, immersive objects, reference works, and interpretative essays. THL\u2019s knowledge and technology are provided free of charge, and are built collaboratively by hundreds of people across the world who share this vision.

Its overall development is guided by an international advisory board consisting of prominent scholars, librarians, technologists, and community leaders in the field of Tibetan and Himalayan Studies from a wide range of disciplinary backgrounds, geographical/cultural foci, and institutional bases. In addition, there are a variety of editorial boards responsible for more hands-on design and content development in specific structural components of THL. In addition, THL\u2019s structural components are populated by scores of individual projects with their own administration ranging from a single participant to a large team of participants.\nWhile the content is the result of many institutions and individuals, the underlying technical infrastructure is supported at the University of Virginia with support from the University of Virginia\u2019s Library, the Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities, SHANTI, and ITC. Specific technical initiatives are also supported by a small but very talented group of volunteer technologists who have played a crucial role in the development of THL.

Scholars use these records as primary evidence for understanding the lives and work of historical persons and the events in which they participated. These records are held in archives and manuscript libraries, large and small, around the world. Scholars may need to search scores of different archives one by one, following clues, hunches, and leads to find the records relevant to their topic. Furthermore, descriptive practices may differ from one archive or library to another. The research is time consuming and inefficient: clues and leads may be easily overlooked and important resources undiscovered.\nThe data needed to address this research challenge already exists in the guides, catalogs, and finding aids that archivists and librarians create to document and provide access to the archival resourcess.

In addition to differences in form and genre, Spanish-language volumes offer very different interpretations of the K\u2019iche\u2019 source text. The opening line of Adri\u00e1n Recinos\u2019s translation is, \u201cEste es el principio de las antiguas historias de este lugar llamado Quich\u00e9,\u201d while Emilio Abreu G\u00f3mez renders it as, \u201cEntonces no hab\u00eda ni gente, ni animales, ni \u00e1rboles, ni piedras, ni nada.\u201d Readers\u2019 interpretations of the text, and of Maya cultural and spiritual traditions conveyed in translation, thus depend upon the editions they consult, and these editions vary widely.\nIn this class, we will design a thematic research collection of the Popol Vuh, housed at the Newberry Library and digitally hosted by the Ohio State University Library. By encoding the manuscript with tools that show the graphic and narrative complexity of the Popol Vuh, this project will allow readers to engage deeply with questions of historical, spiritual, and cultural translation. Such tools will ideally include images (glyphs, vases, figures from codices), maps, and alternative translations. Primary readings include translations and editions of the Popol Vuh; secondary sources will address key topics in Classic and Post-Classic Maya Studies (archaeology, art history, linguistics), as well as critical paradigms in DH scholarship (evaluation, methodology, pedagogy).\nOn seminar days (Tuesdays, led by professor Bigelow), we will analyze primary and secondary readings and identify features we want to encode in our digital critical edition. On studio days (Thursdays, led by professor Alvarado), we will learn how to encode textual variants and graphic forms using Drupal software. We will work in small teams (2-3 people) to encode a section of the manuscript (about 6 folios per person). In this way, we\u2019ll build skills in literary/translation analysis and DH research, thinking critically about the problems that DH platforms do and do not resolve in Latin American, Mesoamerican, and Indigenous Studies.\nThis course is offered in the spring of 2017 so that students can present work at the 2018 DH conference in Mexico City, the first time that the conference will be held in Latin America.\n", "Course Number": "SPAN 7559", "Department": "Spanish Italian and Portuguese", "DH Certificate requirement ": "Methods", "discipline": "Spanish Italian and Portuguese, Digital Humanities", "Instructor": "Rafael Alvarado, Allison Margaret Bigelow", "MAO Materials": "Textual, DH Theory and History", "Related Tools": "Text Encoding Initiative Markup Language (TEI)", "Semester": "Fall", "Syllabus Link": "Syllabus on Google Docs ", "Taught By": "Rafael Alvarado, Allison Bigelow", "university": "University of Virginia", "UVa Course": "yes", "Year": "2017" } }, { "node": { "title": "CADRE", "Body": "Computation and Data Resource Exchange\n", "Content Type": "Organizations", "Home Page URL": "Computation and Research Data Exchange", "Organization Type": "UVa Organization" } }, { "node": { "title": " to UVa KBase by Alum", "I am connected to:": "UVa KBase", "Instructor": "Rennie Mapp", "My connection type is:": "Alum" } }, { "node": { "title": "UVa KBase", "Body": "A Knowledge Base in support of the Digital Humanities at UVa.\nLink is here.\n", "Content Type": "Resources" } }, { "node": { "title": "Matthew Kirschenbaum", "Body": "See Matt Kirschenbaum's website here. \n", "Content Type": "People", "Name": "Matthew Kirschenbaum" } }, { "node": { "title": "Amanda Visconti", "Body": "See Amanda Visconti's dissertation here. \n", "Content Type": "People", "Name": "Amanda Visconti" } }, { "node": { "title": "SHANTI", "Body": "About SHANTI\nLink to SHANTI here\nThe mission of SHANTI (Sciences, Humanities and Arts Network of Technological Initiatives) is to promote a culture of innovation and excellence in humanities, sciences and arts within the academic life of the University of Virginia.

Along the way, we explore how the Internet has created a space for new forms of social action and political imagination which both challenge and reproduce established institutions such as the nation state, the newspaper, and the corporation. In addition, we explore how the Internet itself, as an assemblage of technologies and technical practices, has changed from a network for the communication of messages to a politically contested sphere of exchange in which social data has become a form of territory. \nRequirements \nAttendance is strongly encouraged but not required -- I will not be taking roll.

One of the causes of this change is the transformation of our digital ecology from print and traditional broadcast media to networked digital media, characterized by the rise of database-mediated communication within a global sphere of information exchange. These changes in our media ecology are creating new forms of knowledge and alternative forms of social organization at a pace that is dazzling from an historical perspective. Businesses, governments, and grass roots communities are vigorously adapting to digital media, taking the lead in developing new ways of communicating and acting in the world. Our educational institutions, however, seem bound by habits of thought and structures of communication that resist changes introduced by the new media. Yet the academy is ideally positioned to create and embrace new forms of knowledge with the public interest in mind. In fact a sub-community of academics \u2013 dating back to the 1940s and now known as the digital humanities \u2013 has pursued exactly this mission, against a tide that seems only now to be turning. In this course, you are invited to join this community and explore the ways digital media are being embraced by scholars, artists, and scientists in the pursuit of knowledge and social change. We will explore the history and culture of the digital liberal arts from its birth in the years immediately following the invention of the first commercial computers through its various incarnations up to the present era of the late World Wide Web. Along the way we will examine specific examples of scholars using digital media to advance their research, and explore the aesthetic and epistemological significance of their work through readings-based discussions and hands-on work on a collaborative class project. \nRequirements \nAttendance 10% Blogging 20% Mid-term 20% Final Projects 30% Final Exam 20% \nPolicies \n\n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourse Description \nSyllabus \nClassroom attendance. Attendance is required for all class sessions. Absences in excess of three days will result in loss of a letter grade. Please see the instructors if you anticipate missing more than three classes. \nClassroom participation. Although classroom participation is not measured per se, I do expect you to participate by adding to the conversation and answering questions during seminar and actively collaborating with your peers during studio. \nReading before class. Reading is the fuel that drives course discussion. Whether you have done the reading will affect the quality of your contributions and class discussions as a whole. In this course, we have chosen readings (and the occasional video or podcast) that can be completed in the time allotted before class and with enough time to complete the blogging requirement described below. Of course, \u201creading\u201d in this context means also viewing, listening to, and interacting with assigned new media content. \nTimely completion of assignments. Late assignments will not be accepted without loss of a letter grade for each day late. If you anticipate conflicts with your work in other courses, please schedule a meeting with me and bring your other course syllabi so that we may determine if an accommodation is required. In general, it is a good idea to plan your semester in the first two weeks of class, using all of your course syllabi and a calendar to map at a work strategy. (Time management is one of the life skills you would do well to cultivate while in college; you will be abundantly repaid in life by any investment you make in this area.) \n\n\n\n\nSchedule \nThe course schedule may be found here. \nPurpose \n\n\nBlogging Instructions \n\n\n\n\nIn this course you will blog extensively. Blogs will be used as a vehicle for your reflection on readings as well as goings on in the course. We use blogging in this course to accomplish an important goal \u2014 to connect your reading experience to your classroom experience by means of an on-going conversation that takes place virtually and in person. Your responses help us understand your response to the readings before class, knowledge which we incorporate into the seminar session. Afterward, your blogging allows you to capture and synthesize the thoughts generated during class. \nProtocol \n\n\n\n\n\nSUMMARY \nAdd a comment on the post for the week\u2019s readings before 5 on Monday \n\n\n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourse Description \nBlogging Instructions \n\n\nRead, view, or listen to each assigned resource. Assigned readings are given in the page associated with the day they are to be discussed. These pages are found under \u201cLessons\u201d in the menu and are prefixed with the date of the class meeting. \n\n\nCreate a response to the Response Question provided at the end of the reading list by writing a blog post. See the Rubric below for the formal requirements of this post. You must create this post by 5:00 PM the Monday before seminar to receive full credit for your work. \n\n\nAfter studio on Thursday but before Friday at 5:00 PM, write a blog post on the course site describing something that you found interesting or confusing from the week, unless otherwise directed. These blog posts are called \u201csynthetic responses\u201d and are an essential part of my teaching process. \n\n\nRubric \n\n\nThe most important aspect of this assignment is to do it. Don\u2019t be a perfectionist \u2014 if you have done the reading and attended class, your intuitions are bound to be of value. If they are not, this is one way to develop the muscle that converts the ideas in your head to the words in your mouth \u2014 this is what college is for. The point of blogging is not to produce perfect or even completely coherent ideas, but to get the process of talking, thinking, and writing going. \n\n\nTimeliness is essential. Obviously, for this process to work, your comments and blogs have to be submitted on time. The critical path is your reading \u2014 if you get into a schedule for your reading, the rest will follow. \n\n\nLength is variable. One or two sentences is too short; the ideal is the \u201cfat paragraph\u201d that develops a thought, somewhere between 150 to 300 words. \n\n\nConsistency matters. Like attendance and bowling, back-to-back participation is essential to a successful outcome. \n\n\nExamples \nHere is an example of a synthetic response from a previous course.\nHere is an example of a synthetic response in another course, responding to the content of a seminar. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n", "Course Number": "MDST 3703", "Department": "Media Studies", "DH Certificate requirement ": "Methods", "discipline": "Media Studies, Digital Humanities", "Instructor": "Rafael Alvarado", "MAO Materials": "Textual, DH Theory and History", "Semester": "Fall", "Syllabus Link": "Introduction to the Digital LIberal Arts", "Taught By": "Rafael Alvarado", "university": "University of Virginia", "UVa Course": "yes", "Year": "2017" } }, { "node": { "title": "ANTH 5401 Linguistic Field Methods", "Body": "The goal of this course is to get hands-on practice doing linguistic analysis based entirely on data collected from a native speaker of a language.

How did houses look like, smell, taste and even sound like in the past? How did ancient people throw house parties and run businesses from home? Why did they bury people and objects under house floors?\nThese are some of the key questions we will explore in the Household archaeology class. Household Archaeology is a relative new sub-field of archaeology that moves away from the monumental and highly visible public spaces of antiquity and focuses on the architecture, spatial patterning, daily activities, behaviors and experiences of the ancient house. Household archaeology allow us to move from excavated walls to people and discover the fascinating stories of individuals that made and used the object we finds in archaeological contexts. Our main goal in the course is to explore how ancient houses can help us better ancient societies. In doing so, we will investigate key sites in the eastern Mediterranean ranging from the Neolithic to the Early Modern period, that have enabled archaeologists to explore this new field and introduce us to archaeological assemblages found in ancient houses.\nAcquiring new skills and knowledge about:\nThe field of archaeology\n\u2022 Train in basic archaeological principals that will allow us to understand how archaeological data is formed, collected and analyzed\n\u2022 Critically evaluate how contemporary values and experiences impact our understanding of the past.\n\u2022 Discover how household archaeology has developed through time\nAncient houses:\n\u2022 Understand ancient households as non-static entities and explore the factors that contribute to their development and changes\n\u2022 Investigate the diverse economic, social, religious and political roles of ancient households\n\u2022 Develop appropriate methodologies to reconstruct ancient houses\u2019 life histories that allow multiple readings of the data and encompass different perspectives to include all members of society.\nNew technologies in archaeology:\n\u2022 Learn how to create 3D environments for archaeological data\n\u2022 Evaluate how well new technologies can visualize and inform the interpretation of archaeological data\nContemporary life and self-awareness:\n\u2022 Compare ancient houses and life conditions to your own experiences and house life\n\u2022 Reflect on the ways this course can contribute to your life goals and professional development.\nYou should take this course because:\n\u2022 We will learn together, gain new skills and create a community where everyone is respected, feels included and valued. The course is both for archaeology and non- archaeology majors who are creative and curious about the past and the use of new technologies in creating ancient 3D environment.\n\u2022 We are all custodians of the past and of World Heritage. Learning about the past help us to protect it at a critical time for the survival of world monuments threatened by war, climate change and political agendas.\n\u2022 Household archaeology is about daily life and ordinary people, like you and me, rather than about elites, kings and grand monuments. We all have a role to play in human history and deserve to be part of the historical narrative.\n\u2022 This course is equally about the present, our lives and our relation to others. In leaning about how people lived in the past, we can better understand aspects of our own lives and behaviors and those of the people around us.

Focusing on clusters of texts from the nineteenth and twenty-first centuries, we will sample different genres and modes of writing and reading. We will consider the many media in which narratives about human lives can be expressed, and experiment in using some of them.
