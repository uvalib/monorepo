    <h2>BIBLIOGRAPHICAL PROCEDURES AND FORMAT</h2>
<p><strong>Scope</strong></p>
<p>There were 781 titles published in the Modern Library and its two
related series, Modern Library Giants and the Illustrated Modern
Library, from 1917 through 1985; 642 of these titles were published in
the main Modern Library series. This bibliography covers 1925–59 for the
regular Modern Library series during the most profitable and prolific
years of the series. First printings and major bibliographical variants
of each title (reset texts, reset title pages, introductions added and
dropped, etc.) are fully described. Publishing history information,
including which titles were discontinued each year, is provided.</p>
<p><strong>Format</strong></p>
<p>Within each section of the bibliography, entries are arranged
chronologically. For each title published in the series between 1925 and
1959, subsequent variants of each title are described if they appeared
prior to 1992. The entry numbers reflect the chronological arrangement
of the bibliography and are unrelated to Modern Library numbers assigned
by the publisher.</p>
<p><strong>Editions, Printings, States, Issues</strong></p>
<p>The descriptive bibliography of a reprint series like the Modern Library
presents special challenges in terms of bibliographical methodology.</p>
<p>Basic to any descriptive bibliography is the identification and
distinction of editions, printings, states, and issues. An <em>edition</em> is
defined as the copies of a book printed from a single setting of type,
including all reprintings. Many Modern Library books were printed from
relief plates previously used by other publishers or from offset plates
made by photographing books originally typeset for other publishers.
Modern Library printings of such a title are bibliographically part of
an edition that was created before its publication in the Modern
Library. Other Modern Library books, on the other hand, are printed from
relief or offset plates made from new settings of type (most of these
plates were made for and owned by the Modern Library; sometimes they
were owned jointly by the Modern Library and an original publisher; in a
few cases they were made by an original publisher and rented to the
Modern Library for its printings). All printings from plates made from
an original typesetting constitute an edition in their own right. Modern
Library books identified in the bibliography as having been printed from
newly set plates constitute new editions. For Modern Library printings
that belong to an earlier edition, an attempt has been made to identify
the source of the plates and to indicate precisely which pages of the
Modern Library “edition” were printed from them. (The term “first Modern
Library edition,” as loosely applied by collectors and booksellers,
refers to the first Modern Library printing.)</p>
<p>The widespread practice of printing from plates in the nineteenth and
twentieth centuries has led bibliographers to speak of “parent editions”
and “subsidiary editions.” Plates used by an original publisher for the
initial printing of a work are commonly used by one or more reprint
publishers (such as the Modern Library) for “reprint editions.” The
original publisher may use the plates for a special printing marketed as
a “limited edition,” printings of the “trade edition,” and later
printings of one or more “popular editions” at a lower price and often
in a smaller format. All printings from plates made from the same type
setting belong bibliographically to the same edition or “parent
edition.” Printings by the original publisher marketed in
distinguishable formats and printings by other publishers marketed under
their imprints can be considered “subsidiary editions.” Bowers notes
that a “basic list of possible subsidiary editions to the parent edition
typesetting” includes American and English editions (including cheap
editions), limited editions, colonial editions, editions by other
publishers, revised editions, and enlarged editions. He continues:
“These terms are not pure bibliographical terms and at best are only
conveniences. They do not replace the necessity of being precise in a
bibliography about the origin of a subsidiary edition. Thus a first
American edition may actually be a re-issue of an impression of an
English edition, or an American state of one of its impressions which
comprises a separate American issue, or it may be a first American
impression from the English plates, or a new American type-setting. For
the arrangement of a bibliography, any one of these is most conveniently
treated as the first American edition, but the bibliographical facts
must be present” (1975, pp. 383–84).</p>
<p>The term “Modern Library edition” is used for the sake of convenience in
the printing and publishing history statement (where the precise
bibliographical facts about its origins are set forth) and in the
publishing history notes. The term “bibliographical edition” is used
occasionally when it might otherwise be unclear that “edition” is being
used in its bibliographical sense. The numbering system as described
below distinguishes Modern Library printings that belong to different
editions or parent editions.</p>
<p><em>Printing</em>. All the copies of a book printed at one time without
removing the type or plates from the press are considered a printing.
All Modern Library books were printed from plates. Printings occur only
within editions. <em>Impression</em> is the same as <em>printing</em>, but <em>printing</em>
is used here for consistency.</p>
<p><em>State</em>. States are created by an alteration of the text to <em>some
copies</em> of a particular printing (usually by stop-press correction or
cancellation of leaves). States occur within printings; there cannot be
a first state without a second state. The first printing of Calverton’s
<em>Anthology of American Negro Literature</em>, published in the Modern
Library in 1929, omitted copyright notices from the pages containing
five blues lyrics by W. C. Handy. When Handy granted permission for
their inclusion, he stipulated that copyright notices were to be printed
on the same pages as the lyrics. He protested the omission a few weeks
after publication. The Modern Library ordered its bindery to collect all
unsold copies on hand, to cancel the leaves without copyright notices,
and to replace them with six newly printed leaves containing the
copyright notices. Copies of the first printing distributed before the
cancellation was made constitute the first state of the printing; copies
with the corrected leaves constitute the second state of the printing.
All subsequent printings included the copyright notices. Cancelled
leaves do not always create separate states of a printing. Several
Modern Library books contain cancellations that appear to have been made
in <em>all</em> copies of the first printing.</p>
<p><em>Issue</em>. Issues are created by an alteration of the text that affects
the conditions of publication or sale of some copies of a particular
printing. The alteration usually consists of a change in the title page.
Issues occur only within printings; there cannot be a first issue
without a second issue. Franz Werfel’s <em>Forty Days of Musa Dagh</em>,
published as a Modern Library Giant in 1937, offers a good example. The
printed sheets came from two sources. In addition to securing reprint
rights to the work, the Modern Library acquired 3,984 sets of sheets
from Viking Press, the original American publisher. The first four
leaves of these copies were canceled and replaced with new preliminary
leaves, including the Modern Library title page. The copies thus
published under the Modern Library imprint represent the second issue of
the final Viking Press printing. With the creation of the second issue,
copies of the printing previously sold by Viking Press under its own
imprint became the first issue of the final Viking Press printing. If
Viking Press retained a few copies in its warehouse for subsequent sale
they would also form part of the first issue of the printing. The
availability of Viking Press sheets allowed the Modern Library to reduce
its own first printing from 10,000 copies to 5,000 copies. These 5,000
copies, printed from Viking plates and placed on the market
simultaneously with the Modern Library issue of the final Viking Press
printing, constitute the first Modern Library printing.</p>
<p><strong>Families of Printings</strong></p>
<p>The bibliographical description of books printed over a period of years
from the same set of plates, or from multiple sets of plates made from
the same typesetting, presents special difficulties. All such printings
belong to the same bibliographical edition. The plates may be used
concurrently or in succession by different publishers. The plates of
Theodore Dreiser’s <em>Sister Carrie</em> that the Modern Library first used in
1932 had previously been used for printings by Doubleday, Page &amp; Co.
(1900), B. W. Dodge &amp; Co. (1907), Grosset &amp; Dunlap (1908), Harper &amp;
Brothers (1912), and Boni &amp; Liveright (1917). Printings within a parent
edition can be organized into subsidiary editions but a further level of
ordering is needed. Publishers may change their names or addresses with
the result that later printings appear under new or revised imprints.
There were printings of <em>Sister Carrie</em> under the successive imprints of
Boni &amp; Liveright and Horace Liveright, Inc., for example. A publisher
may also bring out printings in different formats. The Macmillan Co. in
New York published Louis Hémon’s <em>Maria Chapdelaine</em> in three formats.
It first appeared in 1921 in a two-color format using one set of plates
for the text and a second set of plates for matter printed in blue (the
two-color title page, large initials at the beginning of each chapter,
and decorative part titles and chapter heads). There were several
printings in this format. In 1924 Macmillan published an “Illustrated
Edition” using the original text plates together with newly set plates
containing the illustrations and different large initials, both of which
were printed in grayish yellow. Five years later the novel appeared in
Macmillan’s Modern Readers’ Series with an introduction and notes by
Carl Y. Connor. Printings in the Modern Readers’ Series did not include
illustrations, but the large initials from the “Illustrated Edition”
were added to the original text plates (or to a duplicate set of these
plates) to make possible one-color printing. The Modern Library used the
Modern Readers’ Series plates when it published <em>Maria Chapdelaine</em> in
1934, omitting Connor’s introduction and notes but adding a new
introduction by Hugh Eayrs.</p>
<p><em>Sister Carrie</em> remained in the Modern Library for forty years; <em>Maria
Chapdelaine</em> remained in the series for seventeen years. Both titles
were reprinted regularly. In fall 1939 the Modern Library introduced a
new and larger format that featured individually designed title pages.
Backlist titles were put into the new format as they were reprinted.
Modern Library printings of <em>Sister Carrie</em> and <em>Maria Chapdelaine</em>
before 1940 were in the smaller format with a uniform title-page design;
subsequent printings were in the larger format with individually
designed title pages. The Modern Library “subsidiary edition” of each of
these works thus includes two bibliographically distinct sequences of
printings distinguished by the title page design and the size of the
volumes.</p>
<p>Any sequence of printings from a set of plates with a given
characteristic in common can be regarded as a family of printings.
Characteristics that distinguish a family of printings can include fully
or partially reset title pages (including changes in the publisher’s
device or imprint), introductions added and dropped, printings with and
without illustrations, substantive changes in the back matter such as
the addition of an index, and substantive changes in the body of the
text such as the addition of one or more works to a previously published
anthology.</p>
<p>Modern Library printings of <em>Sister Carrie</em> or <em>Maria Chapdelaine</em> fall
into two distinct families based on the title page. Macmillan printings
of <em>Maria Chapdelaine</em> could be regarded either as three subsidiary
editions or three families of printings. The concept of families of
printings is especially useful for the ordering of books printed from
the same set of plates over an extended period of time. It should be
noted that while there are usually multiple printings within a given
family, there can also be families that consist of a single printing.</p>
<p>Since many Modern Library titles remained in the series for decades and
were reprinted every year or two, a decision about the level of
bibliographical ordering to be attempted had to be made at the outset.
No attempt has been made to identify and describe every printing of
every title. Bibliographical ordering at this level may be justified in
a bibliography of the works of a single author or editions of a single
work. It would be impracticable—and not particularly useful—in a
bibliography of a series as large and long-lived as the Modern Library.
The first level of ordering in the bibliography is the identification of
editions as defined above. The second level of ordering is the
identification of families of printings within editions. States and
issues as defined above occur within specific printings; there are only
a few examples of these.</p>
<p>For each family of printings, the <em>earliest</em> printing seen has been
described. Modern Library books can be dated precisely or approximately
on the basis of several kinds of evidence. Books that include lists of
Modern Library titles in the back matter can usually be dated by spring
or fall of a given year. Between fall 1925 and spring 1967 these lists
were revised twice a year, and the current list was usually included in
books printed during a given season. (The list in the first Modern
Library printing of books printed from offset plates commonly appears
without change in later printings.) Modern Library jackets can be dated
on the basis of the lists of titles that were printed inside nearly all
jackets through 1963. The jacket date can provide useful (but not
conclusive) evidence as to the date of the book inside the jacket,
subject to the cautions noted below in the section on jackets. The
dating key can be used to date any list of Modern Library titles by
spring or fall of a given year.</p>
<p>The numbering system begins by identifying works published in the Modern
Library</p>
<p>in approximate chronological order as described above. This
bibliographic numbering system is distinct from the Modern Library
system. Numbers in the bibliography that are not preceded with an ML
pertain to the internal chronological numbering system. <em>Madame Bovary</em>
was the twenty-fifth title published in the Modern Library and has
remained in print in the series from 1917 to the present. The
bibliography number 25 is used for all regular Modern Library printings
of <em>Madame Bovary</em>. Modern Library printings of <em>Madame Bovary</em> between
1917 and 1991 fall into three editions numbered 25.1, 25.2 and 25.3.
Five families of printings have been identified within the first
edition, all based on partially or fully reset title pages. These are
numbered 25.1a through 25.1e. The Modern Library reset the work in 1927
creating the second edition. Three families of printings have been
identified within this edition, including a reset title page in 1940 and
the addition of an introduction by Henri Peyre in 1950. These are
numbered 25.2a, 25.2b and 25.2c. The first and second editions use the
Eleanor Marx Aveling translation; both typesettings were made for the
Modern Library. In 1957 Random House published <em>Madame Bovary</em> in a new
translation by Francis Steegmuller. Later that year the Modern Library
used the Random House plates for its first printing of the Steegmuller
translation, creating the third Modern Library edition. Three families
of Modern Library printings have been identified within the third
edition, including reset title pages in 1969/70 and 1978. These are
numbered 25.3a, 25.3b and 25.3c. All Modern Library printings within the
third edition are bibliographically part of the parent edition
originally published by Random House.</p>
<p>Several of the families within the Modern Library’s first edition of
<em>Madame Bovary</em> appear to have consisted of a single printing. The other
families of printings consist of multiple printings. Bibliographical
ordering at the level of families of printings makes it possible to see
how Modern Library printings of <em>Madame Bovary</em> evolved over a period of
seventy-five years and to place any copy of a Modern Library printing
unambiguously within a family of printings.</p>
<p>Most Modern Library titles exist in a single bibliographical edition.
For these titles the entry number begins with the number for the work
followed by letters designating families of printings. For <em>The
Philosophy of Spinoza</em>, three families of printings have been
identified, all within the same edition. These entries are numbered
136a, 136b and 136c.</p>
<p>The author believes that the first printing of every Modern Library
title has been examined and described (new evidence may prove this
belief to be unfounded). Subsequent families of printings are described
on the basis of the earliest printing examined; the dating of these
families and the identification of the earliest printing within each
will be improved on the basis of information that comes to light as a
result of the publication of this bibliography.</p>
<p>The printing and publishing history statement (see below) indicates
whether Modern Library printings were from newly set plates (in which
case the printings constitute an edition in their own right) or whether
the printings were from an original publisher’s plates (in which case
the printings constitute a subsidiary edition within the parent
edition).</p>
<p><strong>Binding and Jacket Variants</strong></p>
<p>The terms <em>issue</em> and <em>state</em> apply only to the sheets of a book within
a single printing. Binding and jacket variants have no bearing on
<em>state</em> and <em>issue</em> as correctly applied. The Modern Library did not
always bind an entire printing at the same time. A portion of a printing
could be stored as unbound sheets and cased as needed, with the result
that books printed at the same time are sometimes found in variant
bindings. Boni &amp; Liveright printings can be found in Modern Library,
Inc., bindings, for example. Cerf and Klopfer acquired the remaining
Boni &amp; Liveright stock when they bought the Modern Library in 1925. Most
of the books they acquired had not been cased; the sheets were folded
and sewn with Boni &amp; Liveright endpapers tipped onto the outer leaves.
Cerf and Klopfer had the sheets cased in the Modern Library, Inc.,
binding featuring the newly designed torchbearer device. They also
printed new Modern Library, Inc., jackets. There is one Boni &amp; Liveright
title that was discontinued shortly after 1925 and never reprinted by
Cerf and Klopfer, yet they printed a new jacket for it in which the
remaining Boni &amp; Liveright copies were sold.</p>
<p>The format and design of Modern Library titles, including binding and
jacket variants, are described as much as possible for the series as a
whole. The only descriptions of format and design in the entries are for
aspects unique to particular titles. The size of the books is indicated
only when it differs from the standard format (a few titles were
slightly larger so that they could be printed from original plates). The
Modern Library always used uniform binding designs and endpapers.
Endpapers are described only for the few titles that did not use the
standard endpapers of the period. Uniform jacket designs were used for
all titles through spring 1928 and for some newly published titles into
the 1930s. Descriptions of uniform jackets in the entries refer to the
illustrations where they are reproduced; text describing the work from
the front panel or jacket flap is reproduced in the entries. An attempt
has been made to note all of the variant jackets used within a given
family of printings.</p>
<p><strong>Elements of the Entry</strong></p>
<p><em>Heading</em>. The boldface heading includes the following elements: (1)
bibliography number; (2) author or editor; (3) title; (4) year of
publication followed by the year the Modern Library edition was
discontinued; (5) Modern Library catalogue number. The bibliography
number is unique to this bibliography. Modern Library catalogue numbers
were assigned by the publisher and appear in the heading within
parentheses. Catalogue numbers of discontinued titles were usually
reassigned the following season to newly published titles; some
catalogue numbers were used over the years for four or five titles. The
Modern Library occasionally changed a title’s catalogue number; in such
cases both numbers appear in the heading. Additional information about
the change appears in the publishing history notes.</p>
<p><em>Subheads for families of printings</em>. The boldface subhead for each
family of printings includes the following elements: (1) expanded
bibliography number identifying a specific family of printings, or
bibliography number in unexpanded form for Modern Library titles that do
not exist in multiple families of printings; (2) short description such
as <em>First printing</em>, <em>Text reset</em>, or <em>Introduction added</em>; (3) year of
first printing within a family of printings.</p>
<p><em>Title page transcription</em>. Title pages are described using
quasi-facsimile transcription. Quasi-facsimile transcription describes
each line of the title page. Lines may consist of text, rules,
ornaments, publisher’s devices, or an illustration. Line endings are
indicated by a vertical stroke [ | ]. References to specific lines
later in the entry are by line number; it is the reader’s responsibility
to ascertain the line number by counting the vertical strokes indicating
line endings. Quasi-facsimile transcriptions reproduce roman, <em>italic</em>,
script, and gothic types and distinguish capital and lowercase letters.
Full and small roman capitals are distinguished when both appear <em>in the
same line</em>. No further attempt is made to distinguish the size or style
of type. Rules, ornaments and illustrations are described in lowercase
type enclosed in square brackets. The word “rule” in square brackets
refers to a rule that extends the full width of the text page; any rule
shorter than this is described as a “short rule” and can range in length
from a few millimeters to nearly the full width of the text page.
Publisher’s devices such as the Boni &amp; Liveright device and the ML
torchbearer are identified with a reference to the illustrations where
they are reproduced. The description of a title page that is enclosed
entirely within a double rule-frame begins with a statement such as:
[within double rules]. A rule-frame is not regarded as a line of the
title page and the statement describing it is not followed by a vertical
stroke. The first line of the title page is the first line within a
rule-frame.</p>
<p><em>Pagination statement and collational formula</em>. The pagination statement
accounts for every page of the book and is based on the printed page
numerals in the book being described. Unnumbered pages at the beginning
or end of a sequence that can be inferred as part of a sequence of
numbered pages are indicated within square brackets. Unnumbered pages
that cannot be inferred as part of a sequence of numbered pages are
indicated as an italicized total within square brackets, as follows:
[<em>6</em>], 1–280 [281–282]. Unnumbered pages within a sequence of
numbered pages are not noted. Two characteristics found in some of the
pagination statements require explanation. When the Modern Library used
original publishers’ plates it sometimes added new matter to the
preliminaries without repaginating the preliminaries of the original
edition. The result could be two incompatible sequences of pagination in
the preliminaries. These have been transcribed as they appear following
the guidelines indicated above.</p>
<p>Leaves containing a fly title (a second half title preceding the opening
page of the text) have also presented problems. The fly title is
properly regarded as part of the text; when a fly title leaf is present,
the text usually begins with p. 3. Occasionally a fly title leaf cannot
be inferred as part of the text because the text begins with p. 1. In
such cases the fly title and its verso (usually blank) have been
transcribed as [<em>2</em>] following the guidelines for unnumbered pages
that cannot be inferred as part of a sequence of printed page numerals.</p>
<p>The collational formula appears after the pagination statement. The
collation indicates how the printed sheets were folded and how a given
book was physically put together. This information is primarily of
interest to professional bibliographers, but it also reveals useful
information about trends in printing and bookmaking practices over the
course of the twentieth century. Gatherings in Modern Library books are
rarely signed and the number of gatherings is indicated by numerals
within square brackets. The number of leaves in each gathering is
indicated in superscript numerals outside the square brackets. Abnormal
gatherings with inserted or canceled leaves are recorded using
conventional formulas containing the symbols “+,” “-,” or “±.” A handful
of Modern Library books were printed from older plates containing
printed signatures. None of these was printed as signed and the printed
signatures are ignored in the collation.</p>
<p>Collational statements are customary in scholarly bibliographies of
early printed books. Many bibliographers consider them less important
for bibliographies of twentieth century books and they are commonly
omitted. I would like to add a personal statement in support of their
value. Collations are intensely time consuming: the bibliographer has to
go through each book leaf by leaf to determine the number of gatherings
and the number of leaves in each. In most Modern Library books the
gatherings consist of 8, 16, or 32 leaves. A leaf is a physical unit of
a book that can be grasped between the thumb and forefinger; each leaf
has two pages, the recto and the verso. Rectos are odd-numbered pages,
versos are even-numbered pages. A gathering of 8 leaves consists of 16
pages; a gathering of 16 leaves consists of 32 pages. Not all pages have
printed page numbers. Before “perfect” (glued) bindings became the norm
in the American trade publishing industry, most hardbound books were
sewn. If you open a book at the center of a gathering you can see the
thread in the gutter. To compile the collational formula, the
bibliographer examines a book leaf by leaf, noting the thread in the
center of a gathering, and noting the number of gatherings. If the total
number of leaves in a book is not a multiple of 8, 16, or 32, gatherings
at the beginning or end of the volume may have fewer leaves than the
rest of the volume. Leaves at the end of the volume that are not needed
for a book’s printed content may be left blank; with Modern Library
books they were often used for lists of titles.</p>
<p>Going through a book with great care and noting the number of leaves in
each gathering is a time-consuming process. When I decided to include
collations in the bibliography, I had already done title-page
transcriptions and pagination statements for the books in my own
collection and those of two other major Modern Library collectors I had
the benefit of examining during the early stages of the project. Doing
the collations for the books in my own collection took about a year.
This work was worthwhile in three respects. First, it gave me a level of
intimacy with the books as physical objects that a bibliographer ideally
should have. Second, it saved me from several errors in recording
paginations. The pagination statement records the total number of pages
in a book, whether or not the pages are numbered; the collation records
the total number of leaves. When correctly recorded, the number of pages
is twice the number of leaves. When the Modern Library printed from
original publisher’s plates but added material unique to the Modern
Library edition such as a new introduction, it was sometimes necessary
to omit or add leaves in order to make the ML printing fit a typical
8-leaf format. Third, it revealed trends in printing practices over the
course of the twentieth century.</p>
<p><em>List of contents</em>. The list of contents amplifies the pagination
statement by indicating the contents of every page of the book,
including blank pages. Some statements in the contents list employ
quasi-facsimile transcription (for example: v–xiii; INTRODUCTION signed
p. xiii: <span class="smallcaps">Pearl S. Buck</span>). Generic
statements in the contents list are entirely in lower-case letters (for
example: [<em>1</em>] half title; [i] title; 3–[375] text; [376]
blank); any statement entirely in lower-case letters is not part of a
quasi-facsimile transcription. Lists of Modern Library titles in volumes
published after August 1925 are dated by spring or fall of a given year.
The date appears in parentheses following the list of contents. Except
for books printed from offset plates, lists of titles in Modern Library
books were normally updated in each printing. Any Modern Library list
from fall 1925 on can be dated using the dating key.</p>
<p>The verso of the title page is subject to greater change from one
printing to another than any other part of Modern Library books except
for lists of Modern Library titles, which from 1925 to 1963 were updated
twice a year. The verso of the title page is described selectively in
the contents list. Publication and manufacturing statements are only
noted when they are the <em>only</em> printed matter on the page. Copyright
statements are given in full using quasi-facsimile transcription, as are
<em>First</em> statements such as “First Printing” or “FIRST <em>Modern Library</em>
EDITION.” From fall 1925 on it was customary for first Modern Library
printings to include a <em>First</em> statement on the verso of the title page.
<em>First</em> statements were normally removed after the first printing, but
there are numerous examples of <em>First</em> statements that were retained
through two or more printings. The retention of <em>First</em> statements on
later printings is noted whenever this has been observed. If not noted
otherwise, it should be assumed that the <em>First</em> statement was removed
from subsequent printings within a family. Not all first printings of
Modern Library titles had a <em>First</em> statement. If a <em>First</em> statement is
not noted in the description of the first printing it can be assumed
that the first printing lacked such a statement. The presence or absence
of a <em>First</em> statement is never conclusive evidence of priority in
Modern Library printings.</p>
<p>Except for books printed from offset plates, Modern Library lists in the
back matter usually offer the most conclusive evidence for dating a
printing. Books printed from offset plates generally did not include
these lists because they were produced from photographic copies of
earlier printings. The lists would have been outdated and were excluded.</p>
<p><em>Variant printings</em>. Subsequent printings within a family of printings
that vary significantly from the printing described are noted in an
indented paragraph headed <em>Variant</em>. If more than one variant printing
has been noted, the indented paragraphs are headed <em>Variant A</em>, <em>Variant
B</em>, etc. Most variants result from a change in the total number of
leaves, a change in the pagination statement because of the removal of a
battered page numeral from the plates, or a change in the copyright
statement. Variants within a family of printings that are encountered
routinely are not noted. These include changes in Modern Library lists
in the back matter (including the allocation of pages in the back matter
between lists and blank pages), changes in publisher’s notes, and
changes in the collational formula that do not result from a change in
the number of leaves. (It was common for the plates to be imposed
differently from one Modern Library printing to another. Modern Library
books were printed initially in 8’s, then in 16’s, then mostly in 32’s.
A gathering printed in 16’s in one printing might be printed as two 8’s
in another printing. Books that did not consist of an even multiple of
sixteen leaves usually placed the gathering of four, eight, or twelve
leaves at the end of the book until the late 1940s when such gatherings
began to appear in the penultimate position followed by a gathering in
16’s.</p>
<p><em>Contents note</em>. A contents note headed <em>Contents</em> lists the works
included in original Modern Library collections and anthologies unless
these have been fully listed in the list of contents. I have used the
term “collection” to refer to a volume consisting of multiple works by a
single author, and the word “anthology” to refer to a volume consisting
of the works of multiple authors. (As noted above, the “List of
contents” is primarily concerned with the physical make-up of a book and
accounts for the contents of every page. The “Contents note” is
concerned solely with intellectual contents and does not indicate page
numbers.) Some contents notes for poetry anthologies list the poets
included and the number of poems by each but do not attempt to list
individual poems by title.</p>
<p><em>Jackets</em>. Jacket descriptions appear in separate paragraphs headed
<em>Jacket</em>. Each jacket design used within a family of printings is
described separately; if there are multiple jackets, the paragraphs are
headed <em>Jacket A</em>, <em>Jacket B</em>, etc. Uniform typographic jacket designs
are identified with reference to structure and composition. Other
jackets are described individually. Jacket descriptions include enough
information to distinguish successive jackets within a family of
printings but do not fully describe each jacket. Most descriptions of
individually designed jackets describe the front panel only; the jacket
spine is described when it differs significantly from the design of the
front panel. Colors have been described according to <em>ISCC-NBS
Color-Name Charts Illustrated with Centroid Colors</em> published by the
National Bureau of Standards. Back panels of Modern Library jackets were
uniform; successive back panel designs are described and illustrated in
the section on format and design.</p>
<p>Jacket descriptions transcribe the descriptive paragraphs about the
work. These descriptive paragraphs appeared on the front panel of
uniform typographic jackets used from 1917 through spring 1928 and on
the front flap of jackets from fall 1933 on. (Jackets printed from fall
1928 through spring 1933 had brief blurbs on the front panel but no
descriptive paragraphs about the work.) The descriptive paragraphs
sometimes indicate why a work was included in the Modern Library and
provide valuable information about how canonical and semi-canonical
works were presented to American readers at given periods. Descriptive
paragraphs for works that remained in the Modern Library for decades
were commonly rewritten several times. The transcription of successive
descriptive paragraphs for a work like <em>Madame Bovary</em>, which was in the
Modern Library since 1917, can be especially interesting.</p>
<p>Beginning in fall 1953, the text on the flaps and back panels of Modern
Library jackets was reset in sans-serif type. Most of the descriptive
paragraphs were reset without change but some were extensively rewritten
and others were slightly revised. Major changes are fully described. An
attempt has been made to incorporate minor revisions in the
transcriptions of the original paragraphs using square brackets around
alterations together with the symbols “-,” “+,” and “±” to indicate
deletions from the original text and additions or substitutions in the
reset text.</p>
<p>Jackets from fall 1925 through fall 1963 included a complete list of
current Modern Library titles that were updated twice a year. Each
printing of Modern Library jackets used the current list. Jacket
descriptions from fall 1925 through fall 1963 are dated by spring or
fall of a given year on the basis of the list of titles. Any Modern
Library jacket containing a list of titles can be dated using the dating
key. It must be remembered that a date assigned to a jacket does not
conclusively date the book inside the jacket. Most Modern Library
printings were distributed with newly printed jackets that correspond to
the date of the printing, but there were occasions when older jackets
were used on at least some copies of a printing. At one period in the
1930s, Modern Library sales representatives carried stocks of
replacement jackets so they could freshen Modern Library displays in
bookstores; sales representatives were encouraged to offer to freshen
Modern Library stocks as a way of getting their foot in the door when
booksellers protested they did not need additional books. Switching
jackets from one copy of a book to another has always been a common
practice among collectors and booksellers. The only reasonably certain
way of dating a given printing of a Modern Library book is by means of a
Modern Library list at the end of the book. But not all titles or all
printings of a given title include Modern Library lists. And while lists
at the end of the book were normally updated in each printing from
letterpress plates, lists in books printed from offset plates were not
always updated.</p>
<p><em>Printing and publishing history statement and sources</em>. A paragraph
with printing and publishing history information follows the
bibliographical description. The original American publisher is
identified for modern works. Modern Library printings have been compared
with the original publisher’s printings to ascertain the source of the
plates. For titles printed from an original publisher’s plates, the
precise pages printed from the plates are identified, making it easy to
distinguish content that is original to Modern Library printings.
Content omitted from original publishers’ printings (such as
illustrations, introductions or indexes) is also noted. The phrase
“printed from newly set plates” indicates that the Modern Library
printed from plates made from an original typesetting; Modern Library
printings from newly set plates constitute a new bibliographical edition
as defined above. The publication date as announced by the Modern
Library is indicated; the date is rarely more precise than the month or
season of a given year. Following the announced publication date is the
date the Modern Library edition was listed in the “Weekly Record”
section of <em>Publishers’ Weekly</em>, designated with the initials <em>WR</em>. The
next element of the printing and publishing history statement is the
number of copies in the first Modern Library printing, if this has been
ascertained. The last element is the date the Modern Library edition was
discontinued, if applicable.</p>
<p>The publishing history notes are based primarily on research in the
Random House archives at Columbia University Library. Other archival
collections consulted include the Horace Liveright Papers at the
University of Pennsylvania Library, Boni &amp; Liveright archives in the
possession of the W. W. Norton Co., and several other manuscript
collections. The publishing history notes include information about
reprint negotiations, financial arrangements with original publishers,
negotiations with authors of introductions, and information on
printings, and sales. The information provided under each entry varies
according to which records survived in the archival collections
consulted. Collectively the publishing history notes make a significant
contribution to our knowledge of twentieth-century reprint publishing.</p>
