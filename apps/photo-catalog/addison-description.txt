 In 2005 Dan Addison joined The University of Virginia where he currently is the lead staff photographer. He covers news events and sports and also does portraits of faculty, staff and students. Dan can often be seen strolling the Grounds of UVa documenting student life and capturing dramatic images of perhaps the most scenic and historic universities in the US.
 These photos are his originals from photo shoots of events and people on the grounds of UVA.
