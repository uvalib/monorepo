their duties to the states they represented.<hi rend="sup">1</hi><lb/>
After this preliminary overview, the authors explore the historical context in <lb/>
a second article published in the <hi rend="italic">Georgetown Journal of Law &amp; Public Policy</hi> (<hi rend="smallcaps">GJLPP</hi>).<lb/>
Here they narrow down its dates to 1785–1787 and discuss how it figured in <lb/>
the deliberations of the Constitutional Convention. They note the possibility <lb/>
that it had belonged to Charles Lennox, third duke of Richmond (1735–1806), <lb/>
whose family seat was not far from Chichester. Richmond was an advocate of the <lb/>
American cause, a proponent of parliamentary reform, and a tenacious member <lb/>
of the opposition sympathetic to the ideals enunciated in the Declaration. Allen <lb/>
and Sneff make other conjectures in those two articles and expand on them in <lb/>
statements to the press. They refer to the manuscript as the <hi rend="italic">Sussex Declaration</hi> <lb/>
and I will too, although I disagree with them about its origins and significance.<hi rend="sup">2</hi><lb/>
While the <hi rend="italic">PBSA</hi> article was being prepared for publication, they issued a press <lb/>
release on 20 April 2017 in collaboration with a Communications Officer at Har-<lb/>
vard University. Within days, articles about the Sussex Declaration appeared in <lb/>
the <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Guardian</hi>, and the <hi rend="italic">Washington Post</hi>. A CBS television crew <lb/>
showed up at the West Sussex Record Office to film the document on site. A <lb/>
Wikipedia article about the “physical history” of the Declaration cites two of the <lb/>
newspaper reports as well as the press release, which can still be found online in <lb/>
Danielle Allen’s Declaration Resources Project website. They elaborate on their <lb/>
hypotheses in a lecture at the National Archives broadcast by C-SPAN on 6 July <lb/>
2017 and recapitulated in the online <hi rend="italic">National Archives News</hi> with a link to a You-<lb/>
Tube version of the lecture. There and in other media appearances they speculate <lb/>
that Thomas Paine may have been an intermediary responsible for bringing the <lb/>
Sussex Declaration to the duke of Richmond. Their claims are less explicit in the <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> article, which only queries the connection with Paine and Rich-<lb/>
mond. Performing due diligence, however, the reporter consulted outside experts <lb/>
such as a legal historian who observed that even if their attribution to Wilson is <lb/>
wrong, an early manuscript of the Declaration is still “the discovery of a lifetime.”<hi rend="sup">3</hi><lb/>
At the end of the <hi rend="italic">PBSA</hi> article Allen and Sneff consider an alternative <lb/>
hypothesis: their document was based on a miniature facsimile Declaration <lb/>
printed in Boston in or after 1836 (figure&amp;nbsp;2). I brought that facsimile to their <lb/>

attention after they had sent me a preliminary draft of their article. No great<lb/>
amount of scrutiny was required to see that it was the source of the Sussex Dec-<lb/>
laration. The similarities in style and structure are obvious. In my view they are<lb/>
not dealing with a clerk who rearranged the signatures to fulfill Wilson’s politi-<lb/>
cal agenda but rather an amateur who transcribed the facsimile in an exercise of<lb/>
penmanship. But they submit that hypothesis only to dismiss it. Their rebuttal<lb/>
touches on several topics, mainly textual inconsistencies and a question of qual-<lb/>
ity: the facsimile was a mass-produced keepsake measuring no more than 5¾ by<lb/>
4½ inches. Why, they ask, would the clerk use such a paltry print to copy out a<lb/>
Declaration on this scale? They defend their position by pointing out anomalies<lb/>
in the layout of the facsimile not repeated in the manuscript, a transcription<lb/>
problem posed by the sequence of signatures. If the clerk had been copying the<lb/>
facsimile, they say, surely those anomalies would be present in the manuscript.<lb/>
So, what is the source of the Sussex Declaration: the parchment engrossed<lb/>
for the Continental Congress, signed by most of its members on 2 August 1776,<lb/>
the iconic document in the National Archives—or a cheap facsimile printed in<lb/>
Boston some sixty years later? What is the source of the Boston facsimile? In<lb/>
the following I will propose answers to those questions less glamorous than the<lb/>
hypotheses of Allen and Sneff but more consistent with the writing practices<lb/>
and design considerations involved in making a copy of the Declaration. Here,<lb/>
as in other bibliographical endeavors, the pure and simple physical evidence<lb/>
should prevail over less substantial arguments, no matter how many of them<lb/>
may be mustered against a few overriding objections. I will address the main<lb/>
arguments of the PBSA article, which is intended to establish the date of the<lb/>
Sussex Declaration. I will not be concerned with the GJLPP article, for it is<lb/>
entirely predicated on its predecessor and assumes that the alternative hypoth-<lb/>
esis has been refuted. If the dates they propose are not valid, then they cannot<lb/>
attribute it to James Wilson and cannot claim that Wilson used it during the<lb/>
Constitutional Convention.<lb/>
<head><hi rend="smallcaps">I</hi></head><lb/>
Allen and Sneff begin by recounting the provenance of the Sussex Declara-<lb/>
tion. They note that it was deposited in the WSRO by a local solicitor whose firm<lb/>
had done business with the Richmond family. A WSRO archivist told them that<lb/>
the solicitor once had his pick of the family papers that had been entrusted to the<lb/>
firm since the eighteenth century, but were discarded in bulk sometime before<lb/>
1956. Indeed, the finding list of the deposit mentions two or three items relating<lb/>
to the family but they are so scattered and insignificant that it is hard to believe<lb/>
that they came from a trove dating back to the eighteenth century. The deposit<lb/>
is clearly the gleanings of a local history collector who found a few curiosities in<lb/>
his office and kept anything else that caught his eye. The finding list relegates the<lb/>
Sussex Declaration to a miscellaneous section at the end where it is accompanied<lb/>
by an 1828 legal opinion about a conveyance to the duke of Richmond’s trustees,<lb/>
checks drawn on a London bank in the 1840s and 1850s, an advertisement of a<lb/>
London dyer active ca. 1844, a list of the kings and queens of England, and a<lb/>
<pb n="116"/>
<p>
<lb/>1750 letter from the bell ringers of Chichester. With the exception of the letter,<lb/>nothing in this section has a secure date earlier than 1825. Nonetheless a WSRO<lb/>archivist dated the Declaration in the late eighteenth century, an educated guess<lb/>for cataloguing purposes, but Allen and Sneff make it a starting point of their<lb/>exposition in <hi rend="italic">PBSA</hi>.<lb/>
They find additional evidence in the physical features of the Sussex Declara-<lb/>tion. They note that it was written on a large size of parchment suitable for ex-<lb/>hibition and that it has nail holes in the corners as if it had been displayed at one<lb/>point. On the advice of conservators they concede that the nails might have been<lb/>meant to restrain the parchment for other purposes. They view the square shape<lb/>of the nail holes as evidence for a date in the eighteenth century, but the source<lb/>they cite contradicts their conclusions. Yes, early hand-wrought iron nails were<lb/>square but so were the cut nails produced in British and American factories dur-<lb/>ing the first half of the nineteenth century. Wire nails, which would have made<lb/>round holes in the parchment, were not introduced until the 1850s in America or<lb/>a bit earlier in England. The parchment was made of a middling-quality sheep-<lb/>skin. They contend that it was “well prepared,” which may be so, but a Library<lb/>of Congress conservation report graded it below a more prepossessing calfskin<lb/>document they had brought in for comparison.<hi rend="sup">4</hi><lb/>
The Sussex Declaration may have been put on view, but then it was filed<lb/>away and forgotten. It was folded twice for storage, in which state it became<lb/>severely soiled on one side, badly abraded along the folds with loss of text, and<lb/>seriously damaged on the outer edge of the four leaves with loss of parchment.<lb/>As to the edge damage, Allen and Sneff admit that a rodent could be to blame<lb/>but believe it is more likely that a seal had been removed (<hi rend="italic">PBSA</hi>, p.&amp;nbsp;362). In that<lb/>case, however, the two outer leaves would have suffered more than the two in-<lb/>ner leaves. When I saw it at the WSRO, the depredations seemed to me to be<lb/>uniform on each of the four leaves. They do not explain what function a seal<lb/>would have served and why it would have been removed. But those conjectures<lb/>are beside the point because the parchment was then folded a third time as if<lb/>it had been demoted to an even smaller storage space. These signs of abuse<lb/>and neglect are hard to square with their contention that it was a “ceremonial”<lb/>manuscript, a word used repeatedly in the <hi rend="italic">PBSA</hi><lb/>article to signify the ambitious<lb/>intentions of those who produced it. In the <hi rend="italic">GJLPP</hi> article they use the word even<lb/>more frequently to express its iconic function and the innovative ideas of James<lb/>Wilson, who used it to elaborate his views on the Constitution. If it was owned<lb/>by Richmond, then it must have fallen out of favor in a bad way to end up in<lb/>that ignominious condition.<lb/>
The title has some words in black letter, but the text is mostly in a utilitar-<lb/>ian round hand, which Allen and Sneff attribute to a clerk employed by Wilson.<lb/>It cannot be assigned to a prominent politician although they have examined<lb/>the writings of likely candidates and their amanuenses as well. They notice the<lb/><hi rend="sup">4</hi> Preservation Directorate, Library of Congress, “Advanced Image Processing of Mul-<lb/>tispectral Images of the Sussex Declaration,” Declaration Resources Project website; Lee H.<lb/>Nelson, “Nail Chronology as an Aid to Dating Old Buildings,” <hi rend="italic">History News</hi> 23<lb/>(1968), 203–14.

absence of the long s prevalent in manuscripts of this period, but they believe<lb/>
that the clerk was one of the “stylistic radicals” who had dropped that usage.<lb/>
They do not mention that Wilson sometimes used a long s in his drafts of the<lb/>
Constitution, apparently more conservative in his writing practices than his hired<lb/>
hand. Arguing for the American origins of the manuscript, they compare it with<lb/>
contemporary deeds and indentures, some reproduced in the PBSA article, some<lb/>
in the Declaration Resources Project website. They detect stylistic features more<lb/>
likely to be local than to come from England, but to my mind the sample is too<lb/>
small to be convincing. Their morphological analysis of the document has been<lb/>
more useful for their purposes than the script itself, which is difficult to date.<lb/>
Allen and Sneff assert that the clerk made several drafts before completing the<lb/>
“final fair copy” of this manuscript (PBSA, p. 367). They perceive a certain<lb/>
amount of effort expended to produce a symmetrical composition, uniform line<lb/>
endings, no word breaks, and other artistic touches worthy of a document in-<lb/>
tended for display. Nonetheless the clerk botched the job at the beginning and<lb/>
made it worse while trying to correct it. He began to write a date in the same<lb/>
size and style of the black letter “In Congress” on the first line of the title but<lb/>
then thought better of it and began to rub out his mistake. His erasure merely<lb/>
smudged his work leaving remnants of that date easily apparent at first sight. For<lb/>
Allen and Sneff this was an opportunity for further scientific investigation, the<lb/>
results of which are posted on the Declaration Resources Project website and<lb/>
summarized in the PBSA article. They commissioned various tests using imaging<lb/>
techniques and other digital technologies to scrutinize the erasure. In the docu-<lb/>
mentation they received they see evidence that the erased date referred to when<lb/>
the clerk was working on the manuscript: either “July 4, 178” or “July 4, 179,”<lb/>
the last digit indecipherable. Starting on the fair copy, forgetting the momentous<lb/>
date of Independence, the clerk made an absent-minded slip of the pen as if he<lb/>
was thinking about his present circumstances instead of his assignment to rein-<lb/>
terpret the Declaration.<lb/>
The technical reports on the website are inconclusive and are mostly about<lb/>
methodology. A Library of Congress conservator considered the possibility that<lb/>
the third digit in the erased date might be an 8 or 9 but was not willing to com-<lb/>
mit to that reading. I believe there is an easier explanation. Yes, the clerk made<lb/>
a mistake but when and why did he try to fix it? It is more likely that the clerk<lb/>
forgot the July 4, 1776, date while copying out the text, and then went back to<lb/>
write it on the first line next to “In Congress.” Then he realized that this stopgap<lb/>
measure would spoil the symmetrical composition and erased his work, decid-<lb/>
ing instead to insert the missing date between the first and second lines, obvi-<lb/>
ously an afterthought. He had to break it up at either end of the title and cut it<lb/>
down to a size that would fit between the lines. He used a similarly compressed<lb/>
cursive to mend a mistake in the fifth line of text, correcting the word “when”<lb/>
 to “whenever.” This sequence of events explains the smudged title, the inserted<lb/>
date, and the amateurish script. Other mistakes provide opportunities for Allen<lb/>
and Sneff to devise an elaborate argument for the early origins and historical<lb/>
significance of the Sussex Declaration. These too can be explained by viewing<lb/>
them in a bibliographical context, a means of understanding the copying process<lb/>
in manuscript and print.<lb/>
<pb n="118"/>
<p>The bibliographical record begins in 1776 with the broadside printed in the shop <lb/>
of John Dunlap and continues through the eighteenth century with its letter-<lb/>
press progeny in newspapers and broadsides. In the nineteenth century, however, <lb/>
Americans turned to the engrossed Declaration for a validation of their republi-<lb/>
can beliefs and an affirmation of their national identity. They could buy copies <lb/>
of the manuscript reproduced the way they wanted to see it, more as an object of <lb/>
veneration than an artifact of history. They expected the text to be accurate, of <lb/>
course, but they also sought to enhance its meaning with patriotic imagery, ar-<lb/>
tistic interventions maybe strange to our eyes yet perfectly compatible with their <lb/>
concept of a facsimile. New and improved intaglio, letterpress, and lithographic <lb/>
printing technologies helped them to realize its iconic potential in copiously or-<lb/>
namented allegorical compositions, some intended to be works of art, others di-<lb/>
rected toward the bottom of the market. Good and bad, each of these prints has <lb/>
a publication history, which can tell us why some were not reliable, what went <lb/>
wrong with them, and how they caused the mistakes in the Sussex Declaration.<lb/></p>
<p>Benjamin Owen Tyler and John Binns were the first to issue facsimiles of the <lb/>
Declaration. Tyler was a writing master, Binns a newspaper publisher, each in <lb/>
his own way well qualified to produce and market patriotic prints. Tyler stole a <lb/>
march on Binns, who had issued proposals in March&amp;nbsp;1816 but allowed his artists <lb/>
to take their time and did not finish his version until October&amp;nbsp;1819. Tyler issued <lb/>
his in May&amp;nbsp;1818 at half the price his rival had announced. And as a further provo-<lb/>
cation, he launched an advertising campaign capitalizing on an endorsement he <lb/>
had received from Thomas Jefferson. Binns took the bait and complained about <lb/>
the interloper’s exploitive tactics. Quick to take offense, eager for publicity, the <lb/>
facsimilists fought a newspaper war extolling the beauty and accuracy of their <lb/>
products while attacking the character, honesty, and patriotism of their adversar-<lb/>
ies. Both obtained impressive certificates of authenticity, Tyler from the Acting <lb/>
Secretary of State Richard Rush, Binns from Secretary of State John Quincy <lb/>
Adams. Both embellished the text in styles fashionable at that time. Tyler showed <lb/>
off his skills in penmanship by transcribing the text in ornamental scripts, some <lb/>
more elaborate than others but reaching a rhetorical crescendo in the “emphati-<lb/>
cal words” at the end. Binns opted for an allegorical design, an oval “cordon of <lb/>
honor” composed of state seals surrounding the text and surmounted by symbols <lb/>
of prosperity next to medallion portraits of Washington, Hancock and Jefferson. <lb/>
The fifty-six signatures beneath the text were the only portions of these prints <lb/>
rendered in what we would consider a facsimile, Tyler’s truer to the original than <lb/>
Binns’s, both with distinctive traits that make them easily identifiable. The writ-<lb/>
ing master improved some of the signatures, unconsciously correcting marks of <lb/>
infirmity and haste. The signatures in the allegorical print had to be truncated <lb/>
in places to fit in that crowded composition.<hi rend="sup">5</hi><lb/></p>

<p><hi rend="dropcap">I</hi>n 1823 John Quincy Adams commissioned an official government facsimile<lb/>
of the entire manuscript, a state-of-the-art replica expertly engraved by William<lb/>
J.&amp;nbsp;Stone. It is the definitive record of the original, which suffered so much mis-<lb/>
treatment and neglect that it is now barely legible. Printed on parchment in a<lb/>
limited edition, the Stone facsimile did not circulate as widely as the Binns and<lb/>
Tyler facsimiles, which were copied, imitated, and adapted well into the 1890s.<lb/>
Even a restrike on imitation parchment could not compete with prints deco-<lb/>
rated with allegorical vignettes, patriotic emblems, and portraits of Founding<lb/>
Fathers. As much as one would expect these decorations to defeat the function<lb/>
of a facsimile, this style did not go out of fashion until the end of the century.<lb/>
Then, finally, the unadorned Stone facsimile came into its own and became the<lb/>
standard visualization of the document, the source of reproductions published<lb/>
by the government, expounded in textbooks, sold as souvenirs, and printed on<lb/>
Independence Day in the New&amp;nbsp;York&amp;nbsp;Times.<hi rend="sup">6</hi></p>

<p>Facsimile signatures derived either from Binns or Tyler appear in more than<lb/>
ninety prints during the nineteenth century. The chain of transmission can be<lb/>
complicated, a multistage process with some prints acting as intermediaries, oth-<lb/>
ers deriving the signatures from reproductions in illustrated books. Nonetheless,<lb/>
they all belong to those two families. With one exception, publishers paid no<lb/>
attention to the Stone signatures until just before the Centennial. At least eighty<lb/>
prints have an ornamental border of state seals directly or indirectly based on<lb/>
Binns’s “cordon of honor,” a versatile design motif easily adapted to include<lb/>
additional pictorial matter. No less popular, Tyler’s “emphatical” rendition of<lb/>
the text inspired at least twenty-seven imitations in letterpress, intaglio, and<lb/>
lithography. The New&amp;nbsp;York map and print publisher Horace Thayer incorpo-<lb/>
rated Tyler’s lettering in lithographs ca.&amp;nbsp;1859–1863, large allegorical composi-<lb/>
tions including state seals, the American eagle, and a miniature reproduction<lb/>

1839. Most surviving copies are on folded imitation parchment, although some are unfolded,<lb/>
possibly because Stone or Force sold them separately. The American Antiquarian Society has a<lb/>

<p><hi rend="dropcap">B</hi>eginning in the 1830s Boston publishers experimented with combinations<lb/>
of the Binns border and the Tyler text. The earliest attempt to my knowledge is<lb/>
a letterpress broadside produced by the Boston Bewick Company around 1834–<lb/>
1836. A compositor copied Tyler’s title inasmuch as the first words <hi rend="italic">In Congress,<lb/> July 4, 1776</hi> are set in a curve at the top of the print. The facsimile signatures<lb/>
are part of that family as well as the text, which is printed in a script type inter-<lb/>
spersed with ornamental types imitating the “emphatical words.” The display<lb/>
faces include black letter, a bold Antique, and two sizes of open shaded caps. The<lb/>
state seals are in the style of the Binns print and its derivatives, although they are<lb/>
shaped like a rectangular frame rather than an oval border. But here too the seals<lb/>
provide a symbolic entourage for the text, each occupying a compartment inside<lb/>
intertwining oak-leaf and olive garlands with the national seal at the center. It<lb/>
easily outdoes other letterpress broadsides in design and execution but it was<lb/>
intended to be cheap. One version was priced 12½  cents in the imprint. Another<lb/>
version was published by Prentiss Whitney, a Boston auctioneer who had a small<lb/>
printmaking business on the side. The Bewick firm had it stereotyped, no doubt<lb/>
as a steady selling product but also as a giveaway specimen of its fancy job print-<lb/>
ing and stereotyping services. The New York print dealers Phelps &amp; Squire ob-<lb/>
tained a stereotype copy of the state seals frame, replaced the national seal with<lb/>
a portrait of Washington, and reset the text in the same style for an adaptation<lb/>
issued around 1835–1837. Phelps in another partnership, Phelps &amp; Ensign, used<lb/>
a stereotype plate of the entire print to replenish his stock of Declarations around<lb/>
1838–1842. Stationers’ Hall, an office supplies store in Boston, published a letter-<lb/>
press imitation with the same script type, a similar title design, and a rudimentary<lb/>
border of state seals jumbled together with portraits, ornaments, and recycled<lb/>
illustrations on patriotic themes. No doubt other reprints and imitations have yet<lb/>
to be identified. Boston Bewick’s intermarriage of two Declaration families must<lb/>
have had numerous offspring through the stereotyping endeavors of the firm.<lb/></p>

History of America’s Founding Document</hi> (2024), published while this essay was in its final stages of<lb/>
editing and revision. The checklist describes nearly two hundred prints and broadsides pub-<lb/>

facsimiles in “American History in Image and Text,” <hi rend="italic">Proceedings of the American Antiquarian<lb/>
Society</hi> 98 (1988), 247–302. At that time I was able to describe forty-eight typical examples, not<lb/>
just the facsimiles but also broadside editions of the Declaration. So far the only instance of the<lb/>
Stone signatures I have found before the Centennial period, besides the restrikes mentioned<lb/>
above, is an anastatic transfer print published in 1846. Copies are in the Library of Congress,<lb/>
the Boston Athenaeum, and the Independence National Historical Park.<lb/></note>

made his living as a reporter in the office of the Associated Press. After just over <lb/>
ten years in journalism, he resumed the printing business, taking on small jobs <lb/>
at various New York addresses until he died in 1883. An obituary indicates that <lb/>
he had been more than a mere journeyman and was “well-known” for his print-<lb/>
ing work in Boston. He was prominent enough to have taken out the copyright <lb/>
for one of Boston Bewick’s stereotype ventures. Among other achievements he <lb/>
published an engraved miniature facsimile of the Declaration very popular in <lb/>
its day. It reached a wide public in Boston and New York—and may have even <lb/>
gone as far as England. I believe it to be the source of the Sussex Declaration.<hi rend="sup">9</hi><lb/>

<head>III</head><lb/>
<p>Dated 1836, the copyright statement in Bridgham’s facsimile contains his name, <lb/>
but otherwise it is difficult to determine what role he took in its design and pro-<lb/>
duction. Perhaps he had the idea to make a miniature facsimile, a tour de force <lb/>
of lettering and engraving printed on coated paper, all the better to display the <lb/>
precision craftsmanship of the artists he employed. He probably knew about pre-<lb/>
vious attempts to sell Declaration novelties in unusual formats such as prints on <lb/>
silk or satin and, most notably, a commemorative handkerchief priced at a dollar <lb/>
in 1826. Other types of pocket curiosities had already found a ready market in <lb/>
America—portrait miniatures, miniature silver toys, and thumb Bibles, just to <lb/>
mention a few examples. By catering to this fashion, he started a trend soon to <lb/>
be taken to an extreme by the Philadelphia bank note engraver Charles Toppan, <lb/>
who downsized the Declaration to fit inside a 2 by 3 inch card on coated stock, <lb/>
a promotional keepsake first issued in 1840.<hi rend="sup">10</hi><lb/></p>

<p>Bridgham’s design is almost entirely based on the Boston Bewick Company<lb/>
facsimile. The most obvious borrowings can be seen in the facsimile signatures,<lb/>
the state seals in an oak-leaf and olive-wreath border, the curvature of the title,<lb/>
and the “emphatical words” in the text. Some adjustments had to be made to<lb/>
extrapolate these design elements from a large letterpress broadside, and there<lb/>
was one change in iconography—a portrait of Washington was substituted for<lb/>
the national seal—but Bridgham was clearly indebted to his former employer<lb/>
for the concept and layout of his facsimile. Surely it is no coincidence that he<lb/>
published it just after he left that firm. Intaglio was not his medium, but he would<lb/>
have learned about it while on the job and would have understood its potential<lb/>
for delineating fine detail in miniatures. His model, the letterpress broadside, he<lb/>
would have known from hands-on experience in the stereotype foundry or the<lb/>
pressroom. The Boston Bewick Company gave him the means and the motiva-<lb/>
tion to take on this project at a turning point in his career.</p>
<p>The timing of his publication could not have been better. In 1837 a Boston<lb/>
gallery presented a life-size tableau of mannequins reenacting the ratification<lb/>
of the Declaration, each of the fifty-six Signers dressed in period costume. A<lb/>
broadside advertisement assured the public that it was not a painting, although<lb/>
the scene seems to have been based on Trumbull’s Declaration of Independence.<lb/>
The Committee of Five takes center stage, Franklin to the left of Jefferson, Adams to<lb/>
his right, Livingston and Sherman behind them, while Jefferson submits the com-<lb/>
mittee’s text to the president of Congress. This inspiring spectacle could be seen<lb/>
for twenty-five cents, children half price, from eight in the morning until ten at<lb/>
night. If anyone wanted to take away a souvenir, the Bridgham facsimile would<lb/>
have been easily available at that time and just the right size for that purpose.<lb/>
Indeed it was reprinted in 1839 with the border reworked yet again to change the<lb/>
title and replace the Washington portrait with Trumbull’s Declaration.<hi rend="sup">11</hi></p>
<p>The text portion of Bridgham’s print determined the lettering in another<lb/>
Boston edition, which also incorporated Trumbull’s Declaration. Published by<lb/>
the Franklin Print Company in 1838, this one was more than twice the size of<lb/>
the miniature, with a more elaborate oak-leaf border containing twenty-six state<lb/>
seals, the national seal, and portraits of the presidents. It contains a competent<lb/>
reproduction of the Asher B. Durand print after Trumbull’s first version of the<lb/>
painting (to be precise, the painting now in the Yale University Art Gallery, not<lb/>
the second version in the Capitol Rotunda or the third version in the Wadsworth<lb/>
Atheneum) as well as a key to the print consisting of forty-eight numbered outline<lb/>
figures. Numbered facsimile signatures identify each of the figures. The Franklin<lb/>
Print Company credited the pictorial part to the engraver Denison Kimberly,<lb/>
the lettering to John B. Bolton. Although reformatted for different proportions,<lb/></p>

wrote the text for Bridgham, but he does not appear in Boston city directories <lb/>
until 1838, and I have not found other examples of his calligraphic writing that <lb/>
might confirm this supposition. By trade, however, he was an engraver, perhaps <lb/>
a specialist in script. He arrived in Boston in 1831 age twenty after emigrating <lb/>
from Halifax, Nova Scotia, and started to make his living from engraving in 1836, <lb/>
when Bridgham’s print was published. Whatever his connection with Bridgham <lb/>
and the Franklin firm, both prints were successful, and both were reworked for <lb/>
reprint editions. The latter reappeared with additional illustrations and furnished <lb/>

<p>Broadening his horizons, Bridgham may have brought copies of the minia-<lb/>

<hi rend="italic">Great Western</hi> steamship arriving in New York from Bristol in August 1838. His <lb/>
name is on the list along with merchants, men of the cloth, New York notables, <lb/>
wives, children, and servants. What business he might have had in England is <lb/>
impossible to ascertain, but he managed to travel in style on a recently launched <lb/>
Atlantic liner renowned for its size and speed. Perhaps his trip had something <lb/>
to do with a change in career during the late 1830s when he dropped out of the <lb/>
Boston directories. While exploring opportunities abroad, he could use his min-<lb/>
iature as a means of self-promotion, a calling card that could be carried about in <lb/>
quantity and presented as an example of American achievements in the graphic <lb/>
arts. With that in mind, Binns had already sent copies of his print to friends and <lb/>
customers in England, where it made “a highly favorable impression.”<hi rend="sup">13</hi><lb/></p>

<p>sober grace one would expect to see in a specimen of eighteenth-century running<lb/>
round hand. In the following, I will consider other aspects of his or her work, all<lb/>
of which must have come from Boston rather than the other way around. These<lb/>
remarks are not intended to be a point-by-point refutation of the <hi rend="smallcaps">PBSA</hi> article,<lb/>
but they counter the main arguments and provide a more convincing sequence<lb/>
of cause and effect.<lb/></p>
<p>Emphatical Words. The copyist wrote out in a larger script sixty-eight<lb/>
words of special significance, beginning, for example, with “Nature” and<lb/>
“Nature’s God” and ending with “Lives,” “Fortunes,” and “Honor.” Allen and Sneff notice<lb/>
that forty-four of those words correspond to Tyler’s “emphatical words,” a 65%<lb/>
correlation, a reason why they consider the Sussex manuscript to be a source<lb/>
for the facsimile. In a footnote they observe an almost one-to-one correspon-<lb/>
dence of “emphatical words” between the manuscript and the Bridgham print,<lb/>
a correlation I calculate at nearly 90%. Surely that is a more revealing statistic<lb/>
and demands an explanation, but they draw no conclusions in the footnote and<lb/>
concentrate on Tyler instead. They trace the fashion for the “emphatical words”<lb/>
back to the original 1776 engrossed Declaration, which capitalizes most of the<lb/>
substantives as a matter of course and sometimes switches from round hand to<lb/>
black letter for extra effect in the last paragraph. One could go back one step fur-<lb/>
ther and say that the black letter was a stylistic decision on the part of the scribe,<lb/>
Timothy Matlack, who sought to transpose in script some of the letterspaced caps<lb/>
and small caps he encountered in his source document, the Dunlap broadside.<lb/></p>
<p>In any case Allen and Sneff assume that the ornamental scripts in Tyler’s<lb/>
print were beyond his powers. They surmise that he must have consulted their<lb/>
manuscript or a now lost descendant of their manuscript while deciding which<lb/>
words to emphasize. They call him an engraver although he styles himself Profes-<lb/>
sor of Penmanship in the imprint, which states explicitly that the engraving had<lb/>
been done by Peter Maverick. This division of labor helps to explain the advertis-<lb/>
ing function of Tyler’s Declaration. He intended it to be a specimen of calligraphic<lb/>
skill, not just the utilitarian running hand he taught his students but also the<lb/>
decorative lettering he proffered as his professional credentials. American writing<lb/>
masters drummed up business by publishing engraved copybooks with title pages<lb/>
couched in a multitude of plain and fancy scripts. In 1815, while teaching in New<lb/>
York, Tyler promoted his system of instruction in a patriotic print also engraved<lb/>
by Maverick, <hi rend="italic">Eulogium Sacred to the Memory of the Illustrious George Washington</hi>. The<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Eulogium</hi> changes tone and tempo with calligraphic enhancements in selected<lb/>
passages of the text as well as embellished black letter in the title. He perfected<lb/>
that approach three years later when he produced his Declaration, fully capable<lb/>
of choosing the “emphatical words” on his own.<hi rend="sup">14</hi><lb/></p>
<p>This style of decorating the Declaration caught on immediately and remained<lb/>
in fashion throughout the nineteenth century. We have seen the succession of<lb/>
Boston editions, a step-by-step transmission of “emphatical words” from Tyler<lb/>
to Bridgham. If we are to accept that Tyler referred to the Sussex Declaration or<lb/></p>

<p>
a lost descendant when writing out his “emphatical words,” a 65% correlation,<lb/>
how are we to explain the 90% correlation in the Bridgham print? Bridgham’s<lb/>
artist would have had to be even more dependent on the Sussex Declaration,<lb/>
which would have somehow re-emerged in Boston eighteen years after coming<lb/>
into the hands of Tyler. Here again we should seek an easier explanation: the<lb/>
Bridgham print is the source of the Sussex Declaration. The copyist acknowl-<lb/>
edged its rhetorical effects by writing out in a larger script almost every one of<lb/>
its distinctive words.<lb/>
<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Textual variants.</hi> Allen and Sneff relegate to a footnote a discussion of tex-<lb/>
tual variants that appear only in the Bridgham print and the Sussex<lb/>
Declaration (<hi rend="italic">PBSA</hi>, p. 398). In fact, the same readings also occur in the Franklin Print<lb/>
Company facsimile, the last in the succession of Boston editions. They are all ordinary er-<lb/>
rors although the spelling “paralelled” in the phrase “scarcely paralleled in the<lb/>
most barbarous ages” might be justified by precedents in that period. Binns and<lb/>
Tyler adopt a primarily British usage in the spelling “connexion,” which they<lb/>
employ in the phrases “interrupt our connections” and “all political connection.”<lb/>
This variant, not mentioned by Allen and Sneff, occurs in all of the Boston edi-<lb/>
tions but not in the Sussex Declaration. That could be an argument in favor of<lb/>
a direct relationship with the engrossed Declaration, although one could just as<lb/>
easily surmise that the copyist opted for the “connection” spelling, which was also<lb/>
prevalent in England in the 1830s. Perhaps more to the point, the variant spell-<lb/>
ing “paralelled” in the Sussex Declaration becomes significant because it did not<lb/>
originate in the Tyler facsimile but in the Bridgham facsimile. Bridgham’s artist<lb/>
had to cope with the spelling “parallelled” in the Boston Bewick edition, an obvi-<lb/>
ous mistake, but guessed wrong when he tried to fix it. The Sussex copyist did not<lb/>
have any better ideas.<lb/>
<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">The sequence of signatures.</hi> For Allen and Sneff, the signatures are the<lb/>
most important part of the Sussex Declaration. They perceive a pattern in the<lb/>
signatures, a “hidden ordering principle” devised by the copyist in accordance<lb/>
with James Wilson’s aspirations for a strong federal government (<hi rend="italic">PBSA</hi>, p. 386).<lb/>
That pattern breaks a precedent they detect in other government documents and<lb/>
other Declarations, beginning with the engrossed parchment. There the signa-<lb/>
tures are grouped by states (excepting that of Matthew Thornton, who signed it<lb/>
at a later date when there was no more room to put it in the proper place). The<lb/>
state groupings are even more explicit in the “authenticated Copy” printed by<lb/>
order of Congress in 1777 and some of the letterpress broadsides issued in the era<lb/>
of Binns and Tyler. By changing the order of the signatures, they say, the Sussex<lb/>
Declaration downgrades the prominence of the states and asserts the supreme<lb/>
power of the central government prescribed by the Constitution. Wilson’s role in<lb/>
framing the Constitution provides additional evidence for dating the manuscript.<lb/>
If that date is valid, and if Wilson was involved, the Sussex Declaration would be<lb/>
a bridge between the two great founding documents of the United States and a<lb/>
means of explicating the political precepts behind them.<lb/>
<lb/>
The “hidden ordering principle” is based on a cipher system used in en-<lb/>
crypted correspondence during the Revolutionary War. Allen and Sneff con-<lb/>
sulted with a codebreaking expert who confirmed that a system can be discerned<lb/>
in the sequence of signatures. I will not try to describe it in detail except to say<lb/>
</p>
<pb n="126"/>
<p><lb/>that the copyist chose names from different columns in the engrossed Declara-<lb/>
tion, first concentrating on one column, then another, while interspersing the <lb/>
names of the Georgia, Pennsylvania, and Delaware delegates to make it harder <lb/>
to crack the code. Nowhere do they explain why the code was predicated on <lb/>
columns rather than some other ordering principle, an alphabetical system for <lb/>
example, or a geographical progression from state to state, which might at least <lb/>
have some regional significance. Nowhere do they define the purpose of the code <lb/>
unless it was a means of randomizing the names while ensuring that none of them <lb/>
would be omitted. One would expect a code to contain a confidential message in <lb/>
danger of falling into the wrong hands, but it is unclear what needed to be kept <lb/>
secret on this occasion. The names were not protecting classified information. <lb/>
Instead of making complications, it is better to look for precedents and similar <lb/>
examples, a simple comparison of layout techniques and production methods. <lb/>
An easier explanation can be found in the field of graphic design, a basic skill of <lb/>
the artists who copied the Declaration.<lb/></p>
<p><lb/>Design considerations often dictated the sequence of signatures. Allen and <lb/>
Sneff are not correct in saying that the Sussex Declaration was the only one to <lb/>
interfere with the state groupings before the publication of the Bridgham print in <lb/>
1836. The printers of the Boston Bewick facsimile rearranged the states to save <lb/>
on space and make room for the oak and olive frame. A Philadelphia printer <lb/>
moved the signatures out of order in an 1832 broadside reconfigured in a three-<lb/>
column format. After 1836 the signatures frequently appear in random order for <lb/>
no other reason than to fill an area predetermined by the decorative apparatus <lb/>
and the proportions of the page. Just to take one example, an 1845 letterpress <lb/>
broadside starts out with the state groupings but then switches out the signatures <lb/>
to rank them in a five-column format within a border of state seals. The printers <lb/>
disbanded the Maryland delegation and put each of the signatures in a different <lb/>
column.<hi rend="sup">15</hi><lb/></p>
<p><lb/>Like others who made those design decisions, Bridgham’s artist sought to <lb/>
achieve a harmonious balance between image and text, a pleasing composition <lb/>
comprising the border of state seals, the calligraphic lettering, and the facsimile <lb/>
signatures. The lettering above and the signatures below were aligned to form <lb/>
two rectangular blocks, each even in weight, each fitting neatly inside the bor-<lb/>
der. The artist allowed a tendril to extend beyond the border to complete the <lb/>
last line of text, a grace note following the phrase “our <hi rend="smallcaps">LIVES</hi>, our <hi rend="smallcaps">FORTUNES</hi>, <lb/>
and our sacred <hi rend="smallcaps">HONOR</hi>.” Likewise, the signatures were spaced out to make the <lb/>
line endings flush with the text, even though the emblematic John Hancock had <lb/>
to be compressed, and some signatures lost their final flourishes. Signatures at <lb/>
the beginning and the end of the last line retained their flourishes for a decora-<lb/>

<lb/>tive purpose, both looping down to fill hollow portions of the border. The state<lb/>
groupings would have had no meaning in this graphic concept and would have<lb/>
prevented the artist from placing the signatures in an even array, although ves-<lb/>
tiges can be detected in sequences of Maryland, North Carolina, and New Jersey<lb/>
delegates. Symmetry was the top priority of the artist. By a simple computation,<lb/>
he found a way to accommodate the fifty-six signatures in a graphic construct<lb/>
composed of six columns and nine rows with the exception of the first and last<lb/>
columns, which have ten signatures instead of nine.<lb/>
Allen and Sneff argue against the priority of the Bridgham print on the grounds<lb/>
that the Sussex copyist could not have replicated its sequence of signatures. They<lb/>
believe that he would have had to backtrack between columns if he started the<lb/>
transcription process by reading across the rows. Diagrams in the <hi rend="italic">PBSA</hi> article<lb/>
(pp. 401 and 402) intimate that he would have been confused by the extra names<lb/>
in the first and last columns and could not have dealt with them to arrive at the<lb/>
sequence in the Sussex Declaration. The transcription process does not seem all<lb/>
that difficult to me. The copyist proceeded through the six rows of names, one<lb/>
name after another left to right, allowing the first and last columns to be slightly<lb/>
staggered. He then inserted the two extra names, Roger Sherman and Elbridge<lb/>
Gerry, to restore the alignment between the inner and outer columns. Then he<lb/>
resumed the regular progression from left to right in the last three lines.<lb/>
Turning that argument around, I question why Bridgham’s artist would have<lb/>
replicated the sequence in the Sussex Declaration. Why would he use it as a start-<lb/>
ing point and then go off and consult some other source to turn those round hand<lb/>
names into facsimile signatures? In the manuscript, the names occupy six rows<lb/>
and then spill over to a seventh row containing a name and a half. What value<lb/>
would he have seen in that haphazard arrangement? He would have been much<lb/>
more interested in creating his own sequence to make a block of signatures in<lb/>
pleasing proportions. Let’s say he knew about the hidden ordering principle and<lb/>
wished to preserve it. But why would he be privy to the secret rather than anyone<lb/>
else in the Declaration business? There are too many loose ends and coincidences<lb/>
in this scenario. It is much more likely that he began with the Boston Bewick let-<lb/>
terpress broadside, an easily adaptable model for the layout and decoration. He<lb/>
then reconceived it as an engraved miniature and decided on a symmetrical com-<lb/>
position in accordance with the aesthetic of that genre. To achieve the “neatness”<lb/>
highly prized in that period, he changed the order of the signatures to fit them<lb/>
in a rectangular block, nine rows deep, six columns across. Neatness, uniformity<lb/>
and symmetry were his goals and the real reasons for rearranging the signatures.<lb/>
<hi rend="bold">Misspelled signatures.</hi> Allen and Sneff note that the copyist misspelled<lb/>
some of the signatures. They cite eight problematic names, three of which might<lb/>
be excused as alternatives: Pinn for Penn, Rutlidge for Rutledge, Hayward for<lb/>
Heyward. A ninth could be added to their list, a garbled superscript in the signa-<lb/>
ture of Samuel Huntington: Sam<hi rend="sup">u.</hi> for Sam<hi rend="sup">el</hi>. More egregious errors occur in four<lb/>
names: Floys for Floyd, Harnson for Harrison, Witherspoare for Witherspoon,<lb/>
and M. Keap for M: Kean. The <hi rend="italic">PBSA</hi> article includes a series of thumbnail il-<lb/>
lustrations juxtaposing the Sussex Declaration versions with the signatures in<lb/>
the Stone facsimile, the best record of the originals in the engrossed Declara-<lb/>
tion. It is true that some of the originals are barely legible and that ignorant<lb/>
<pb n="128"/>
<p>compositors got them wrong in books and broadsides even in the eighteenth <lb/>
century. Otherwise Allen and Sneff do not dwell on the Sussex misspellings and <lb/>
do not try to explain them except to observe that they are more likely to stem <lb/>
from manuscripts than printed matter.<lb/></p>
<p>The facsimile signatures in Bridgham’s miniature Declaration were respon-<lb/>
sible for the spelling mistakes in the Sussex Declaration. The signatures were <lb/>
already corrupted in transmission when Bridgham’s artist copied them from the <lb/>
Boston Bewick broadside but were distorted even more when he cut them down <lb/>
to fit in his rectangular composition (figure 3). Tyler can be blamed for a cal-<lb/>
ligraphic lilt he gave to the d in Floyd, which was nudged downward in his print <lb/>
and tilted even more in the miniature. The copyist read it as an s followed by <lb/>
a flourish. Samuel Huntington customarily abbreviated his first name as Sam<lb/>
<hi rend="sup">el</hi>. <lb/>
with a flourished superscript, sometimes writing two identifiable letters but more <lb/>
often just a double loop. The Boston Bewick Company’s facsimilist closed the <lb/>
double loop or allowed it to be closed while making the transition from intaglio <lb/>
to letterpress. Bridgham’s artist read the altered superscript as a u instead of el, <lb/>
a good guess but wrong nonetheless as can be seen in other examples of that signa-<lb/>
ture before and after 1776. As far as the copyist was concerned, the superscript u <lb/>
was a legitimate abbreviation, an easy choice to make in comparison to the less <lb/>
legible names. The n in McKean, for example, was gradually twisted out of shape <lb/>
in the prints of Tyler, the Boston Bewick Company, and Bridgham, whose artist <lb/>
compressed and elongated it in such a way that the copyist opted for a p in the <lb/>
Sussex Declaration. Copying the c in Stockton, Bridgham’s artist made a slip of <lb/>
the pen interpreted by the copyist as a cursive r, that too a plausible assumption <lb/>
although Storkton is not a common name. The name Witherspoare is unknown <lb/>
to genealogists and that mistranscription can only be explained by Tyler’s deci-<lb/>
sion to make an a out of the second o in the original and tidy up the final flourish, <lb/>
which was coarsened and then retrenched in the Boston facsimiles. I could cite <lb/>
other errors, mostly faults of the writing master and the miniaturists.<lb/></p>
<p>They were not the only ones to go astray in their attempts to transcribe <lb/>
the names. Printers of letterpress broadsides sometimes used facsimiles as their <lb/>
source documents with the best of intentions but with regrettable results. As <lb/>
one might expect, those farther removed from the original were more likely <lb/>
to make mistakes. A Philadelphia broadside published in 1855 repeats one of <lb/>
the names, misspells five of them, and gratuitously includes the Philadelphian <lb/>
Thomas Willing, who voted against the Declaration and did not sign the docu-<lb/>
ment. Lithographic artists encountered the same problems when they tried to <lb/>
make sense of the facsimile signatures. None of the Declarations I have seen to <lb/>
date is more delinquent in the spelling of the signatures than a lithographic map <lb/>
of New York City published ca. 1855 by Charles Magnus. A German immigrant, <lb/>
Magnus may not have been familiar with American proper names or with the <lb/>
English language, for he even had problems with the title, which commemorates <lb/>
the seventy-ninth year of “Indepedence.” The map is decorated with a view of <lb/>
City Hall, steamships in the harbor, and the Declaration in the usual border of <lb/>
state seals, the text in a uniform cursive, and the signatures in a “gothic” all caps <lb/>
sans serif script. Magnus or his artist used the Binns print or one of its derivatives <lb/>
as a model for the border and a source for the text, which contains the same <lb/></p>

<p>
words emphasized in special scripts. The Binns signatures, however, mystified<lb/>
the lithographer who misspelled fourteen of the fifty-six names, mainly those that<lb/>
were hard to read. The New York lithographer committed mistakes not unlike<lb/>
those of the Sussex copyist: <hi rend="smallcaps">WITHERSPOART</hi> for Witherspoon, <hi rend="smallcaps">HOYG</hi> for<lb/>
Floyd, <hi rend="smallcaps">PINN</hi> for Penn, and <hi rend="smallcaps">M KEAN</hi> for M: Kean. Both had to contend with<lb/>
facsimile signatures, but even an immigrant poorly schooled in English was able<lb/>
to construe common names such as Harrison and Stockton.<hi rend="sup">16</hi><lb/>
The copyist’s mistakes are easier to explain if they can be imputed to the il-<lb/>
legibility of his source and his failure to find a remedy. Some delegates scrawled<lb/>
their signatures in such a way as to make them difficult to read even in a full-size<lb/>
facsimile. Bridgham’s miniature exacerbated the problem. Published sixty years<lb/>
after the fact, it was conceived as a novelty and was never intended to be an<lb/>
authoritative text, but it circulated widely and could easily come into the hands<lb/>
of someone whose notions of the American Revolution were more sentimental<lb/>
than scholarly. The copyist transcribed it by rote and relied on his imagination<lb/>
to interpret the parts he did not understand. He was unwilling or unable to find<lb/>
a better source for this display of penmanship and did not worry overmuch about<lb/>
the accuracy of his work.<lb/>
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">Complications.</hi> A line of reasoning should follow the shortest distance<lb/>
between two points. That common-sense rule is a deciding factor for testing<lb/>
hypotheses in bibliographical investigations—or any field of intellectual inquiry.<lb/>
The complications in Allen and Sneff’s arguments undercut their claims for the<lb/>
priority of the Sussex Declaration. If it came first and served as a source for the Bridgham<lb/>
facsimile, we would have to believe that the Bostonians copied the<lb/>
same order of names while consulting another source to render them in facsimile.<lb/>
We would have to believe that they took the oversize words in that manuscript<lb/>
as cues to execute the same words in ornamental penmanship even though they<lb/>
had the Boston Bewick edition easily at hand and could use that as a model for<lb/>
the “emphatical words.” We would have to accept the hypothesis that the Sussex<lb/>
Declaration or a derivative manuscript influenced Tyler’s choice of “emphatical<lb/>
words” sometime around 1818 and then resurfaced eighteen years later to guide<lb/>
the work of the Bostonians. If we follow that line of reasoning, we would have to<lb/>
imagine that James Wilson was willing to overlook the atrocious spelling of the<lb/>
names even though he depended on them to affirm his position during the de-<lb/>
bates on the Constitution and could have corrected them on the basis of personal<lb/>

acquaintance.<lb/>
A few loose ends may be permissible when plying disparate strands of evidence, but these are too many to be believed.<lb/>
We do not have to work so hard if we allow the Bridgham miniature to be the source of the Sussex Declaration.<lb/>
If we accept that hypothesis, we do not have to explain away the damage in the title, the errors in the text, the absence of the long <hi rend="italic">s</hi>, and the profusion of misspelled names.<lb/>
We do not need a secret code to understand the reordering of the signatures.<lb/>
We are not obliged to excuse the poor quality of parchment, the marks of neglect, and the amateurish work of the copyist if he was engaged in a penmanship exercise rather than a “ceremonial” commission.<lb/>
We can even dispense with the provenance research if the manuscript came to the West Sussex Record Office by way of a local history collector who had only a tangential relationship with the Richmond family.<lb/>
At this point we can only guess where the collector obtained it, but we could consider the possibility that Bridgham brought copies of the miniature to England and that one of them piqued the curiosity of the copyist.<lb/>
After the novelty wore off, the parchment was folded up and filed away until it was retrieved by the collector.<lb/>
Speculation along those lines may be tempting but is not necessary to vouch for the priority of the miniature.<lb/>

<p>
Allen and Sneff published their findings in a bibliographical journal and then used that publication as the premise for their account of the Constitutional Convention.<lb/>
They are political historians who want to get the dating questions out of the way so they can do what they do best, a study of James Wilson’s political philosophy.<lb/>
Allen is James Bryant Conant University Professor at Harvard University, director of the Allen Lab for Democracy Renovation, and author of <hi rend="italic">Our Declaration: A Reading of the Declaration of Independence in Defense of Equality</hi> (2014).<lb/>
Sneff worked at the Declaration Resources Project before completing a doctorate in American history with an emphasis on material culture and history of the book.<lb/>
By no means are they the first to use bibliographical analysis as an avenue for research in other fields, but this approach has obstacles and limitations that can be overcome only by observing its rules and regulations.<lb/>
Every field has its own methodology and this one is no exception: a rigorous routine is needed to ensure the orderly analysis of texts produced in quantity.<lb/>
</p>
<p>
Bibliographers have learned the hard way about the dangers of examining documents in isolation.<lb/>
High spots deserve extra effort, but it is not enough to focus on milestones of history, landmarks in philosophy, breakthroughs in sci-<lb/>
ence, and canonical works of literature.<lb/>
The context is important too if only as a gauge of value and a basis for comparison.<lb/>
In fact, Allen and Sneff do have a bibliographical context for their work.<lb/>
Along with the documentation about the Sussex manuscript, the Declaration Resources Project website offers a pdf catalogue of Declaration editions and manuscripts listing 747 items from 1776 through 1826, plus an additional manuscript appended in June 2023.<lb/>
The catalogue tracks the dissemination of this text in different formats—books, periodicals, prints, and broadsides—a commendable attempt to be comprehensive.<lb/>
It helps, for example, to explain the patriotic mindset of the printmaker John Binns, who featured the text in his newspaper long before he produced the print.<lb/>
</p>
<pb n="132"/>
<p>It is, however, an enumerative bibliography with minimal descriptions mainly<lb/>
based on secondary sources. It covers only the first fifty years of the Declara-<lb/>
tion, not long enough to account for the surge of patriotic publications in the<lb/>
nineteenth century.<hi rend="sup">17</hi></p>
<p>If it had gone on for ten more years it would have brought Allen and Sneff<lb/>
up to the Bridgham miniature. But even then a brief listing of this kind would<lb/>
not show the facsimile’s relevance to their concerns or its relationship to the<lb/>
other Boston editions. Worthy in other ways, an enumerative bibliography is not<lb/>
intended to answer questions about form and content. It does not describe physi-<lb/>
cal objects with the details that might disclose the influence of one artifact on<lb/>
another, the information that might reveal resemblances in production methods,<lb/>
textual elements, and stylistic motifs. To make their claims for the Sussex Decla-<lb/>
ration, Allen and Sneff looked hard for this kind of information but only looked<lb/>
in one place and did not consider the commercial context. The manuscript they<lb/>
found deserves bibliographical scrutiny, but if I am correct about its sources, it<lb/>
has nothing to do with James Wilson and the Constitution. Rather, it should be<lb/>
dated at least fifty years later, when someone copied Bridgham’s engraving in an<lb/>
attempt to emulate the engrossed Declaration. If not an entirely successful effort,<lb/>
it is an interesting byproduct of the trade in patriotic prints and a good example<lb/>
of a text entangled in transcriptions large and small.</p>

UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA’S FIRST LIBRARY<lb/>
AND ITS JEFFERSONIAN CATALOGS</head>

<p><hi rend="dropcap">I</hi>n&amp;nbsp;1984, a manuscript catalog of Thomas Jefferson’s library resurfaced at the<lb/>
Library of Congress. The rediscovery was announced by Douglas&amp;nbsp;L.&amp;nbsp;Wilson,<lb/>
who proposed that the catalog—dated&amp;nbsp;1823—reestablished Jefferson’s system<lb/>
of library organization, lost after a fair copy of Jefferson’s catalog disappeared<lb/>
with the transfer of his library to Congress in&amp;nbsp;1815. This&amp;nbsp;1823 manuscript filled<lb/>
an archival void in Jefferson studies and advanced a new and enduring view<lb/>
of Jefferson’s book collecting habits in the final decade of his life (1815–26).<lb/>
In a subsequent analysis and edition of the rediscovered catalog, written with<lb/>
James&amp;nbsp;Gilreath, Wilson affirmed that the document in question was a copy of<lb/>
Jefferson’s catalog drawn up to reestablish the arrangement of his books, “in his<lb/>
own order.”<hi rend="sup">1</hi></p>
<p>Gilreath and Wilson’s account captures the first part of a complex story. In<lb/>
this article, we offer an alternative analysis of the&amp;nbsp;1823 catalog. Drawing on new<lb/>
materials, including another recently resurfaced Jeffersonian booklist, we argue<lb/>
that the surviving textual, bibliographical, and provenance evidence repositions<lb/>
the&amp;nbsp;1823 catalog as the originating document of the University of Virginia’s<lb/>
library. Not only does the catalog reconstruct the arrangement of<lb/>
Jefferson’s</p>

review of E.&amp;nbsp;Millicent&amp;nbsp;Sowerby’s <hi rend="italic">Catalogue of the Library of Thomas Jefferson</hi><lb/>
(Washington, DC: The Library of Congress, 1952). See Gilreath, “Sowerby Revirescent and Revised,”<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">The Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America</hi> 78, no.&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;(1984): 219–32. There, Gilreath observes<lb/>
that “Wilson’s [forthcoming] article offers another document which contains a strikingly dif-<lb/>
ferent order for many chapters [of Jefferson’s catalog]” (230). An analysis followed in 1989:<lb/>
