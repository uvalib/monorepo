  <head>Jonathan Richardson, Charles Chauncy, and the Manuscripts of Pope</head>
<pb n="228"/>
<p>The impressive terseness of Mack’s account has led to its being overlooked.<lb/>
For instance, Smith’s IELM entry records that ‘The first major dispersal of<lb/>
Pope’s MSS in the salerooms did not occur until the W. Nassau Lees Sale, at<lb/>
Christie’s, 20 [sc. 30] July 1889’ (2), and gives an account only of the sub-set of<lb/>
the Chauncy manuscripts which reached that sale, two years after the one which<lb/>
Mack mentions. Likewise, the current online catalogue record for the Morgan<lb/>
Library manuscript MA 348, the first extant draft of the ‘Essay on Man’, reads<lb/>
‘Presented by Pope to Jonathan Richardson (1694–1771); Dr. Charles Chauncey,<lb/>
and by descent in his family until at least 1860; General William Nassau Lees; his<lb/>
sale (Christie’s, 30 July 1889, lot 79)’. Moreover, the Sotheby catalogue of 1887<lb/>
to which Mack refers the reader is not widely available, and although it tells us<lb/>
much about the Richardson–Chauncy manuscripts of Pope, it does not tell the<lb/>
full story. The following is therefore the first full account of the eighteenth- and<lb/>
nineteenth-century career of the most important group of manuscripts of Pope.</p>
<head>I</head>
<p>Richardson evidently retained the manuscripts which Pope had given him until<lb/>
his death. They were sold in April 1776, by Baker and Leigh, with three associ-<lb/>
ated lots.<hi rend="sup">4</hi> The catalogue describes the four lots as follows:</p>
<p>3170 Two Copper Plates of Mr. Pope’s Head, one in a Circle, the other in a Whig [sic], by Richardson,<hi rend="sup">5</hi><lb/>
3171 Most of Mr. Pope’s Poems in their first Sketches in his own hand Writing, and some first Editions corrected,<lb/>
3172 Mr. Pope’s Pastorals, Manuscript, neatly wrote,</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">N. B.</hi> This Copy is that which passed through the Hands of Walsh, Congreave,<lb/>
Mainwaring, Garth, Granville, Southerne, Sir W. Trumbull, Lord Halifax, Lord<lb/>
Wharton, Marq. of Dorchester, Duke of Bucks, &amp;c. The Alterations from this Copy<lb/>
were upon the Objections of some of these, or my own. A. Pope.<hi rend="sup">6</hi></p>
<p>4. A Catalogue of the Very Large and Valuable Library of Doctor John Campbell ... To Which is Added, Some Original Letters of Mr. Pope to Mr. Richardson of Queen’s Square, and also Many of his Works with his own Manuscript Corrections (London: for S. Baker and G. Leigh, 1776), 99 [reproduced in the microfilm series Sotheby Catalogues, part I, reel 6 of 71].<lb/>
5. Unidentified: Richardson the elder made a number of etched portraits of Pope, for which see Wimsatt, Portraits of Alexander Pope, 178–200. Cf. William Gregson, writing in or shortly after December 1775, in George Sherburn, ‘New Anecdotes about Alexander Pope’, Notes &amp; Queries 203 (1958), 343–349 at 346: ‘I have the plates of several of Mr Popes Heads, Sketch’d by my Grandfather [Richardson the elder], the best Proof I think is bound up, as Frontispiece to his Works.’<lb/>

<p>Baker and Leigh’s marked-up copy of the sale catalogue in the British<lb/>
Library records three of the buyers, and a copy in the Bodleian supplies the<lb/>

Dr. Chauncey; Lot&amp;nbsp;3172 for £1 1s. to Grigson (William Gregson, grandson of<lb/>
Jonathan Richardson the elder, who gave it to the radical Thomas Brand Hollis);<lb/>
and Lot&amp;nbsp;3173 for £1 11s. 6d. to G. Davies.<hi rend="sup">8</hi><lb/></p>
<p>Charles Chauncy did not enjoy his purchase for long, for he died on Christ-<lb/>
mas Day, 1777. His will (PROB 11/1038/53) bequeaths ‘all my Books Mss Book<lb/>
Cases Pictures’ and the like to his brother Nathaniel. When he first drafted the<lb/>
will, which is dated 10 March 1776, he added that he desired that his collections<lb/>
‘may not be seperated or disposed of but kept entire and together’ to be inher-<lb/>
ited in due course by whichever of the three sons of his deceased sister Martha<lb/>
Snell should be thought most deserving of them (Charles himself was childless,<lb/>
and neither Nathaniel nor his other brother Philip had sons, so the three Snell<lb/>
brothers were his only male nephews).<hi rend="sup">9</hi> However, he subsequently struck this<lb/>
passage out, and the will as proved on 8 January 1778 makes no restriction as to<lb/>
the future of the books or collections. Nathaniel Chauncy kept them together for<lb/>
his lifetime, but his collections of books and other objects were dispersed, ‘by his<lb/>
express order’, in a series of sales by auction after his death in 1790.<hi rend="sup">10</hi><lb/></p>
<p>However, the Pope manuscripts were not among the books sold at this time.<lb/>
A note in one of them records that it passed from Charles Chauncy to Na-<lb/>
thaniel, and thence to one of the Snell nephews, another Charles, who married<lb/>
Nathaniel’s daughter Amelia, and changed his name in 1783 to Charles Snell<lb/>
Chauncy.<hi rend="sup">11</hi> Since the whole collection was still together in 1887, it must in fact all<lb/>
have passed to Charles Snell Chauncy. By his will (PROB 11/1500/155, fol. 254r),<lb/></p>
<p><hi rend="sup">7</hi> Pope’s letters to Richardson are now widely dispersed (see references at Smith,<lb/>
‘Alexander Pope’, 13–14). The manuscript of a draft of the ‘Preface’ to the 1717<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> was, in the nineteenth century, preserved in an album of materials relating<lb/>
to Pope which also included one of his letters to Jonathan Richardson the elder<lb/>
(Smith, ‘Alexander Pope’, 16–17 and PoA 400), but only very loosely could this have<lb/>
been called Pope’s ‘Dedication to all his Works’. For the ‘transcript’, see ‘Transcript<lb/>

<p>he left ‘all my Household Furniture Plate Linen China Printed Books Wines and<lb/>
other Liquors Carriages and Horses’ to his widow at his death in 1809, and there<lb/>
appears to have been no quarrel over the fact that the form of words ‘printed<lb/>
books’ does not cover manuscripts. She in turn left her books to her daughter<lb/>
Charlotte Chauncy by her will, proved in 1841 (PROB&amp;nbsp;11/1940/325), but Char-<lb/>
lotte appears to have predeceased her, and the movement of the books within the<lb/>
Chauncy family for the next&amp;nbsp;46&amp;nbsp;years is unclear. In&amp;nbsp;1887, however, the barrister<lb/>
and antiquary William Thorpe wrote a letter to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> about a completely<lb/>
different manuscript with a Chauncy provenance, in which he stated that ‘I am<lb/>
informed by the family solicitor, Mr.&amp;nbsp;Teesdale&amp;nbsp;... that when the Chauncy collec-<lb/>
tions were disposed of by&amp;nbsp;... Sotheby in&amp;nbsp;1790, the autographs were retained by<lb/>
the family, who have now sent them to the hammer’ (<hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, 17&amp;nbsp;September&amp;nbsp;1887,<lb/>
7; repeated in essentials <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, 4&amp;nbsp;October&amp;nbsp;1887, 3). The solicitor in question, John<lb/>
Marmaduke Teesdale, had married a Chauncy (see his obituary in <hi rend="italic">Law&amp;nbsp;Times</hi>, 16<lb/>
June&amp;nbsp;1888, 128), so he was in a good position to know the family history.</p>

<p>The catalogue of Sotheby’s sale of July&amp;nbsp;1887, to which Mack alludes so briefly,<lb/>
included a series of lots headed ‘Pope (Alexander) Autograph Manuscripts, From<lb/>
the Library of the late Dr.&amp;nbsp;Charles Chauncy’, and this series provides the fullest<lb/>
account of the set of manuscripts which had passed by inheritance through the<lb/>
generations of the Chauncy family in the&amp;nbsp;111&amp;nbsp;years since Charles’s purchase in<lb/>
April&amp;nbsp;1776.<hi rend="sup">12</hi> The catalogue entries are transcribed here (text to the right of the<lb/>

£10&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;Benjamin Franklin Stevens. Two volumes are catalogued here, one an<lb/>

the total sum realized, and seven of the eleven lots did go to a single purchaser, but the account<lb/>
is obviously garbled.</p>

<p><lb/>volume begins with <hi rend="italic">An Essay on Man</hi>.<hi rend="sup">14</hi> It has not previously been identified as a Richardson–Chauncy book. The second volume, ‘<hi rend="italic">The Essay on Man</hi>, with ... errata in first edition’, must be ‘the volume now in the Berg collection [79-432] that contained among other Pope material a copy of the <hi rend="italic">Essay on Man</hi> and the manuscript of the <hi rend="italic">First Satire of the Second Book of Horace</hi>’, for this copy, annotated<lb/>in a hand or hands other than Pope’s, has Chauncy ownership inscriptions, and<lb/>was, as we shall see, with the other Richardson–Chauncy books when Elwin<lb/>collated it.<hi rend="sup">15</hi></p>
<p><lb/>478 <hi rend="italic">The Dunciad</hi>, first edition, large paper, frontispiece, filled with MS. Notes<lb/>and corrections from the first Broglio MS. by Mr. Pope himself, uncut | 8vo. Dublin,<lb/>1728<lb/>£13 to Thompson. This is the 1728 <hi rend="italic">Dunciad</hi>, actually annotated by Jonathan<lb/>Richardson rather than by ‘Mr. Pope himself’, which is now in the Berg collec-<lb/>tion of the New York Public Library (Smith, ‘<hi rend="italic">Alexander Pope</hi>’, entry PoA 32),<lb/>and was reproduced in facsimile with commentary by David Vander Meulen in<lb/>1991. Vander Meulen notes that this copy and the other two Dunciads listed here<lb/>all have the manuscript date 1777 on their title pages, which ‘seems to indicate<lb/>that in that year they were part of a single collection, probably that of Dr. Charles<lb/>Chauncy ... or his brother and heir Nathaniel. . . . But then parts of the trail<lb/>become obscure’.<hi rend="sup">16</hi> We can now be confident that all three Dunciads were Rich-<lb/>ardson–Chauncy books; that the collection was still Charles’s until the end of<lb/>1777 (he died on 25 December but his will was not proved until 1778); and that<lb/>they remained in the family until 1887, when they were sold as Lots 478, 479,<lb/>and 480. Thompson bought six other lots in the 1887 sale; the six others all went<lb/>to the library of William Nassau Lees, sold in 1889; this is therefore doubtless the<lb/>annotated <hi rend="italic">Dunciad</hi> which was Lot&amp;nbsp;75 in Nassau Lees’ sale, described by Smith<lb/>(‘<hi rend="italic">Alexander Pope</hi>’, 2) as unlocated. It is, by the way, an odd coincidence that just<lb/>as Charles Chauncy bought the Richardson manuscripts of Pope in April&amp;nbsp;1776<lb/>and died twenty months later, in December&amp;nbsp;1777, so Nassau Lees bought them<lb/>in July&amp;nbsp;1887 and died twenty months later, in March&amp;nbsp;1889.</p>

Another copy, large paper, frontispiece, with MS. corrections,<lb/>copied from Pope’s copy by Jonathan Richardson junr. uncut | 8vo. ib. 1728<lb/>£7&amp;nbsp;7s. to Colonel (Francis) Grant. This is the 1728 <hi rend="italic">Dunciad</hi> now at the Huntington<lb/>Library, 106517 (Smith, ‘<hi rend="italic">Alexander Pope</hi>’, PoA&amp;nbsp;34), which was bought by B.&amp;nbsp;F.<lb/>Stevens at Grant’s sale, was in the library of Robert Hoe by 1905, and was bought<lb/>by Huntington at the Hoe sale in 1912; Vander Meulen remarks of this and the</p>

The volume was sold at Sotheby’s on 10 February 1971, to Charles Traylen, an English<lb/>bookdealer acting ultimately for Yale University Library, but its export was, controversially,<lb/>prevented: see Peter Hopkirk, ‘Dispute over plans to export Pope manuscript [sic]’, <hi rend="italic">The Times</hi>,<lb/>15&amp;nbsp;January&amp;nbsp;1971, 3, and subsequent letters to <hi rend="italic">The Times</hi> by Peter Eaton (2&amp;nbsp;February&amp;nbsp;1971, 15),<lb/>Charles Traylen (10&amp;nbsp;February&amp;nbsp;1971, 13), and P.&amp;nbsp;J.

<lb/>£50 to Thompson, and thus to Nassau Lees, and Lot&amp;nbsp;79 at his sale (see&amp;nbsp;481–483 above); the manuscript portion is now in the Morgan Library, and the printed copy of Epistle&amp;nbsp;IV is unlocated (Smith, ‘Alexander Pope’, 2 and PoA&amp;nbsp;164, 168).

Samuel sale, Sotheby’s, 1 July 1907.’ In fact, only one manuscript with a clear Richardson–Chauncy provenance did so: ‘Lot 111, specified as from Charles Chauncey’s …’

<p>library, was described as an autograph MS of a text which had not been repre-<lb/>
sented at all in the 1889 sale’, namely this one, the ‘Epistle on Taste’, or Epistle to<lb/>
Burlington. We now see that it had been sold as from Charles Chauncy’s library in<lb/>
1887, but not to Thompson, and had therefore not passed to Nassau Lees. The<lb/>
1887 and 1911 catalogue entries both appear to refer to the same manuscript, an<lb/>
autograph of the <hi rend="italic">Epistle to Burlington</hi> with a Chauncy provenance. Smith (‘Alex-<lb/>
ander Pope’, 2–3 and PoA 76) discusses the likelihood of its identification with<lb/>
Morgan Library MA&amp;nbsp;352, in which one leaf of the <hi rend="italic">Epistle to Burlington</hi> is followed<lb/>
by eight leaves of the <hi rend="italic">Epistle to Dr.&amp;nbsp;Arbuthnot</hi>. The Morgan fragment was indeed<lb/>
collated by Jonathan Richardson.<hi rend="sup">19</hi> And, as we shall see below, its readings cor-<lb/>
respond to those transcribed by Whitwell Elwin from a manuscript which, when<lb/>
he saw it, was in the possession of the Chauncy family.<lb/>

₤20 to Thompson. This fair copy — ‘a superb example of [Pope’s] calligraphy’ as<lb/>
Peter Croft called it — must be what Richardson meant by ‘the several finished<lb/>
copies, (of his own neat and elegant writing)’ which he possessed, ‘several’ refer-<lb/>
ring to the different ‘books’ of the <hi rend="italic">Essay on Man</hi> identified in the previous clause<lb/>
in Richardson’s memoir.<hi rend="sup">20</hi><lb/>
</p>
<p>The two manuscripts of the <hi rend="italic">Essay on Man</hi> in the 1887 sale both passed from<lb/>
the Chauncy family via Thompson to Nassau Lees. One of the Nassau Lees cop-<lb/>
ies (484 above) is, as we have just seen, at the Morgan Library; the other, Lot&amp;nbsp;80<lb/>
at the Nassau Lees sale, was catalogued as ‘Ethic Epistles I–III’, and can surely<lb/>
be identified both with the present copy and with the manuscript of the <hi rend="italic">Essay on<lb/>
Man</hi> now at Harvard, which bears the same title (Smith, ‘Alexander Pope’, 2–4<lb/>
and PoA&amp;nbsp;165). The Harvard manuscript was offered for sale by Dodd, Mead and<lb/>
Co. of New York in 1910.<hi rend="sup">21</hi><lb/>
</p>
<p>A manuscript sold as Lot&amp;nbsp;112 in the Stuart M. Samuel sale in 1907 also bore<lb/>
the title ‘Ethic Epistles’. There are two ways to explain this. The first is that two<lb/>
manuscripts bore this title: the one now at Harvard, and the one in the Samuel<lb/>
sale. In that case, there were three manuscripts of the <hi rend="italic">Essay on Man</hi> in all: the<lb/>
one now at the Morgan, the one now at Harvard, and a third, now unlocated,<lb/>
known only from its appearance in the Samuel sale catalogue. Smith proposes,<lb/>
on several grounds, that this was the case, and if she is right, the chronology of<lb/>
sales must have been as follows: 1887, the present Harvard MS is sold to Nas-<lb/>
sau Lees; 1889, the present Harvard MS is sold at Nassau Lees’ sale; 1907, a<lb/>
previously unknown MS with the same title appears at Samuel’s sale, is sold to<lb/>
Sabin, and is never seen again; 1910, the present Harvard MS is offered for sale<lb/>
by Dodd, Mead and Co. An alternative explanation is that there were only two<lb/>

<p>manuscripts of the Essay on Man, the one now at the Morgan and the one now at Harvard, and that the latter was sold in 1887, 1889, and 1907, before being offered for sale by Dodd, Mead and Co. in 1910.<lb/>
Of interest to us here is the question of whether the postulated third manu-<lb/>
script could also have had a Chauncy provenance. Smith suggests that it could,<lb/>
arguing that the ‘Epistle on Taste’ manuscript, 485 above, was catalogued as Lot<lb/>
111 in the Samuel sale with a note of its Chauncy provenance, and that the ‘Ethic<lb/>
Epistles’ was catalogued as Lot 112, and ‘by virtue of its juxtaposition to Lot 111<lb/>
may also have come from Chauncey’. She also notes that a manuscript of Epistle<lb/>
IV of the Essay on Man was acquired by Pierpont Morgan in 1909, and argues<lb/>
that ‘this suggests that there were more Chauncy MSS in circulation than had<lb/>
reached the sale rooms in 1889’. So there were, as we have seen: the Chauncy<lb/>
family sold their manuscripts in 1887, and not all of these were bought by Nas-<lb/>
sau Lees to return to the market in 1889. But the only Pope manuscript with a<lb/>
definite Chauncy provenance which Smith can identify as having been sold after<lb/>
1889 without having been part of the Nassau Lees sale is the ‘Epistle on Taste’<lb/>
manuscript which, as we have seen, was sold as Lot 485 with the Chauncy manu-<lb/>
scripts in 1887. There is no reason to believe that the Chauncy family withheld<lb/>
any of their literary manuscripts from the sale of 1887 for separate sale at around<lb/>
the same time, and the statement made at that time by their family lawyer sug-<lb/>
gests that they did not do so. In that case, if the Samuel manuscript of the Essay on<lb/>
Man is to be distinguished from the manuscripts now at the Morgan Library and<lb/>
Harvard, it was never a Chauncy manuscript. That is of course perfectly possible<lb/>
— Charles Chauncy bought all of Jonathan Richardson’s literary manuscripts of<lb/>
Pope apart from the Pastorals, but there were manuscripts which Richardson, and<lb/>
therefore Chauncy, never possessed, for instance the manuscript of Epistle IV<lb/>
which has just been mentioned — but a hypothetical Chauncy provenance can-<lb/>
not be part of the argument for the existence of a third Essay on Man manuscript.<lb/><lb/>
487 Epistle III to Lord Bathurst. The original Autograph MS. of Pope, with<lb/>
his numerous alterations and corrections, wanting 8 lines at end. Transcript of the<lb/>
same by Mr. Pope, with his autograph corrections and alterations, and the<lb/>
printed edition of Epistles III to VII, with numerous MS. corrections and<lb/>
alterations by Pope himself. Also Epistle II, Autograph MS. of Pope, with<lb/>
his MS. alterations and corrections | folio.<lb/>
£21 to Thompson, and thence to Nassau Lees, at whose sale the same body of<lb/>
material was Lot 81: the manuscript of ‘Epistle II’, the Epistle to a Lady, is now<lb/>
unlocated; the two manuscripts of ‘Epistle III’, the Epistle to Bathurst, are now<lb/>
Huntington HM 6007 and 6008; ‘the printed edition of Epistles III to VII, with<lb/>
numerous MS. corrections and alterations by Pope himself’ is extracted from<lb/>
Pope’s Works, volume II (1735), with collations in Richardson’s hand rather than<lb/>
Pope’s, and is now Huntington HM 6009 (Smith, ‘Alexander Pope’, 2 and PoA<lb/>
65, 67–70).<lb/><lb/>
22. HM 6007 and 6008 are reproduced in Earl R. Wasserman, Pope’s Epistle to Bathurst:<lb/>
A Critical Reading, with an Edition of the Manuscripts (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Press, 1960).<lb/>

III<lb/>
One final question remains to be asked about the Richardson–Chauncy manu-<lb/>
scripts in the period between their acquisition by Jonathan Richardson during <lb/>
the lifetime of Pope and their sale by the Chauncy family in 1887: what light is <lb/>
shed on them by the Elwin–Courthope edition of Pope, in which some of them <lb/>
are cited? Elwin wrote in his preface to the first volume, published in 1871, that<lb/>
Pope presented several of his manuscripts to the son of Jonathan Richardson, the portrait-<lb/>
painter. . . . Richardson’s interlined copy of the first quarto volume of Pope’s poetry passed <lb/>
into the hands of Malone, and was ultimately bought by Mr. Croker. The manuscripts <lb/>
which Richardson possessed in the handwriting of Pope were purchased by Dr. Chauncey, <lb/>
and are still the property of his descendants.<hi rend="sup">23</hi><lb/>
‘Richardson’s interlined copy of the first quarto volume of Pope’s poetry’ is <lb/>
the copy of the 1717 <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> presented by Pope to Jonathan Richardson the elder, <lb/>
bearing notes in Malone’s hand, which is now in the Berg Collection (Smith, <lb/>
‘Alexander Pope’, 12). This copy was, as Elwin reports elsewhere, annotated by <lb/>
Richardson the younger, but was evidently not included with the ‘first Editions <lb/>
corrected’ in the sale of 1776.<hi rend="sup">24</hi> Having been in Croker’s possession, it was no <lb/>
doubt among the materials of Croker’s on which Elwin founded his work, and <lb/>
readings from it occur in Elwin’s first two volumes.<hi rend="sup">25</hi> There are points at which <lb/>
Elwin appears to be citing, and strangely misrepresenting, Pope’s manuscripts, <lb/>
when I suspect that he is actually working from Richardson’s annotations.<hi rend="sup">26</hi><lb/>
In his introduction to the third volume of the Elwin–Courthope edition, <lb/>
Courthope thanked Elwin ‘for his liberality in allowing me to use his transcript <lb/>
of the Chauncy MS., which throws so much light on the meaning of Pope’s sat-<lb/>
ires’; he referred again, a few pages later, to ‘the transcript which Mr. Elwin has <lb/>
made from the Chauncy MS.’<hi rend="sup">27</hi> This form of words suggests that Courthope did <lb/>
not realize that the transcript which Elwin had communicated to him included <lb/>
readings from multiple manuscripts.<hi rend="sup">28</hi> The first references to the ‘Chauncy MS.’ <lb/>
in the collations in this volume are in those to the <hi rend="italic">Epistle to Bathurst</hi>, where its <lb/>
readings correspond to those of Huntington HM 6007 and HM 6008 (Lot 487 <lb/>

He specifies one of its com-<lb/>panions: ‘The Richardson collection contains a manuscript in which the poet<lb/>has transcribed from his <hi rend="italic">Pastorals</hi> the various lines he thought defective, and …<lb/>referred the task of selection to Walsh, who has jotted down his decisions at the<lb/>bottom of Pope’s remarks’.<hi rend="sup">35</hi> This is certainly the manuscript (Smith, ‘Alexander<lb/>Pope’, <hi rend="italic">PoA</hi> 274) which, having long been a companion to the autograph fair copy<lb/>of the <hi rend="italic">Pastorals</hi>, was sold separately from it at the Houghton sale of&amp;nbsp;1980, and was<lb/>Lot&amp;nbsp;381 in the Roy&amp;nbsp;Davids sale at Bonhams, 8&amp;nbsp;May&amp;nbsp;2013.<lb/><lb/>29. <hi rend="italic">Works of Alexander Pope</hi>, ed.&amp;nbsp;Elwin and Courthope, 3. 127–157 passim; Wasserman,<lb/><hi rend="italic">Pope’s Epistle to Bathurst</hi>, 60 notes that the ‘Chauncy MS’ readings derive from the Huntington<lb/>manuscripts.<lb/>30. <hi rend="italic">Works of Alexander Pope</hi>, ed.&amp;nbsp;Elwin and Courthope, 3. 172–178 passim (cf.&amp;nbsp;Mack, ed.,<lb/><hi rend="italic">Last and Greatest Art</hi>, 160–162); ‘the ignoble shout of Guise’ (3.&amp;nbsp;172) is a bad emendation of the<lb/>manuscript reading ‘the noble shout of Guise’.<lb/>31. <hi rend="italic">Works of Alexander Pope</hi>, ed.&amp;nbsp;Elwin and Courthope, 3. 241–273 passim (cf.&amp;nbsp;Mack, ed.,<lb/><hi rend="italic">Last and Greatest Art</hi>, 424–430 and 436–450); Elwin’s reference to plural manuscripts is <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>,<lb/>1.&amp;nbsp;xviii.<lb/>32. <hi rend="italic">Works of Alexander Pope</hi>, ed.&amp;nbsp;Elwin and Courthope, 3. 289–300 passim, and 3.&amp;nbsp;279, 400<lb/>n 2 (cf.&amp;nbsp;Mack, ed., <hi rend="italic">Last and Greatest Art</hi>, 172–186).<lb/>33. <hi rend="italic">Works of Alexander Pope</hi>, ed.&amp;nbsp;Elwin and Courthope, 4. 271 n 2; Vander&amp;nbsp;Meulen, <hi rend="italic">Pope’s<lb/>Dunciad of 1728</hi>, 43.<lb/>34. <hi rend="italic">Works of Alexander Pope</hi>, ed.&amp;nbsp;Elwin and Courthope, 1.&amp;nbsp;239.<lb/>35. <hi rend="italic">Works of Alexander Pope</hi>, ed.&amp;nbsp;Elwin and Courthope, 1.&amp;nbsp;240.<lb/>
