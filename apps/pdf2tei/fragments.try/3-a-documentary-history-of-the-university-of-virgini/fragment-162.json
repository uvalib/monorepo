In\n<lb/>other words, the timing of Trist’s commission to compile the 1823 catalog was driven primarily by Jefferson’s interest in developing a final list of books that\n<lb/>would form the University of Virginia’s first library. In the event, Trist declined the payment, explaining that his “motive in undertaking it was to gratify Mr\n<lb/>Jefferson ... and as part of that gratuitously done by him for the Un[iversit]y.”<hi rend=\"sup\">68</hi>\n<lb/>A further clue regarding the origin and purpose of the 1823 Trist catalog hides in plain sight in Gilreath and Wilson’s 1989 account: their observation that\n<lb/>the catalog was for many years “mistakenly labeled as a catalog of the library at the University of Virginia.” Closer examination of the catalog’s provenance\n<lb/>and the manuscript itself reveals that this association was not a “mistake,” but rather was based on a clearly traceable history that connects the catalog to the\n<lb/>university rather than to Jefferson’s personal estate. If Trist’s manuscript had been privately prepared for Thomas Jefferson, it would most likely have been\n<lb/>retained by Jefferson’s family among Jefferson’s other personal papers and ultimately consigned to the Massachusetts Historical Society along with the rest of\n<lb/>the Coolidge Collection—including the 1783 catalog. This was not the case. As Gilreath himself writes in the introduction to his edited collection <hi rend=\"italic\">The Judgment of Experts</hi>,\n<lb/>“provenance is the one unfailing guide when used in conjunction with a critically intelligent examination of the physical properties and text of any document …\n<lb/>when considered along with other methods of checking a document, it will certainly improve the reliability of any conclusion.”<hi rend=\"sup\">69</hi>\n<lb/>Our early examination of the 1823 Trist catalog was conducted using a scan of the document, but when we later examined the manuscript in person we found\n<lb/>what is perhaps the catalog’s most tantalizing piece of provenance evidence. On the front pastedown in the original binding, the number “41” appears penciled\n<lb/>in the upper left corner (fig. 19a). This number matches the method and placement of shelf-marking used in the University of Virginia’s first library (see fig. 19b),\n<lb/>suggesting that the number indicates the book’s subject chapter and shelving location in the Rotunda or in Pavilion VII—a structure on the University of\n<lb/>Virginia’s quadrilateral “lawn” that housed the university’s books before the Rotunda was completed and the books installed under its dome.<hi rend=\"sup\">70</hi>\n<lb/>While the 1823 Trist catalog would likely have been classified in Chapter 40, “Bibliography,” the penciled “41” could be the result of human error: Chapter 40\n<lb/>contained only five titles prior to 1826. In contrast, the adjacent Chapter 41, “Philology,” contained over 100 titles. In installing the constituent volumes of\n<lb/>these two chapters onto their shelves and labelling them, books from Chapter 40 could have been easily\n</p>\n<p>\n<lb/><hi rend=\"sup\">68</hi> “Nicholas P.
