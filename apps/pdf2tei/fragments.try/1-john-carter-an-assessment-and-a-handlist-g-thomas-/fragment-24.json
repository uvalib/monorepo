  "tei": "<pb n=\"24\"/>\n<head>The <lb/>1960s and 1970s</head>\n<p>From the time he began at Sotheby’s in 1955, Carter was occupied <lb/>with devising ways to bring American auction business to London, a task <lb/>he was ideally suited for and very successful at accomplishing; and after <lb/>1960, when Sotheby’s decided to open a full-time New York office with <lb/>Peregrine Pollen as head, he was also helping to get that office established. <lb/>His efforts to publicize Sotheby’s were coincidentally assisted by the three <lb/>American lecture tours he was asked to make for the English Speaking <lb/>Union in 1961-63. Another instance of his supporting the sale of art dur-<lb/>ing this period (though without any mention of Sotheby’s) was a letter <lb/>he wrote to <hi rend=\"italic\">The Times</hi> from New York (published 21 March 1962), which <lb/>serves as a good illustration of his epistolary style:</p>\n<head>Everyone’s Business</head>\n<p>Sir,— To an Englishman at this distance the attitudes of Parliament, press, and <lb/>public towards the Royal Academy seem (with the honourable exception of <hi rend=\"italic\">The <lb/>Times</hi>) oddly governessy. <lb/>The Academy, surely, is a society of gentlemen accountable, like any other club, <lb/>to its membership and to the law of the land: but how to anyone else? It owns certain <lb/>property; it has certain liabilities. Like many other clubs, it is a victim of the economic <lb/>arithmetic of the 1960s. Some clubs raise the subscription: others charge more for <lb/>whisky: others again let in cads. The Academy decides to sell a picture. <lb/>Would even a member of Parliament, let alone any busybody who can spell <lb/>Leonardo, presume to interfere publicly in the private affairs of the Athenaeum or <lb/>White’s, of the Beefsteak or the Garrick? And if they did, would you, Sir, print their <lb/>letters? I take leave to doubt it, while remaining</p>\n<p>Your obedient servant, <lb/><hi rend=\"italic\">John Carter</hi></p>\n<p>Below his name, he gave his New York address as the Grolier Club, char-<lb/>acteristically linking his location with the content of the letter (a practice <lb/>that goes back to a 1930 letter in <hi rend=\"italic\">Bookmart</hi> about defining “first edition,” <lb/>where he used the First Edition Club as his address).</p>\n<p>But all the travel and negotiations of these years (which he called <lb/>“hectic” in a 1971 recollection) did not prevent his devoting a great deal <lb/>of time and energy (in the early and middle 1960s) to the project that led <lb/>to <hi rend=\"italic\">Printing and the Mind of Man</hi> (a title for which he was responsible). Carter <lb/>played a major role, first as an active member of the Supervisory Com-<lb/>mittee for a historical display (of which Stanley Morison was the “inspirer <lb/>and foster-father,” as Carter put it) to be held in conjunction with the July <lb/>1963 International Printing Machinery and Allied Trades Exhibition, and <lb/>then as co-editor (with Percy Muir) of an expanded catalogue of books <lb/>that were selected to show the impact of printing on intellectual history.</p>",
