One learns, for<lb/>\nexample, about formes and collations, the bibliographical meanings of<lb/>\n“sheet” and “signature,” and the importance of distinguishing integral<lb/>\nfrom inserted advertisements. And the information is sound, as when he<lb/>\nemphatically states that collations are necessary for modern books. He<lb/>\neven brings up press figures, clearly summarizing the current knowledge<lb/>\nof them and then adding, “The bibliographers have not made much out<lb/>\nof them yet. But they will.” The only place I have found in the first edition<lb/>\nwhere Carter slips up seriously is when he says that valuing dust-jackets<lb/>\nis “a matter of taste,” noting that Morris L. Parrish, “one of the greatest<lb/>\nsticklers who ever lived,” threw them away; he should simply have said<lb/>\nthat Parrish was wrong. (The reference to Parrish was deleted twenty<lb/>\nyears later, in the fifth edition.) Another distinguishing characteristic of<lb/>\nthe book is that its advice is conveyed in the entertaining prose that was<lb/>\nby then well-honed. Commenting on the undiscriminating citation of<lb/>\nauthor bibliographies (at the end of the entry for “Bibliography”), Carter<lb/>\nsays,<lb/>\nThe judicious collector soon learns that verdicts are not infallible just because they<lb/>\nare in print; that the cry of “Not in Prism” should excite him only if Prism’s book<lb/>\nboth claims to be comprehensive and has some reputation for accuracy; but that as<lb/>\nlong as others continue to cherish a variant or issue canonised by however incom-<lb/>\npetent a bibliographer, so long will booksellers continue to cite even an incompetent<lb/>\nbibliography rather than none at all.<lb/>\nAnd the long entry on “Rarity” begins this way (with what is probably the<lb/>\nmost quoted passage in the book):<lb/>\nRarity is the salt in book-collecting. But if you take too much salt, the flavour of the<lb/>\ndish is spoiled; and if you take it neat it will make you sick. Similarly, those book-<lb/>\ncollectors who exalt rarity above any other criterion tend to develop third-degree<lb/>\nbibliomania, which is a painful and slightly ridiculous ailment.<lb/>\nIt is easy to see why this book is such a pleasure to consult. The book<lb/>\nworld is fortunate to have a reliable source of basic information that has<lb/>\nbeen, through its appeal, widely disseminated and influential.<lb/>\nIn 1958 Carter brought out a revised edition of Browne’s <hi rend=\"italic\">Urne Buriall</hi><lb/>\nand the <hi rend=\"italic\">Garden of Cyrus</hi>, marking the three-hundredth anniversary of its<lb/>\noriginal appearance. As published by Cambridge University Press in a<lb/>\ncompact and attractive volume, it gave Carter’s text a much wider circu-<lb/>\nlation than it had achieved in the limited edition of 1932, a not inconsid-<lb/>\nerable service. And the two-page preface shows the skill and charm that<lb/>\nCarter brought to the writing of such pieces. In his praise of Browne’s two<lb/>\n</p>",
