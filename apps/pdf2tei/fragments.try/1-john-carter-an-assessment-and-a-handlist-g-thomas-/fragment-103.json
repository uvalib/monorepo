It is not a rare name, in other words, and descendants of Wil-<lb/>\nliam Waynflete survive on both sides of the Atlantic. Someone other than Carter <lb/>\ncould well have chosen to use “John Waynflete” in 1934. And it might not be a <lb/>\npseudonym at all.<lb/>\nThe collections of Carter’s papers in various libraries (Eton, King’s, Cam-<lb/>\nbridge University Library, Bodleian, and Lilly among them) do not seem to con-<lb/>\ntain anything relevant; Sebastian Carter, John’s nephew, knows nothing about <lb/>\nthe novel; and Michael Meredith tells me that it was not among Carter’s copies <lb/>\nof his own books at the time of his death. Carter’s authorship of it has not been <lb/>\nproved or disproved. The question comes down to how one evaluates the likeli-<lb/>\nhood that anyone other than Carter could have used “John Waynflete” versus <lb/>\nthe likelihood that Carter could have written something, even as a parody, with <lb/>\nthe style and content of this novel. Unless there is evidence that I am not aware <lb/>\nof, I think it seems reasonable to say that the arguments against John Carter’s <lb/>\nauthorship of <hi rend=\"italic\">The Fall of the Titan</hi> are stronger than those supporting it.<lb/>",
