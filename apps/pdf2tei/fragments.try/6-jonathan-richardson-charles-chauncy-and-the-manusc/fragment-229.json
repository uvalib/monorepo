Elwin wrote in his preface to the first volume, published in 1871, that<lb/>\nPope presented several of his manuscripts to the son of Jonathan Richardson, the portrait-<lb/>\npainter. . . . Richardson’s interlined copy of the first quarto volume of Pope’s poetry passed <lb/>\ninto the hands of Malone, and was ultimately bought by Mr. Croker. The manuscripts <lb/>\nwhich Richardson possessed in the handwriting of Pope were purchased by Dr. Chauncey, <lb/>\nand are still the property of his descendants.<hi rend=\"sup\">23</hi><lb/>\n‘Richardson’s interlined copy of the first quarto volume of Pope’s poetry’ is <lb/>\nthe copy of the 1717 <hi rend=\"italic\">Works</hi> presented by Pope to Jonathan Richardson the elder, <lb/>\nbearing notes in Malone’s hand, which is now in the Berg Collection (Smith, <lb/>\n‘Alexander Pope’, 12). This copy was, as Elwin reports elsewhere, annotated by <lb/>\nRichardson the younger, but was evidently not included with the ‘first Editions <lb/>\ncorrected’ in the sale of 1776.<hi rend=\"sup\">24</hi> Having been in Croker’s possession, it was no <lb/>\ndoubt among the materials of Croker’s on which Elwin founded his work, and <lb/>\nreadings from it occur in Elwin’s first two volumes.<hi rend=\"sup\">25</hi> There are points at which <lb/>\nElwin appears to be citing, and strangely misrepresenting, Pope’s manuscripts, <lb/>\nwhen I suspect that he is actually working from Richardson’s annotations.<hi rend=\"sup\">26</hi><lb/>\nIn his introduction to the third volume of the Elwin–Courthope edition, <lb/>\nCourthope thanked Elwin ‘for his liberality in allowing me to use his transcript <lb/>\nof the Chauncy MS., which throws so much light on the meaning of Pope’s sat-<lb/>\nires’; he referred again, a few pages later, to ‘the transcript which Mr. Elwin has <lb/>\nmade from the Chauncy MS.’<hi rend=\"sup\">27</hi> This form of words suggests that Courthope did <lb/>\nnot realize that the transcript which Elwin had communicated to him included <lb/>\nreadings from multiple manuscripts.<hi rend=\"sup\">28</hi> The first references to the ‘Chauncy MS.’ <lb/>\nin the collations in this volume are in those to the <hi rend=\"italic\">Epistle to Bathurst</hi>, where its <lb/>\nreadings correspond to those of Huntington HM 6007 and HM 6008 (Lot 487 <lb/>\n<lb/>\n<hi rend=\"sup\">23</hi> <hi rend=\"italic\">The Works of Alexander Pope</hi>, ed.
