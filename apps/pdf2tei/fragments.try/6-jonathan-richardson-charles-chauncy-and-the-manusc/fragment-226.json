How these left the Chauncy family is unclear, though they may have been dispersed in the Leigh and Sotheby sale’ of Nathaniel Chauncy’s library in 1790.<hi rend=\"sup\">17</hi> We now see that both remained in the hands of the descendents of Nathaniel Chauncy until 1887.\n<lb/>480 The Dunciad, with Notes Variorum, large paper, frontispiece, with numerous MS. Notes and corrections from his second MS. by Mr.&amp;nbsp;Pope himself, uncut | 8vo. 1736\n<lb/>£8&amp;nbsp;8s. to ( J.) Pearson. This is the 1736 Dunciad now in the Berg collection (Smith, ‘Alexander Pope’, PoA&amp;nbsp;33). Vander&amp;nbsp;Meulen notes that in 1888 it was owned by Richard Tangye; for his remarks on its earlier history, see Lot&amp;nbsp;479.\n<lb/>481 Sapho to Phaon, wholly translated, Autograph MS. of Pope | folio. 1707\n<lb/>482 Essay on Criticism, Autograph MS. of Pope | folio. 1709\n<lb/>483 Windsor-Forest, Autograph MS. of Pope, wanting a few lines at end | folio. 1709\n<lb/>Respectively £17, £28, and £20 to Thompson, and thus to Nassau Lees; identified as Richardson–Chauncy books at his sale, where they were Lots&amp;nbsp;76, 77, and 78 respectively, but their history in the years before he acquired them has previously been incomplete (Smith, ‘Alexander Pope’, 2 and PoA&amp;nbsp;297, PoA&amp;nbsp;160, PoA&amp;nbsp;376–377 respectively). Now respectively at the Morgan Library, MA&amp;nbsp;349; the Bodleian Library, MS&amp;nbsp;Eng.&amp;nbsp;poet.&amp;nbsp;c.&amp;nbsp;1; and Washington University in St.&amp;nbsp;Louis. At some point before 1887, the manuscripts of Essay on Criticism and Windsor-Forest were brought together, and the title-page of the former had the title of the latter added to it, but they were separated again before the sale.<hi rend=\"sup\">18</hi>\n<lb/>484 Essay on Man, in&amp;nbsp;IV Epistles, Epistle&amp;nbsp;I to&amp;nbsp;III, Autograph MS. of Pope, Epistle&amp;nbsp;IV printed with numerous MS. corrections by Pope himself | folio. n.d.\n<lb/>£50 to Thompson, and thus to Nassau Lees, and Lot&amp;nbsp;79 at his sale (see&amp;nbsp;481–483 above); the manuscript portion is now in the Morgan Library, and the printed copy of Epistle&amp;nbsp;IV is unlocated (Smith, ‘Alexander Pope’, 2 and PoA&amp;nbsp;164, 168). This must be what Richardson meant by ‘the first scratches of the four books’ of the Essay on Man which he possessed.\n<lb/>485 Epistle on Taste, Autograph MS. of Pope, with his numerous alterations and corrections | folio. n.d.\n<lb/>£25&amp;nbsp;10s. to Quaritch. After her account of the Richardson–Chauncey books in the Nassau Lees sale, Smith states (‘Alexander Pope’, 2) that ‘Further MSS from the Chauncey collection appeared on the market later, in the Stuart&amp;nbsp;M. Samuel sale, Sotheby’s, 1 July 1907.’ In fact, only one manuscript with a clear Richardson–Chauncy provenance did so: ‘Lot 111, specified as from Charles Chauncey’s …’\n<lb/>17.&amp;nbsp;Vander&amp;nbsp;Meulen, Pope’s Dunciad of 1728, 44–45.\n<lb/>18.&amp;nbsp;For the title-page, see Robert&amp;nbsp;M.
