Savage perceptively connects these images of water creatures with the close<lb/>\nof Pope’s introductory ‘<hi rend=\"italic\">Design</hi>’ to the <hi rend=\"italic\">Essay</hi>, discussing the epistles that are to<lb/>\ncome: ‘Consequently, these Epistles in their progress will become less dry, and<lb/>\nmore susceptible of Poetical Ornament. I am here only opening the Fountains,<lb/>\nand clearing the passage; To deduce the Rivers, to follow them in their Course,<lb/>\nand to observe their Effects, will be a task more agreeable. [italics reversed]’<lb/>\n</p>\n<p>Perhaps, the fountains engraving was chosen to support this metaphor, and the<lb/>\nothers because they were adjacent in the <hi rend=\"italic\">Odyssey</hi>. The text left no room for these<lb/>\nengravings in the large-paper folio, but that would have made production easier.<lb/>\nThe quarto sheets would have had to go separately through the rolling press in<lb/>\norder for the engravings to be impressed.<lb/>\n</p>\n<p>The engravings the quarto and large folio shared in the preliminaries were<lb/>\ninventive in a way the quarto’s tailpieces were not. The title page was provided<lb/>\nwith a new engraving especially designed for <hi rend=\"italic\">An Essay on Man</hi>: the head of Apollo<lb/>\nemerges in glory from clouds, cobwebs, and old manuscripts. Around the head is<lb/>\nthe motto ‘<hi rend=\"smallcaps\">ΓΝΩΘΙ ΣΕΑϒΤΟΝ</hi>’ (know thyself ), one of the maxims of the temple<lb/>\nof Apollo at Delphi (figure 5). The injunction is of central thematic importance to<lb/>\n<hi rend=\"italic\">An Essay on Man</hi>. Pope begins his second epistle with a couplet that summarizes<lb/>\nthe first and defines his approach:<lb/>\n</p>",
