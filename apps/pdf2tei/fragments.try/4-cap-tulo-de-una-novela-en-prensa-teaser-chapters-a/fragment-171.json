  "tei": "<pb n=\"171\"/>\n<p><hi rend=\"dropcap\">I</hi>n essence, these teaser chapters showcased the breadth and depth of material<lb/>\nthat this publishing firm produced. What is more, the authors who penned these<lb/>\ndiverse works hailed from around the globe (England, France, Argentina, Italy,<lb/>\nChile, Russia, Spain, the United States,<hi rend=\"sup\">17</hi> Ireland, and Germany). However, the<lb/>\nnames of virtually all the authors of these sample chapters would have been<lb/>\nknown to readers, especially for the educated and elite consumers of Sur. For<lb/>\ninstance, a few of the authors whose sampled works appeared in these issues<lb/>\nincluded James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, Aldous Huxley, George Orwell, Gabriela<lb/>\nMistral, Albert Camus, and T. E. Lawrence, as well as Victoria Ocampo herself.<lb/>\nWhen viewed in tandem with the numerous ads that filled the opening and clos-<lb/>\ning pages of each issue of the literary journal Sur, these teaser chapters reveal<lb/>\none potential way in which Ocampo might have marketed select works as a part<lb/>\nof her more general mission to promote certain authors for her Latin American<lb/>\nreaders.<hi rend=\"sup\">18</hi><lb/>\nWhile Ocampo’s literary journal tended to include only one pre-publication<lb/>\nchapter from each of these books, there were instances in which several chap-<lb/>\nters—or even entire works—appeared in Sur prior to the book publication with<lb/>\nEditorial Sur. Consider, for instance, the following titles that had at least two<lb/>\nchapters published in Sur prior to their releases as single-volume works with Edi-<lb/>\ntorial Sur: André Gide’s Perséphone (1936), Eduardo Mallea’s La ciudad junto al río<lb/>\ninmóvil (1936), Virginia Woolf’s Un cuarto propio (1936), Aldous Huxley’s Con los<lb/>\nesclavos en la noria (1937), Victoria Ocampo’s Virginia Woolf, Orlando y Cía<lb/>\n(1938), and Silvina Ocampo’s Autobiografía de Irene (1948).<hi rend=\"sup\">19</hi> Multiple poems from Gabri-<lb/>\nela Mistral’s Tala (1938) as well as Eduardo González Lanuza’s La degollación de los<lb/>\ninocentes (1938) and Transitable cristal (1943) also appeared in the pages of Sur prior<lb/>\nto their official release with Editorial Sur. It is telling that early on multiple teaser<lb/>\nchapters from Editorial Sur books—if not the entire works—appeared in Sur. In<lb/>\nessence, these early pre-publication chapters highlight the residual influence of<lb/>\nserial publications. The only two books that were published in an entirely serial-<lb/>\nized format in Sur prior to their release with Editorial Sur were Woolf’s Un cuarto<lb/>\npropio and Gide’s Perséphone.<hi rend=\"sup\">20</hi> These two works are the second and third Editorial<lb/>\nSur works that were pre-published in Sur, respectively, which further stresses the<lb/>\n</p>\n<p>17. The only American writer, Christopher Isherwood, was born in the United Kingdom<lb/>\nin 1904, but he became a United States citizen in 1946 and lived in California until his death<lb/>\nin 1986.<lb/>\n</p>\n<p>18. Alongside the promotional materials for Editorial Sur editions and articles in forth-<lb/>\ncoming issues of Sur, the majority of advertisements found in the opening and closing pages<lb/>\nof Ocampo’s literary journal throughout the 1930s and 1940s were for printers, bookstores, or<lb/>\nother publishing houses in Buenos Aires.<lb/>\n</p>\n<p>19. Ocampo included three chapters from T. E. Lawrence’s Siete pilares de la sabiduría in<lb/>\nSur (120 [October 1944]), but these appeared the month after the entire book was released with<lb/>\nEditorial Sur (September 1944).<lb/>\n</p>\n<p>20. I note in another work that this Spanish-language translation of Gide’s work with<lb/>\nEditorial Sur was most likely “a type of reverse marketing to attract potential [buyers] by<lb/>\ngiving them access to a (successful) sample of the type of material that they publish” since, in<lb/>\naddition to appearing in Sur in its entirety, it was distributed free of charge in book form (Nora<lb/>\nBenedict, Borges and the Literary Marketplace: How Editorial Practices Shaped Cosmopolitan Reading.<lb/>\n[New Haven: Yale University Press, 2021], 276).<lb/>\n</p>",
