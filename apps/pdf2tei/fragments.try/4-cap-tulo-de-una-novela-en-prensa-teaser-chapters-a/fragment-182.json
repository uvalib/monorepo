Other writers and intellectu-<lb/>\nals involved in the Argentine publishing industry have noted the difficulty and<lb/>\nextremely high cost of acquiring authors’ rights, which might account for why<lb/>\nOcampo focused on promoting the works of authors for whom she had already<lb/>\nsecured the translation rights.<hi rend=\"sup\">53</hi> Not only that, most of the Spanish-language edi-<lb/>\ntions that she produced were the first and only authorized translations of these<lb/>\nworks, which made them all the more valuable. That is to say, Ocampo identified<lb/>\na number of the best international literary works earlier on in her career as a<lb/>\npublisher and then proceeded to corner the market by acquiring the translation<lb/>\nand publication rights for these titles. One of the ways in which Ocampo might<lb/>\nhave been able to skirt the issue of paying large sums of money to acquire au-<lb/>\nthors’ rights was through her impressive networks of contacts. Her close friend-<lb/>\nships with <hi rend=\"italic\">Virginia Woolf</hi>, <hi rend=\"italic\">Igor Stravinsky</hi>, and <hi rend=\"italic\">Rabindranath Tagore</hi> are well<lb/>\nknown and these connections undoubtedly provided her with a great deal more<lb/>\npublishing freedom and access than most Latin American editors of the time. In<lb/>\nfact, her teaser publications of T. S. Eliot’s <hi rend=\"italic\">Sobre la poesía y los poetas</hi> and Cyril<lb/>\nConnolly’s <hi rend=\"italic\">La tumba sin sosiego</hi>, both of which appeared in 1947 in the special<lb/>\nquadruple issue of <hi rend=\"italic\">Sur</hi> dedicated to English literature, illustrated her impressive<lb/>\nliterary connections. In her introductory note to the entire issue, Ocampo alludes<lb/>\nto her networks by stating that “la lista de agradecimientos, en lo que respecta a<lb/>\nmis relaciones personales con Inglaterra, sería tan larga que no intentaré agotarla<lb/>\nen este prólogo” [the list of acknowledgements, with regard to my personal rela-<lb/>\ntions with England, would be so long that I won’t attempt to exhaust it in this<lb/>\nprologue].<hi rend=\"sup\">54</hi> However, she still mentions several individuals by name who helped<lb/>\nher fill the pages of the issues at hand. In particular, she notes her conversations<lb/>\nwith Connolly “sobre este número y sus <hi rend=\"italic\">hints</hi> me han sido preciosos” [about<lb/>\nthis issue and that his hints have been very valuable].<hi rend=\"sup\">55</hi> She also discusses Eliot’s<lb/>\nfoundational role in deciding on writers to include and the overall shape of the<lb/>\nfour-issue publication: “Yo quería saber lo que los ingleses pensaban de su propia<lb/>\nliteratura contemporánea y no cansaba de interrogarlos.... Así fué el propio T.<lb/>\nS. Eliot quien eligió entre sus obras ¿Qué es un clásico? para este número de <hi rend=\"italic\">SUR</hi>”<lb/>\n[I wanted to know what the English thought of their own contemporary literature<lb/>\nand I didn’t tire of asking them.... Thus, it was T. S. Eliot himself who chose<lb/>\n<hi rend=\"italic\">What is a Classic?</hi> from among his works for this issue of <hi rend=\"italic\">SUR</hi>].<hi rend=\"sup\">56</hi><lb/>\n</p>\n<p><hi rend=\"sup\">53</hi>. Adolfo Bioy Casares recalled similar snags when working with Jorge Luis Borges on<lb/>\ntheir “<hi rend=\"italic\">Séptimo Círculo</hi>” [Seventh Circle] collection with Emecé Editores in the 1940s: “el<lb/>\ntrabajo en la editorial nos asomó a los problemas de los derechos de autor, que hasta entonces<lb/>\nhabíamos ignorado.... Nos enteramos así de que algunas novelas que deseábamos incluir en El<lb/>\nSéptimo Círculo no estaban libres” [our work in the publishing house showed us the problems<lb/>\nof copyright that we had ignored up to that point.... We realized that some novels that we<lb/>\nwanted to include in the Seventh Circle series were not free] (Adolfo Bioy Casares, <hi rend=\"italic\">Memorias:<lb/>\nInfancia, adolescencia, y cómo se hace un escritor</hi> [Barcelona: Tusquets, 1994], 101).<lb/>\n</p>\n<p><hi rend=\"sup\">54</hi>.

The version of Eliot’s “¿Qué es un clásico?” that ap-<lb/>\npeared in <hi rend=\"italic\">Sur</hi> is notably different from the final published version in his <hi rend=\"italic\">Sobre la poesía y los poetas</hi>.<lb/>\n</p>",
