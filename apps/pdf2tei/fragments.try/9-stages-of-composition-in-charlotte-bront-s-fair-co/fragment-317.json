As we have seen, it was Brontë’s practice to edit<lb/>and tighten such parallels across the novel’s three volumes. Given the material<lb/>evidence presented here, it is reasonable to suppose that she modified her open-<lb/>ing chapter in concert with the composition of the novel’s conclusion.</p>\n<head>7.  The Role of Interpretation</head><lb/>\n<p>This article has attempted to call attention to the kinds of rich bibliographical<lb/>and codicological evidence found in a modern literary manuscript. It has largely<lb/>focused on demonstrating the utility of correlating variations in the substrates of the<lb/>manuscript with differences in its numbering. It cannot offer a close analysis of all<lb/>of the changes made by Brontë, which is better handled in the form of a critical edi-<lb/>tion. At the same time, it is important to acknowledge that the manuscript contains<lb/>some significant expansions that entail no apparent changes to its paper stocks.</p>\n<p>One notable example, already discussed, is Brontë’s revision to her chapter<lb/>“The First Blue-Stocking”—the “translation” of the French passage that was<lb/>made in September 1849 per the advice of her publishers. Another even larger<lb/>expansion preceding that one seems to have gone undetected to date. “Writ-<lb/>ten in the Schoolroom” was copied out by Brontë in the summer of 1849. The<lb/>chapter, which falls toward the very end of volume 3, describes Louis Moore’s<lb/>proposal to Shirley Keeldar. Ending with f. A851.B851.C858.[D864].E290, the<lb/>chapter was followed by “The Winding-up.” Then, as table 5 shows, a series of<lb/>ten leaves was inserted as part of stage C of the composition process, as is evident<lb/>by the changes to the manuscript’s red-ink and B-series brown-ink numbering.<lb/>This new section, demarcated by a double rule of two short pen strokes in the<lb/>manuscript, begins on the very bottom of f. A851.B851.C858.[D864].E290. Nine<lb/>leaves later, we find A852.B852.C869.[D875].E301 and its ensuing sequence.<lb/>What had been a difference in seven leaves between the numbering of states B<lb/>and C later increased to a difference of 17 leaves.</p>\n<p>This newly added section is conveniently framed as an interpolated narrative<lb/>from Louis Moore’s blank book—a narrative device that Brontë uses earlier on<lb/>in the third volume of the novel in the chapter, “Louis Moore,” and later again,<lb/>at the beginning of “Written in the Schoolroom.” Critics such as Lewes found<lb/>this tactic rather clumsy, as his following critique makes evident:</p>\n<p>There, again, there is Louis Moore writing long narratives in his note-book.<lb/>What he writes is often striking; and had the authoress only thought of making him keep a journal,<lb/>probability would have been sufficiently saved. But, instead of that, she obliges him to sit<lb/>down in Shirley’s room, draw out a note-book, and proceed to write very circumstantially,<lb/>for our benefit, what everyone feels he would never have written at all. And while writing<lb/>he is so intensely conscious of being read, that he says, “I confess it—to this mute page, I<lb/>may confess it” . . . . All that Louis Moore writes might have been told by the authoress,<lb/>without subterfuge.<hi rend=\"sup\">150</hi></p>\n<p>150. Lewes, “Shirley: a Tale.
