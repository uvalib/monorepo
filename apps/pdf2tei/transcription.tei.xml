<p>John Carter: An Assessment<lb/>
and a Handlist<lb/>
by<lb/>
G. THOMAS TANSELLE<lb/>
John carter was one of the most prominent and significant<lb/>
figures in the Anglo-American book world in the twentieth<lb/>
century. Indeed, he held a unique position, for he distinguished<lb/>
himself as a bookseller, a collector, a scholar, and a writer, equally<lb/>
at home and equally recognized on both sides of the Atlantic.<lb/>
He created innovative rare-book catalogues for the Scribner Book Store;<lb/>
formed several notable collections, especially of Catullus and Housman;<lb/>
was a pioneer investigator of the bibliographical problems of nineteenth-century publishers’ bindings; performed (with Graham Pollard) a classic<lb/>
piece of bibliographical detection in uncovering the Wise-Forman forgeries; produced a scholarly edition of <hi>Sir Thomas Browne’s Urne Buriall and the Garden of Cyrus</hi>; and wrote (or co-wrote or co-edited) several celebrated<lb/>
works—<hi>An Enquiry into the Nature of Certain Nineteenth Century Pamphlets</hi> (1934), <hi>Taste and Technique in Book-Collecting</hi> (1948), <hi>ABC for Book-Collectors</hi> (1952), and <hi>Printing and the Mind of Man</hi> (1967).<lb/>
A record of his published writings is obviously a basic guide to his accomplishment. But such a record is also desirable for another reason that<lb/>
would not apply to many people: nearly every piece he wrote, no matter<lb/>
how small (including brief reviews and letters to editors), is worth reading<lb/>
for its style and wit. I am therefore presenting here a handlist (following in<lb/>
Carter’s tradition of handlist-writing) that will enable readers to find these<lb/>
pieces. Carter published so prolifically (some 1500 items are known) in such<lb/>
a wide array of venues that there are bound to be many items I have missed,<lb/>
especially among his letters to editors. But what is here is a comprehensive<lb/>
nucleus to which additions can be made. As Carter said in his handlist of<lb/>
Stanley Morison, it is “intended to serve as a series of signposts now and as<lb/>
a basis for amplification, correction and addition in the future.”<lb/>
As an introduction to the handlist, I shall attempt a brief assessment of<lb/>
Carter’s achievement, which is a by-product of the overview provided by<lb/>
the handlist. It is inevitably biographical to some extent; but the emphasis is on Carter’s writings, not his life, because a book-length biography<lb/>
already exists: Donald C. Dickinson’s John Carter: The Taste and Technique of<lb/>
<pb n="2"/>
<p>a Bookman (2004). The biographical details selected for mention here and<lb/>
in the handlist (many of which do not appear in the Dickinson book) are<lb/>
those that seem to me most relevant for understanding the background<lb/>
and context of his writings and his wide influence. I knew John Carter for<lb/>
only the last ten years of his life: some of my recollections were written<lb/>
up in section 36 of my memoir, <hi>The Living Room</hi> (published in vol-<lb/>
ume 59 of Studies in Bibliography and then in <hi>Books in My Life</hi>,<lb/>
2021), and I dedicated my book about book-jackets to his memory. I shall<lb/>
not forget the many kindnesses he showed me and the important favors he<lb/>
did for me, and the present offering is a reflection of my gratitude.<lb/>
</p>
<head>ASSESSMENT</head>
<head>The 1930s</head>
<p>John Carter’s first post-collegiate publication on a bookish subject, an<lb/>
article on “Original Condition” in the 15 November 1930 issue of Publish-<lb/>
ers’ Weekly, came only three years after college and inaugurated an amaz-<lb/>
ing four-year period of brilliant productivity. Born John Waynflete Carter<lb/>
at Eton on 10 May 1905, he was educated at Eton and King’s College<lb/>
Cambridge, where he achieved a double first in the classical tripos and<lb/>
an honors degree in 1927. By that time he was already collecting Catullus<lb/>
and had become interested in textual criticism through the influence of A.<lb/>
E. Housman’s lectures. Almost immediately after leaving Cambridge he<lb/>
was hired (in September 1927) by the London office of Charles Scribner’s<lb/>
Sons to locate rare books to be sold in their New York shop. In the three<lb/>
years between then and that 1930 article, he was becoming acquainted<lb/>
with the book dealers and collectors both in Britain and in America (his<lb/>
first visit to New York being January to April 1929). But he was clearly do-<lb/>
ing more, for his first three letters to the Times Literary Supplement (in 1931-<lb/>
33) show that by then he was already immersed in research on Sir Thomas<lb/>
Browne, publishers’ bindings, and the pamphlets that became known as<lb/>
the Wise-Forman forgeries—the subjects of his first major publications<lb/>
(and of his early articles for the main book-collecting journals of the time,<lb/>
The Book Collector’s Quarterly in England and The Colophon in America).<lb/>
In May 1932 he published Binding Variants in English Publishing, 1820-<lb/>
1900 as the sixth volume in Michael Sadleir’s important Bibliographia se-<lb/>
ries, which had the significant subtitle “Studies in Book History and Book<lb/>
Structure” (where “structure” makes clear the interest in bibliographical<lb/>
analysis). Sadleir, a publisher (Constable was his firm), novelist, and col-<lb/>
lector, had already established himself (he was sixteen and a half years<lb/>
older than Carter) as a bibliographical scholar and a pioneer historian<lb/>
of publishers’ bindings. He had published a bibliography of Trollope in<lb/>
1928 (a landmark through its explicit demonstration that an author bibli-<lb/>
</p>
<pb n="3"/>
<p>ography can be a contribution to the history of publishing); and two years<lb/>
later <hi>The Evolution of Publishers’ Bindings Styles, 1770-1900</hi> came out as the<lb/>
first volume in his <hi>Bibliographia</hi> series. Carter’s admiration for Sadleir<lb/>
is suggested by a letter he wrote to <hi>The Times</hi> on 20 December 1957 to<lb/>
supplement <hi>The Times</hi>’s obituary of Sadleir: “None of those who moved in his orbit<lb/>
. . . was ever made to feel a satellite. But in our corner of the sky a star has<lb/>
fallen.” An “avowed disciple” of Sadleir (as he called himself in a 1970 article),<lb/>
Carter had been following Sadleir’s lead in investigating edition binding; and he<lb/>
had published articles on the subject in 1931 and 1932 that he was able to incorporate<lb/>
into his 1932 book. In the first chapter of that book, he modestly called it “a<lb/>
rather swollen appendix” to Sadleir’s book, but it is much more than that in<lb/>
several ways.<lb/>
First, the chapter called “Historical,” though it is a condensed ac-<lb/>
count of the beginnings and early use of cloth for bindings, draws on his<lb/>
own original research in publishers’ catalogues and trade journals. Second, the<lb/>
bulk of the first half is a detailed account of how to go about in-<lb/>
vestigating the bindings of nineteenth-century books and determining the<lb/>
order of variant bindings. He touches on the use of publishers’ records<lb/>
and catalogues, review copies, inscriptions, inserted advertisements,<lb/>
endpapers, and edge treatments, among much else, and he deals with such<lb/>
topics as special bindings, series variants, and bindings-up of parts, along<lb/>
with the description of cloth grains. The first half of the book (<hi>General</hi>), which<lb/>
also includes a “specimen investigation,” provides a “method of attack” that is<lb/>
then applied in the second half (<hi>Particular</hi>) to numerous books by some five<lb/>
dozen authors. This extensive survey of examples, based on the examination of<lb/>
an impressive number of copies, is yet another contribution of the book, making it<lb/>
useful for reference—and in the process displaying Carter’s cautious and undogmatic<lb/>
way of reaching conclusions.<lb/>
The book is addressed to “students and amateurs of book-structure” (p. xi), and<lb/>
Carter is concerned throughout to advance bibliographical study. He hopes to show<lb/>
“what an immensely important part of bibliography they [binding variants] become when<lb/>
they are taken seriously,” and he wants to help “develop a scientific method on<lb/>
general lines for dealing with so frequent a phenomenon” (p. 6). He makes clear<lb/>
that “the attitude of mind most desirable in a bibliographer is suspicion” (p. 39), and<lb/>
he stresses the necessity for examining multiple copies. His more specific observations<lb/>
on analyzing bindings form a perfect set of instructions for the beginner on<lb/>
how best to approach a nineteenth-century book: they have not been superseded, nor<lb/>
have they been stated in more attractive prose. Of the several pioneer studies of<lb/>
publishers’ bindings by Carter and Sadleir, this one is the most continuingly useful,<lb/>
still valuable as a guide.<lb/>
A few months after <hi>Binding Variants</hi>, another of Carter’s major<lb/>
publications came out: his edition of Sir Thomas Browne’s <hi>Urne Buriall</hi> and
<pb n="4"/>
<hi>the Garden of Cyrus</hi> (originally published in 1658, with “<hi>Urne Buriall</hi>” as a subtitle to “<hi>Hydriotaphia</hi>”).<lb/>
It was a lavish production, elegantly printed by the Curwen Press and published (in an edition of 215 copies) by Cassell & Company with thirty drawings by Paul Nash (printed by collotype and colored by pochoir) and a morocco and vellum binding designed by him.<lb/>
This handsome book is regularly regarded as one of the masterpieces of twentieth-century book production—as, for example, in Martin Hutner and Jerry Kelly’s <hi>A Century for a Century</hi> (Grolier Club, 1999).<lb/>
But the work also makes a scholarly contribution to the study of Browne. Carter had been reading Browne since his Eton days, and by the early 1930s he was on the trail of author-corrected copies of the first edition (as his letter to the <hi>Times Literary Supplement</hi> on 16 July 1931 shows), while he was working on a new edition, at the request of Desmond Flower (of Cassell’s).<lb/>
He was able to locate and use six such copies before his edition came out, only two of which had previously been known.<lb/>
The thoroughness of his work is symbolized by his annotated copy of Edward H. Marshall’s 1929 Mac-<lb/>
millan edition: its leaves, mounted on larger paper, were interleaved with blanks, which were covered with his notes reporting collations, references, and critical observations (described in G. F. Sims catalogue 102 [1979],<lb/>
item 85).<lb/>
As he noted in his introduction, he had collated all editions be-<lb/>
fore 1800 and all published in Great Britain since then (though he does<lb/>
not mention collating multiple copies of the early editions).<lb/>
Carter’s editorial approach was admirable. Because the successive<lb/>
lifetime editions were unreliable, he based his text on the first edition<lb/>
and reported all his departures from it (except the correction of turned,<lb/>
dropped, or transposed letters), as well as the results of his collations.<lb/>
Aside from the adoption of Browne’s own corrections, the departures<lb/>
were few because he retained the punctuation and spelling of the first<lb/>
edition (except the long s and the ”sporadic” use of v for u).<lb/>
He correctly recognized that Browne’s “use of commas and semicolons, like his use of initial capitals and italics is too much a part of himself and his period to submit to this wholesale modernization [of earlier editors].”<lb/>
Nevertheless he did make an “irreducible minimum of corrections where the com-<lb/>
positor’s carelessness has produced intolerable obscurity.”<lb/>
Clearly there is room for disagreement here, for some of the obscurity may not have<lb/>
been caused by the compositor, and in any case what is intolerable is a subjective matter.<lb/>
But critical editing necessarily entails judgment, and these alterations are all recorded<lb/>
in the notes. The introduction ends with a gracious point not often made: although he has criticized earlier edi-<lb/>
tions, he says, “one cannot begin to criticize an edition until one has used it thoroughly, so that criticism becomes almost a proof of obligation.”<lb/>
On 2 July 1934, less than two years after the Browne edition, Carter’s<lb/>
third major publication appeared—the one that made him a book-world<lb/>

<pb n="5"/>⏎<lb/>celebrity: <hi>An Enquiry into the Nature of Certain Nineteenth Century Pamphlets</hi>,<lb/>written in collaboration with Graham Pollard, a bookseller with the firm<lb/>of Birrell & Garnett. The story of how Carter and Pollard uncovered the<lb/>Wise-Forman forgeries has been told often; indeed, it is one of the best-known episodes in bibliographical history, familiar to many people outside the book world (as a result of such treatments as Richard D. Altick’s, in his 1950 book <hi>The Scholar Adventurers</hi>, and Dwight Macdonald’s, in a<lb/>1962 New Yorker article, as well as Carter’s own accounts). Its wide appeal<lb/>is understandable, as the story of two young booksellers who, through<lb/>persistent research, were able to bring down a dominant and respected<lb/>figure (for Thomas J. Wise was a distinguished collector and widely known<lb/>book-world symbol, the author of many bibliographies, and a former<lb/>president of the Bibliographical Society). It also has the elements of a detective story, with parts of a puzzle gradually, but inexorably, falling into<lb/>place. And in the Enquiry, given the panache of Carter’s prose, the story<lb/>was given a presentation that increased its appeal.<lb/>Many of the people who are attracted to the story for all these reasons,<lb/>however, do not recognize its important contribution to bibliographical<lb/>scholarship. Identifying the perpetrators (which the book did not explicitly do) is a different activity from proving that the pamphlets are indeed<lb/>fraudulent. In the absence of explicit documents, the former involves<lb/>circumstantial evidence, such as the fact that the suspected pamphlets<lb/>entered the market from the stock of a single dealer (Herbert E. Gorfin).<lb/>But the latter requires physical evidence from the items themselves. The<lb/>use of such evidence for investigating books of earlier periods was well established by this time, but the bibliographical analysis of nineteenth- and<lb/>twentieth-century books was in its infancy. The attention paid to “points”<lb/>in modern books by collectors, dealers, and the writers of author bibliographies was a form of physical examination, but it was often undisciplined<lb/>and lacking in a concern for uncovering book-production history. Publishers’ bindings, however, were beginning to be seriously studied, under<lb/>the leadership of Sadleir and Carter. And the Enquiry took a major step<lb/>forward in demonstrating ways in which the analysis of paper and type<lb/>could also be applied to post-1800 books.<lb/>It is possible that Carter’s collecting of detective fiction played a role<lb/>in inspiring the analysis of paper reported in the Enquiry. He was certainly<lb/>aware of the detective stories of R. Austin Freeman (discussed in his essay in <hi>New Paths in Book Collecting</hi> as reaching “a new level in scientific<lb/>detection”), and it is not unlikely that he knew “<hi>The Apparition of Burling Court</hi>” (1923; collected in <hi>The Puzzle Lock</hi>, 1925). In that story, the<lb/>detective, Dr. Thorndyke, proves a book to be fraudulent through several<lb/>physical tests, the decisive one being a laboratory examination of the paper, which showed that the paper contained mechanical wood-pulp and<lb/>
<p><pb n="6"/>
esparto. Thorndyke stated that “esparto was not used until 1860,” which<lb/>
was twenty years after the purported date of the book. It turns out that the<lb/>
presence of esparto in the paper of some of the pamphlets that Carter and<lb/>
Pollard were investigating was the basis for proving them to be forgeries.<lb/>
(Although Dr. Thorndyke is not referred to, another fictional detective,<lb/>
Edgar Allan Poe’s Auguste Dupin, is cited as a precursor in a later chapter<lb/>
[p. 87].) Whether or not there was any connection with Dr. Thorndyke,<lb/>
Carter and Pollard used the same procedure: after having the papers of<lb/>
the pamphlets tested and determining the dates when esparto and chemi-<lb/>
cal wood-pulp were introduced into papermaking, they found that twenty-<lb/>
two of the pamphlets had printed dates that preceded the dates when their<lb/>
paper would have been available, and thus they were fraudulent.</p>
<p>The authors were aware that their use of paper evidence was more<lb/>
groundbreaking than that of typographical evidence. The paper test, they<lb/>
said, “has not hitherto been applied to bibliographical purposes” (p. 42),<lb/>
whereas, in the opening sentence of the chapter on type, they call atten-<lb/>
tion to Robert Proctor’s work, decades earlier, identifying the printers<lb/>
of incunabula through the type designs. They also note that Proctor, a<lb/>
friend of William Morris, had in 1898 questioned (on the basis of its type)<lb/>
the Morris pamphlet that Carter and Pollard proved to be a forgery.</p>
<p>The typographical tests they used throughout were proposed by Stanley<lb/>
Morison (they could hardly have had a greater typographical adviser).<lb/>
He noticed the kernless “f” and “j” and the tilted question mark used<lb/>
in many of the pamphlets; and these characteristics not only provided<lb/>
another dating test (based on the earliest use of a kernless font) but also<lb/>
led to the identification of the printer as Richard Clay &amp; Sons (Clay had<lb/>
added that question mark to the font). The Clay firm was not involved in<lb/>
the deception: having been commissioned by Wise to print many facsimi-<lb/>
les for the Browning and Shelley societies, they had no reason to question<lb/>
the imprints and dates being placed on these other pamphlets. Carter and<lb/>
Pollard concluded that sixteen of the fraudulent pamphlets were definitely<lb/>
printed by Clay &amp; Sons and that all the rest probably were.</p>
<p>The analysis of paper and type is set out in chapters 4 and 5 with<lb/>
meticulous care and exemplary thoroughness. These chapters are part<lb/>
of the six that constitute part I, “Deduction,” tracing the story from the<lb/>
initial suspicion to the “proved conclusion.” In the last chapter of part I,<lb/>
the authors say, “With all its drudgery, detective work has a great intel-<lb/>
lectual fascination” (p. 93)—and this fascination has been conveyed to<lb/>
the reader. With the “machinery of detection” having been set forth, the<lb/>
authors move in part II, “Reconstruction,” to a description of the forger’s<lb/>
motivation, methods, and marketing strategies. Then comes the largest<lb/>
section of the book, part III, “Dossiers,” in which each of forty-six pam-<lb/>
<pb n="7"/>
<p>phlets (by fifteen authors) is given a thorough account, reporting (among<lb/>
other things) the history of references to it, the location of known cop-<lb/>
ies, the results of tests, and a conclusion. The book as a whole not only<lb/>
demonstrates the use of certain paper and typographical tests in biblio-<lb/>
graphical analysis but also provides a model of how to draw conclusions<lb/>
cautiously and present the results responsibly.<lb/>
</p>
<p>Another attraction of the book is its prose style. Although the book was<lb/>
a true collaboration between Carter and Pollard, Carter’s voice emerges<lb/>
plainly at many points, and some chapters are clearly his work, especially<lb/>
those in part II. The opening one, <hi>The Modern First Edition Market, 1885-1895</hi>, is an expert survey of the development of interest in literary<lb/>
first editions (a preview of the more detailed account in <hi>Taste and Technique in Book-Collecting</hi>), providing the necessary context for understanding<lb/>
why the kinds of pamphlets that Wise produced were sought after. It<lb/>
has many characteristic touches, such as this: “New vistas were opening<lb/>
before the collectors’ eyes, each with a glint of Eldorado at the end” (p. <lb/>
107). In “these feverish and speculative conditions,” Carter added, “it<lb/>
would have been almost surprising if there had not been some collateral<lb/>
descendant of Annius to perceive this golden opportunity. . . . At this time,<lb/>
the thing was, comparatively, easy money: the fish were rising, he [the<lb/>
forger] found (after a few experiments) the right fly, and they swallowed it<lb/>
with a regularity and unanimity which must have been to him exceedingly<lb/>
satisfactory” (pp. 108-09).<lb/>
</p>
<p>The chapter on “Establishing the Pedigrees” shows Carter at his most<lb/>
skillful, for he convincingly points the finger at Wise without saying out-<lb/>
right that Wise created the forgeries (which could not be said, since the<lb/>
documentary evidence that later turned up—incriminating Harry Buxton<lb/>
Forman as well as Wise—was not known at that time). Wise could be<lb/>
criticized in other ways, however, especially for his supposed failure to be<lb/>
suspicious of the pamphlets, given the circumstances of their appearance<lb/>
and his bibliographical expertise. His behavior, Carter suggests, “savoured<lb/>
of Nelson with the telescope to his blind eye” (p. 134). Carter was unspar-<lb/>
ing in his condemnation of the “shocking negligence” of Wise (even though<lb/>
he had to call the forger “anonymous”) and of the resulting damage:</p>
<quote>
<p>Mr. Wise, by his credulity, by his vanity in his own possessions, by his dogmatism, by<lb/>
abuse of his eminence in the bibliographical world, has dealt a blow to the prestige<lb/>
of an honourable science, the repercussions of which will be long and widely felt. . . .<lb/>
Like the thirteenth stroke of a faulty clock, which discredits the accuracy of the hours<lb/>
which have gone before, the spuriousness of these books must inevitably cast asper-<lb/>
sions on many similar books which are, in fact, genuine. . . . If Mr. Wise, one of the<lb/>
most eminent bibliographers of our time, can be so extensively wrong, who can we<lb/>
be sure is right? (pp. 141–42)</p>

<p>The <hi>Enquiry</hi> is a landmark of bibliographical analysis and the presentation<lb/>
of bibliographical evidence, and it is written in such a way that it is an<lb/>
enduringly readable story of detection.<lb/></p>
<p>The three major books of 1932-34 were not Carter’s only significant<lb/>
publications of the early 1930s. In November 1934, four months after the<lb/>
<hi>Enquiry</hi> appeared, Constable (in London) and Scribner’s (in New York)<lb/>
brought out a volume of essays (planned by him and Michael Sadleir)<lb/>
that he edited, entitled <hi>New Paths in Book Collecting</hi>. There had of course<lb/>
been a number of books about book collecting during the previous forty<lb/>
years, but what made this one distinctive was that it consisted of essays<lb/>
by different writers, each taking up an appealing direction for collecting.<lb/>
The authors were drawn primarily from his and Sadleir’s circle of book-world friends, half of them dealers and half collectors: Carter (on “Detective Fiction”), Sadleir (“Yellow-Backs”), P. H. Muir (“Ignoring the Flag”<lb/>
and “War Books”), Graham Pollard (“Serial Fiction”), David A. Randall<lb/>
(“American First Editions, 1900-1933”), Thomas Balston (“English Book<lb/>
Illustration, 1880-1900”), C. B. Oldman (“Musical First Editions”), and<lb/>
John T. Winterich (“The Expansion of an Author Collection”). When<lb/>
Carter commented on this book in 1948 (in <hi>Taste and Technique in Book-Collecting</hi>), he called it “only one instance of the responsible part taken in<lb/>
recent years by professional booksellers, not merely through their practical influence exerted in the course of business but also by their contributions to bibliophilic literature and propaganda, in the formulation and<lb/>
the exposition of theory, of policy and of practice in the book-collecting<lb/>
world” (Cambridge edition, p. 84). Here he was not only observing a development but also describing the path he saw for himself as a bookseller,<lb/>
one he faithfully followed.<lb/></p>
<p>The title of the volume was not meant to suggest that the subjects<lb/>
discussed were entirely new, for some collectors were already focusing<lb/>
on them; but they were new in the sense that they were not traditional,<lb/>
and the purpose of the book was to call attention to, and encourage,<lb/>
the approach to collecting represented by these trends. It was the paths<lb/>
that were new, not necessarily the subjects: the book aimed not to “dictate” but “to suggest by means of examples” (p. 7). As Carter remarked<lb/>
in <hi>Taste and Technique in Book-Collecting</hi>, the volume was “one gambit” in the “general propagandist movement towards diversity of method” (p. 84). Throughout his career, Carter argued that collectors should think on their own<lb/>
and not simply repeat what earlier collectors had done. In the introduction to this volume, for example, he says that collectors should have<lb/>
“enough independence to dislike joining the herd movements which<lb/>
are always ploughing their way across the book market” (p. 6). The<lb/>
point is made several times in the opening pages through metaphor.<lb/>
For example:<lb/></p>
<pb n="9"/>
<p>A collection of “high spots” may sound the chord of C major, which is indeed a fine<lb/>
and resounding noise; yet there are other and more subtle harmonies, the pleasantest<lb/>
of which are those which we evolve for ourselves. These are composed of notes which<lb/>
anyone can use and many have used, but by our own arrangement of them we can<lb/>
achieve a sound never heard before. (p. 11)<lb/>
</p>
<p>Earlier, in a visual metaphor, he says that the coherence of such a collec-<lb/>
tion can reveal a “beautiful pattern” (p. 4). This newly revealed pattern,<lb/>
like the “sound never heard before,” makes a “contribution to knowledge” (a phrase<lb/>
used on the first page). Implicit in all the essays that<lb/>
follow (“<hi>essays in method</hi>,” he calls them), and often explicit as well, is a<lb/>
recognition that collecting is a form of historical study and that follow-<lb/>
ing new paths increases our understanding of the past. With this kind of<lb/>
grounding, <hi>New Paths</hi> remains one of the most perceptive and inspiring<lb/>
of introductory guides.<lb/>
</p>
<p>Carter followed up on this book in two ways the same year. With<lb/>
Sadleir, he organized an exhibition “arranged to illustrate” <hi>New Paths</hi> at J. &amp; E. Bumpus, accompanied by a substantial annotated catalogue; and for<lb/>
the Scribner Book Store he put together a catalogue on detective fiction<lb/>
(largely from his own collection). (In the next few years, he and David A.<lb/>
Randall, head of Scribner’s Rare Book Department in New York as of<lb/>
March 1935, publicized many more new paths in their catalogues.) His<lb/>
interest in publishers’ bindings also led to further contributions to their<lb/>
history in the form of two introductions to Elkin Mathews catalogues<lb/>
(1932) and two small books, <hi>Publishers’ Cloth</hi> (1935, in connection with<lb/>
an exhibition at the New York Public Library) and <hi>More Binding Variants</hi><lb/>
(1938, a supplement to his 1932 book).<lb/>
</p>
<p>His editorial work also continued with editions of Housman’s <hi>Introductory Lecture</hi> (1933) and <hi>The Collected Poems</hi> (1939) and an incomplete<lb/>
edition of <hi>Catullus</hi> (two fascicles only, 1934–35). (The <hi>The Collected Poems</hi> was<lb/>
published without an editor’s name; but four years later, in the course of<lb/>
an article in the <hi>Times Literary Supplement</hi> on 5 and 12 June 1943, Carter<lb/>
revealed his editorship publicly.) These efforts, however, did not have the<lb/>
scholarly merit of the Browne edition. The Housman <hi>The Collected Poems</hi>, to<lb/>
take the primary example, could have been a triumph; but it was hastily<lb/>
produced and involved faulty editorial judgments. Housman’s will autho-<lb/>
rized his brother Laurence to destroy some manuscripts and to oversee<lb/>
the use of the others; and Laurence in turn asked Carter (who had helped<lb/>
organize the manuscripts) to produce an edition of the poetry. The result<lb/>
was criticized, beginning in the autumn of 1952 (when the book was in<lb/>
its thirteenth impression), by two American scholars, Tom Burns Haber<lb/>
(Ohio State) and William White (Wayne State), leading to an acrimonious<lb/>
feud that erupted periodically in the pages of the <hi>Times Literary Supplement</hi><lb/>
(and, to a lesser extent, <hi>The Book Collector</hi>) over the next sixteen years.<lb/>
</p>
<pb n="10"/>
<p>It started on 26 September 1952 in the <hi rend="italic">TLS</hi> with a letter from White,<lb/>
using information from Haber, who had studied the Housman manu-<lb/>
scripts, beginning in 1950, much more thoroughly than Carter had.<lb/>
White’s letter, referring to Carter’s “slip-shod editing,” alludes to the<lb/>
two concerns that were the basis of their criticism: the outright errors<lb/>
in the text and the questionable judgment underlying the handling of<lb/>
uncanceled manuscript alternatives, where Carter followed the choices<lb/>
made by Laurence Housman in the poems included in his posthumous<lb/>
editions. Carter’s response (24 October 1952) was weak on both counts.<lb/>
Regarding the first, he said he had only claimed “a more correct text.”<lb/>
As for the second, he asserted that “the person authorized to perform<lb/>
this [choice among variants] . . . was the author’s brother, whose judg-<lb/>
ment they [White and Haber] are not entitled to challenge.” Haber’s long<lb/>
letter on 7 November mainly described the history of the manuscripts<lb/>
and his work with them; and it was not until a year later (2 October<lb/>
1953) that Haber, in a good letter summarizing the situation, made a proper<lb/>
reply to Carter’s second point. Carter, he said, “is speaking wildly when<lb/>
he says (of the poet’s brother) that consanguinity endows an editor with<lb/>
omniscience when choosing between alternative readings in a manuscript.”<lb/>
Haber ends by regretting that the text “should be toyed with once again,”<lb/>
since the fourteenth impression, about to appear, was not to be a thorough<lb/>
revision. That fourteenth impression, “freshly corrected” according to<lb/>
Carter (23 October 1953), still contained errors that were noted by<lb/>
White (12 February 1954), who also questioned Carter’s assertion that<lb/>
Housman’s will gave his brother the right to choose between variants.<lb/>
Despite Carter’s assurance (5 March 1954), White’s quotation from the will<lb/>
(14 May 1954) suggests that Carter was incorrect. But this point, of<lb/>
course, is a legal one and is irrelevant to a scholarly editor’s obligation to<lb/>
think through textual decisions independently. The debate was quiescent<lb/>
for the next five years; but during that time Haber’s <hi>The Manuscript Poems of A. E. Housman</hi> (1955)<lb/>
appeared, and it produced discussion in the <hi rend="italic">TLS</hi> (1 July 1955; 15 June, 20, 27 July 1956)<lb/>
and <hi>The Book Collector</hi> (4:110-14) that intensified the lack of civility between Carter and Haber—<lb/>
though the anonymous front-page <hi rend="italic">TLS</hi> review of Haber’s book on 29 April<lb/>
1955, one of the most severe attacks the <hi rend="italic">TLS</hi> has ever published, was not by<lb/>
Carter but by his friend and occasional collaborator John Sparrow.<lb/>
The controversy over <hi>The Collected Poems</hi> revived again when Haber<lb/>
brought out a volume in 1959 called <hi>Complete Poems: Centennial Edition</hi> (from<lb/>
the same American publisher as <hi>The Collected Poems</hi>), which<lb/>
contained the same poems as Carter’s edition but with different texts.<lb/>
Carter asked (29 May 1959) whether Haber had received authorization from<lb/>
the Housman estate, questioned a number of readings, and said that<lb/>
Haber’s textual es-<lb/>
</p>
<pb n="11"/>
<p>say “follows the expectable line of quiet superiority.”<lb/>
After Haber replied (24 July 1959), Carter maintained that only his edition was authorized and<lb/>
that Haber was not qualified to “tamper” with the text; and he concluded<lb/>
his letter (14 August 1959) as follows:<lb/>
</p>
<p>I am if anything more conscious to-day of the fallibility of my eyes and of my<lb/>
judgment than I was, thirty-odd years ago, when Housman lectured to us on textual<lb/>
criticism at Cambridge. Mr. Haber, as students of his writings must by now be well<lb/>
aware, is afflicted with no such humility. This puts him at an advantage in the protracted<lb/>
controversy into which I have been, most reluctantly, drawn. But I am not<lb/>
sure that the advantage is shared by the poet and his readers, whom each of us is<lb/>
trying in his own way to serve.<lb/>
</p>
<p>Haber’s Complete Poems was withdrawn after several impressions (following the English publisher’s insistence that it was unauthorized), and the<lb/>
debate over The Collected Poems finally ended almost a decade later, when<lb/>
White reported (11 January 1968) only three “trifling errors” in the latest<lb/>
impression (the correction of which he acknowledged on 1 October 1971).<lb/>
But since in the same issue (11 January 1968) Haber pursued his feud<lb/>
with Sparrow, Carter could not resist one more sarcastic retort (14 March<lb/>
1968). Reacting to Haber’s account of first looking into the manuscripts,<lb/>
Carter says, “It is as if stout Cortes had beheld the Pacific for the first<lb/>
time (except that Cortes, if Keats is to be believed, was silent).” And in the<lb/>
same letter Carter calls White “that indefatigable vigilante of Housman’s<lb/>
text.” The condescending tone was inappropriate, for Carter should himself have been such a vigilante, having accepted the task of editing these<lb/>
poems. Nevertheless, his 1939 edition gave readers convenient access to<lb/>
the body of Housman’s poetry for the first time; and, in its successive revisions,<lb/>
it remained the standard text for many decades.<lb/>
</p>
<p>Aside from his various book publications of the 1930s, Carter made<lb/>
important contributions to the book world during these years through his<lb/>
journalism and his participation in other activities that promoted communication<lb/>
among members of that world. His first book-related journalism appeared in <hi>Publishers’ Weekly</hi>, as a result of his having become<lb/>
acquainted with its editor, Frederick G. Melcher, during his first trip to<lb/>
New York in 1929. At that time <hi>Publishers’ Weekly</hi> was a crucial journal<lb/>
for the antiquarian-book world as well as the new-book world through its<lb/>
inclusion of a department called “Old and Rare Books,” which provided<lb/>
substantial articles and reviews along with columns by Frederick M. Hopkins<lb/>
(“Rare Book Notes”) and Jacob Blanck (“News from the Rare Book<lb/>
Shops”). Carter became a regular contributor, producing nearly seventy<lb/>
pieces (articles, reviews, letters) from 1930 through 1947, at which time<lb/>
the function of the rare-book section was taken over by a new periodical,<lb/>
<hi>Antiquarian Bookman</hi>. (Publishers’ Weekly did not forget its role in Carter’s<lb/>

<pb n="12"/>⏎career and offered one of the most informative biographical articles about him in its issue of 3 January 1953.)<lb/>⏎When, in the issue of 20 December 1941, he looked back on his PW writings, he found “some couched in the intolerant language of youth, others in the autocratic style of middle age, but none of them expressing sentiments to which their writer would not still subscribe.”<lb/>⏎They include some of the best articles he ever wrote.<lb/>⏎</p>⏎<p>⏎At the same time Carter was playing a role in the creation of another outlet for book-world news, the back page of the Times Literary Supplement.<lb/>⏎Michael Sadleir was the prime mover in this endeavor: in early 1931 he convened a group of friends (including Carter, Pollard, Percy Muir, John Hayward, and Dudley Massey) to discuss with Simon Nowell-Smith, a new member of the Times staff, the possibility of expanding the coverage of the book world on the TLS back page from the limited “Notes on Sales” it presently carried.<lb/>⏎This group, which became known as the “Biblio Boys,” continued (with an evolving membership) to have monthly dinners for many decades; it stands as a major example of the role that social connections and personal communication can play in the responsible development of a field (as glimpsed in Bertram Rota catalogue 290, The Biblio-Boys, 1999).<lb/>⏎The earliest instance of the group’s influence was the invigoration of the TLS back page, which did become a widely followed forum for the antiquarian-book world.<lb/>⏎Carter was by far its most prolific contributor—and, beginning in 1946 during Stanley Morison’s editorship, its formally appointed supervisor, a position he kept (except during his Washington years, 1953-55) until 1967, when the bibliographical page ceased to be a regular feature.<lb/>⏎He wrote about 700 reviews for the TLS between 1931 and the end of his life, along with some 300 other pieces (letters, articles, and notes, many of them amounting to additional reviews).<lb/>⏎His sensible and well-expressed views (which had a scholarly underpinning) were thereby given wide circulation.<lb/>⏎But the TLS policy of anonymity meant that most readers (those not privy to book-world gossip) were not aware that Carter’s was the dominant voice through which they were being provided with remarkably thorough coverage from the antiquarian-book world, including reports of auctions and exhibitions as well as reviews of bibliographical journals and books.<lb/>⏎</p>⏎<p>Another product of the Biblio Boys’ conversations, though of much shorter duration, was Bibliographical Notes & Queries, a periodical that Muir undertook to edit from the Elkin Mathews shop, beginning in January of 1935.<lb/>⏎Carter did his part to make the journal succeed by furnishing a large number of queries and replies (many under pseudonyms), covering a wide range of topics, from publishing practices to specific books (often with substantial discussions).<lb/>⏎But the services to scholarship provided by the journal were not sufficiently used to allow it to continue past the May 1939 issue.<lb/>⏎It was nevertheless a valiant attempt to promote the inter-
<pb n="13"/>
<p>change of ideas and information, a perennial concern of Carter’s circle<lb/>of book-world friends. His own efforts—in reviews, notes, catalogue entries, talks, and conversations—took up a lot of his time, but they played<lb/>a major role, through their ubiquity and style, in educating all kinds of<lb/>participants in the book world. And they did not prevent his producing<lb/>substantial scholarly work. In May of 1939, when BN&amp;Q ended and he<lb/>marked his thirty-fourth birthday, he could look back on a decade of impressive accomplishment, rarely equaled in bibliographical history.<lb/></p>
<head>The 1940s</head>
<p>Carter’s role in the war effort began in September 1939, when he became a press censor for the Ministry of Information, serving as information secretary to the Minister, Brendan Bracken.<lb/>His duties there allowed him to continue his work at Scribner’s (whose office at 23 Bedford Square was around the corner); but four years later, in November 1943, he was<lb/>named director of the General Division of the Ministry’s New York office, called British Information Services, which necessitated his taking a leave<lb/>of absence from Scribner’s. (In his New York position, which involved being supervisor of publications, he wrote in 1945 an anonymous and<lb/>widely circulated pamphlet, <hi>Victory in Burma</hi>, intended to show, as he says at the outset, that Britain’s Burma campaigns “have been an integral and<lb/>a vital part of the over-all Allied strategy in the war against Japan.”) His<lb/>government service ended in October 1945; and at the beginning of 1946 he was named managing director of Scribner’s London office, with new<lb/>responsibilities added to his previous ones. It is understandable, therefore,<lb/>that the pace of his writing in the 1930s could not be maintained in the<lb/>1940s. But he did produce a major book and kept up his journalistic presence, even adding two mass-circulation magazines, <hi>The Atlantic Monthly</hi><lb/>and <hi>The Cornhill Magazine</hi>, to his outlets (having written some theater reviews for <hi>The Spectator</hi> in 1940).<lb/></p>
<p>His reviews and reports for <hi>Publishers’ Weekly</hi> in the late 1930s and early 1940s contain many moving references to the war.<lb/>He begins his comment on the first volume of W. W. Greg’s drama bibliography this way: “This is the week of Hitler’s invasion of Holland, Belgium, Luxembourg and France.<lb/>It is, therefore, a week in which the words ‘important’ and ‘a major event’ sound a little odd when applied to a book.”<lb/>Later in the same column, he notes the ending of <hi>Bibliographical Notes &amp; Queries</hi> and adds, “Let us hope that it may revive, with other humane activities, when we reach that post-war world which now looks so much like a mirage” (15 June 1940).<lb/>The title of another piece, “Bomb-Proof Bibliography” (21 October 1939), is explained at the outset: “When the newspapers are full of the war, and our sleep is constantly interrupted by air-raid<lb/>
<pb n="14"/>
warnings, it is comforting to turn, for a change of air, to these scholarly pages” (referring to Dorothy Blakey’s <hi>Minerva Press bibliography</hi>).<lb/>
In the spring of 1941 he could report, in reference to the Maggs shop, that “the nightingale is still singing in Berkeley Square—this year in the key of B minor” (19 April 1941).<lb/>
</p>
<p>
One of the high points of the war years for him, and one of the most emotional, was the occasion (7 July 1941) when he presented to Churchill the manuscript of Clough’s poem that Churchill had read in a radio broadcast two months earlier; his charming account, in the issue of 2 August 1941, is <hi>Clough to Churchill</hi>.<lb/>
On that occasion he also gave Churchill a copy of <hi>Grim Glory</hi>, the 1941 book of wartime photographs edited by his wife, for which he had composed the dedication to Churchill.<lb/>
(Five years earlier, on 26 December 1936, he had married Ernestine Fantl, a native of Savannah, Georgia, who was then the curator of architecture at the Museum of Modern Art.)<lb/>
The most memorable of all these pieces, <hi>A Bookseller’s Day in London</hi> (2 November 1940), reports that “it’s three weeks now since I went to sleep not hearing a German bomber somewhere overhead”; and he wakes up to “the now all too familiar sound of the demolition squads shovelling piles of broken glass into trucks.”<lb/>
Instead of reading the morning papers he turns to a favorite essay by his great-great-uncle William Johnson Cory, “which makes me think of sanity and the classics and all the things I was brought up to respect.”<lb/>
His account of his day’s routine under wartime conditions is journalism at its best, vividly conveying the atmosphere of a particular time and place.<lb/>
Carter’s major book of the 1940s resulted from his being asked to deliver the Sandars Lectures in Bibliography at Cambridge in 1947.<lb/>
Entitled <hi>Taste and Technique in Book-Collecting</hi>, the book was published on 26 July 1948 by R. R. Bowker in New York (the publisher of <hi>Publishers’ Weekly</hi>) and, three months later (on 29 October), by Cambridge University Press in England.<lb/>
(The Cambridge edition is preferable, with its wonderful typography, its comfortable feel in the hand, and its old-fashioned use of recto running-titles, obviously written by Carter, that summarize the content of each two-page spread—this last a feature of the <hi>Enquiry</hi> also. For typographic excellence, the book was named one of the <hi rend="bold">“Fifty Books of the Year”</hi> by the National Book League.)<lb/>
It is, in my opinion, Carter’s best book, and the best book about book collecting ever written.<lb/>
Although it has many devotees, it has nevertheless been overshadowed by several of his other books.<lb/>
The reason may be its title, which sounds like a how-to manual.<lb/>
But the book is actually a perceptive historical study of book collecting, along with an account of the role of taste and technique (that is, connoisseurship) in making it a serious scholarly pursuit.<lb/>
He states in the preface that it is “not a primer or a text-book or a manual for beginners” but rather “a somewhat ruminative treatise”— or, as he later says,<lb/>

<pb n="15"/>
<p>an <hi>advanced treatise of a general kind</hi> (Cambridge edition, p. 107).<lb/>
And he begins the second part by describing what is to follow as <hi>reflexions, not advice</hi>.<lb/>
No one, he believes, <hi>can learn how to collect from manuals or at second hand</hi> (p. 91).<lb/>
Nevertheless, the book is full of well-reasoned observations, and anyone who takes them to heart will have acquired the best kind of preparation—not conveyed by instructions but by penetrating insights born of wide experience and learning.<lb/>
The book is a tour de force, or a series of such tours, for each chapter is a showpiece.<lb/>
Elegant in structure, as in all other aspects, it is divided into two parts of six chapters each: the first part is called <hi>Evolution</hi> and the second <hi>Method</hi>.<lb/>
This pairing is not to be equated with <hi>taste</hi> and <hi>technique</hi>, because the latter two (for which we could substitute <hi>temperament</hi> and <hi>approach</hi>) run throughout the book as a unifying thread.<lb/>
The <hi>Evolution</hi> section is a marvelously rich account of nineteenth-century British and American collecting (with a few glimpses of earlier centuries and the European continent)—rich both in the number of individuals cited and in the analyses of the patterns and motives they display (not forgetting the role of literary criticism).<lb/>
The second part, <hi>Method</hi>, includes chapters on <hi>Tools and Terminology</hi>, <hi>Bookshop and Auction Room</hi>, <hi>Rarity</hi> (the longest chapter and a particularly impressive one), and <hi>Condition</hi>.<lb/>
Even the discussion of reference books (in the first of these), is enjoyable; and although it is inevitably dated in its citations, it is still worth reading for its astute comments on categories of reference works.<lb/>
In the same way, the fact that the examples drawn on in every chapter have to be from before 1949 does not make the book seem dated, for they so thoroughly document a wide range of situations that one can see their applicability to any period.<lb/>
And the awesome profusion of examples, one of the hallmarks of the book, is an extreme demonstration of the feats of memory attainable by attentive booksellers.<lb/>
The final chapter is appropriately on <hi>Condition</hi>, for a subcategory of that topic, <hi>original condition</hi>, turns up throughout the book: the primary movement, after all, in the story that Carter tells of the evolution of book collecting is the growing concern with preserving books in their original condition.<lb/>
The earlier interest in possessing books in fine bindings began changing in the late nineteenth century, with Wise as a principal instigator, to an emphasis on the historical significance of original condition.<lb/>
Carter’s investigations of nineteenth-century publishers’ bindings is an indication of his firm belief in the importance of such condition.<lb/>
If the published forms of books are relatively easy to define after the introduction of edition-binding, they are not obvious for earlier books.<lb/>
From his first article, entitled <hi>Original Condition: An Appeal to Reason</hi> (1930), Carter continually argued for a <hi>reasonable</hi> approach to this question.<lb/>
By that he meant that a collector should not hold out for a copy in the un-<lb/>

<pb n="16"/>
bound or temporarily bound condition that occasionally survives; instead,<lb/>
one should be satisfied with a contemporary bound copy (which could be<lb/>
one of the copies originally offered for retail sale). For this period, in other<lb/>
words, original condition could refer to any of the forms that might have<lb/>
been encountered in a bookseller’s shop.<lb/>
</p>
<p>His position is indeed reasonable, but when he writes on this subject, he is inclined to take one false step: to use, as a support for his point of view, the idea that boards or wrappers were “by intention ephemeral” (p. 178), representing “the chrysalis stage of production” (p. 180). The printer’s or publisher’s assumption that wrappers or boards would be replaced does not alter the historical fact that such a stage existed and is therefore worthy of attention. Carter does recognize the value of the bibliographical evidence (as he always does), but there was no need to introduce, as if it were relevant, the presumed expectations of the producers of the books. To do so may be a consolation for collectors, but it is a rare lapse in logic for Carter.<lb/>
</p>
<p>As usual, his prose is a delight (even though in the 1970 reprint he claimed to detect “a certain stylistic dandyism” in it). The book should be read slowly, so that each paragraph (and most of its constituent sentences) can be savored. The richness of the texture is created by—to name some of its elements—balanced syntax, precise but often surprising diction, striking metaphors, a profusion of proper names and italicized titles, a judicious sprinkling of foreign words (including untransliterated Greek), and an affinity for colons. One cannot help but think that his love of seventeenth-century prose, especially Thomas Browne’s, played its part. Dipping into the book anywhere is likely to pull up a memorable, and often aphoristic, sentence, such as: “whenever expertise becomes an end in itself instead of the means to an end, it results in empty virtuosity” (p. 81). Or, on the fondness some collectors feel for books of their youth: this attraction “often reflects the unpredictable influence of some miscellaneous shelf which the mere accident of propinquity at a receptive period has endowed with an unforgotten magic” (p. 72). Or, for a more extended example, dealing with one of Carter’s favorite, and most important, topics:<lb/>
</p>
<p>And if I return now to individuality of taste and the variety of approach involved in breaking new ground—both healthy signs of originality, enterprise and intelligence—it is for the purpose of emphasising the importance of a sense of balance in the general structure. For although I have been, and remain, a proponent of idiosyncrasy, a warm supporter of the unusual approach in book-collecting, I have detected in myself and have sometimes suspected among my book-collecting friends a tendency to a certain esotericism of taste which is analogous to, and is indeed sometimes allied with, that conscious virtuosity in technique to which I referred earlier. It is, equally with the other, a perfectly legitimate tendency in the sophisticated collector, as long as it is clearly recognised as such. But since it is the sophisticated collectors
<pb n="17"/>
who most influence the unsophisticated, there is always a danger that their manner-
<lb/>
isms, whether of taste or method, will be imitated (and usually exaggerated) while
<lb/>
their underlying purpose remains unrecognised: just as many an architect who slaps
<lb/>
on a swag here or a cupola there fondly supposes himself to be thereby qualifying for
<lb/>
comparison with Wren or Brunelleschi. (pp. 88-89)
<lb/>
The rhythms of this paragraph, the placement of its pauses, leading to-
<lb/>
ward the summarizing simile, make it a characteristic performance.
<lb/>
The personality that comes through is learned and humane—to use
<lb/>
the adjectives that Carter applied on the first page to A. W. Pollard’s
<lb/>
great essay on book collecting in the eleventh edition of the <hi>Encyclopaedia Britannica</hi>. Carter’s scholarly temperament, and his consequent concern
<lb/>
with history, are evident throughout, epitomized perhaps in his insistence
<lb/>
that any “restoration” of a book be accompanied by a statement in which
<lb/>
“the nature of the repairs made to it” are “recorded indelibly” (p. 185).
<lb/>
He insisted that scholarly bibliographical analyses have “a strong claim
<lb/>
on the attention of the average collector” (p. 114), and he recognized
<lb/>
the role of collectors as scholars: “the ultimate value of the bibliophile
<lb/>
to pure scholarship depends on his recognition as an active entity, not
<lb/>
a mere appendix” (p. 99). In his discussion of Sadleir’s <hi>Bibliographia</hi>
<lb/>
series, Carter observed that it was “marked by a scholarly appreciation
<lb/>
of the importance of book-structure and publishing practice to the intel-
<lb/>
ligent collector, whose acquiescence in this proposition was enlisted by
<lb/>
being taken for granted” (p. 61). There could be no better description of
<lb/>
Carter’s own book.
<lb/>
The same mind is obviously at work in his journalism of the 1940s.
<lb/>
For example, in reviewing J. D. Cowley’s <hi>Bibliographical Description and Cataloguing</hi>,
<lb/>
he said, “The principles of bibliography are valid for books
<lb/>
of all periods, and even the chronicler of a living author is the better for
<lb/>
having learned how to collate an incunable” (<hi>Publishers’ Weekly</hi>, 16 March
<lb/>
1940). And after the war, when he described the great Yale convocation
<lb/>
of October 1946 to “mark the return of the University’s collections to
<lb/>
peacetime use” (<hi>Publishers’ Weekly</hi>, 23 November 1946), he concluded his
<lb/>
highly laudatory account with these important reflections:
<lb/>
Objects—books, pictures, or bones—are part of the stuff of scholarship, of culture,
<lb/>
of ideas. It is axiomatic that it is the duty of institutions to acquire, preserve and
<lb/>
catalog them; generally agreed, though not everywhere achieved, that they should
<lb/>
be readily available to those who need to study them; but much less often recognized
<lb/>
that they require to be actively injected into the thoughts and studies of the academic,
<lb/>
and also of the wider, world outside their glass cases. Every year museums and librar-
<lb/>
ies get fuller and the problem of exploiting their resources more formidable. The
<lb/>
methods by which this can best be done vary with the circumstances; but the amount
<lb/>
of imagination and enterprise being devoted in this country [the United States] to
<lb/>
making such collections as Yale’s not a mere adjunct but an integral and living part

<pb n="18"/>of the world of taste and scholarship is something of which Americans may rightly<lb/>
be proud.<lb/>
That these enlightened ideas, and others like them, were expressed in a<lb/>
journal with the wide readership (mostly nonbibliographical) of <hi>Publishers’ Weekly</hi> was fortunate; and one cannot help regretting that Carter’s voice<lb/>
was not much heard there after the rare-book department was ceded to<lb/>
the <hi>Antiquarian Bookman</hi> in 1948.<lb/>
Two other publications of the 1940s deserve mention. In 1941, Carter<lb/>
and Brooke Crutchley (of <hi>Cambridge University Press</hi>) produced a re-<lb/>
vised edition of Harry G. Aldis’s 1916 <hi>The Printed Book</hi>. Although their<lb/>
edition is now superseded, it is significant for the role it played for a<lb/>
decade or two. Their contribution was to provide up-to-date coverage<lb/>
of the nineteenth-century revolution in book production, especially the<lb/>
introduction of publishers’ binding and new methods of printing and il-<lb/>
lustration. The book was one more element in Carter’s ongoing effort to<lb/>
promote the study of nineteenth-century books. And since it sold well<lb/>
(with reprintings occurring in 1947 and 1951), it served that purpose ef-<lb/>
fectively. At the other end of the decade, in 1948, another of Carter’s<lb/>
perennial concerns was represented in <hi>The Firm of Charles Ottley, Landon &amp; Co.</hi> (the title-page authorship credited to Carter “with Graham Pollard”).<lb/>
As the subtitle indicated, it was a “footnote to <hi>An Enquiry</hi>,” proving four<lb/>
more pamphlets fraudulent and serving as the first interim report on the<lb/>
continuing investigation of the <hi>Wise-Forman</hi> forgeries.<lb/>
<lb/>
The 1950s<lb/>
The next decade was one of dramatic change in Carter’s life. In early<lb/>
1953 <hi>Scribner’s</hi> closed most of its London operations, thus ending Cart-<lb/>
er’s quarter-century association with the firm (during which time he had<lb/>
made thirty-six Atlantic crossings). And in October of 1955 he happily<lb/>
joined <hi>Sotheby’s</hi> book department as a half-time associate, with special<lb/>
responsibility for being the American representative (a particularly appro-<lb/>
priate appointment since he already knew the American scene so well);<lb/>
this arrangement left him free to engage at the same time in independent<lb/>
consulting for collectors and librarians, an activity that extended the in-<lb/>
fluence of his ideas.<lb/>
During the two and a half years in between (from April 1953 to Oc-<lb/>
tober 1955), he was based at the British Embassy in Washington as the<lb/>
personal assistant (with the rank of Counsellor) to the British ambassador,<lb/>
Sir Roger Makins (a service for which he was later named Commander of<lb/>
the <hi>Order of the British Empire</hi>). He was a perfect choice, with his wide<lb/>
knowledge of the United States and his elegance in manner and dress as
<pb n="19"/>well as in speaking and writing. The job had a large social component,<lb/>and Carter and his wife greatly enjoyed this period of their lives. (In her<lb/>entertaining and perceptive 1974 autobiography, <hi>With Tongue in Chic</hi>, she<lb/>says, “The Washington years were golden years.”) The flavor of their<lb/>Washington life is suggested by a thank-you note from T. S. Eliot written<lb/>on 22 May 1955, after a luncheon party at the Carters’ Georgetown house<lb/>(quoted from R. M. Smythe auction catalogue 157, 13 November 1996,<lb/>lot 412, with one correction):<lb/><lb/>Dear Ernestine<lb/>I can’t leave Washington without writing to thank you & John for your hospitality<lb/>- for a delicious lunch beautifully served in perfect surroundings and in a company<lb/>at once distinguished and sympathetic. And if you were leaving Washington in the<lb/>autumn for any other destination than London, I should say how sorry I was not to<lb/>able to look forward to a similar occasion next year.<lb/>Yours gratefully<lb/>Tom Eliot<lb/><lb/>The glamorous life implied here (or “glittering,” as Ernestine called it) was<lb/>not an unaccustomed one for the Carters: given the connections Carter<lb/>had made through the international world of collecting and the fact that<lb/>Ernestine had been, before the move to Washington, an influential fash-<lb/>ion journalist with the English Harper’s Bazaar (becoming Women’s Editor<lb/>of The Sunday Times on their return to London, and later Associate Editor),<lb/>their combined circle of celebrity acquaintances was impressive, as was<lb/>their entertaining. I have remarked in the past on the interdependence<lb/>of all parts of a person’s life and on how the scholarly (or bibliographical)<lb/>and the social nourish each other. One illustration of this point that I have<lb/>used is the life of Mary Hyde, and it happens that the Hydes were New<lb/>York friends of Carter. When Carter was setting up a New York office for<lb/>Sotheby’s, Donald Hyde provided space and secretarial help in his law<lb/>firm’s financial-district premises at 61 Broadway. Carter’s writings, no less<lb/>than his bookselling activities, benefited from the knowledge and contacts<lb/>furnished by his full social life.<lb/><lb/>Eighteen months before Carter began at the embassy in Washington,<lb/>he delivered one of the Windsor Lectures at the University of Illinois<lb/>and produced for that occasion a landmark essay, <hi>Some Bibliographical Agenda</hi>—agenda, that is, for the study of nineteenth-century English<lb/>books, which was the subject of this lecture series in October 1951. (The<lb/>essay was published the next year in a volume that included the essays<lb/>by the other two lecturers that year, Gordon N. Ray and Carl J. Weber;<lb/>Carter also selected it for his 1956 collection, <hi>Books and Book-Collectors</hi>.)<lb/>In his essay, Carter set the stage for future work: after summarizing the<lb/>revolutionary changes in book production in the nineteenth century that<lb/>
<pb n="20"/><lb/>
complicate bibliographical research on books of that period and after<lb/>
outlining what little work had been done, he focused on a few of the<lb/>
complicating features, such as cancels, binding variants, and inserted ad-<lb/>
vertisements. His comments, as always, are grounded in an understanding<lb/>
of the importance of printing and publishing history for bibliographical<lb/>
analysis and description.<lb/>
At the time, Fredson Bowers’s <hi>Principles of Bibliographical Description</hi><lb/>
was a relatively new book, having been published at the very end of<lb/>
1949; but Carter had absorbed it, and he ended his essay with a generally<lb/>
shrewd assessment. He was sympathetic, of course, with Bowers’s<lb/>
conception of bibliography as historical scholarship, and he welcomed<lb/>
Bowers’s efforts to systematize work on modern books. But he correctly<lb/>
noted that Bowers’s lack of experience (at that time) with nineteenth- and<lb/>
twentieth-century books weakened his treatment of them, which showed<lb/>
“signs of the rigidity natural to a cautious man operating in comparatively<lb/>
unfamiliar territory.” One result, as Carter recognized, is that Bowers<lb/>
inappropriately extended to the period of publishers’ bindings the idea<lb/>
that only the sheets (and not the binding) of a book could be a determi-<lb/>
nant of issue. The one place where Carter slipped up was when he said<lb/>
that Bowers’s collation formula might be “unnecessarily elaborate” for<lb/>
nineteenth-century books, seemingly not recognizing that the formula<lb/>
was not elaborate for books with a simple structure and that the for-<lb/>
mulary had to be prepared to handle complex structures, which many<lb/>
nineteenth-century books certainly do have. But if we make allowance<lb/>
for this misjudgment, we can still read the essay with profit for its many<lb/>
helpful insights and its point of view.<lb/>
About a year after Carter delivered this lecture, his <hi>ABC for Book-Collectors</hi> (1952)<lb/>
was published—the book that has proved to be his most<lb/>
famous one. It has sold well throughout the English-speaking world for<lb/>
several generations and is now in its ninth edition (having been sensitively<lb/>
revised several times since his death by Nicolas Barker, most recently<lb/>
with Simran Thadani). The book was not the first glossary of book-world<lb/>
terms: a well-established one, <hi>The Bookman’s Glossary</hi>, had been published<lb/>
in 1926 by R. R. Bowker, the publisher of the American edition of Carter’s<lb/>
<hi>Taste and Technique</hi>, and was in its third edition in 1952. Carter’s concern<lb/>
with improving it had been shown in a letter noted in <hi>Publishers’ Weekly</hi> on<lb/>
11 August 1945; but the Glossary was geared more toward librarians and<lb/>
publishers than collectors and dealers, and the ABC was, as Carter says<lb/>
in his preface, the first “to deal comprehensively with the terminology of<lb/>
this particular subject and no other.” He benefited from the advice of an<lb/>
impressive group of consultants, enumerated in the preface as “a sort of<lb/>
Tenth Legion,” and the result was a remarkably thorough treatment. It<lb/>
included not only terms one encounters in dealers’ catalogues and basic<lb/>

<pb n="21"/>concepts of collecting (such as “condition”) but also standard reference<lb/>
books and fundamental points of bibliographical analysis.<lb/>
</p>
<p>Indeed, Carter’s recognition of the essential role of bibliographical<lb/>
scholarship in collecting is a notable feature of the book. One learns, for<lb/>
example, about formes and collations, the bibliographical meanings of<lb/>
“sheet” and “signature,” and the importance of distinguishing integral<lb/>
from inserted advertisements. And the information is sound, as when he<lb/>
emphatically states that collations are necessary for modern books. He<lb/>
even brings up press figures, clearly summarizing the current knowledge<lb/>
of them and then adding, “The bibliographers have not made much out<lb/>
of them yet. But they will.” The only place I have found in the first edition<lb/>
where Carter slips up seriously is when he says that valuing dust-jackets<lb/>
is “a matter of taste,” noting that Morris L. Parrish, “one of the greatest<lb/>
sticklers who ever lived,” threw them away; he should simply have said<lb/>
that Parrish was wrong. (The reference to Parrish was deleted twenty<lb/>
years later, in the fifth edition.)<lb/>
</p>
<p>Another distinguishing characteristic of the book is that its advice is conveyed in the entertaining prose that was by<lb/>
then well-honed. Commenting on the undiscriminating citation of author<lb/>
bibliographies (at the end of the entry for “Bibliography”), Carter says,<lb/>
<q>The judicious collector soon learns that verdicts are not infallible just because they<lb/>
are in print; that the cry of “Not in Prism” should excite him only if Prism’s book<lb/>
both claims to be comprehensive and has some reputation for accuracy; but that as<lb/>
long as others continue to cherish a variant or issue canonised by however incompetent a bibliographer, so long will booksellers continue to cite even an incompetent<lb/>
bibliography rather than none at all.</q><lb/>
</p>
<p>And the long entry on “Rarity” begins this way (with what is probably the<lb/>
most quoted passage in the book):<lb/>
<q>Rarity is the salt in book-collecting. But if you take too much salt, the flavour of the<lb/>
dish is spoiled; and if you take it neat it will make you sick. Similarly, those book-collectors who exalt rarity above any other criterion tend to develop third-degree<lb/>
bibliomania, which is a painful and slightly ridiculous ailment.</q><lb/>
</p>
<p>It is easy to see why this book is such a pleasure to consult. The book<lb/>
world is fortunate to have a reliable source of basic information that has<lb/>
been, through its appeal, widely disseminated and influential.<lb/>
</p>
<p>In 1958 Carter brought out a revised edition of Browne’s <hi>Urne Buriall</hi> and the <hi>Garden of Cyrus</hi>, marking the three-hundredth anniversary of its<lb/>
original appearance. As published by <hi rend="bold">Cambridge University Press</hi> in a<lb/>
compact and attractive volume, it gave Carter’s text a much wider circu-<lb/>
lation than it had achieved in the limited edition of 1932, a not inconsid-<lb/>
erable service. And the two-page preface shows the skill and charm that<lb/>
Carter brought to the writing of such pieces. In his praise of Browne’s two<lb/>
</p>
<pb n="22"/>
<p>great essays as “the perfected products of his maturity,” Carter displayed<lb/>
the maturity of his own prose:<lb/>
in <hi>Urne Buriall</hi>, the curious lore, the strange fantasies, the whimsical speculations,<lb/>
the extraordinary conceits, the relish for picturesque legend and equally picturesque<lb/>
reality, the fascination exerted on the author by bizarre historical and mythical fig-<lb/>
ures—all these jewelled elements, like the thousand small pieces of stained glass in<lb/>
a great rose window, are harmonised by Browne’s deeply reflective imagination, and<lb/>
patterned, with the most polished and elaborate artistry, into paragraph after para-<lb/>
graph of baroque magnificence.</p>
<p>Carter was able to emend Browne’s text with a few further authorial<lb/>
corrections, drawn from six additional author-corrected copies that had<lb/>
become known since 1932 (bringing the total to twelve), as well as several<lb/>
other justifiable emendations.</p>
<p>Otherwise, however, this edition is less desirable in three ways. First,<lb/>
Browne’s marginal references are omitted. Second, Carter reports that<lb/>
“a quarter of a century’s reflection has convinced me of the over-severity<lb/>
of my earlier reaction” against the modernizing of previous editors, and<lb/>
he therefore modernizes spelling and punctuation in a few places—in<lb/>
only a very few, fortunately, or so it seems (though one cannot be sure<lb/>
without a full collation, since these changes are not listed). Third, the<lb/>
short list of “Emendations in the Present Text” records only the emendations to his 1932 text (except, that is, for the occasional modernizing of<lb/>
accidentals), and thus one does not have a complete list of emendations<lb/>
to the first edition, such as the one in his 1932 edition—“which,” he says,<lb/>
“was too elaborate to repeat in a reading edition and to which readers<lb/>
concerned with such things are referred.” But that earlier edition can be<lb/>
consulted only in rare-book rooms. And in any case, the idea of a “reading edition”—“for the general reader, not for the antiquarian or for the<lb/>
specialist”—is suspect. Ordinary readers are often interested in textual<lb/>
alterations; and when they are not, the presence of the information does<lb/>
not deter them from reading. That Carter continued to be concerned with<lb/>
Browne’s text is shown by his “working copies” of the two impressions of<lb/>
this edition, in which he marked eleven possible revisions in the first and<lb/>
eight corrections in the second.</p>
<p>Carter’s other publications of the 1950s were mostly useful continu-<lb/>
ations of his long-standing enthusiasms: handlists of A. E. Housman,<lb/>
Stanley Morison, and William Johnson Cory (plus an edition of Cory),<lb/>
showing how valuable the handlist genre can be; and essays on book col-<lb/>
lecting, Wise, and publishers’ bindings, some of them in the new journal<lb/>
<hi>The Book Collector</hi>. He also continued to produce reviews steadily and to<lb/>
write occasional biographical accounts and obituaries, primarily (but not<lb/>
exclusively) of book-world figures. Two obituaries from The Times in this
<pb n="23"/>
period display his prose in response to two contrasting personalities. Of Belle da Costa Greene, Morgan’s librarian, he wrote (19 May 1950):<lb/>
The elder J. Pierpont Morgan was a formidable and autocratic grandee, and not, one may suppose, an easy master. His librarian steadily enhanced his original confi-<lb/>
dence in her without sacrificing one jot of her own imperious temper, so that in her later years the posture of the autocrat came perhaps the more naturally to her. She was always direct, she was no respecter of persons, she could on occasion be high-<lb/>
handed; but in a world where dust settles as easily on persons as on things these are refreshing tactics.<lb/>
In his portrait of Wilmarth Lewis’s wife, he said (14 May 1959):<lb/>
She was Annie Burr Auchincloss; and the stamp of that aristocratic lineage was as plainly visible in her handsome presence as it was subtly perceptible beneath the charm and friendliness of manner which endeared her not merely to her own wide acquaintance but to hundreds of scholars, students and connoisseurs whom her hus-<lb/>
band’s dedicated passion for Strawberry Hill and its master continually drew into the Farmington orbit.<lb/>
These examples of Carter’s effectiveness in this genre can be duplicated from all parts of his career. The bookseller A. W. Evans, for example, “would dominate you by a combination of personal charm and an easy, urbane scholarship which endowed the transaction with an atmosphere of mutual privilege” (19 April 1943). And who besides Carter would have said that the death of the collector Louis H. Silver extinguished “a fire before which his many friends delighted to warm their hands” (5 Novem-<lb/>
ber 1963), or that there was an “ironically sad splendour” in the timing of the choreographer Andrée Howard’s death (20 April 1968)? (His writing about Howard reflects his love of ballet; his use of “sad splendour” may echo the title of Sadleir’s novel <hi>Desolate Splendour</hi>.)<lb/>
Two publications of 1956-57 serve to mark these years (when he was beginning work at Sotheby’s) as a turning point: one consolidated what had gone before, and the other looked forward. The first was a gathering of his essays called <hi>Books and Book-Collectors</hi> (1956), consisting of eighteen pieces written between 1934 and 1955 and including treatments of Wise, detective fiction, the study of nineteenth-century books, and collecting his-<lb/>
tory, along with eight biographical sketches and his amusing review of his own <hi>ABC</hi>. It is an appealing selection, which served to introduce new read-<lb/>
ers to his prose. And it preserved in book form essays that are otherwise not very accessible. (There are many more that deserve to be collected.) The other publication—the one that looked forward to his new life—was Sotheby’s 213th Season, 1956-1957, a pictorial review of the season in pamphlet form, with an introduction by him. Carter initiated the idea of an annual review (which he edited for the first few years) in this modest fashion, and it evolved into the series of elaborate volumes called <hi>Art at Auction</hi>.
</p>
<pb n="24"/>
<head>The 1960s and 1970s</head>
<p>From the time he began at Sotheby’s in 1955, Carter was occupied<lb/>
with devising ways to bring American auction business to London, a task<lb/>
he was ideally suited for and very successful at accomplishing; and after<lb/>
1960, when Sotheby’s decided to open a full-time New York office with<lb/>
Peregrine Pollen as head, he was also helping to get that office established.<lb/>
His efforts to publicize Sotheby’s were coincidentally assisted by the three<lb/>
American lecture tours he was asked to make for the English Speaking<lb/>
Union in 1961-63. Another instance of his supporting the sale of art during<lb/>
this period (though without any mention of Sotheby’s) was a letter<lb/>
he wrote to The Times from New York (published 21 March 1962), which<lb/>
serves as a good illustration of his epistolary style:</p>
<div type="letter">
  <head>Everyone’s Business</head>
  <p>Sir,— To an Englishman at this distance the attitudes of Parliament, press, and<lb/>
  public towards the Royal Academy seem (with the honourable exception of The<lb/>
  Times) oddly governessy.<lb/>
  </p>
  <p>The Academy, surely, is a society of gentlemen accountable, like any other club,<lb/>
  to its membership and to the law of the land: but how to anyone else? It owns certain<lb/>
  property; it has certain liabilities. Like many other clubs, it is a victim of the economic<lb/>
  arithmetic of the 1960s. Some clubs raise the subscription: others charge more for<lb/>
  whisky: others again let in cads. The Academy decides to sell a picture.<lb/>
  </p>
  <p>Would even a member of Parliament, let alone any busybody who can spell<lb/>
  Leonardo, presume to interfere publicly in the private affairs of the Athenaeum or<lb/>
  White’s, of the Beefsteak or the Garrick? And if they did, would you, Sir, print their<lb/>
  letters? I take leave to doubt it, while remaining<lb/>
  </p>
  <p>Your obedient servant,<lb/>
  </p>
  <p>John Carter<lb/>
  </p>
  <p>New York (Grolier Club)<lb/>
  </p>
</div>
<p>Below his name, he gave his New York address as the Grolier Club, characteristically linking his location with the content of the letter (a practice<lb/>
that goes back to a 1930 letter in <hi>Bookmart</hi> about defining “first edition,”<lb/>
where he used the First Edition Club as his address).</p>
<p>But all the travel and negotiations of these years (which he called<lb/>
“hectic” in a 1971 recollection) did not prevent his devoting a great deal<lb/>
of time and energy (in the early and middle 1960s) to the project that led<lb/>
to <hi>Printing and the Mind of Man</hi> (a title for which he was responsible). Carter<lb/>
played a major role, first as an active member of the Supervisory Committee for a historical display (of which Stanley Morison was the “inspirer<lb/>
and foster-father,” as Carter put it) to be held in conjunction with the July<lb/>
1963 International Printing Machinery and Allied Trades Exhibition, and<lb/>
then as co-editor (with Percy Muir) of an expanded catalogue of books<lb/>
that were selected to show the impact of printing on intellectual history.</p>
<p><pb n="25"/>The majestic volume that appeared in 1967 was designed by John <lb/>
Dreyfus (with title-page lettering engraved by Reynolds Stone) and printed <lb/>
at Cambridge University Press for publication by Cassell. The writing was <lb/>
equal to the design, with substantial commentaries produced by (in ad-<lb/>
dition to Carter and Muir) Nicolas Barker, H. A. Feisenberger, Howard <lb/>
Nixon, and S. H. Steinberg. Carter’s hand is evident throughout, though <lb/>
he was the sole author of only a few entries. (The entries are unsigned, <lb/>
but Muir indicated the authorship in a set of proofs, now at Cambridge <lb/>
University Library.) Carter wrote the commentaries on Maimonides, <lb/>
Shakespeare, Lewis Carroll, and Churchill and was the co-author (with <lb/>
Muir) of four others. The Churchill item (his speech of 20 August 1940) <lb/>
is the last of the 424 entries in the book. It is not surprising that Carter <lb/>
wrote this entry, given his admiration for Churchill (as shown by his <lb/>
1941 account of meeting him, mentioned above). In the entry, having cited the <lb/>
Gettysburg Address, he says, “Lincoln and Churchill were far more than <lb/>
a century apart in temperament, but they shared a genius for language.” <lb/>
He ends his commentary by noting that Churchill had “an eloquence that <lb/>
matched the hour.”<lb/>
</p>
<p>The volume can be seen as an elaborate presentation of one of Carter’s <lb/>
“new paths”—not one taken up in <hi>New Paths</hi> but one that he and Randall <lb/>
had promoted at Scribner’s, as reflected in Carter’s 1938 catalogue on <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Science and Thought in the Nineteenth Century</hi>. But new paths can evolve into <lb/>
established paths, and <hi>Printing and the Mind of Man</hi> became a signpost for <lb/>
collectors, with “<hi rend="italic">PMM</hi>” being cited in dealers’ descriptions, and it thus <lb/>
turned into the kind of list that Carter always advised collectors not to <lb/>
follow. And, like any selection, its choices were subjective, reflecting in <lb/>
this case an English-language bias. How comprehensive it is as a record <lb/>
of the writings that in printed form have affected Western civilization can <lb/>
be debated. But it remains a readable and well-informed guide to some of <lb/>
the monuments (many of them undebatable) of intellectual history.<lb/>
</p>
<p>Aside from <hi>Printing and the Mind of Man</hi>, Carter’s principal publica-<lb/>
tions of the 1960s came at the beginning and end of the decade. First, <lb/>
in 1961, was a useful edition (with a graceful and informative preface) of <lb/>
<hi>Housman’s Selected Prose</hi>, which made more widely available some pas-<lb/>
sages from Housman’s celebrated prefaces to his Latin editions, as well <lb/>
as some of his other writings on textual criticism. (One may object to the <lb/>
way the prefaces were cut and also to two of Carter’s editorial practices: <lb/>
after reporting Housman’s concern for accuracy, he says that “minor vari-<lb/>
ations of typographical details [unspecified] have been accommodated <lb/>
to the style in current use at Cambridge”; and he also inserts six com-<lb/>
mas without noting precisely where these “temerities” occur.) Then in <lb/>
1968-70 a series of four “Working Papers” for a revised edition of the <lb/>
<hi>Enquiry</hi> were published as pamphlets in limited editions to be distributed<lb/>
</p>
<pb n="26"/>  
<p>by Blackwell’s. (The revision of the Enquiry that Carter and Pollard had<lb/>
worked on sporadically for decades never appeared; but in 1983 Nicolas<lb/>
Barker and John Collins brought out a supplementary volume, <hi>A Sequel to “An Enquiry into the Nature of Certain Nineteenth Century Pamphlets”: The Forgeries of H. Buxton Forman and T. J. Wise Re-Examined</hi>, bringing together<lb/>
all the Wiseian research that had accumulated.) One product of Carter’s<lb/>
New York life in the middle of the decade was a series of six charming<lb/>
pamphlets called <hi rend="italic">Halcyon Booklets</hi>, financed by Mary Jean Kempner<lb/>
Thorne and published (with Carter as editor) between 1964 and 1966 un-<lb/>
der the imprint of the Halcyon-Commonwealth Foundation, which had<lb/>
been set up chiefly for this purpose. The series gave Carter an outlet for<lb/>
reprinting some favorite essays, such as Churchill’s “Iron Curtain” speech<lb/>
and William Johnson Cory’s “On the Education of the Reasoning Facul-<lb/>
t ies,” a touchstone for Carter throughout his life.<lb/>
His other publications during these years (aside from reviews) con-<lb/>
sisted mainly of essays in exhibition catalogues on Wise and Housman<lb/>
and pieces for the <hi>Antiquarian Bookman</hi> and <hi>The Book Collector</hi>. A reminisc-<lb/>
ent note, not surprisingly (and indeed appropriately), entered into some<lb/>
of these writings, such as those on collecting Catullus, detective fiction,<lb/>
and Housman. Two others should be noted. For the 1970–71 volume of <hi>Art at Auction</hi>, he wrote an essay on the early history of Sotheby’s in New York<lb/>
that he subtitled “Some Egotistical Reminiscences”: it is of absorbing in-<lb/>
terest for the study of bookselling history and of Carter’s biography. And<lb/>
when the Private Libraries Association in 1970 handsomely reprinted his<lb/>
<hi>Taste and Technique in Book-Collecting</hi>, he added as an “Epilogue” his presi-<lb/>
dential address to the Bibliographical Society, delivered on 18 November<lb/>
1969 and entitled “Taste and Technique in Book Collecting, 1928–1968.”<lb/>
These dates are significant, for they cover more than the twenty years<lb/>
since his book was first published and go back another twenty years to<lb/>
the beginning of his career. He is thus reflecting on his whole professional<lb/>
life, describing such changes (in which he played a part) as the growth<lb/>
of institutional collecting and of an interest in authors’ archives and the<lb/>
monuments of science and intellectual history. The essay is of a piece<lb/>
with the 1948 book in its prose style and its multiplicity of examples, but<lb/>
it is far more personal—as in the delightful five-page tour of the great<lb/>
assemblage of illustrious antiquarian bookshops in London during his<lb/>
time, with his incisive impressions of their proprietors. Although the piece<lb/>
ends uncertainly, with some apprehension as to how collectors will react<lb/>
to the new investigative techniques affecting author bibliographies, the<lb/>
preceding four pages show that Carter, as usual, had kept abreast of de-<lb/>
velopments in analytical bibliography. It does not seem unexpected that<lb/>
he would give this climactic position, in an essay on book collecting, to<lb/>
bibliographical scholarship.</p>
<pb n="27"/>
<p>In the spring of 1970 Carter completed his term as president of the<lb/>
Bibliographical Society; and from the autumn onward, his life was dominated<lb/>
by health problems, including some small strokes. He died on 18<lb/>
March 1975, two months short of his seventieth birthday. During his last<lb/>
year he was awarded the Bibliographical Society’s Gold Medal, and two<lb/>
of his publications were tributes to Percy Muir and Graham Pollard, two<lb/>
friends with whom he had been closely associated since the late 1920s. I<lb/>
am glad that Lord Redcliffe-Maud, in his unpublished oration for Carter’s<lb/>
funeral at Eton on 5 May 1975, referred to Carter’s “unpatronising kindness<lb/>
to people younger (or less learned) than himself.” And it was equally<lb/>
important to mention his “extraordinary success in setting himself rigorous,<lb/>
incorruptible professional standards without ever losing his amateur<lb/>
status.” These, along with personal loyalty, were prominent among his<lb/>
defining characteristics.</p>
<p>There are many reasons to remember John Carter. The first one I<lb/>
want to mention is his prose style—not that it is more important than his<lb/>
bibliographical contributions, but because it is basic to the role he played<lb/>
in bibliographical history as a communicator to a wide audience. And he<lb/>
does deserve attention as a writer. His prose, stylish and witty, is a joy to<lb/>
read, and once people start reading, they want to read more. That is why<lb/>
the <hi>ABC</hi> has sold so well: it is not simply consulted as a reference book but<lb/>
read all the way through, since one entry leads a person on to the next.<lb/>
Even people not particularly interested in the book world, when they are<lb/>
exposed to an essay of his, want to find another one. And in the process,<lb/>
of course, they learn something about books. Which brings us to his role<lb/>
as an educator. The impulse for a good deal of his writing, I think, was to<lb/>
educate—both the general public and his book-world colleagues, to<lb/>
set them on a sensible course of thinking about books as physical objects.<lb/>
(Sadleir, reviewing the <hi>The Spectator</hi>, referred to Carter’s “qualities as an educator.”) That motive underlies not only the <hi>ABC</hi>, <hi>Binding Variants</hi>, <hi>Taste and Technique</hi>, and <hi>Printing and the Mind of Man</hi> but also the<lb/>
running commentary formed by his extensive journalism.</p>
<p>Furthermore, he had the knowledge to be a generally reliable guide.<lb/>
He not only had the practical experience of examining thousands of books<lb/>
as a bookseller and a collector; he also had a thorough acquaintance with<lb/>
the history of his field and the literature of bibliographical scholarship,<lb/>
gained through reviewing many hundreds of books about books (it is hard<lb/>
to imagine that anyone has ever reviewed more of them). Occasionally,<lb/>
however, he faltered. His editions of Browne (the second one), Catullus,<lb/>
and Housman showed that he had not thought as carefully about textual<lb/>
criticism as he had about bibliophily and bibliography. Even in those<lb/>
areas, there were some minor missteps when he commented on original</p>
<pb n="28"/>
<p>condition, the collation formula, and dust-jackets. But normally his judg-<lb/>
ments stand up well, as do his own bibliographical investigations. The<lb/>
study of nineteenth-century books has of course moved on from where<lb/>
he left it; but his <hi>Binding Variants</hi>, <hi>More Binding Variants</hi>, <hi>Publisher’s Cloth</hi>,<lb/>
and the <hi>Enquiry</hi> were pioneer efforts, demonstrating ways of focusing on<lb/>
physical evidence in nineteenth-century books. And his own principal<lb/>
collections remain intact, available to support further research: publish-<lb/>
ers’ bindings at the Bodleian, detective fiction and Housman at the Lilly,<lb/>
Catullus at Texas, and Cory at Eton.<lb/>
</p>
<p>John Carter’s name was known to everyone in the English-speaking<lb/>
antiquarian-book world of the middle decades of the twentieth century.<lb/>
His presence was felt through his influential conversations and consulta-<lb/>
tions with collectors and dealers, librarians and scholars; his involvement<lb/>
with notable catalogues, important auctions, and celebrated transactions;<lb/>
his place on the boards of organizations and journals; his continuous<lb/>
reporting of bibliographical events and issues; his prolific reviewing of<lb/>
books, periodicals, and exhibitions; his lecturing to both scholarly and<lb/>
general audiences; and his authorship and editorship of innovative and<lb/>
fundamental publications. By means of these activities, he promoted in-<lb/>
ternational unity in the antiquarian-book world and publicized the inte-<lb/>
gral role of bibliographical scholarship in bookselling and book collecting.<lb/>
To have been the book-world voice for two generations, leaving a trail<lb/>
of informed and civilized commentary along with several classic works in<lb/>
admirable prose, is a considerable legacy.<lb/>
</p>
<div type="chapter">
<pb n="29"/>
<p>This handlist of John Carter’s published writings is divided into five sections:<lb/>
(A) Books and Pamphlets. (B) Books and Pamphlets Edited. (C) Contributions to<lb/>
Books and Pamphlets. (D) Contributions to Periodicals, except the Times Literary<lb/>
Supplement. (E) Contributions to the Times Literary Supplement. In sections D and E,<lb/>
a letter preceding each entry indicates whether it is an article (A), an editorial (E),<lb/>
a letter to an editor (L), a note or query (N), an obituary (O), or a book or journal<lb/>
review (R). (Articles and notes can be long or short, and the distinction between<lb/>
them can sometimes be subjective.) Offprints of articles, often made available<lb/>
with printed wrappers (and sometimes with changed pagination), are not normally noted; but a few inscribed by Carter are cited. Cross-references consist of<lb/>
a section letter followed by a year (and sometimes, for ease of reference, a month<lb/>
also). All items are signed “John Carter” except where otherwise indicated.<lb/>
</p>
<p>Seven categories of material offer special problems, and my comments on<lb/>
them here are meant to supplement the entries for them in the handlist below:<lb/>
</p>
<p>(1) Letters to Editors, 1927-75. Letters to editors formed an important genre<lb/>
of writing for Carter, and he was a prolific writer of them. They appeared in a<lb/>
wide range of journals, and I am well aware that there have to be a large number<lb/>
that I have missed, especially in some of the book-trade weeklies and some of the<lb/>
non-book-world periodicals. But many are here, offering a good sample of his<lb/>
epistolary style, providing a considerable amount of biographical information,<lb/>
and displaying the personality that the letters projected. For Carter’s many letters<lb/>
to the Times Literary Supplement, see the discussion in section E below.<lb/>
</p>
<p>(2) Scribner Catalogues, 1927-53. Carter was employed by Charles Scribner’s<lb/>
Sons in September 1927 as the London representative for the Scribner Book<lb/>
Store in New York, with the responsibility for acquiring British and European<lb/>
continental books to be sold in the store’s Rare Book Department. The head of<lb/>
that department when Carter was hired was John C. Champion, who was succeeded in March 1935 by David A. Randall, with whom Carter worked until<lb/>
Scribner’s London office was closed in 1953. Thus any of the approximately fifty<lb/>
catalogues issued by the Rare Book Department between 1927 and 1953 (or the<lb/>
nearly two dozen Rare Book Bulletins starting in 1939) could include entries<lb/>
written by Carter, especially for books that he had supplied. Beginning with his<lb/>
second trip to New York in early 1932, he worked closely with Champion and<lb/>
was responsible for a changed direction in the catalogues, now featuring books<lb/>
that reflected new approaches to collecting (an interest that resulted in 1934 in<lb/>
his anthology <hi>New Paths in Book Collecting</hi>). The first of these was <hi>First Editions of<lb/>
Famous Adventure Stories, 1831-1922</hi> (catalogue 92, November 1932), and another<lb/>
was <hi>Detective Fiction</hi> (catalogue 98, 1934); Carter wrote introductions to both. After Randall’s arrival, the collaboration was even closer, and still more innovative<lb/>
topics appeared. According to Randall’s autobiography, <hi>Dukedom Large Enough</hi><lb/>
(1969), Carter was responsible for catalogues dealing with the <hi>Modern Library</hi>,<lb/>
“<hi>science and thought</hi>,” and classical music (though of course he would have<lb/>
contributed to many others). There is sufficient evidence for including entries<lb/>
for sixteen Scribner catalogues and one Rare Book Bulletin in section B below,<lb/>
</p>

<pb n="30"/>
<p>(3) Double Crown Club Menus, 1933–36. A blanket entry for the delightful<lb/>
menus of this dining club of typophiles (of which Carter was president in 1946)<lb/>
is included in section B because Carter (elected to the Club in 1932) was secretary<lb/>
from 1933 to 1936 and can therefore be thought of as the editor of the menus<lb/>
during those years, each of which was designed by a different person (often a<lb/>
prominent book designer or artist). He designed two himself, numbers 38 (May<lb/>
1933) and 55 (April 1936); and he was the subject of a third, number 65 (February<lb/>
1938), which was for the meeting at which he spoke on “<hi>Cheap Reprints</hi>” (a talk<lb/>
printed in <hi>Typography</hi> for Winter 1938). Forty-eight of the menus from Carter’s<lb/>
own collection (ranging from 1924, when the Club began, to 1970, and including<lb/>
the two he designed) were listed in <hi>Potter Books</hi> catalogue 7 (May 1977). Carter<lb/>
was also one of the speakers who participated in the discussion of Stanley Mori<lb/>
son at the November 1967 dinner, which resulted in a separate publication (see<lb/>
C:1968). A biographical entry for Carter is included in <hi>The Double Crown Club:</hi><lb/>
Register of Past and Present Members (1949); and James Moran’s <hi>The Double Crown<lb/>
Club: A History of Fifty Years</hi> (1974) quotes from Carter’s witty reports on the meet<lb/>
ings and is entered in section C.<lb/>

(4) Pseudonymous and Unsigned Contributions to Bibliographical Notes & Que<lb/>
ries, 1935–39. This journal resulted from conversations among the members of<lb/>
Michael Sadleir’s informal dining group (the “<hi>Biblio Boys</hi>”), who recognized the<lb/>
desirability of greater communication in the rare-book world. P. H. Muir (of El<lb/>
kin Mathews Ltd.) was its editor from the start, in January 1935, with David A.<lb/>
Randall (of Scribner’s) joining him as “American editor” in October. Although<lb/>
members of the group did their best to support the journal through numerous<lb/>
contributions, many under pseudonyms, there was insufficient material for it to<lb/>
continue after May 1939. (At that point fifteen issues—four for 1935 designated<lb/>
as volume 1 and eleven, numbered as twelve, for 1936–39 as volume 2—had<lb/>
been published, totaling 151 pages and containing 330 queries, with replies to<lb/>
many of them; Cordex “self-binding” cases, with gilt-lettered spines, for shelving<lb/>
each of the two volumes were also available.) Carter contributed 39 items using<lb/>
his own name, and some of his comments were substantial: for example, his notes<lb/>
on Thomas Gray’s <hi>Odes</hi> (in May 1936 and April and November 1938) amount<lb/>
to more than 2500 words, and those on Florence Nightingale’s <hi>Notes</hi> (October<lb/>
1935), a 1684 edition of <hi>Catullus</hi> (May 1936), and Melville’s <hi>Typee</hi> (February<lb/>
1937) are at least 750 words each. And the only two articles that appeared in the<lb/>
journal, written to fill out the last two pages of the last two issues, were his. He<lb/>
<pb n="31"/>
also contributed under several pseudonyms. <lb/>
In his own bound set of the fifteen issues (now in my collection), Carter wrote, “Among the pen names adopted by J.W.C. are Richard Gullible, Harriet Marlow, E. Schlengemann, George Waynflete, Milton A. Hellman.” <lb/>
He also identified “Harriet Marlow,” a name taken from Beckford’s fiction, as his in <hi>Publishers’ Weekly</hi> 140 (1941 [9 August]): 381. <lb/>
“E. Schlengemann” was the person from whom the British Museum bought its first copies of the forgeries (see the <hi>Enquiry</hi>, p. 145). <lb/>
It is surprising that “Richard Gullible” is in this list because that name was used by Richard Jennings in 1934 for his series of six parodies (sent to Carter and Graham Pollard as letters) that came to be known as the “Gullible Papers”; Carter arranged for the printing of those leaflets, and his account is in the <hi>The Book Collector</hi> 8 (1959): 182–83 (see also lot 44 in the Sotheby catalogue of the Carter sale, 24 March 1976). <lb/>
But his listing of the name here means that the two items signed with this name in <hi>BN&amp;Q</hi> can be assigned to him. <lb/>
Since he says that these five names were “among” the ones he used, there were certainly others. Percy Muir, in a letter to me on 5 April 1978, said that “all the Carter aliases” in the journal were “Harriet Marlow,” “E. Schlengemann,” and “Holmlock Shears”; but he then named two more as “possibles”: “Ignoramus” and “Michael Trevanion.” <lb/>
The latter is well established as a name used by Simon Nowell-Smith and can be ruled out. <lb/>
But if we accept “Holmlock Shears” (used once) and “Ignoramus” (used twice), we have seven names, and I have included items with all seven signatures in section D below (totaling 42 items). <lb/>
It is likely that there are still other pseudonymous contributions by Carter, and some of the unsigned items might be his as well; to cover this possibility, section D also includes a blanket entry for such pieces at 1935–39. <lb/>
(5) British Information Services Pamphlets. <lb/>
From November 1943 through October 1945, Carter was director of the General Division of British Information Services in New York (at 30 Rockefeller Plaza). <lb/>
One of his responsibilities was to oversee the preparation and production of the many BIS publications, including a large series of pamphlets intended for wide public distribution, as he explained in a detailed article about the BIS operation, “Publishing—But for Free,” in <hi>Publishers’ Weekly</hi> on 10 November 1945 (148: 2136–39). <lb/>
Any, or all, of the BIS pamphlets published during this period can be considered to have been edited by him, but his exact (and no doubt varying) involvement in them is not known. <lb/>
One that appeared soon after his arrival (and is mentioned in his 1945 article) is likely to have received particular editorial attention from him, given his admiration for Churchill: <lb/>
<hi>Winston Churchill, Prime Minister: A Selection from Speeches Made by Winston Churchill during the Four Years That Britain Has Been at War</hi> (December 1943). <lb/>
The pamphlets dealt not only with the war but also with British life in general; other titles from these years include <hi>Britain’s Industrial Cities</hi> (1944), <hi>Britain’s Sea Power</hi> (1944), <hi>The British Commonwealth and Empire</hi> (1944), <hi>Fifty Facts about the Middle East</hi> (1944), <hi>Flying Bombs</hi> (1944), <hi>John Britain</hi> (1944), <hi>A Picture of Britain: Background of a People</hi> (1944), <hi>African Achievement</hi> (1945), <hi>Britain’s Future in the Making</hi> (1945), <hi>The British Merchant Navy</hi> (1945), and <hi>Miracle Harbor</hi> (1945). <lb/>
To cover Carter’s editorial work on BIS publications, a blanket entry is included in section B at 1943–45. <lb/>
Only one of the BIS pamphlets, <hi>Victory in Burma</hi> (1945), is known to have been entirely written by Carter, and it is listed in section A. <lb/>

<pb n="32"/>
<p>(6) Unsigned Commentary in <hi>The <lb/>Book Collector</hi>, 1952-75. Carter’s set of <hi>The <lb/>Book Collector</hi> is at the Library of Congress. <lb/>
There are well over a hundred places <lb/>
where Carter made some kind of marginal note (or put a question mark or exclamation point in the margin), often for the purpose of questioning a statement or <lb/>
its wording; and there are about sixty places where he simply put a line or a check <lb/>
mark or an X in the margin. In only fourteen places did he indicate his authorship of unsigned paragraphs in the "Commentary" (or "News and Comment") <lb/>
section by writing his initials or "I drafted this" in the margin. There may be no <lb/>
distinction between these two kinds of annotation; but it is possible that "I drafted <lb/>
this" indicates later revision by someone else (though the result would probably <lb/>
still be primarily his writing). All fourteen are given entries in section D below. <lb/>
It seems very likely that he wrote still other unsigned paragraphs as well, and <lb/>
they are represented by a blanket entry for 1952-75. As for his pseudonymous <lb/>
contributions of notes and queries to <hi>The <lb/>Book Collector</hi>, see the discussion above <lb/>
for <hi>Bibliographical Notes &amp; Queries</hi>, since he continued to use the same pseudonyms <lb/>
in this revival of the function of the old journal.<lb/>
</p>
<p>(7) Sotheby Catalogues, 1955-72. From October 1955, when Carter became an <lb/>
associate in the book department at Sotheby’s, until July 1972, when he retired, <lb/>
he was in a position to write up entries for inclusion in Sotheby auction catalogues, and he occasionally did so. For example, Anthony Hobson told me that <lb/>
Carter gave him a hand in cataloguing Sydney Cockerell’s collection in 1956. <lb/>
And John Kerr and P. J. Croft identified for me several lots that were described <lb/>
by Carter: in the 1 December 1964 sale, lots 526 and 528; 6-7 December 1966, <lb/>
lot 611; 8-9 July 1968, lots 782-827 and 840; and 9-10 December 1968, lots 756-<lb/>
57a. He also catalogued the manuscript of Evelyn Waugh’s <hi>Scoop</hi> for the sale <lb/>
of 7-8 July 1969 and Lear’s <hi>A Book of Nonsense</hi> for the sale of 22 June 1970, and <lb/>
any lot of Housman material was probably catalogued by him. But according <lb/>
to Hobson and Kerr, he did not otherwise write many catalogue entries. I have <lb/>
included a blanket entry in section C for all the Sotheby catalogues from 1955 <lb/>
to 1972, as a way of representing the scattered entries that he wrote over the <lb/>
years. Also entered in section C are a preface, an introduction, and a note of <lb/>
acknowledgment that have been identified as his in the catalogues for the Sadleir <lb/>
(1958), Silver (1965), and Diaghilev (1968) sales. There are two catalogues that <lb/>
have so far been identified as ones that Carter was entirely responsible for: those <lb/>
for the Pariser sale of Wiseiana on 4-5 December 1967 and for the Ewing sale <lb/>
of Victorian fiction on 12-13 October 1970; these catalogues are given entries in <lb/>
section B, as books edited by Carter.<lb/>
</p>
<p>The basis for the attribution of other unsigned or pseudonymous publications, <lb/>
except for those in the <hi>Times Literary Supplement</hi>, is sometimes explained within the <lb/>
entries themselves and otherwise can normally be assumed to be the collections of <lb/>
press cuttings in the Eton and Cambridge University libraries. For the unsigned <lb/>
contributions to the <hi>Times Literary Supplement</hi>, see section E below.<lb/>
</p>
<p>Finally, there are two other matters I must comment on. First is the question <lb/>
whether Carter wrote <hi>The Fall of the Titan</hi> (London: Lincoln Williams, 1934), a <lb/>
novel by "John Waynflete," according to the title page. The authorship of this<lb/>
</p>
<pb n="33"/>
<p>work has often been attributed to John Carter by collectors and library cataloguers because his middle name was Waynflete and because he occasionally<lb/>
used <hi>John Waynflete</hi> as a pseudonym beginning in 1944 (having used <hi>George Waynflete</hi> from 1939 and <hi>Waynflete</hi> from 1940).<lb/>
Neither the content nor the stilted style of this sentimental anti-Labour novel suggests Carter’s authorship; but the idea has been proposed that it might have been written as a parody. The question is fully discussed in the appendix below. Since<lb/>
Carter’s authorship has never been proved or disproved (but seems unlikely), I am mentioning the book here rather than including it in the handlist.<lb/>
Second, during the time (April 1953 to October 1955) when Carter was the personal assistant to Sir Roger Makins, the British ambassador to the United States, he wrote some speeches and articles for Makins. A few of them, in the form of carbon-copy<lb/>
typescripts (annotated by Carter) and in published form (no doubt revised by Makins), are in the Carter collection at Eton.<lb/>
The extent to which Makins’s published articles reflect Carter’s ghostwriting is uncertain, and I have not included any of them in the handlist.<lb/>
I have collected Carter’s publications for many years, and that process has brought numerous items to my attention that I would not otherwise have known<lb/>
about. I have also drawn on the collections of Carter material at Eton College, King’s College Cambridge, the Cambridge University Library, the Bodleian<lb/>
Library, the Library of Congress, the Lilly Library, the Grolier Club, the Harry Ransom Center, and the R. R. Bowker Company. There are many people to<lb/>
whom I owe a debt of gratitude. I wish first to acknowledge the generosity of A. S. G. Edwards, who has repeatedly alerted me to (and even provided copies<lb/>
of) many obscure items over the past forty years. He also read a draft of this essay and handlist, as did Nicolas Barker (who made helpful comments) and Michael<lb/>
Meredith (whose help included checking some material at Eton that I might not have seen on my visit there). In addition, I wish to record my indebtedness to<lb/>
the following individuals (many of them now deceased): Richard Bucci, Ernestine Carter, Sebastian Carter, Meghan Constantinou, P. J. Croft, Arthur Crook, Brooke<lb/>
Crutchley, Scott Ellwood, Basie Bales Gitlin, Harrison Hayford, Richard Colles Johnson, John Kerr, Marie Korey, Richard Landon, Elizabeth Lynch, Charles W. Mann,<lb/>
William Matheson, David McKitterick, Percy Muir, A. N. L. Munby, Paul Needham, Robert Nikirk, Simon Nowell-Smith, Jean Peters, David A. Randall, Ronald R. Randall,<lb/>
William B. Todd, David L. Vander Meulen, James M. Wells, and David Whitesell. For permission to quote from Carter’s unpublished annotations, I am grateful to Michael<lb/>
Meredith, acting on behalf of Eton College Library.<lb/>

dix (pp. 141-46) to Carter’s edition of Browne’s <hi>Urne Buriall</hi> (B:1932). In the<lb/>
copy in my collection (inscribed “ex dono authoris 1933”), Carter changed the printed date “MCMXXXII” to “MCMXXXIII” and (another matter<lb/>
of dating) revised the first line of page [7] by deleting “to be” and “shortly”<lb/>
from the statement that his Browne edition was “to be published shortly.”<lb/>

<hi>An Enquiry into the Nature of Certain Nineteenth Century Pamphlets</hi>. By Carter and Graham Pollard. London: Constable; New York: Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1934.<lb/>
xii,400 pp. Cloth, dust-jacket. Published 2 July 1934. 2000 copies printed,<lb/>
700 of them for America. Copies intended for American distribution have<lb/>
“$6.00” stamped at the top of the front dust-jacket flap. The four-page pro-<lb/>
spectus, which indicates that the book can be ordered for 15s from Birrell<lb/>
&amp; Garnett (where Pollard was a partner), states that the book “introduces<lb/>
scientific methods which have never before been applied to bibliographi-<lb/>
cal problems of this period.” For Carter’s later writings on the Wise-Forman<lb/>
forgeries (some of them in collaboration with Graham Pollard), see especially<lb/>

The front flap of the dust-jacket on<lb/>some copies (presumably review copies) is extra wide and has six lines of<lb/>publication information printed vertically at the right edge. This subedition<lb/>includes as an epilogue Carter and Pollard’s “Aftermath of An Enquiry” (pp. 19-<lb/>41), plus notes on the 1934 text by Barker and Collins.

<hi>Victory in Burma</hi>. New York: British Information Services, July 1945. 32 pp. Pictorial wrappers. Printed by Alco Gravure (Hoboken, N.J.). Unsigned. In the<lb/>
Eton copy, Carter wrote: “The facts and figures came of course from the<lb/>
Information Division of BIS; but this booklet was written single-handed during three or four days’ solitary confinement in our apartment in New York.<lb/>
I also selected the photographs, which I still think first-rate.” For Carter’s<lb/>
account of the publication program of British Information Services in New<lb/>
York (where he was in charge of publications from November 1943 through<lb/>
October 1945), see his <hi>Publishing—But for Free</hi> (D:1945, November). In<lb/>
that article he refers to Victory in Burma as one of the “popular pamphlets”<lb/>
dealing with the war but does not reveal his authorship of it. Given the huge<lb/>
numbers of these pamphlets that were printed, Victory in Burma must have<lb/>
been the most widely circulated of all Carter’s writings, with the possible<lb/>
exception of his <hi>ABC for Book-Collectors</hi> (A:1952). For further comment on<lb/>
his work for British Information Services, see the headnote to the handlist,<lb/>

delivered on 17 and 24 November and 1 December 1947, with “some substitution of transatlantic titles among the books cited as examples” (as Carter<lb/>
noted in the 1970 reprint). Dedicated to his wife. The four-page prospectus,<lb/>
<pb n="37"/>
<div type="chapter">
<p>
indicating that the book could be ordered from Bowker for $5, notes that Carter’s work “is always eagerly awaited by fellow bookmen on both sides of the Atlantic.”<lb/>
According to Bowker records, 2000 copies were published on 26 July 1948.<lb/>
An advance extract from the last chapter (“Condition”) had been published in <hi>Publishers’ Weekly</hi> (also published by Bowker) on 22 November 1947 (D:1947).<lb/>
On 8 June 1948 Carter wrote to Sol Malkin (editor of <hi>Antiquarian Bookman</hi>), asking him to include, in the issue closest to the book’s publication date, a notice (in the “Sack Cloth and Ashes Department”) of an error in his discussion of a variant in <hi>Boswell’s Johnson</hi> (this letter is cited in Richard Cady catalogue 21 [1985], item 23).<lb/>
Then in early 1949, Carter arranged for an erratum slip to be printed, correcting this error: on page 98 he had said that the “gve/give” variant in <hi>Boswell’s Johnson</hi> is one of two examples of points that are “neither interesting nor significant”; the erratum slip notes that “the priority of the gve reading was long ago established by Prof. Pottle” in his bibliography of Boswell.<lb/>
A proof of this erratum slip, dated 1 February 1949, is in the Bowker files; a copy of the final slip, signed “J.C.” in print, is taped into the Rosenwald copy in the Library of Congress.<lb/>
By 7 November 1955, there were still 133 copies of the book unsold, and these were given to Carter.<lb/>
English (<hi>Cambridge University Press</hi>) edition: Cambridge: <hi>Cambridge University Press</hi>, 1948. xi,201 pp. Cloth, dust-jacket. Price 15s. 1500 copies printed (according to a publisher’s dummy in the collection of Richard Landon).<lb/>
The Cambridge edition (a new typesetting) was published three months after the American edition, on 29 October 1948, according to a review copy in my collection.<lb/>
And the copy (also in my collection) that Carter gave to his friend Brooke Crutchley, the University printer, has an inscription (“for the printer from a completely satisfied author”) dated 26 October 1948.<lb/>
(The American preface is dated 1 December 1947, and the English preface is dated 21 July 1948, only five days before the American publication date.)<lb/>
Since the error that necessitated the erratum slip in the American edition had come to Carter’s attention by early June (see above), he was able to make a change during production of the Cambridge edition.<lb/>
A set of the Cambridge proofs in my collection, dated 5–6 May 1948 (with the title-page date of “194”, before the fourth digit was known), has the same erroneous text on p. 103 that the American edition has on p. 98.<lb/>
But the Cambridge edition as published in October has a revised text, with the passage altered in two ways.<lb/>
First, the cancels in Shelley and Conrad, which in the earlier text “produced a genuine distinction of issue,” now “make a proper bibliographical ‘point.’”<lb/>
Second, the Boswell example is attached to this sentence (“as does the misprint ‘gve’ for ‘give’ on p. 135, vol. 1 of Boswell”), so that in the next sentence only some transposed lines in <hi>South Wind</hi> (and not the Boswell misprint) are “neither interesting nor significant.”<lb/>
The introduction was reprinted (condensed) from the English edition in <hi>Good Living</hi> (C:1948) and, from the American edition, in William Targ’s <hi>Bouillabaisse for Bibliophiles</hi> (C:1955); chapter 10 was reprinted (condensed) from the American edition as “Bookseller and Auctioneer” in <hi>The Atlantic Monthly</hi> (D:1948, July) and, from the English edition, as “Bookshop and Auction Room” in <hi>The Bookseller</hi> (D:1948, December); and chapter<lb/>

<pb n="38"/> <lb/>
11 was reprinted (condensed) from the American edition as <hi>Reflections on <lb/>
Rarity</hi> in <hi>The New Colophon</hi> (D:1948, April). The tenth paragraph of chapter <lb/>
10 was quoted on the front cover of <hi>AB Bookman’s Weekly</hi> for 20-27 September 1976 (58: 1545). Second impression, with corrections: 1949. The <lb/>
correction to page 103 made in the first Cambridge impression evidently did <lb/>
not seem adequate to Carter, for in the second impression he deleted the <lb/>
Boswell reference entirely (shortening the page by one line, accommodated <lb/>
by a larger space in the mid-page section division).<lb/>
Private Libraries Association subedition, with an epilogue:<lb/>
London: Private Libraries Association, 1970. xiv,242 pp. Cloth, dust-jacket.<lb/>
Additional dedication to S. C. Roberts and Frederic G. Melcher. The text is<lb/>
that of the corrected English impression, with a <hi>Prefatory Note 1970</hi> (pp.<lb/>
xiii-xiv) and three pages (pp. 203-05) of <hi>Corrections & Notes (1969)</hi> added.<lb/>
The epilogue, <hi>Taste and Technique in Book Collecting, 1928-1968</hi> (pp.<lb/>
209-42) was Carter’s presidential address to the Bibliographical Society on<lb/>

The Firm of Charles Ottley, Landon &amp; Co.: Footnote to An Enquiry. By Carter “with<lb/>

as a paper to the Bibliographical Society [in November],” as stated in a<lb/>
“Prefatory Note” dated 25 October 1948. Dedicated to “S.M.” and “M.S.”<lb/>
(Stanley Morison and Michael Sadleir). In an inscribed copy (listed in Ulysses<lb/>
Bookshop catalogue 13 [1992], item 104), Carter wrote below the eight-line<lb/>
Latin dedication, “The only work in Latin of John Carter.” (But he also wrote<lb/>
a Latin dedication for his Morison handlist, A:1950.) Reissue with a leaflet of<lb/>
“Corrections and Additions” laid in: 1967 (leaflet date). [4],95 pp. See A:1967.<lb/>

A Handlist of the Writings of Stanley Morison. With notes by Morison and indexes<lb/>
by Graham Pollard. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press for private distribution,<lb/>
1950. ix,46 pp. Paper-covered boards, dust-jacket. Limited to 500<lb/>
copies. A tribute to Morison on his sixtieth birthday (6 May 1949). Laid into<lb/>
some copies is Morison’s eight-page Prolegomena ad Curriculum Vitae (Cambridge, 1949). Carter’s copy, with his bookplate, at the Library of Congress<lb/>
provides additional information. At the foot of the front free endpaper he<lb/>
wrote: “First copies bound 7 June for distribution to some of those attending<lb/>
at the Senate House, Cambridge, 8 June, for S.M’s Litt.D.” He also wrote<lb/>
on this endpaper: “There are two states of the dedication leaf: this is the<lb/>
second.” The dedication in this copy reads “EDVARDO / DIANAE FILIO<lb/>
/ VIATICVM”. On a letter of thanks from Morison to Carter, 15 June 1950<lb/>
(laid in), Carter noted: “a longer and more specific dedication was provided<lb/>
(at the printer’s request) for the majority of copies.” In a fuller account for<lb/>
<hi>The Book Collector</hi> (<hi>Morisonianum</hi>, D:1965, Autumn), Carter gave the text<lb/>
of the longer dedication: “EDVARDO / HVNC PATRINI SVI / SCRIPTORIVM CATALOGVM / A PATRE EXCVSVM / DICAT EDITOR”.<lb/>
He also explained that the shorter dedication was his original and preferred<lb/>
one and that he asked the printer to use it for a few copies after the main<lb/>

<pb n="39"/>
press run had been completed. Thus the second state as printed preserves<lb/>
the earlier version of the text. There is also a printed presentation slip (“with<lb/>
the compliments of the author and printer”) laid in Carter’s copy and an<lb/>
erratum slip stapled to the verso of the dedication leaf: “For MR MORISON, read DR MORISON, passim / (The edition of this erratum is limited<lb/>
to 25 copies)”. Although the book was not intended for public sale, Carter<lb/>
reported in his Book Collector piece that fifty copies in 1958, and twelve more<lb/>
in 1965, were sold to Elkin Mathews for sale to the public. For Carter’s later<lb/>

prospectus, indicating that the book could be ordered from Bertram Rota for<lb/>
15s and providing two specimen pages, contains prose that is characteristic<lb/>
of Carter: for example, the book is said to be “salted with well-distributed<lb/>

Eton copy, there is a carbon typescript of Carter’s letter to Osbert Lancaster<lb/>
on 23 May 1963 (when the booklet was at the printer’s) with this sentence:<lb/>
“Its elegance (but not necessarily its chastity) would be greatly enhanced<lb/>
by a pocket-size portrait of the author’s heroine, preferably holding a martini glass, to accompany the dedication.” The dedication is to the Countess<lb/>
of Littlehampton, one of Lancaster’s characters. Lancaster did provide the<lb/>
drawing.<lb/>

by line 28, as he did by line 4 on page 4, by lines 16–18 on page 8, and by<lb/>
line 9 on page 12, and he put a longer line by lines 13–23 on page 23; he cor-<lb/>

The Mystery of <hi>“The Death of Balder.”</hi> By Carter and Graham Pollard. Working Papers for a Second Edition of <hi>An Enquiry into the Nature of Certain Nineteenth Century Pamphlets</hi> no. 3 (January 1969). Oxford: Distributed for the authors by B. H. Blackwell, 1969. 21 pp. Wrappers. 200 copies for sale at one guinea. (In no. 4 [1970], the printing record states that 300 copies of no. 3 were for sale.) In Carter’s set of “working copies” of the four Working Papers (in my collection), this is the only one not marked “working copy”; it simply has Carter’s signature on the front wrapper. The first of its two annotations is <hi>“Todd dustjacket / 7i”</hi> in the upper right corner of the title page.<lb/>
The reference is to Thomas J. Wise: <hi>Centenary Studies</hi>, edited by William B. Todd (C:1959), the jacket of which is mentioned in the first sentence of this pamphlet. Carter may simply be calling attention to the fact that the jacket copy considers <hi>The Death of Balder</hi> a potential Wise forgery, whereas this Working Paper shows that it was not.<lb/>
The significance of <hi>“7i”</hi> is not clear, but possibly Carter wished to make a change (not necessarily connected with that jacket) in the footnote (numbered 1) on page 7. The only other annotation is on page 11, where he underlined <hi>“three years”</hi> and put a question mark in the margin.<lb/>

pp., with 30 collotype illustrations by Paul Nash (hand-colored by pochoir).<lb/>
Vellum binding inlaid with morocco, designed by Nash. Limited to 215 copies, priced at 15 guineas. Printed at the Curwen Press, overseen by Oliver Simon.<lb/>
The four-page prospectus (including a specimen of page 26) states: <hi>“One copy consisting of two volumes, the first <hi>Urne Buriall</hi> and <hi>The Garden of Cyrus</hi>, the second a portfolio of all Mr. Nash’s original drawings, both specially bound, at 350 guineas.”</hi><lb/>
An indication of Carter’s research for this edition is offered by his copy of Edward H. Marshall’s 1929 Macmillan edition, interleaved with his extensive notes and the results of his collations of earlier editions (described in G. F. Sims catalogue 102 [1979], item 85).<lb/>
There is a set of proofs at the Grolier Club and another in my collection, with material in both cases relating to the preparation of the 1958 revised edition.<lb/>
My set, which is the earlier of the two, is a bound one that Carter gave to John Sparrow (who wrote his name and <hi>“d.d.editor”</hi> on the front free endpaper).<lb/>
On the half-title, Carter noted, <hi>“2nd proof corrected”</hi>, and he wrote <hi>“final proof”</hi> on the divisional title for <hi>“The Garden of Cyrus”</hi>; he entered fourteen marginal revisions on five pages of the introduction and 27 corrections on fifteen pages of <hi>“Urne Buriall.”</hi><lb/>
Laid into the volume is a list of ten <hi>“proposals”</hi> for changes to be made in the text being prepared for the 1958 Cambridge edition—a list that was marked to be sent to Geoffrey Keynes, John Hayward, John Sparrow, and Jeremiah Finch (a Browne scholar at Princeton).<lb/>
The Grolier set (also bound, from Carter’s library) is designated as the final proofs on the spine and incorporates in the printed text all of the changes entered in the margins of my set.<lb/>
It does contain numerous marginal revisions and corrections, but they are for the 1958 edition, and they include all but one of the proposed changes on the list laid into my set.<lb/>
(The one not included consists of three alterations in the passage beginning at line 12 on page 74: <hi>“their”</hi> for <hi>“the”</hi> before <hi>“true”</hi>, <hi>“or”</hi> for <hi>“of”</hi> after <hi>“ours”</hi>, and <hi>“contrive”</hi> or <hi>“contain”</hi> for <hi>“continue.”</hi>)<lb/>
The fortunes of the 1932 edition after publication were partly told in a letter from Desmond Flower (of Cassell’s) to Geoffrey Keynes on 8 February 1965 (the copy sent to Carter is at the Grolier Club).<lb/>
Upon publication, only 29 copies were sold at the original price of fifteen guineas (owing to the Depression), and soon afterward 37 sets of sheets were sold to the Redfern Gallery.<lb/>
In 1941 Cassell’s premises at La Belle Sauvage, an old Ludgate Hill coaching inn, were destroyed by German bombs, and 20-30 bound copies were lost. But some sets of sheets (possibly close to a hundred), having been stored in a subsidiary warehouse, were spared.<lb/>
Many of these were made available to the Folio Society, which was licensed to sell them in a binding with Nash’s original designs.<lb/>
In an advertisement headed <hi>“Treasure Trove”</hi> in the <hi>The Book Handbook</hi> for June 1951 (2.2:x), the Folio Society announced the availability of copies bound by Sangorski & Sutcliffe, in a slip-case, for twenty guineas.<lb/>
</p>
<div><pb n="45"/><p>price had gone up to £36 by 1965, when sets of sheets were still available<lb/>
for binding to order. The “Appendix” (pp. 141-46) was reprinted, with some<lb/>
added introductory paragraphs, as “The Iniquity of Oblivion Foil’d” in <hi>The Colophon</hi> (D:1933, February) and as a separate (A:1933); the last chapter was<lb/>
reprinted as a separate by the Rampant Lions Press (B:1946).<lb/>
Revised edition: Edited by Carter, with a “Preface” (pp. vii-viii) and<lb/>
appendixes (pp. 115-20). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1958.<lb/>
viii,120 pp. Cloth, dust-jacket. 3000 copies. The copy that Carter inscribed<lb/>
to his aunt, Faith Compton Mackenzie (in my collection), is dated 28-29<lb/>
October 1958. In the copy that Carter labeled “working copy” on the dust-jacket and the front free endpaper (in my collection), he listed four page<lb/>
numbers (45, 48, 58, 89) on the front free endpaper and called them “Queries” (not corrections), but his annotations appear on other pages as well.<lb/>
Most of them contain references to <hi>LCM</hi>— that is, L. C. Martin’s 1964<lb/>
edition —but without any implication that the Martin readings should be<lb/>
accepted (and indeed those at 48.4 and 68.30 had already been rejected in<lb/>
his published notes). The <hi>LCM</hi> annotations are as follows: 30.5 “<hi>LCM</hi>”;<lb/>
37.24 “<hi>LCM unlike</hi>” [for “nor like”]; 48.4 “<hi>LCM contriving</hi>” [for “continuing”];<lb/>
48.22-26 “?see <hi>LCM</hi>”; 66.1 “<hi>LCM conjecture contained</hi>” [for “continued”];<lb/>
68.30 “<hi>LCM conjecture containe</hi>” [for “continue”]; 69.6 “<hi>LCM [delete sign]</hi>” [deleting a comma after “divisions”].<lb/>
There are three other annotations relating to Browne’s text. On page 45, Carter marked for possible deletion (with a question mark) the comma after “hope” in line 18, adding the marginal note “(see Lytton Strachey)”—whose analysis of Browne’s<lb/>
style is referred to twice in Carter’s preface. And there are marginal notes<lb/>
on pages 58 (the insertion of “which” before “with” in line 14) and 89<lb/>
(“seases” for “creases” in line 24, with a question mark), both of which are<lb/>
marked out. In “<hi>A Note on the Text</hi>,” he changed “compositor” to “press-corrector” (117.27). Second impression: 1967. 2000 copies. The Grolier<lb/>
Club copy of the 1967 impression, which Carter labeled “working copy” on<lb/>
the dust-jacket, has, on the front free endpaper, the date 8 August 1967 and<lb/>
a list of nine page numbers headed “Correct” along with one page number<lb/>
labeled “Queries.” Two of the page numbers refer to editorial matter, but<lb/>
the other eight point to readings requiring correction in Browne’s text, and<lb/>
all eight had been reported to Carter by Geoffrey Keynes in a letter of 4<lb/>
June 1968 (laid into the Grolier Club copy). That letter was apparently<lb/>
occurred by a letter from Carter following the publication of Keynes’s<lb/>
edition of Browne’s <hi>Selected Writings</hi> (Faber & Faber, 1968), which includes<lb/>
Carter’s texts. Keynes begins, “I could have sworn I did send you a list of<lb/>
errors,” and the list is as follows (erroneous readings first): 33.16 body of ]<lb/>
body of the / 35.21 <hi>Ecclisiastes</hi>] Ecclesiastes / 36.6 <hi>acccount</hi>] account / 77.17<lb/>

In the course of a 1943 article for the <hi>Times Literary Supplement</hi> (E2:1943), Carter revealed that he was the editor. For Carter’s other editions of Housman, see the references at B:1930. Second through thirteenth impressions: October 1940, May 1941, April 1942, November 1942, April 1943, January 1944, March 1945, September 1946, February 1948, July 1949, August 1950, February 1952. At this point, the text came un-<lb/>
<pb n="49"/>der attack by two American scholars, Tom Burns Haber and William White,<lb/>
and the controversy thus aroused appeared in the correspondence columns of<lb/>
the Times Literary Supplement during the next sixteen years, resulting in correc-<lb/>
tions in later impressions; for the key moments in this debate, see the letters<lb/>
in the TLS on 26 September, 24 October, 7 November 1952; 2 October 1953;<lb/>

Fourteenth impression: December 1953. With a new “Note on the Text”<lb/>
signed by Carter and dated 1953. A note in Carter’s hand in the Lilly Library<lb/>
copy reads: “This 14th impression incorporates some further revisions of the<lb/>
text, resulting from a complete re-collation of the posthumously published<lb/>
poems with the MSS in the Library of Congress.” Fifteenth impression:<lb/>

ingly claims that “the poet’s notes and manuscripts, in accordance with his own<lb/>
instructions, were destroyed after his death”; but Housman’s injunction<lb/>
did not apply to all his manuscripts, and the “Note on the Text” refers to<lb/>
editorial changes made after “further scrutiny of the manuscripts.” Second<lb/>

Rinehart & Winston (the name of the firm as of March 1960) also briefly had<lb/>

Unsigned. These pamphlets are entered here because Carter was director of the General Division of British Information Services in New York<lb/>
from November 1943 through October 1945, and one of his responsibilities was to oversee the preparation and production of BIS publications,<lb/>
which included a large number of widely distributed pamphlets. He can therefore be considered the editor of those pamphlets. The one that he is known to have written, <hi>Victory in Burma</hi> (1945), is entered in section A. For further comment, see the headnote to the handlist, above.</p>

A. E. Housman, <hi>Selected Prose</hi>. Edited by Carter, with a “<hi>Preface</hi>” (pp. vii–xv).<lb/>
Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1961. xv,204 pp. Hardback (with<lb/>
dust-jacket) and paperback. Carter-Sparrow-White (A:1952) 21. In the Eton<lb/>
copy of the Collamore exhibition catalogue (C:1961), Carter noted that his<lb/>
preface to the <hi>Selected Prose</hi> incorporates most (except for the conclusion) of<lb/>
his address at that exhibition opening. In a note in <hi>The Book Collector</hi> a year<lb/>
later (“<hi>Housmaniana</hi>,” D:1962, Spring), he explained the production history<lb/>
of the book: “The first impression (serving both the British and American<lb/>
markets) bears on the reverse of the title-leaf the legend ‘Reprinted in the<lb/>
United States of America’. The collector will naturally infer an earlier printing:<lb/>
he will be wrong. The bibliographer will wonder, reprinted from what?<lb/>
The explanation is that the book was set at Cambridge (the page-proofs, to<lb/>
which I happen to have access, carry the normal imprint of the University<lb/>
Printer); the edition was then produced in the United States by photo-offset<lb/>
from ‘reproduction proofs’; it was bound and jacketed (for the cloth issue)<lb/>
and wrappered (for the paperback) also in the United States; and the copies for publication<lb/>
from Bentley House on 8 Nov. 1961 (20 Oct. from CUP New York) shipped across the Atlantic.”<lb/>

<!-- Text continues on next page -->

<p>that the Foundation was financed by Mary Jean Kempner Thorne, primar-<lb/>

Printing and the Mind of Man: A Descriptive Catalogue Illustrating the Impact of Print<lb/>
on the Evolution of Western Civilization during Five Centuries. Edited by Carter<lb/>
and Percy H. Muir. London: Cassell, [1966]. 16 pp. Wrappers. A “specimen”<lb/>
(so called in the introductory essay on the inside front wrapper) to advertise<lb/>
the full edition (B:1967), it consists of the first sixteen pages of the main text<lb/>
of the projected volume (a single sewn gathering) with added wrappers. The<lb/>
text is in a preliminary state—the major difference being that there is an<lb/>
illustration for the Thomas Littleton entry (no. 23) and none for Aesop (no.<lb/>
15), whereas the reverse is true in the published book. The recto of the front<lb/>
wrapper reproduces the title-page wording of the book but in a different set-<lb/>
ting. The essay on the verso of the front wrapper, entitled “The Impact of<lb/>
Print,” with Carter’s characteristic phrasing, was obviously written by him;<lb/>
it was later used (with the title and the last two sentences deleted, along with<lb/>
nine smaller revisions) on the book’s dust-jacket flaps. (It was also used in a<lb/>
four-page prospectus, where Carter is known to have changed by hand the<lb/>
phrase “full descriptions” to “in-depth descriptions” in the third sentence.)<lb/>
In the copy of the specimen in my collection, presented by Carter to Arthur<lb/>
Cohen on Michaelmas 1966, Carter wrote a note on the inside back wrapper<lb/>
regarding the price of “approximately” nine guineas listed among the statis-<lb/>
tics and specifications printed there: “this was figured before the September<lb/>
estimate reduction: should not therefore be exceeded.” The price when pub-<lb/>
lished was seven guineas.<lb/>

Includes an appendix (pp. 47–54), “Shelley, Swinburne and Housman,” condensed from an article by Carter and John Sparrow in the <hi>Times Literary Supplement</hi> (E2:1968, November).<lb/>
Published 11 November 1969. In the “Note on the Text,” Carter points out that Housman’s manuscript has no title other than “Cambridge inaugural.”<lb/>
The decision to supply a title, he says, was not his. “But,” he adds, “having deferred to the decision, I discovered in myself a disinclination to defer to anyone else’s preference in such presumption; so, for better or worse, the title here given to the Cambridge inaugural is mine.”<lb/>
Carter reported two errors in a letter published in the <hi>Times Literary Supplement</hi> on 27 November 1969, p. 1362: at 22.19, “preserved” should be “preserve”; at 23.11, “examples” should be “example”.<lb/>
Carter first published the lecture, omitting a short paragraph on Shelley and Swinburne, in the <hi>Times Literary Supplement</hi> of 9 May 1968, with an appended “Note” (E2:1968); and he had the TLS text reprinted “for private circulation” (see the preceding entry).<lb/>

  <p>[Dedication to Churchill], in Grim Glory: Pictures of Britain under Fire, edited by Ernestine Carter (who wrote the text and captions), with a preface by Edward R. Murrow and photographs by Lee Miller et al. (London: Lund, Humphries, 1941), p. [3]. Reprinted four times. Carter identified the dedication as his composition in “Clough to Churchill” (D:1941, August). It reads, “Dedicated to / The Right Honourable / MR. WINSTON CHURCHILL / Prime Minister of Great Britain / the embodiment and the inspiration / of the indomitable spirit / of the common people / to which this book / pays tribute”. Carter may also have contributed to the captions; for example, one of them states, “Since Waterloo, of course, the playing-fields of Eton have been a legitimate military objective.” A further account of the book </p>

David Randall on 18 December 1964 (at the Lilly Library), Carter says that<lb/>
the preface “was, as a matter of fact, written by the third of the signatories<lb/>
to it.” Carter was a member of the Supervisory Committee and would have<lb/>
been involved in various aspects of the preparation of this book, but he was<lb/>
not on the Editorial Board—nor on the British Museum Committee, which<lb/>
oversaw the historical exhibition of fine printing that was mounted in the<lb/>
British Museum (whereas the Earls Court exhibition displayed, along with<lb/>
printing equipment, books that were monuments of intellectual history). The<lb/>
catalogues of both exhibitions are included in this publication but are sepa<lb/>
rately paginated. In the preface to the British Museum part, R. A. Wilson<lb/>
thanks Carter (along with Nicolas Barker and Percy Muir) for special help<lb/>
“in selecting the books and producing the following catalogue.” Carter’s<lb/>
Curwen Press edition of Browne (<hi>B:1932</hi>) is listed as item 177. Because the<lb/>
British Museum exhibition was to run two months longer than the one at<lb/>
Earls Court, its catalogue was made available separately, with the imprint of<lb/>
the British Museum and the title <hi>Printing and the Mind of Man: An Exhibition<lb/>

<p>E. Contributions to the Times Literary Supplement, 1931–74<lb/>
Carter made almost a thousand contributions to the Times Literary Supplement from 26 March 1931 (a letter on <hi rend="italic">“Original Boards”</hi>) through 3 May 1974 (a review of Sydney Roscoe’s book on John Newbery): about 700 were reviews, and the rest were letters and articles. Together they covered a remarkable number of the books, bibliographical periodicals, exhibitions, auctions, and other book-world events of their time. All the reviews were unsigned (following TLS policy until 1974), and all the letters were signed; some of the articles were signed, but<lb/>
</p>
<pb n="88"/>
<p>most were not. It would be a pointless duplication to list all these contributions<lb/>
here because a nearly complete (and fully indexed) list is available to subscribers<lb/>
on the internet, in the TLS Historical Archive (at &lt;www.the-tls.co.uk&gt;), which<lb/>
identifies the authorship of most unsigned pieces. It is easy to use: one simply<lb/>
enters Carter’s name and “Contributor” to see a nearly complete chronological<lb/>
list. In the list, every item has a citation (title, date, page); and for the pieces classified as reviews, there are the names of the authors and the titles of the books and<lb/>
journals reviewed as well. Every item also has a link to a view of the original page.<lb/>
</p>
<p>One can, if one wishes, limit the list to “Editorial” (which means articles and<lb/>
letters) or “Reviews.” Choosing “Reviews,” however, will not provide a list of<lb/>
all the reviews because some items are incorrectly classified in the Archive.<lb/>
For example, many short “articles,” and even some long ones, are actually reviews<lb/>
of books or journals but were not set up in the way reviews usually were, with<lb/>
details of the book or journal in the heading; as a result, they are not classified as<lb/>
reviews. (And occasionally the reverse is true.) Thus if one wishes to see whether<lb/>
Carter ever reviewed a particular book or journal in the TLS, one should (after<lb/>
entering Carter’s name as contributor) enter the name of the author or title of<lb/>
the book or journal as “Keyword” (rather than “Author” or “Book title”), and it<lb/>
will be located even if it does not appear in the heading of the piece. This search<lb/>
would then have to be supplemented by an examination of list E1 below.<lb/>
</p>
<p>The Archive contains a few other errors, but they are normally obvious and pose no difficulty. For example, Carter’s second letter to the TLS, entitled “Sir<lb/>
Thomas Browne” on 16 July 1931, is listed twice because another letter on the<lb/>
same page, by three other writers, is entitled “Sir Thomas More,” and the entry<lb/>
mistakenly merges these two references and lists the merged entry twice. For a<lb/>
variety of reasons, many other duplicated entries exist, and the extra ones can be<lb/>
ignored, though they cause the stated total number of Carter’s contributions to<lb/>
be somewhat inflated—but see the first list below for items to be added, bringing the<lb/>
total back to nearly a thousand.<lb/>
</p>
<p>There are two main sources for TLS authorship: the archival set of published<lb/>
issues (with the authors’ names written on them) and the “Stock Books” (showing the<lb/>
material available for use each week). Apparently the electronic Archive was<lb/>
based on the first, with occasional reference to the second when the first is unclear,<lb/>
as is implied in Derwent May’s 2001 book, <hi>Critical Times: The History of the “Times Literary Supplement”</hi> (p. xi). (This procedure is confirmed by the fact that in some<lb/>
instances the Archive fills the space for “Contributor” with the statement “can’t find in stock book.”) In 1977 and 1978, Arthur Crook (who had been editor of the TLS<lb/>
from 1959 to 1974 and was then hoping to write a history of the journal) kindly allowed<lb/>
me to examine the Stock Books, which I went through for the issues from 31 August<lb/>
1940 to 5 November 1971 (but the bibliographical “back page” authors were not<lb/>
noted until 30 August 1941). I have checked my notes against the electronic Archive and<lb/>
have found that 59 items credited to Carter in the Stock Books are not assigned to him<lb/>
in the Archive. In all these cases except one, the Archive gives no contributor’s name,<lb/>
and many of them are classified as advertisements. (Perhaps the program called for a<lb/>
contributor’s name to be entered if “Review” were used; but “Editorial” did not, and<lb/>
it is not clear why “Advertisement” was sometimes chosen<lb/>

<pb n="89"/><lb/>when the contributor’s name was not indicated in the archival copies and could<lb/>not be located in the Stock Books.) In the one instance where the Archive gives a<lb/>contributor’s name for one of these items assigned to Carter in the Stock Books, the<lb/>Archive is incorrect, as explained in the list below at 2 January 1953.<lb/>These pieces clearly are Carter’s work and should be added to the list of<lb/>his contributions. Even with them added, some of Carter’s contributions are<lb/>surely still not accounted for: anyone who attentively reads the <hi>TLS</hi> back page<lb/>for this period will find elements of Carter’s style in other pieces, which is not<lb/>surprising since he was in charge of the back page from 1946 to 1967 (except<lb/>for 1953–55, when he was in Washington). But I have not included TLS items<lb/>solely on the basis of my judgment. It is perhaps unnecessary to tell future users<lb/>of this handlist that the <hi>TLS Archive</hi>, like other electronic files, may at some<lb/>point be revised—with the result that the errors and omissions noted here may<lb/>be corrected.<lb/>In the first of two lists below, all the additions from the Stock Books (and four<lb/>other additions) are recorded. The second list brings together Carter’s major<lb/>contributions to the <hi>TLS</hi>, extracted from the full listing.<lb/><hi rend="bold">E1. Additions to the TLS Archive’s List of Carter’s Contributions</hi><lb/>The items listed here, with four exceptions, are attributed to Carter in the Stock<lb/>Books but are not credited to him (or anyone, except in one case) in the electronic<lb/>Historical Archive. The four additions not from the Stock Books are a letter of<lb/>12 August 1944, which is not credited to Carter in the Archive even though it<lb/>is signed; an unsigned report on the <hi>Silver sale</hi> (2 December 1965), which is<lb/>identified by a cutting at Eton; some paragraphs on the <hi>Maurice Pariser sale</hi><lb/>in a <hi>“Commentary” column</hi> (14 December 1967), which is identified by<lb/>a typescript photocopy at the Harry Ransom Center; and some paragraphs on Stanley<lb/>Morison in a <hi>“Commentary” column</hi> (19 December 1968), which is identified by<lb/>a corrected proof at Eton. (These last two items raise the possibility, indeed the<lb/>probability, that Carter made other contributions to the <hi>“Commentary” column</hi>,<lb/>which began on 19 October 1967; the contributors to this column are usually not<lb/>identified in the Archive.) All these pieces are unquestionably Carter’s work and<lb/>should be added to the list in the Archive.<lb/><hi rend="bold">E1:1944</hi><lb/>L “Morris L. Parrish,” <hi>TLS</hi>, 12 August 1944, p. 396.

E2. Carter’s Major Contributions to the <hi>TLS</hi><lb/>
It may be useful to extract from the full list, for separate recording here,<lb/>
Carter’s major <hi>TLS</hi> pieces. The list below consists of (1) editorials (unsigned leaders), (2) signed pieces of any length (other than letters), and (3) unsigned pieces<lb/>
<pb n="93"/>
and signed letters that are the equivalent of two full columns or more in length.<lb/>
Reviews that are long simply because they take up a number of bibliographical<lb/>
journals and discuss the contents of each are not included here; they amount to<lb/>
a series of short reviews (and individual issues of journals often do receive inde­<lb/>
pendent reviews). Five pieces in this list will not be found under Carter’s name<lb/>
in the Historical Archive (those at 20 April 1946, 19 January 1951, 9 April 1964,<lb/>
29 May 1964, and 17 December 1964). They are among the items assigned to<lb/>
Carter only in the Stock Books and recorded in the list above; since they are long<lb/>
enough to qualify for the present list, they are repeated here.<lb/>
Eleven pieces in this list were later reprinted: those at 1 June 1946, 20 March<lb/>
1948, 2 June 1950, 25 August 1950, 12 January 1951, 13 April 1951, 9 May 1952,<lb/>
18 March 1955, 28 August 1959, 9 May 1968, and 30 October 1970. Twelve<lb/>
pieces were signed: those at 27 April 1933, 22 August 1935, 30 May 1936, 5<lb/>
June 1943, 1 June 1946, 12 July 1957, 6 September 1963, 14 March 1968, 9 May<lb/>

<head>APPENDIX</head>
<head>John Carter’s Supposed Novel</head>
<p>Those who are familiar with John Carter’s writings have long been aware of<lb/>
the 1934 novel called <hi>The Fall of the Titan</hi>, by “John Waynflete.” It has regularly<lb/>
been attributed to Carter, whose full name was John Waynflete Carter and who<lb/>
occasionally used “John Waynflete” (or “George Waynflete” or “Waynflete”) as<lb/>
a pseudonym, as on the second edition (1946) of the volume of clerihews that he<lb/>
edited for the Rampant Lions Press, the private press of his brother Will. But<lb/>
the novel has not been read by many people because of its rarity. As of August<lb/>
2020, WorldCat records only four copies worldwide: at the British Library, the<lb/>
National Library of Scotland, Oxford, and Yale (three of which—all but Oxford—<lb/>
attribute the authorship to Carter in their catalogues). There are also copies<lb/>
at Trinity College Dublin and Swansea University, and there may of course be<lb/>
other institutional copies not reported to WorldCat. In addition, I am aware of a<lb/>
few individuals who possess a copy. Nevertheless, it is clearly a very scarce book.<lb/>
Because I recently acquired a copy (with the assistance of A. S. G. Edwards),<lb/>
I am now in a position to read it, which I have done. The experience, however,<lb/>
was not what I had expected. Carter’s writing is known for its elegance and wit,<lb/>
and this novel is written with ludicrous formality and is full of banal sentiments.<lb/>
One only has to read a few pages to begin wondering: did Carter really write this?<lb/>
The name “John Waynflete” is what has caused people to think that he did. But<lb/>
<pb n="99"/>
if he did, the next question is: why would he have written it in that style? And if<lb/>
that question can be answered, there is the question of when, in his pre-1934 life,<lb/>
he would have been likely to have the time or inclination to write it.<lb/>
Since so few people have read the novel, the best way to begin a discussion<lb/>
of it is to describe its plot (which is relevant evidence in itself ). The story en–<lb/>
compasses the rise and fall of Silas Burney, a depraved and unscrupulous man<lb/>
who becomes a famous Labour leader. In <hi>Book I</hi> (of four Books, comprising 38<lb/>
chapters), we learn that Silas has neglected his wife and four children, being more<lb/>
dedicated to the Socialist Party. The next Book covers his becoming a member<lb/>
of Parliament and a powerful and influential speaker (the titan of the Labour<lb/>
movement); his being befriended by the daughter (named Miles) of Sir John<lb/>
Walker, a “tolerant and kind” newspaper owner who treats his employees well;<lb/>
and Miles’s asking Silas to help a housemaid (Flossie) whom (unknown to Miles)<lb/>
he has seduced. At this point we are told that “there are always forces at work,<lb/>
unseen forces, ever vigilant to bring to nought the evildoer wherever found, and<lb/>
Silas Burney was now to see the first signs of his fall” (p. 147).<lb/>
In <hi>Book III</hi>, Miles and Flossie gradually discover that they are in love with the same man<lb/>
(Silas); and a Sir Jacob Randles promises Silas wealth and his daughter’s hand in return<lb/>
for Silas’s arranging for Sir Jacob to be given a title. Silas, in <hi>Book IV</hi>, vows to pay<lb/>
Flossie to be rid of her (and the child she had by him) in order to accept Sir Jacob’s<lb/>
offer. Sir John, convinced of Flossie’s goodness and with evidence of Silas’s duplicity,<lb/>
manages to bring everyone together in London, where Silas is confronted. Flossie<lb/>
makes an eloquent speech (including poetry) at the end of which she dies, but not before<lb/>
Silas has wept and asked for forgiveness. In a brief Epilogue, we learn that Silas and his<lb/>
daughter have moved to Canada, where he says to her that the bright star they see in the sky<lb/>
“may be your mother’s eyes looking down on you and me, and hoping and praying that you<lb/>
will become like her—a woman who brought ‘the Titan’ down and made him a MAN!”<lb/>
There are a number of other characters that I have not mentioned; and most of the characters,<lb/>
from time to time, engage in political discussion, often uttering long statements on the dangers<lb/>
of socialism and the corruption of the demagogues who attain office. One character wonders<lb/>
“if the rottenness and canker had gone too far to save the nation” (p. 73). And not only the<lb/>
characters but the narrative voice also raises this concern:<lb/>
There has been working silently on the English Nation for many years, a spirit alien to<lb/>
everything that makes for honesty of purpose, integrity of character and truthful speech. Turn<lb/>
where we will, this insidious power is at work, ceaselessly, noiselessly, resolutely; bent<lb/>
on undermining the British Character and the British Constitution. (p. 95)<lb/>
From the opening chapter, the narrator’s views are clear: a minister’s strictures, for instance,<lb/>
are said to have “aroused the bellicose propensities of a certain class who alas! have<lb/>
assumed the reins of government,” and a footnote here states “Labour Government in Office” (p. 11). The formality of expression is illustrated on the previous page when two men<lb/>
conversing on a veranda say they should move inside because of an approaching storm:<lb/>
by doing so, they were “suiting the action to the word.” The style ranges from overly formal<lb/>
to melodramatic:<lb/>
<div><p><pb n="100"/>“Some women who love brush the stars with their shoulders, they bring a touch<lb/>of Heaven into the dreariest life, they smooth life’s wrinkles and chase fear and<lb/>doubt into night” (p. 83). These examples are perhaps sufficient to suggest the<lb/>novel’s tone and point of view.<lb/>The book of 285 pages was published at 7s.6d. in early 1934 by Lincoln Wil-<lb/>liams Ltd., a short-lived London publisher with offices at 19 Adam Street (and<lb/>was printed by the Clock House Press of Hoddesdon). It may have been available<lb/>in late 1933, for it is included in the publisher’s advertisement in The Bookman<lb/>for December 1933. The Lincoln Williams firm was active for only three years,<lb/>from 1932 to 1935, when financial problems brought about its end. It went into<lb/>administration in July 1935, following a petition from Amy Gilmour, author of<lb/>a novel called The Lure of Islam, which the firm had published in 1933; and the<lb/>winding-up order is dated 20 August 1935. I am aware of fifty titles with the<lb/>Lincoln Williams imprint during those years, and they encompass a wide variety<lb/>of books, ranging from reference books on cricket and books of practical advice<lb/>to biographies, memoirs, travel writing, historical studies, poetry, and fiction. It<lb/>seems likely that many of them were paid for by their authors.<lb/>The dust-jacket for The Fall of the Titan (known from Richard Landon’s copy)<lb/>lists twelve other novels, with titles like The Seal of Love, Hearts Adrift, and Noonday<lb/>Devil. It carries on the front an illustration by H. W. Perl (1897–1952), the famous<lb/>(and much collected) artist of pulp-fiction covers, who did other Lincoln Williams<lb/>jackets as well. No information about the author is given, and the blurb consists<lb/>of only two phrases: “A powerful story of ambition, intrigue, love and disaster.<lb/>A novel to put into the hands of thinking young people.”<lb/>On 5 April 1934 the Times Literary Supplement included the book in its section<lb/>of brief notices of “New Books and Reprints” (pp. 245–46). The short review is<lb/>worth quoting in full:<lb/>In a style so stilted and sententious as to read almost like a parody, the author tells the<lb/>story of one Silas Burney, a bold bad Labour leader, who, despite the fact he had robbed<lb/>his employer, left his wife and children to starve, seduced a housemaid, and trifled with<lb/>the affections of a baronet’s daughter, becomes a power in the land and is confidently<lb/>spoken of as the coming Prime Minister. There is, however, as we are reminded in capital<lb/>letters, “something in the world that works against a bad man.” The “Titan” crashes,<lb/>and is made to see the error of his ways as the result of a remarkable dying speech by the<lb/>housemaid which, starting with an impassioned eulogy of Cobden, Bright and free trade,<lb/>ends up by warning him that “bankruptcy and death are the final heirs of imposture and<lb/>make-believe.”<lb/>This review is notable in two ways: the deftness of its plot summary and the per-<lb/>ceptiveness of its suggestion that the book might be a parody. The TLS historical<lb/>archive does not give the names of the authors of brief reviews of this kind. But<lb/>these two points invite the speculation that the review might have been written<lb/>by Carter himself (if he wrote the book) as a way of instructing readers to treat<lb/>the book as a parody. (Many years later he wrote a review of his ABC for Book-<lb/>Collectors.) Although he did not become a regular reviewer for the TLS until 1936,<lb/>he had already published a signed article there (on Byron in the 27 April and<lb/>4 May 1933 issues) as well as a few letters, and he was already involved, with<lb/>several others, in reinvigorating the TLS back page as a bibliographical forum.</p></div>

      <pb n="101"/>
      <p>Conceivably the fact that the book was noticed at all shows Carter’s influence<lb/>
      (of the twelve other novels listed on the dust-jacket for <hi>The Fall of the Titan</hi>, only<lb/>
      five were given any notice in the TLS). In any case, whether or not Carter had<lb/>
      anything to do with the review, the idea that the novel might be a parody is<lb/>
      worth considering.<lb/>
      </p>
      <p>This idea would seem to be at odds with the dust-jacket recommendation<lb/>
      that the book should be “put into the hands of thinking young people”—which<lb/>
      implies that it should be taken at face value. On the other hand, of course, this<lb/>
      blurb could be part of the parody. But if one wished to produce a parody of sentimental fiction with an anti-Labour slant, it would take a remarkable commitment<lb/>
      to devote about 90,000 words to the cause. And it is not clear what would be<lb/>
      accomplished. Parodying the literary conventions and moralistic tone of popular<lb/>
      fiction would affect the expression of political views on both sides. It would not,<lb/>
      in other words, be a way of directing the reader’s sympathy to move from one<lb/>
      side to the other—though possibly it could reveal shortcomings in the arguments<lb/>
      on both sides. Or it could simply, through exaggeration, show the weaknesses of<lb/>
      popular fiction. But it is not very effective as a parody, since it is tiresome rather<lb/>
      than amusing. Viewing it as a parody, therefore, does not redeem it from being<lb/>
      an unsatisfactory piece of writing, in contrast with everything known to be from<lb/>
      Carter’s pen.<lb/>
      </p>
      <p>The novel does contain a few elements that would be compatible with Carter’s authorship, the first being its many classical references. Carter’s devotion to<lb/>
      the classics, nourished at Eton and King’s Cambridge (where he took an honors<lb/>
      degree in classics), was lifelong and was reflected in his collecting and editing<lb/>
      of Catullus and his admiration for A. E. Housman. Although Catullus is not<lb/>
      mentioned in the novel, there are references to Aristotle, Plutarch, Aristophanes,<lb/>
      Tacitus, Cicero, Socrates, and Homer. There is even a conversation about remembering classical texts from one’s college days (p. 132), and a Latin quotation<lb/>
      from Augustine is the subject of another conversation (p. 33). Other literary allusions include Byron, Moliere, Lamartine, Clovis Hugues, and Shakespeare (one<lb/>
      character uses the phrase “stale, flat, and unprofitable”). There are few bibliophilic touches, but a character introduced on the first page is “a lover of books”<lb/>
      (p. 230), and another character visits a bookshop that had been Dodsley’s in the<lb/>
      eighteenth century (pp. 51-52). These references do not, however, furnish strong<lb/>
      enough evidence to outweigh the overall style and tone, for they are not beyond<lb/>
      the competence of many people with a literary education.<lb/>
      </p>
      <p>If Carter wrote the novel, it is not credible that he wrote it in the years just<lb/>
      prior to its publication. Immediately after he came down from Cambridge in<lb/>
      1927, he was fully occupied with the book world, having been hired at once by<lb/>
      Scribner’s London office to supply rare books to the New York shop. And his<lb/>
      letters to the TLS beginning early in 1931 show that he was already immersed<lb/>
      in the study of publishers’ bindings, Sir Thomas Browne, and the Wise-Forman<lb/>
      forgeries—the subjects of his remarkable series of publications in 1932-34 (<hi>Binding Variants in English Publishing</hi> and an edition of Browne in 1932 and <hi>An Enquiry into the Nature of Certain Nineteenth Century Pamphlets</hi> in 1934). Also in these years he<lb/>
      contributed introductions to two Elkin Mathews catalogues, searched for books<lb/>
      </p>

  </text>

<pb n="102"/>
<p>to send to Scribner’s, wrote four catalogues for Scribner’s, collaborated on other<lb/>
Scribner catalogues, and edited <hi>Catullus</hi> and <hi>New Paths in Book Collecting</hi>.<lb/>
It is hard to conceive of his writing <hi>The Fall of the Titan</hi> at the same time.<lb/>
(The only periods when he might have had some free time on his hands would have been<lb/>
on shipboard when traveling to and from New York in early 1929 and early 1932;<lb/>
but it seems unlikely that he would have given priority to this novel over<lb/>
the bibliographical projects he had in progress.)</p>

<p>So we are left with the possibility that he wrote it for amusement during his<lb/>
college years. But that, too, is hard to believe: why would he have chosen to de-<lb/>
vote so much time to a work of melodramatic political fiction (or a parody of one),<lb/>
when he was busy with his studies and with book-hunting? And if he had done<lb/>
so, everything we know about him suggests that he would have made a better job<lb/>
of it, even as an undergraduate. The novel as it stands would presumably have<lb/>
been an embarrassment to him by 1934. Why would he have wanted to resurrect<lb/>
it by giving it to a publisher? A possible reason could be that he thought it might<lb/>
bring in some money. But if he wanted to publish it and conceal his authorship,<lb/>
surely he would not have chosen a pseudonym that could so easily be identified<lb/>
with him.</p>

<p>We thus come back to the name “John Waynflete,” which remains, after all,<lb/>
the seemingly most persuasive link with Carter—and probably the only one<lb/>
considered by the collectors and library cataloguers who have made the connec-<lb/>
tion. But it is not as decisive as it may at first seem to be. Carter’s verifiable<lb/>
uses of the name “Waynflete” did not begin until after 1934: first as “George Wayn-<lb/>
flete” in <hi>Bibliographical Notes &amp; Queries</hi> in 1939, then as “Waynflete” in <hi>Publishers’ Weekly</hi> in 1940, and finally as “John Waynflete” in <hi>The Cornhill Magazine</hi> in 1944.<lb/>
Therefore if someone other than Carter were looking for a pseudonym, even<lb/>
someone attuned to the bibliophilic world, there would have been no reason to<lb/>
avoid “Waynflete” as a name already in use. And Carter was not well enough<lb/>
known (at least until the <hi>Enquiry</hi> came out, a few months after the novel) for<lb/>
many people to have been aware of his middle name. (I realize that Carter’s use<lb/>
of “George Waynflete” in 1939 could be seen as his way of distancing himself<lb/>
from the novel he had signed “John Waynflete” five years earlier—though not a<lb/>
very great distancing. But this argument goes both ways: he could also have been<lb/>
distancing himself from the “John Waynflete” someone else had used five years<lb/>
earlier—which he would probably have been aware of through the TLS review.)</p>

<p>If there was no reason for someone else to avoid using “Waynflete” in 1934,<lb/>
what reason would there have been for anyone else to choose it? Actually, there<lb/>
would have been many people to whom the name might have occurred as an<lb/>
appealing and appropriate pseudonym: anyone who had a connection with Eton,<lb/>
Winchester, or Magdalen College. Carter’s middle name results from a family<lb/>
connection with William Waynflete, a fifteenth-century Provost of Eton, who<lb/>
was also a Bishop of Winchester and the founder of Magdalen College Oxford.<lb/>
The name is well known to persons who have some association with any of these<lb/>
institutions. And, as Nicolas Barker has pointed out to me, it further impinges on<lb/>
people’s consciousness through its use in place names, such as a road in Oxford,<lb/>
a street in London, and a close in Bishops Waltham. The widespread knowledge<lb/>
of the Waynflete name is indicated by its presence even in America: in Portland,<lb/>

<pb n="103"/>Maine, for example, there is a Waynflete School, which was named for the same<lb/>William Waynflete. It is not a rare name, in other words, and descendants of Wil-<lb/>liam Waynflete survive on both sides of the Atlantic. Someone other than Carter<lb/>could well have chosen to use “John Waynflete” in 1934. And it might not be a<lb/>pseudonym at all.<lb/><lb/>The collections of Carter’s papers in various libraries (Eton, King’s, Cam-<lb/>bridge University Library, Bodleian, and Lilly among them) do not seem to con-<lb/>tain anything relevant; Sebastian Carter, John’s nephew, knows nothing about<lb/>the novel; and Michael Meredith tells me that it was not among Carter’s copies<lb/>of his own books at the time of his death. Carter’s authorship of it has not been<lb/>proved or disproved. The question comes down to how one evaluates the likeli-<lb/>hood that anyone other than Carter could have used “John Waynflete” versus<lb/>the likelihood that Carter could have written something, even as a parody, with<lb/>the style and content of this novel. Unless there is evidence that I am not aware<lb/>of, I think it seems reasonable to say that the arguments against John Carter’s<lb/>authorship of The Fall of the Titan are stronger than those supporting it.

<pb n="105"/>THE SOURCES OF THE SUSSEX DECLARATION: <lb/>A RECONSIDERATION<lb/>by<lb/>John Bidwell<lb/>In April 2017 several newspapers carried stories about the discovery of a manu-<lb/>script Declaration of Independence. Conjectures about the political signifi-<lb/>cance of the manuscript began to circulate in print and then proliferated on <lb/>the web where the original announcements are still accessible. The discovery <lb/>was sufficiently newsworthy that Prime Minister Theresa May and President <lb/>Donald Trump took time to look at it while Trump was making his UK state <lb/>visit in 2019. Unfortunately, they and their advisors were misinformed. Basic <lb/>assumptions about the date and origins of the manuscript are in error and have <lb/>prompted unfounded claims about its historical importance. I hope to correct <lb/>those errors here and set the record straight by reviewing the bibliographical <lb/>arguments that made that manuscript a media sensation.<lb/>My main concern is with an article by Danielle Allen and Emily Sneff in <lb/>the <hi>Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America</hi> (PBSA). It serves as the definitive <lb/>announcement of the discovery and a means of explaining the authors’ research <lb/>methods. They describe and date the manuscript (see figure 1) in the article and <lb/>suggest a route by which it came to its present location in the West Sussex Record <lb/>Office (WSRO), Chichester, England. In brief this is how they present their find-<lb/>ings: sometime between 1783 and 1790 a clerk made a copy of the <hi>Declaration <lb/>of Independence</hi>, the manuscript that had been engrossed on parchment for the <lb/>Continental Congress in 1776. The clerk had trouble reading the original, com-<lb/>mitted errors of transcription, and even smudged the title, but was ambitious <lb/>enough to write it out on a large sheet of parchment. Measuring 24 by 30½ inches,<lb/>it was intended for display and was probably commissioned by the Pennsylva-<lb/>nia lawyer James Wilson (1742-1798), one of the Founding Fathers who had <lb/>signed the engrossed Declaration. Wilson played a prominent part in drafting <lb/>the Constitution, which he also signed, and relied on this copy to argue for a <lb/>strong national government founded on the will of the people rather than a loose <lb/>confederation of semi-independent states. His concept of nationhood is evident <lb/>in the way the clerk transcribed the fifty-six signatures in the engrossed Decla-<lb/>ration, not grouped by states as in the original but intermingled in a seemingly<lb/>

Here they narrow down its dates to 1785–1787 and discuss how it figured in<lb/>the deliberations of the Constitutional Convention. They note the possibility<lb/>that it had belonged to Charles Lennox, third duke of Richmond (1735–1806),<lb/>whose family seat was not far from Chichester. Richmond was an advocate of the<lb/>American cause, a proponent of parliamentary reform, and a tenacious member<lb/>of the opposition sympathetic to the ideals enunciated in the Declaration. Allen<lb/>and Sneff make other conjectures in those two articles and expand on them in<lb/>statements to the press. They refer to the manuscript as the Sussex Declaration<lb/>and I will too, although I disagree with them about its origins and significance.<sup>2</sup><lb/>While the PBSA article was being prepared for publication, they issued a press<lb/>release on 20 April 2017 in collaboration with a Communications Officer at Har‐vard University. Within days, articles about the Sussex Declaration appeared in<lb/>the <hi rend="bold">New York Times</hi>, the <hi rend="bold">Guardian</hi>, and the <hi rend="bold">Washington Post</hi>. A CBS television crew<lb/>showed up at the West Sussex Record Office to film the document on site. A<lb/>Wikipedia article about the “physical history” of the Declaration cites two of the<lb/>newspaper reports as well as the press release, which can still be found online in<lb/><hi>Danielle Allen’s Declaration Resources Project</hi> website. They elaborate on their<lb/>hypotheses in a lecture at the National Archives broadcast by <hi rend="bold">C‐SPAN</hi> on 6 July<lb/>2017 and recapitulated in the online National Archives News with a link to a You‐Tube version of the lecture. There and in other media appearances they speculate<lb/>that Thomas Paine may have been an intermediary responsible for bringing the<lb/>Sussex Declaration to the duke of Richmond. Their claims are less explicit in the<lb/><hi rend="bold">New York Times</hi> article, which only queries the connection with Paine and Rich‐mond.<lb/>Performing due diligence, however, the reporter consulted outside experts<lb/>such as a legal historian who observed that even if their attribution to Wilson<lb/>is wrong, an early manuscript of the Declaration is still “the discovery of a lifetime.”<sup>3</sup><lb/>At the end of the PBSA article Allen and Sneff consider an alternative<lb/>hypothesis: their document was based on a miniature facsimile Declaration<lb/>printed in Boston in or after 1836 (figure 2).<lb/><figure xml:id="fig2"><!-- Image link to be added during image export workflow --><figDesc>Figure 2: miniature facsimile of the Declaration printed in Boston in or after 1836.</figDesc></figure><lb/>I brought that facsimile to their</p><div type="footnotes"><note xml:id="fn1" n="1">Danielle Allen and Emily Sneff, “The Sussex Declaration: Dating the Parchment Manuscript of the Declaration of Independence Held at the West Sussex Record Office (Chichester, UK),” <hi>Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America</hi> 112 (2018), 357–403.

attention after they had sent me a preliminary draft of their article. No great<lb/>
amount of scrutiny was required to see that it was the source of the Sussex Dec-<lb/>
laration. The similarities in style and structure are obvious. In my view they are<lb/>
not dealing with a clerk who rearranged the signatures to fulfill Wilson’s politi-<lb/>
cal agenda but rather an amateur who transcribed the facsimile in an exercise of<lb/>
penmanship. But they submit that hypothesis only to dismiss it. Their rebuttal<lb/>
touches on several topics, mainly textual inconsistencies and a question of qual-<lb/>
ity: the facsimile was a mass-produced keepsake measuring no more than 5¾ by<lb/>
4½ inches. Why, they ask, would the clerk use such a paltry print to copy out a<lb/>
Declaration on this scale? They defend their position by pointing out anomalies<lb/>
in the layout of the facsimile not repeated in the manuscript, a transcription<lb/>
problem posed by the sequence of signatures. If the clerk had been copying the<lb/>
facsimile, they say, surely those anomalies would be present in the manuscript.<lb/>
So, what is the source of the Sussex Declaration: the parchment engrossed<lb/>
for the Continental Congress, signed by most of its members on 2 August 1776,<lb/>
the iconic document in the National Archives— or a cheap facsimile printed in<lb/>
Boston some sixty years later? What is the source of the Boston facsimile? In<lb/>
the following I will propose answers to those questions less glamorous than the<lb/>
hypotheses of Allen and Sneff but more consistent with the writing practices<lb/>
and design considerations involved in making a copy of the Declaration. Here,<lb/>
as in other bibliographical endeavors, the pure and simple physical evidence<lb/>
should prevail over less substantial arguments, no matter how many of them<lb/>
may be mustered against a few overriding objections. I will address the main<lb/>
arguments of the PBSA article, which is intended to establish the date of the<lb/>
Sussex Declaration. I will not be concerned with the GJLPP article, for it is<lb/>
entirely predicated on its predecessor and assumes that the alternative hypoth-<lb/>
esis has been refuted. If the dates they propose are not valid, then they cannot<lb/>
attribute it to James Wilson and cannot claim that Wilson used it during the<lb/>
Constitutional Convention.<lb/>
</p>
<head>I</head><lb/>
<p>
Allen and Sneff begin by recounting the provenance of the Sussex Declara-<lb/>
tion. They note that it was deposited in the WSRO by a local solicitor whose firm<lb/>
had done business with the Richmond family. A WSRO archivist told them that<lb/>
the solicitor once had his pick of the family papers that had been entrusted to the<lb/>
firm since the eighteenth century, but were discarded in bulk sometime before<lb/>
1956. Indeed, the finding list of the deposit mentions two or three items relating<lb/>
to the family but they are so scattered and insignificant that it is hard to believe<lb/>
that they came from a trove dating back to the eighteenth century. The deposit<lb/>
is clearly the gleanings of a local history collector who found a few curiosities in<lb/>
his office and kept anything else that caught his eye. The finding list relegates the<lb/>
Sussex Declaration to a miscellaneous section at the end where it is accompanied<lb/>
by an 1828 legal opinion about a conveyance to the duke of Richmond’s trustees,<lb/>
checks drawn on a London bank in the 1840s and 1850s, an advertisement of a<lb/>
London dyer active ca. 1844, a list of the kings and queens of England, and a<lb/>

<pb n="110"/>
1750 letter from the bell ringers of Chichester. <lb/>
With the exception of the letter, nothing in this section has a secure date earlier than 1825. <lb/>
Nonetheless a WSRO archivist dated the Declaration in the late eighteenth century, an educated guess for cataloguing purposes, but Allen and Sneff make it a starting point of their exposition in PBSA. <lb/>
They find additional evidence in the physical features of the Sussex Declaration. <lb/>
They note that it was written on a large size of parchment suitable for exhibition and that it has nail holes in the corners as if it had been displayed at one point. <lb/>
On the advice of conservators they concede that the nails might have been meant to restrain the parchment for other purposes. <lb/>
They view the square shape of the nail holes as evidence for a date in the eighteenth century, but the source they cite contradicts their conclusions. <lb/>
Yes, early hand-wrought iron nails were square but so were the cut nails produced in British and American factories during the first half of the nineteenth century. <lb/>
Wire nails, which would have made round holes in the parchment, were not introduced until the 1850s in America or a bit earlier in England. <lb/>
The parchment was made of a middling-quality sheep-skin. <lb/>
They contend that it was <hi>well prepared</hi>, which may be so, but a Library of Congress conservation report graded it below a more prepossessing calfskin document they had brought in for comparison. <lb/>
The Sussex Declaration may have been put on view, but then it was filed away and forgotten. <lb/>
It was folded twice for storage, in which state it became severely soiled on one side, badly abraded along the folds with loss of text, and seriously damaged on the outer edge of the four leaves with loss of parchment. <lb/>
As to the edge damage, Allen and Sneff admit that a rodent could be to blame but believe it is more likely that a seal had been removed (<hi rend="bold">PBSA, p. 362</hi>). <lb/>
In that case, however, the two outer leaves would have suffered more than the two inner leaves. <lb/>
When I saw it at the WSRO, the depredations seemed to me to be uniform on each of the four leaves. <lb/>
They do not explain what function a seal would have served and why it would have been removed. <lb/>
But those conjectures are beside the point because the parchment was then folded a third time as if it had been demoted to an even smaller storage space. <lb/>
These signs of abuse and neglect are hard to square with their contention that it was a <hi>“ceremonial”</hi> manuscript, a word used repeatedly in the PBSA article to signify the ambitious intentions of those who produced it. <lb/>
In the GJLPP article they use the word even more frequently to express its iconic function and the innovative ideas of James Wilson, who used it to elaborate his views on the Constitution. <lb/>
If it was owned by Richmond, then it must have fallen out of favor in a bad way to end up in that ignominious condition. <lb/>
The title has some words in black letter, but the text is mostly in a utilitarian round hand, which Allen and Sneff attribute to a clerk employed by Wilson. <lb/>
It cannot be assigned to a prominent politician although they have examined the writings of likely candidates and their amanuenses as well. <lb/>

absence of the long s prevalent in manuscripts of this period, but they believe<lb/>
that the clerk was one of the “stylistic radicals” who had dropped that usage.<lb/>
They do not mention that Wilson sometimes used a long s in his drafts of the<lb/>
Constitution, apparently more conservative in his writing practices than his hired<lb/>
hand. Arguing for the American origins of the manuscript, they compare it with<lb/>
contemporary deeds and indentures, some reproduced in the PBSA article, some<lb/>
in the Declaration Resources Project website. They detect stylistic features more<lb/>
likely to be local than to come from England, but to my mind the sample is too<lb/>
small to be convincing. Their morphological analysis of the document has been<lb/>
more useful for their purposes than the script itself, which is difficult to date.<lb/>
Allen and Sneff assert that the clerk made several drafts before completing the<lb/>
“final fair copy” of this manuscript (PBSA, p. 367). They perceive a certain<lb/>
amount of effort expended to produce a symmetrical composition, uniform line<lb/>
endings, no word breaks, and other artistic touches worthy of a document in-<lb/>
tended for display. Nonetheless the clerk botched the job at the beginning and<lb/>
made it worse while trying to correct it. He began to write a date in the same<lb/>
size and style of the black letter “In Congress” on the first line of the title but<lb/>
then thought better of it and began to rub out his mistake. His erasure merely<lb/>
smudged his work leaving remnants of that date easily apparent at first sight.<lb/>
For Allen and Sneff this was an opportunity for further scientific investigation,<lb/>
the results of which are posted on the Declaration Resources Project website and<lb/>
summarized in the PBSA article. They commissioned various tests using imaging<lb/>
techniques and other digital technologies to scrutinize the erasure. In the docu-<lb/>
mentation they received they see evidence that the erased date referred to when<lb/>
the clerk was working on the manuscript: either “July 4, 178” or “July 4, 179,” the<lb/>
last digit indecipherable. Starting on the fair copy, forgetting the momentous<lb/>
date of Independence, the clerk made an absent-minded slip of the pen as if he<lb/>
was thinking about his present circumstances instead of his assignment to rein-<lb/>
terpret the Declaration.<lb/>
The technical reports on the website are inconclusive and are mostly about<lb/>
methodology. A Library of Congress conservator considered the possibility that<lb/>
the third digit in the erased date might be an 8 or 9 but was not willing to com-<lb/>
mit to that reading. I believe there is an easier explanation. Yes, the clerk made<lb/>
a mistake but when and why did he try to fix it? It is more likely that the clerk<lb/>
forgot the July 4, 1776, date while copying out the text, and then went back to<lb/>
write it on the first line next to “In Congress.” Then he realized that this stop-<lb/>
gap measure would spoil the symmetrical composition and erased his work, decid-<lb/>
ing instead to insert the missing date between the first and second lines, obvi-<lb/>
ously an afterthought. He had to break it up at either end of the title and cut<lb/>
it down to a size that would fit between the lines. He used a similarly compressed<lb/>
cursive to mend a mistake in the fifth line of text, correcting the word “when”<lb/>
to “whenever.” This sequence of events explains the smudged title, the inserted<lb/>
date, and the amateurish script. Other mistakes provide opportunities for Allen<lb/>
and Sneff to devise an elaborate argument for the early origins and historical<lb/>
significance of the Sussex Declaration. These too can be explained by viewing<lb/>
them in a bibliographical context, a means of understanding the copying process<lb/>
in manuscript and print.<lb/>
<pb n="112"/><!-- continued from previous page inside <p> -->
The bibliographical record begins in 1776 with the broadside printed in the shop<lb/>
of John Dunlap and continues through the eighteenth century with its letterpress progeny in newspapers and broadsides.<lb/>
In the nineteenth century, however,<lb/>
Americans turned to the engrossed Declaration for a validation of their republican beliefs and an affirmation of their national identity.<lb/>
They could buy copies<lb/>
of the manuscript reproduced the way they wanted to see it, more as an object of veneration than an artifact of history.<lb/>
They expected the text to be accurate, of course, but they also sought to enhance its meaning with patriotic imagery, artistic interventions maybe strange to our eyes yet perfectly compatible with their concept of a facsimile.<lb/>
New and improved intaglio, letterpress, and lithographic printing technologies helped them to realize its iconic potential in copiously ornamented allegorical compositions, some intended to be works of art, others directed toward the bottom of the market.<lb/>
Good and bad, each of these prints has a publication history, which can tell us why some were not reliable, what went wrong with them, and how they caused the mistakes in the Sussex Declaration.<lb/>
Benjamin Owen Tyler and John Binns were the first to issue facsimiles of the Declaration.<lb/>
Tyler was a writing master, Binns a newspaper publisher, each in his own way well qualified to produce and market patriotic prints.<lb/>
Tyler stole a march on Binns, who had issued proposals in March 1816 but allowed his artists to take their time and did not finish his version until October 1819.<lb/>
Tyler issued his in May 1818 at half the price his rival had announced.<lb/>
And as a further provocation, he launched an advertising campaign capitalizing on an endorsement he had received from Thomas Jefferson.<lb/>
Binns took the bait and complained about the interloper’s exploitive tactics.<lb/>
Quick to take offense, eager for publicity, the facsimilists fought a newspaper war extolling the beauty and accuracy of their products while attacking the character, honesty, and patriotism of their adversaries.<lb/>
Both obtained impressive certificates of authenticity, Tyler from the Acting Secretary of State Richard Rush, Binns from Secretary of State John Quincy Adams.<lb/>
Both embellished the text in styles fashionable at that time.<lb/>
Tyler showed off his skills in penmanship by transcribing the text in ornamental scripts, some more elaborate than others but reaching a rhetorical crescendo in the <hi>“emphatical words”</hi> at the end.<lb/>
Binns opted for an allegorical design, an oval <hi>“cordon of honor”</hi> composed of state seals surrounding the text and surmounted by symbols of prosperity next to medallion portraits of Washington, Hancock and Jefferson.<lb/>
The fifty-six signatures beneath the text were the only portions of these prints rendered in what we would consider a facsimile, Tyler’s truer to the original than Binns’s, both with distinctive traits that make them easily identifiable.<lb/>
The writing master improved some of the signatures, unconsciously correcting marks of infirmity and haste.<lb/>
The signatures in the allegorical print had to be truncated in places to fit in that crowded composition.<lb/>

<p><pb n="113"/>In 1823 John Quincy Adams commissioned an official government facsimile<lb/>of the entire manuscript, a state-of-the-art replica expertly engraved by William<lb/>J. Stone. It is the definitive record of the original, which suffered so much mis-<lb/>treatment and neglect that it is now barely legible. Printed on parchment in a<lb/>limited edition, the Stone facsimile did not circulate as widely as the Binns and<lb/>Tyler facsimiles, which were copied, imitated, and adapted well into the 1890s.<lb/>Even a restrike on imitation parchment could not compete with prints deco-<lb/>rated with allegorical vignettes, patriotic emblems, and portraits of Founding<lb/>Fathers. As much as one would expect these decorations to defeat the function<lb/>of a facsimile, this style did not go out of fashion until the end of the century.<lb/>Then, finally, the unadorned Stone facsimile came into its own and became the<lb/>standard visualization of the document, the source of reproductions published<lb/>by the government, expounded in textbooks, sold as souvenirs, and printed on<lb/>Independence Day in the New York Times.<note place="foot" n="6">Printed in or after 1833, the restrike was issued as a folding plate in Peter Force’s American Archives, 5th ser., vol. 1 (1848). Force approved a payment to Stone for this printing job in 1839. Most surviving copies are on folded imitation parchment, although some are unfolded, possibly because Stone or Force sold them separately. The American Antiquarian Society has a copy on paper watermarked J WHATMAN TURKEY MILL 1850. The Department of State had a stock of restrikes on hand in 1893, one of which is at the Massachusetts Historical Society. Electrotype reprints could have been made during the nineteenth century—but probably not until 1894 or 1895, when the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey produced electrotype plates for that purpose. For more on the Stone facsimile and its restrikes, see Leonard Rapport, “Fakes and Facsimiles: Problems of Identification,” American Archivist 42 (1979), 23–26; Catherine Nicholson, “Finding the Stones: National Archives Discovers Several Engravings of the Declaration,” Prologue Magazine 44 (Summer 2012), https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2012/summer/stone.html (accessed 20 March 2023). Full-size reproductions were priced at thirty cents and forty-five cents in the Catalog of U.S. Government Publications during the 1950s. At the other end of the scale, a copy of the original limited edition Stone facsimile recently sold for $4,420,000 (Freeman’s, Philadelphia, 1 July 2021, lot 1), a record-breaking price due to the provenance of that copy, formerly owned by the Signer Charles Carroll.</note></p><p>Facsimile signatures derived either from Binns or Tyler appear in more than<lb/>ninety prints during the nineteenth century. The chain of transmission can be<lb/>complicated, a multistage process with some prints acting as intermediaries, oth-<lb/>ers deriving the signatures from reproductions in illustrated books. Nonetheless,<lb/>they all belong to those two families. With one exception, publishers paid no<lb/>attention to the Stone signatures until just before the Centennial. At least eighty<lb/>prints have an ornamental border of state seals directly or indirectly based on<lb/><hi rend="bold">Binns’s “cordon of honor,”</hi> a versatile design motif easily adapted to include additional pictorial matter. No less popular, Tyler’s <hi rend="italic">“emphatical”</hi> rendition of<lb/>the text inspired at least twenty-seven imitations in letterpress, intaglio, and<lb/>lithography. The New York map and print publisher Horace Thayer incorpo-<lb/>rated Tyler’s lettering in lithographs ca. 1859–1863, large allegorical composi-<lb/>tions including state seals, the American eagle, and a miniature reproduction of John Trumbull’s painting <hi>The Declaration of Independence</hi>.

ca. 1887–1890.<lb/>
Beginning in the 1830s Boston publishers experimented with combinations <lb/>
of the Binns border and the Tyler text. The earliest attempt to my knowledge is <lb/>
a letterpress broadside produced by the Boston Bewick Company around 1834 –<lb/>
1836. A compositor copied Tyler’s title inasmuch as the first words In Congress, <lb/>
July 4, 1776 are set in a curve at the top of the print. The facsimile signatures <lb/>
are part of that family as well as the text, which is printed in a script type interspersed <lb/>
with ornamental types imitating the “emphatical words.” The display <lb/>
faces include black letter, a bold Antique, and two sizes of open shaded caps. The <lb/>
state seals are in the style of the Binns print and its derivatives, although they are <lb/>
shaped like a rectangular frame rather than an oval border. But here too the seals <lb/>
provide a symbolic entourage for the text, each occupying a compartment inside <lb/>
intertwining oak-leaf and olive garlands with the national seal at the center. It <lb/>
easily outdoes other letterpress broadsides in design and execution but it was <lb/>
intended to be cheap. One version was priced 12½ cents in the imprint. Another <lb/>
version was published by Prentiss Whitney, a Boston auctioneer who had a small <lb/>
printmaking business on the side. The Bewick firm had it stereotyped, no doubt <lb/>
as a steady selling product but also as a giveaway specimen of its fancy job printing <lb/>
and stereotyping services. The New York print dealers Phelps & Squire obtained <lb/>
a stereotype copy of the state seals frame, replaced the national seal with <lb/>
a portrait of Washington, and reset the text in the same style for an adaptation <lb/>
issued around 1835–1837. Phelps in another partnership, Phelps & Ensign, used <lb/>
a stereotype plate of the entire print to replenish his stock of Declarations around <lb/>
1838–1842. Stationers’ Hall, an office supplies store in Boston, published a letterpress <lb/>
imitation with the same script type, a similar title design, and a rudimentary <lb/>
border of state seals jumbled together with portraits, ornaments, and recycled <lb/>
illustrations on patriotic themes. No doubt other reprints and imitations have yet <lb/>
to be identified. Boston Bewick’s intermarriage of two Declaration families must <lb/>
have had numerous offspring through the stereotyping endeavors of the firm.<lb/>

He had a long career in job print-<lb/>

He first appears in Boston city directories in 1835 identified as a stereotype founder and then drops out of sight after the company closed down in 1836.<lb/>
He reappears in the 1840s as a printer,<lb/>

In the 1850s he moved to Brooklyn and<lb/>
made his living as a reporter in the office of the Associated Press.<lb/>
After just over ten years in journalism, he resumed the printing business, taking on small jobs<lb/>
at various New York addresses until he died in 1883.<lb/>
An obituary indicates that he had been more than a mere journeyman and was <hi>“well-known”</hi> for his print-<lb/>

He was prominent enough to have taken out the copyright for one of Boston Bewick’s stereotype ventures.<lb/>

<p>Dated 1836, the copyright statement in Bridgham’s facsimile contains his name,<lb/>
but otherwise it is difficult to determine what role he took in its design and pro-<lb/>
duction.<lb/>
Perhaps he had the idea to make a miniature facsimile, a tour de force<lb/>
of lettering and engraving printed on coated paper, all the better to display the<lb/>
precision craftsmanship of the artists he employed.<lb/>
He probably knew about pre-<lb/>
vious attempts to sell Declaration novelties in unusual formats such as prints on<lb/>
silk or satin and, most notably, a commemorative handkerchief priced at a dollar<lb/>
in 1826.<lb/>
Other types of pocket curiosities had already found a ready market in<lb/>
America6mdash;portrait miniatures, miniature silver toys, and thumb Bibles, just to<lb/>
mention a few examples.<lb/>
By catering to this fashion, he started a trend soon to<lb/>
be taken to an extreme by the Philadelphia bank note engraver Charles Toppan,<lb/>
who downsized the Declaration to fit inside a 2 by 3 inch card on coated stock,<lb/>

<p>Bridgham’s design is almost entirely based on the Boston Bewick Company<lb/>
facsimile signatures,<lb/>
the state seals in an oak-leaf and olive-wreath border, the curvature of the title,<lb/>
and the “emphatical words” in the text. Some adjustments had to be made to<lb/>
extrapolate these design elements from a large letterpress broadside, and there<lb/>
was one change in iconography—a portrait of Washington was substituted for<lb/>
the national seal—but Bridgham was clearly indebted to his former employer<lb/>
for the concept and layout of his facsimile. Surely it is no coincidence that he<lb/>
published it just after he left that firm. Intaglio was not his medium, but he would<lb/>
have learned about it while on the job and would have understood its potential<lb/>
for delineating fine detail in miniatures. His model, the letterpress broadside, he<lb/>
would have known from hands-on experience in the stereotype foundry or the<lb/>
pressroom. The Boston Bewick Company gave him the means and the motiva-<lb/>
tion to take on this project at a turning point in his career.</p>

<p>The timing of his publication could not have been better. In 1837 a Boston<lb/>
gallery presented a life-size tableau of mannequins reenacting the ratification<lb/>
of the Declaration, each of the fifty-six Signers dressed in period costume. A<lb/>
broadside advertisement assured the public that it was not a painting, although<lb/>
the scene seems to have been based on Trumbull’s Declaration of Independence. The<lb/>
Committee of Five takes center stage, Franklin to the left of Jefferson, Adams to<lb/>
his right, Livingston and Sherman behind them, while Jefferson submits the com-<lb/>
mittee’s text to the president of Congress. This inspiring spectacle could be seen<lb/>
for twenty-five cents, children half price, from eight in the morning until ten at<lb/>
night. If anyone wanted to take away a souvenir, the Bridgham facsimile would<lb/>
have been easily available at that time and just the right size for that purpose.<lb/>
Indeed it was reprinted in 1839 with the border reworked yet again to change the<lb/>
title and replace the Washington portrait with Trumbull’s Declaration.<sup>11</sup></p>

<p>The text portion of Bridgham’s print determined the lettering in another<lb/>
Boston edition, which also incorporated Trumbull’s Declaration. Published by<lb/>
the Franklin Print Company in 1838, this one was more than twice the size of<lb/>
the miniature, with a more elaborate oak-leaf border containing twenty-six state<lb/>
seals, the national seal, and portraits of the presidents. It contains a competent<lb/>
reproduction of the Asher B. Durand print after Trumbull’s first version of the<lb/>
painting (to be precise, the painting now in the Yale University Art Gallery, not<lb/>
the second version in the Capitol Rotunda or the third version in the Wadsworth<lb/>
Atheneum) as well as a key to the print consisting of forty-eight numbered outline<lb/>
figures. Numbered facsimile signatures identify each of the figures. The Franklin<lb/>
Print Company credited the pictorial part to the engraver Denison Kimberly,<lb/>
the lettering to John B. Bolton. Although reformatted for different proportions,</p>

 the lettering is close in style to that of the Bridgham miniature and imitates<lb/>
 almost all of the “emphatical words” in size and shape. Conceivably Bolton wrote the text for Bridgham, but he does not appear in Boston city directories<lb/>
 until 1838, and I have not found other examples of his calligraphic writing that<lb/>
 might confirm this supposition. By trade, however, he was an engraver, perhaps<lb/>
 a specialist in script. He arrived in Boston in 1831 age twenty after emigrating<lb/>
 from Halifax, Nova Scotia, and started to make his living from engraving in 1836,<lb/>
 when Bridgham’s print was published. Whatever his connection with Bridgham and<lb/>
 the Franklin firm, both prints were successful, and both were reworked for reprint<lb/>
 editions. The latter reappeared with additional illustrations and furnished<lb/>

 motifs published by the New York print dealers who had reprinted the Boston<lb/>

<p>
 Broadening his horizons, Bridgham may have brought copies of the miniature to England.<lb/>
 My sole evidence for this conjecture is a passenger list of the Great Western<lb/>
 steamship arriving in New York from Bristol in August 1838. His name is on the<lb/>
 list along with merchants, men of the cloth, New York notables, wives, children,<lb/>
 and servants. What business he might have had in England is impossible to ascertain,<lb/>
 but he managed to travel in style on a recently launched Atlantic liner renowned<lb/>
 for its size and speed. Perhaps his trip had something to do with a change in career<lb/>
 during the late 1830s when he dropped out of the Boston directories. While exploring<lb/>
 opportunities abroad, he could use his miniature as a means of self-promotion, a<lb/>
 calling card that could be carried about in quantity and presented as an example of<lb/>
 American achievements in the graphic arts. With that in mind, Binns had already<lb/>

Bridgham’s<lb/>artist would have had to be even more dependent on the Sussex Declaration,<lb/>which would have somehow re-emerged in Boston eighteen years after coming<lb/>into the hands of Tyler. Here again we should seek an easier explanation: the<lb/>Bridgham print is the source of the Sussex Declaration. The copyist acknowl-<lb/>edged its rhetorical effects by writing out in a larger script almost every one of<lb/>its distinctive words.<lb/>Textual variants. Allen and Sneff relegate to a footnote a discussion of tex-<lb/>tual variants that appear only in the Bridgham print and the Sussex Declaration<lb/>(PBSA, p. 398). In fact, the same readings also occur in the Franklin Print Company<lb/>facsimile, the last in the succession of Boston editions. They are all ordinary er-<lb/>rors although the spelling “paralelled” in the phrase “scarcely paralleled in the<lb/>most barbarous ages” might be justified by precedents in that period. Binns and<lb/>Tyler adopt a primarily British usage in the spelling “connexion,” which they<lb/>employ in the phrases “interrupt our connections” and “all political connection.”<lb/>This variant, not mentioned by Allen and Sneff, occurs in all of the Boston edi-<lb/>tions but not in the Sussex Declaration. That could be an argument in favor of<lb/>a direct relationship with the engrossed Declaration, although one could just as<lb/>easily surmise that the copyist opted for the “connection” spelling, which was also<lb/>prevalent in England in the 1830s. Perhaps more to the point, the variant spell-<lb/>ing “paralelled” in the Sussex Declaration becomes significant because it did not<lb/>originate in the Tyler facsimile but in the Bridgham facsimile. Bridgham’s artist<lb/>had to cope with the spelling “parallelled” in the Boston Bewick edition, an obvi-<lb/>ous mistake, but guessed wrong when he tried to fix it. The Sussex copyist did not<lb/>have any better ideas.<lb/>The sequence of signatures. For Allen and Sneff, the signatures are the<lb/>most important part of the Sussex Declaration. They perceive a pattern in the<lb/>signatures, a “hidden ordering principle” devised by the copyist in accordance<lb/>with James Wilson’s aspirations for a strong federal government (PBSA, p. 386).<lb/>That pattern breaks a precedent they detect in other government documents and<lb/>other Declarations, beginning with the engrossed parchment. There the signa-<lb/>tures are grouped by states (excepting that of Matthew Thornton, who signed)<lb/>it at a later date when there was no more room to put it in the proper place). The<lb/>state groupings are even more explicit in the “authenticated Copy” printed by<lb/>order of Congress in 1777 and some of the letterpress broadsides issued in the era<lb/>of Binns and Tyler. By changing the order of the signatures, they say, the Sussex<lb/>Declaration downgrades the prominence of the states and asserts the supreme<lb/>power of the central government prescribed by the Constitution. Wilson’s role in<lb/>framing the Constitution provides additional evidence for dating the manuscript.<lb/>If that date is valid, and if Wilson was involved, the Sussex Declaration would be<lb/>a bridge between the two great founding documents of the United States and a<lb/>means of explicating the political precepts behind them.<lb/>The “hidden ordering principle” is based on a cipher system used in en-<lb/>crypted correspondence during the Revolutionary War. Allen and Sneff con-<lb/>sulted with a codebreaking expert who confirmed that a system can be discerned<lb/>in the sequence of signatures. I will not try to describe it in detail except to say<lb/>
<pb n="120"/>that the copyist chose names from different columns in the engrossed Declaration, first concentrating on one column, then another, while interspersing the<lb/>names of the Georgia, Pennsylvania, and Delaware delegates to make it harder to crack the code. Nowhere do they explain why the code was predicated on<lb/>columns rather than some other ordering principle, an alphabetical system for example, or a geographical progression from state to state, which might at least<lb/>have some regional significance. Nowhere do they define the purpose of the code unless it was a means of randomizing the names while ensuring that none of them<lb/>would be omitted. One would expect a code to contain a confidential message in danger of falling into the wrong hands, but it is unclear what needed to be kept<lb/>secret on this occasion. The names were not protecting classified information.<lb/>Instead of making complications, it is better to look for precedents and similar examples, a simple comparison of layout techniques and production methods.<lb/>Design considerations often dictated the sequence of signatures. Allen and Sneff are not correct in saying that the Sussex Declaration was the only one to<lb/>interfere with the state groupings before the publication of the Bridgham print in 1836. The printers of the Boston Bewick facsimile rearranged the states to<lb/>save on space and make room for the oak and olive frame. A Philadelphia printer moved the signatures out of order in an 1832 broadside reconfigured in a<lb/>three-column format. After 1836 the signatures frequently appear in random order for no other reason than to fill an area predetermined by the decorative<lb/>apparatus and the proportions of the page. Just to take one example, an 1845 letterpress broadside starts out with the state groupings but then switches out the<lb/>signatures to rank them in a five-column format within a border of state seals. The printers disbanded the Maryland delegation and put each of the signatures in a<lb/>different column.15<lb/>Like others who made those design decisions, Bridgham’s artist sought to<lb/>achieve a harmonious balance between image and text, a pleasing composition<lb/>comprising the border of state seals, the calligraphic lettering, and the facsimile<lb/>signatures. The lettering above and the signatures below were aligned to form two<lb/>rectangular blocks, each even in weight, each fitting neatly inside the border.<lb/>The artist allowed a tendril to extend beyond the border to complete the last<lb/>line of text, a grace note following the phrase “our LIVES, our FORTUNES,<lb/>and our sacred HONOR.” Likewise, the signatures were spaced out to make the<lb/>line endings flush with the text, even though the emblematic John Hancock had<lb/>to be compressed, and some signatures lost their final flourishes. Signatures at<lb/>the beginning and the end of the last line retained their flourishes for a decorative tone.<note place="foot" n="15">15.

<tive purpose, both looping down to fill hollow portions of the border. The state<lb/>
groupings would have had no meaning in this graphic concept and would have<lb/>
prevented the artist from placing the signatures in an even array, although vestiges<lb/>
can be detected in sequences of Maryland, North Carolina, and New Jersey<lb/>
delegates. Symmetry was the top priority of the artist. By a simple computation,<lb/>
he found a way to accommodate the fifty-six signatures in a graphic construct<lb/>
composed of six columns and nine rows with the exception of the first and last<lb/>
columns, which have ten signatures instead of nine.<lb/>
Allen and Sneff argue against the priority of the Bridgham print on the grounds<lb/>
that the Sussex copyist could not have replicated its sequence of signatures. They<lb/>
believe that he would have had to backtrack between columns if he started the<lb/>
transcription process by reading across the rows. Diagrams in the PBSA article<lb/>
(pp. 401 and 402) intimate that he would have been confused by the extra names<lb/>
in the first and last columns and could not have dealt with them to arrive at the<lb/>
sequence in the Sussex Declaration. The transcription process does not seem all<lb/>
that difficult to me. The copyist proceeded through the six rows of names, one<lb/>
name after another left to right, allowing the first and last columns to be slightly<lb/>
staggered. He then inserted the two extra names, Roger Sherman and Elbridge<lb/>
Gerry, to restore the alignment between the inner and outer columns. Then he<lb/>
resumed the regular progression from left to right in the last three lines.<lb/>
Turning that argument around, I question why Bridgham’s artist would have<lb/>
replicated the sequence in the Sussex Declaration. Why would he use it as a starting<lb/>
point and then go off and consult some other source to turn those round hand<lb/>
names into facsimile signatures? In the manuscript, the names occupy six rows<lb/>
and then spill over to a seventh row containing a name and a half. What value<lb/>
would he have seen in that haphazard arrangement? He would have been much<lb/>
more interested in creating his own sequence to make a block of signatures in<lb/>
pleasing proportions. Let’s say he knew about the hidden ordering principle and<lb/>
wished to preserve it. But why would he be privy to the secret rather than anyone<lb/>
else in the Declaration business? There are too many loose ends and coincidences<lb/>
in this scenario. It is much more likely that he began with the Boston Bewick letterpress broadside, an easily adaptable model for the layout and decoration. He then reconceived it as an engraved miniature and decided on a symmetrical composition in accordance with the aesthetic of that genre. To achieve the “neatness” highly prized in that period, he changed the order of the signatures to fit them in a rectangular block, nine rows deep, six columns across. Neatness, uniformity and symmetry were his goals and the real reasons for rearranging the signatures.<lb/>
Misspelled signatures. Allen and Sneff note that the copyist misspelled<lb/>
some of the signatures. They cite eight problematic names, three of which might be excused as alternatives: Pinn for Penn, Rutlidge for Rutledge, Hayward for Heyward. A ninth could be added to their list, a garbled superscript in the signature of Samuel Huntington: Samu<lb/>
. for Samel. More egregious errors occur in four names: Floys for Floyd, Harnson for Harrison, Witherspoare for Witherspoon, and M. Keap for M: Kean. The PBSA article includes a series of thumbnail illustrations juxtaposing the Sussex Declaration versions with the signatures in the Stone facsimile, the best record of the originals in the engrossed Declaration. It is true that some of the originals are barely legible and that ignorant<lb/>

<pb n="122"/>
compositors got them wrong in books and broadsides even in the eighteenth<lb/>
century. Otherwise Allen and Sneff do not dwell on the Sussex misspellings and<lb/>
do not try to explain them except to observe that they are more likely to stem<lb/>
from manuscripts than printed matter.<lb/>
The facsimile signatures in Bridgham’s miniature Declaration were respon-<lb/>
sible for the spelling mistakes in the Sussex Declaration. The signatures were<lb/>
already corrupted in transmission when Bridgham’s artist copied them from the<lb/>
Boston Bewick broadside but were distorted even more when he cut them down<lb/>
to fit in his rectangular composition (figure 3). Tyler can be blamed for a cal-<lb/>
ligraphic lilt he gave to the d in Floyd, which was nudged downward in his print<lb/>
and tilted even more in the miniature. The copyist read it as an s followed by<lb/>
a flourish. Samuel Huntington customarily abbreviated his first name as Samel.<lb/>
with a flourished superscript, sometimes writing two identifiable letters but more<lb/>
often just a double loop. The Boston Bewick Company’s facsimilist closed the<lb/>
double loop or allowed it to be closed while making the transition from intaglio<lb/>
to letterpress. Bridgham’s artist read the altered superscript as a u instead of el, a<lb/>
good guess but wrong nonetheless as can be seen in other examples of that signa-<lb/>
ture before and after 1776. As far as the copyist was concerned, the superscript u<lb/>
was a legitimate abbreviation, an easy choice to make in comparison to the less<lb/>
legible names. The n in McKean, for example, was gradually twisted out of shape<lb/>
in the prints of Tyler, the Boston Bewick Company, and Bridgham, whose artist<lb/>
compressed and elongated it in such a way that the copyist opted for a p in the<lb/>
Sussex Declaration. Copying the c in Stockton, Bridgham’s artist made a slip of<lb/>
the pen interpreted by the copyist as a cursive r, that too a plausible assumption<lb/>
although Storkton is not a common name. The name Witherspoare is unknown<lb/>
to genealogists and that mistranscription can only be explained by Tyler’s deci-<lb/>
sion to make an a out of the second o in the original and tidy up the final flourish,<lb/>
which was coarsened and then retrenched in the Boston facsimiles. I could cite<lb/>
other errors, mostly faults of the writing master and the miniaturists.<lb/>
</p>
<p>
They were not the only ones to go astray in their attempts to transcribe<lb/>
the names. Printers of letterpress broadsides sometimes used facsimiles as their<lb/>
source documents with the best of intentions but with regrettable results. As<lb/>
one might expect, those farther removed from the original were more likely<lb/>
to make mistakes. A Philadelphia broadside published in 1855 repeats one of<lb/>
the names, misspells five of them, and gratuitously includes the Philadelphian<lb/>
Thomas Willing, who voted against the Declaration and did not sign the docu-<lb/>
ment. Lithographic artists encountered the same problems when they tried to<lb/>
make sense of the facsimile signatures. None of the Declarations I have seen to<lb/>
date is more delinquent in the spelling of the signatures than a lithographic map<lb/>
of New York City published ca. 1855 by Charles Magnus. A German immigrant,<lb/>
Magnus may not have been familiar with American proper names or with the<lb/>
English language, for he even had problems with the title, which commemorates<lb/>
the seventy-ninth year of “Indepedence.” The map is decorated with a view of<lb/>
City Hall, steamships in the harbor, and the Declaration in the usual border of<lb/>
state seals, the text in a uniform cursive, and the signatures in a “gothic” all caps<lb/>
sans serif script. Magnus or his artist used the Binns print or one of its derivatives<lb/>
as a model for the border and a source for the text, which contains the same<lb/>

<pb n="124"/>words emphasized in special scripts.<lb/>
The Binns signatures, however, mystified<lb/>
the lithographer who misspelled fourteen of the fifty-six names, mainly those that<lb/>
were hard to read. The New York lithographer committed mistakes not unlike<lb/>
those of the Sussex copyist: WITHERSPOART for Witherspoon, HOYG for<lb/>
Floyd, PINN for Penn, and M KEAN for M: Kean. Both had to contend with<lb/>
facsimile signatures, but even an immigrant poorly schooled in English was able<lb/>
to construe common names such as Harrison and Stockton.16</p>
<p>The copyist’s mistakes are easier to explain if they can be imputed to the illegibility of his source and his failure to find a remedy. Some delegates scrawled<lb/>
their signatures in such a way as to make them difficult to read even in a full-size<lb/>
facsimile. Bridgham’s miniature exacerbated the problem. Published sixty years<lb/>
after the fact, it was conceived as a novelty and was never intended to be an<lb/>
authoritative text, but it circulated widely and could easily come into the hands<lb/>
of someone whose notions of the American Revolution were more sentimental<lb/>
than scholarly. The copyist transcribed it by rote and relied on his imagination<lb/>
to interpret the parts he did not understand. He was unwilling or unable to find<lb/>
a better source for this display of penmanship and did not worry overmuch about<lb/>
the accuracy of his work.</p>
<p>Complications. A line of reasoning should follow the shortest distance<lb/>
between two points. That common-sense rule is a deciding factor for testing<lb/>
hypotheses in bibliographical investigations—or any field of intellectual inquiry.<lb/>
The complications in Allen and Sneff’s arguments undercut their claims for the<lb/>
priority of the Sussex Declaration. If it came first and served as a source for<lb/>
the Bridgham facsimile, we would have to believe that the Bostonians copied the<lb/>
same order of names while consulting another source to render them in facsimile.<lb/>
We would have to believe that they took the oversize words in that manuscript<lb/>
as cues to execute the same words in ornamental penmanship even though they<lb/>
had the Boston Bewick edition easily at hand and could use that as a model for<lb/>
the <hi>“emphatical words.”</hi> We would have to accept the hypothesis that the Sussex<lb/>
Declaration or a derivative manuscript influenced Tyler’s choice of <hi>“emphatical<lb/>
words”</hi> sometime around 1818 and then resurfaced eighteen years later to guide<lb/>
the work of the Bostonians. If we follow that line of reasoning, we would have to<lb/>
imagine that James Wilson was willing to overlook the atrocious spelling of the<lb/>
names even though he depended on them to affirm his position during the debates</p>

<p>We do not have to work so hard if we allow the Bridgham miniature to be the<lb/>
source of the Sussex Declaration. If we accept that hypothesis, we do not have<lb/>
to explain away the damage in the title, the errors in the text, the absence of the<lb/>
long s, and the profusion of misspelled names. We do not need a secret code to<lb/>
understand the reordering of the signatures. We are not obliged to excuse the<lb/>
poor quality of parchment, the marks of neglect, and the amateurish work of the<lb/>
copyist if he was engaged in a penmanship exercise rather than a “ceremonial”<lb/>
commission. We can even dispense with the provenance research if the manu-<lb/>
script came to the West Sussex Record Office by way of a local history collector<lb/>
who had only a tangential relationship with the Richmond family. At this point<lb/>
we can only guess where the collector obtained it, but we could consider the<lb/>
possibility that Bridgham brought copies of the miniature to England and that<lb/>
one of them piqued the curiosity of the copyist. After the novelty wore off, the<lb/>
parchment was folded up and filed away until it was retrieved by the collector.<lb/>
Speculation along those lines may be tempting but is not necessary to vouch for<lb/>
the priority of the miniature.<lb/>

<p>Allen and Sneff published their findings in a bibliographical journal and then<lb/>
used that publication as the premise for their account of the Constitutional Con-<lb/>

of the way so they can do what they do best, a study of James Wilson’s political<lb/>
philosophy. Allen is James Bryant Conant University Professor at Harvard Uni-<lb/>
versity, director of the Allen Lab for Democracy Renovation, and author of <hi>Our Declaration: A Reading of the Declaration of Independence in Defense of Equality (2014)</hi>.<lb/>
Sneff worked at the Declaration Resources Project before completing a doctor-<lb/>
ate in American history with an emphasis on material culture and history of the<lb/>
book. By no means are they the first to use bibliographical analysis as an avenue<lb/>
for research in other fields, but this approach has obstacles and limitations that<lb/>
can be overcome only by observing its rules and regulations. Every field has its<lb/>
own methodology and this one is no exception: a rigorous routine is needed to<lb/>
ensure the orderly analysis of texts produced in quantity.<lb/>
</p>
<p>Bibliographers have learned the hard way about the dangers of examining<lb/>
documents in isolation. High spots deserve extra effort, but it is not enough to<lb/>
focus on milestones of history, landmarks in philosophy, breakthroughs in sci-<lb/>
ence, and canonical works of literature. The context is important too if only<lb/>
as a gauge of value and a basis for comparison. In fact, Allen and Sneff do<lb/>
have a bibliographical context for their work. Along with the documentation<lb/>
about the Sussex manuscript, the Declaration Resources Project website offers<lb/>
a pdf catalogue of Declaration editions and manuscripts listing 747 items from<lb/>
1776 through 1826, plus an additional manuscript appended in June 2023. The<lb/>
catalogue tracks the dissemination of this text in different formats—books, peri-<lb/>
odicals, prints, and broadsides—a commendable attempt to be comprehensive.<lb/>
It helps, for example, to explain the patriotic mindset of the printmaker John<lb/>
Binns, who featured the text in his newspaper long before he produced the print.<lb/>
</p>
<pb n="126"/>
<p>It is, however, an enumerative bibliography with minimal descriptions mainly<lb/>
based on secondary sources. It covers only the first fifty years of the Declaration,<lb/>
not long enough to account for the surge of patriotic publications in the<lb/>
nineteenth century.17<lb/></p>
<p>If it had gone on for ten more years it would have brought Allen and Sneff<lb/>
up to the Bridgham miniature. But even then a brief listing of this kind would<lb/>
not show the facsimile’s relevance to their concerns or its relationship to the<lb/>
other Boston editions. Worthy in other ways, an enumerative bibliography is not<lb/>
intended to answer questions about form and content. It does not describe physical<lb/>
objects with the details that might disclose the influence of one artifact on<lb/>
another, the information that might reveal resemblances in production methods,<lb/>
textual elements, and stylistic motifs. To make their claims for the Sussex Declaration,<lb/>
Allen and Sneff looked hard for this kind of information but only looked<lb/>
in one place and did not consider the commercial context. The manuscript they<lb/>
found deserves bibliographical scrutiny, but if I am correct about its sources, it<lb/>
has nothing to do with James Wilson and the Constitution. Rather, it should be<lb/>
dated at least fifty years later, when someone copied Bridgham’s engraving in an<lb/>
attempt to emulate the engrossed Declaration. If not an entirely successful effort,<lb/>
it is an interesting byproduct of the trade in patriotic prints and a good example<lb/>
of a text entangled in transcriptions large and small.<lb/></p>

<p>A DOCUMENTARY HISTORY OF THE<lb/>UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA’S FIRST LIBRARY<lb/>AND ITS JEFFERSONIAN CATALOGS<lb/>by<lb/>Samuel V Samuel V.. Lemley, Neal D Lemley, Neal D.. Curtis, Curtis,<lb/>and Madeline Zehnder*<lb/></p>
<p>In 1984, a manuscript catalog of Thomas Jefferson’s library resurfaced at the Library of Congress.<lb/>The rediscovery was announced by Douglas L. Wilson,<lb/>who proposed that the catalog— dated 1823 —reestablished Jefferson’s system<lb/>of library organization, lost after a fair copy of Jefferson’s catalog disappeared<lb/>with the transfer of his library to Congress in 1815.<lb/>This 1823 manuscript filled<lb/>an archival void in Jefferson studies and advanced a new and enduring view<lb/>of Jefferson’s book collecting habits in the final decade of his life (1815-26).<lb/>In a subsequent analysis and edition of the rediscovered catalog, written with<lb/>James Gilreath, Wilson affirmed that the document in question was a copy of<lb/>Jefferson’s catalog drawn up to reestablish the arrangement of his books,<lb/>“in his own order.”1<lb/></p>
<p>Gilreath and Wilson’s account captures the first part of a complex story. In<lb/>this article, we offer an alternative analysis of the 1823 catalog. Drawing on new<lb/>materials, including another recently resurfaced Jeffersonian booklist, we argue<lb/>that the surviving textual, bibliographical, and provenance evidence repositions<lb/>the 1823 catalog as the originating document of the University of Virginia’s<lb/>library. Not only does the catalog reconstruct the arrangement of Jefferson’s<lb/></p>

See Gilreath,<lb/>“Sowerby Revirescent and Revised,” The Papers of the Bibliographical<lb/>Society of America 78, no. 2 (1984): 219–32. There, Gilreath observes<lb/>that “Wilson’s [forthcoming] article offers another document<lb/>which contains a strikingly different order for many chapters<lb/>[of Jefferson’s catalog]” (230).

<p>personal library at Monticello; it also lays out the epistemological and disciplinary categories that would shape the development and future growth of a major early American university.<lb/>
Indeed, scholars including Wilson and Endrina Tay have previously proposed a relationship between the university’s library and 1823 catalog, with Wilson noting that the catalog was intended “apparently for the University of Virginia.”<lb/>
By collating and examining all of the book lists and catalogs Jefferson took part in compiling from 1815 to 1826, we consider the textual imbrications and intricacies of this link, charting the 1823 catalog’s role in the compilation of later catalogs for the University of Virginia’s first library.</p>
<p>In addition to offering a fuller account of the 1823 manuscript’s origins and re-inscriptions, we also put forward an analysis of how Jefferson’s extant book lists from this period are textually related.<lb/>
Jefferson made (or had made) a large number of catalogs, bibliographic inventories, and lists of books over the course of his life, and the resulting variety of organizational schemata, artistic and intellectual disciplines, and content can stymie generalizing treatment.<lb/>
To chart the textual filiation of the catalogs we examine here, we construct an annotated stemma over the course of this article.<lb/>
What emerges is both a more comprehensive view of how the University of Virginia’s library came to be, and evidence of Jefferson’s attempts to construct and perpetuate a totalizing vision of knowledge-in-books across all of his library-building projects.</p>
<p>Origins: The 1783 Catalog &amp; the 1812 Fair Copy<lb/>
An inveterate, compulsive arranger of books, Jefferson began compiling what would become the catalog of his Monticello library sometime after a fire destroyed his first library at Shadwell in February, 1770.<lb/>
This catalog is traditionally labelled the 1783 catalog and lists books Jefferson acquired during his political career and in the first years of his retirement (1809–12).<lb/>
The date traditionally assigned to the catalog, 1783, refers to a manuscript tally of books in Jefferson’s hand, dated March 6, 1783, that appears on the catalog’s fifth</p>

<p>Riddled with what E. Millicent Sowerby describes as “erasures and semi-erasures,”<lb/>
the 1783 catalog was a working document that functioned as the primary reference tool and inventory of Jefferson’s library at least until 1812, when<lb/>
Jefferson made a fair copy of the catalog that would eventually accompany his<lb/>
books to Congress in 1815.7</p>

<p>Jefferson intended to have the 1812 catalog printed for reasons of both<lb/>
personal convenience and future preservation. Writing to Thomas Cooper on<lb/>
July 10, 1812, Jefferson refers to the fair copy: “I am making a fair copy of the<lb/>
Catalogue of my library, which I mean to have printed merely for the use of<lb/>
the library.”8 Jefferson’s portrayal of the 1812 catalog as “useful” may reflect<lb/>
his need for an easier-to-navigate alternative to the 1783 catalog, which by<lb/>
1812 was a confusing and palimpsestic document that listed books he no<lb/>
longer owned and omitted books he had since acquired. Jefferson’s desire to<lb/>
print the 1812 catalog—a remediation that would have enabled him to distribute<lb/>
copies to interested readers—also reveals his interest in the library’s posthumous<lb/>
existence and utility; at last, the collection that the 1812 catalog would describe<lb/>
was nearing a long-elusive stasis.</p>

<p>Tacit in Jefferson’s letter to Cooper is the fact that he had begun<lb/>
to view his collection of books as a coherent and relatively fixed whole,<lb/>
ready to enter the permanent record.</p>

<p>By the time Jefferson began work on the 1812 catalog, he had already envisioned<lb/>
an institutional future for his library. In a letter to Cooper, dated January<lb/>
16, 1814, Jefferson writes: “I have long had under contemplation, & been collecting<lb/>
materials for the plan of an university in Virginia.” Jefferson adds that this<lb/>
university (not yet the University of Virginia, but only an university in Virginia)<lb/>
might acquire his library “on their own terms,” thus securing a collection of<lb/>
“about 7. or 8 thousand volumes” and “the best … of it’s [sic] size probably in<lb/>
America.”9 Jefferson’s letter expresses a typical immodesty about his books, but<lb/>
it also indicates that he had come to anticipate the dispersal of his library—an<lb/>
act that would require a legible and comprehensive inventory of its contents.<lb/>
However, war intervened, and the destruction of Washington in 1814 by British<lb/>
troops precipitated the library’s sale to Congress in 1815.</p>

<p>In addition to the presumably improved functionality it offered, the 1812<lb/>
fair copy introduced a new organizational schema, superseding an earlier version<lb/>
that organized the 1783 catalog. In retirement, Jefferson continued to refine and<lb/>
modify the order of his shelves and the headings under which he classed his</p>

<p>books. While the 1783 catalog employed a forty-six-subject schema, the 1812 fair<lb/>
copy employed a forty-four-subject alternative. Both schemata, however, classed<lb/>
their subjects under Jefferson’s tripartite division of knowledge based on Francis<lb/>
Bacon’s three parts of learning: “History/Memory,” “Philosophy/Reason,” and<lb/>
“Fine Arts/Imagination.”</p>
<p>Although the 1812 fair copy is presumed lost, evidence for this schematic<lb/>
change survives in the printed catalog that then-Librarian of Congress George<lb/>
Watterston produced in 1815 following the sale of Jefferson’s books to Congress.<lb/>
According to his correspondence with Jefferson, Watterston based the new catalog’s<lb/>
arrangement of subject chapters on the 1812 fair copy, informing Jefferson in a letter<lb/>
dated October 13, 1815, that “I have preserved your arrangement, as one that I think<lb/>
excellent.” Watterston’s printed 1815 catalog thus shares its<lb/>
subject categories with its lost manuscript predecessor. This later catalog makes<lb/>
clear that the reduction of subject headings from 46 to 44 chapters was the result of<lb/>
shifting, compressing, and subdividing the original 1783 classifications. In all, the<lb/>
1812 and 1815 catalogs removed five chapters that appear in the 1783 catalog and<lb/>
added three more. Figure 1 maps the additions, deletions, expansions, and combinations<lb/>
of subject chapters that occur between the 1783 and 1812/15 schemata. As shown,<lb/>
most of the alterations occur in the final section of Jefferson’s tripartite scheme,<lb/>
“Fine Arts/Imagination.” While the motives behind these changes are undocumented<lb/>
and obscure, the alterations appear to subsume the most idiosyncratic chapters into<lb/>
more general categories, rendering the new schema more applicable and useful to<lb/>
an institutional collection of books; they might also have merely combined sparsely<lb/>
populated chapters to form more general categories containing more volumes, or<lb/>
divided overpopulated or thematically cluttered chapters into more manageable<lb/>
subchapters. Regardless, in adopting these alterations, Watterston deferred to<lb/>
Jefferson and emulated the 1812 fair copy in making the 1815 printed catalog.</p>
<p>There was one glaring difference between the 1812 and 1815 catalogs, however.<lb/>
As Watterston informed Jefferson, “I have introduced but one alteration &amp; that is in<lb/>
arrangeing [sic] each chap: alphabetically … it gives them a uniformity of appearance<lb/>
quite agreable [sic].”</p>

<head>After 1815: Gilreath &amp; Wilson Revisited</head>
<p>The rest, according to Gilreath and Wilson, is history: Watterston’s retaining the 1812 fair copy “has meant that the arrangement of individual books that was so important to Jefferson has been lost.”<lb/>
In other words, after the 1815 printed catalog imposed an alphabetical arrangement in place of Jefferson’s “chronological-analytical” system, the 1812 fair copy became the last surviving record of Jefferson’s intended ordering of his books. Taking this as its premise, Gilreath and Wilson’s <hi>Thomas Jefferson’s Library</hi> announced that<lb/>
<quote>the restoration of Jefferson’s order has been made possible by the rediscovery of a manuscript [in the Rare Books Division of the Library of Congress] that was commissioned and corrected by Jefferson for the purpose of reconstructing the original catalog order that had been obliterated in Watterston’s printed congressional catalog of 1815. For many years, [the rediscovered manuscript] was mistakenly labeled as a catalog of the library at the University of Virginia and may have been intended for its collections. Bound with the manuscript catalog, which was clearly not in Jefferson’s hand, was a copy of the 1815 printed catalog…. A close comparison of the manuscript and the 1815 printed catalog makes clear … that the two contain the same entries, though each is arranged in a different order.</quote>
Gilreath and Wilson go on to observe that the rediscovered manuscript was copied at Jefferson’s behest by Nicholas P. Trist in 1823, citing an exchange of letters between Trist and Jefferson in evidence of the circumstances of the manuscript’s origin.<lb/>
Since the publication of <hi>Thomas Jefferson’s Library</hi> in 1989, no one has significantly modified or revisited Gilreath and Wilson’s account, and their assessment of the provenance and production history of the 1823 catalog has remained</p>

<p>authoritative in the intervening decades.18<lb/>
Their case regarding the rediscovered catalog rests on three arguments. First, Gilreath and Wilson contend that the<lb/>
1823 catalog derived from a now‐lost annotated copy of the 1815 catalog, writing<lb/>
that Trist compiled the 1823 catalog after Jefferson sent Trist a copy of the 1815 printed catalog that he [Jefferson] had annotated to indicate his intended order for the books. Trist then compiled the manuscript catalog … and sent it,<lb/>
along with Jefferson’s annotated copy of the printed catalog, back to Jefferson when the job was completed. Though Jefferson’s marked 1815 printed catalog has not been found<lb/>
and is presumed lost, we now have the Trist manuscript copy that was precious to Jefferson because it reclaimed the results of an important undertaking that had nearly been<lb/>
lost—his painstaking and distinctive ordering of the books in his magnificent library.19<lb/>

Second, Gilreath and Wilson suggest that the primary motivation behind Trist’s<lb/>
manuscript was to “reconstruct” Jefferson’s “original” order erased by Watterston. Although they do not elaborate on its potential applications after Jefferson<lb/>
received it in late 1823, they do note that “[i]t is not surprising that Jefferson’s<lb/>
thoughts should have turned to book catalogs in 1823 since he was actively engaged in organizing the University of Virginia library.”20<lb/>
Third, they conclude that the Trist manuscript’s longstanding association with the University of Virginia was a “mistake,” allowing only that it “may have been intended for its<lb/>
collections.” In what follows we reevaluate these points in turn, beginning with<lb/>
the question of the copy text Trist used to create the manuscript catalog in 1823.<lb/>
New evidence suggests that Gilreath and Wilson’s pathbreaking scholarship tells<lb/>
only the first part of a fascinating narrative, one that ends with the formation of<lb/>
the University of Virginia’s first library and its installation on the shelves of the<lb/>
University’s Rotunda.<lb/>
</p>
<div type="footnotes">
<note n="18">The Library of Congress catalog entry for the Trist manuscript in question paraphrases Gilreath and Wilson, stating that “Trist apparently worked from a copy of the printed 1815 Library of Congress catalogue specially marked by Jefferson in order to restore, in place of its alphabetical arrangement of each subject category, the original order of entries that Jefferson preferred” (Thomas Jefferson and Nicholas Philip Trist “Catalogue” [1823], Manuscript / Mixed Material, Thomas Jefferson Collection, Rare Book and Special Collections Division, The Library of Congress, Washington, D.C., Z997.J48 J44 1823, https://www.loc.gov/item/87204942/).<lb/>
In similar terms, the Thomas Jefferson’s Libraries project at the International Center for Jefferson Studies at Monticello writes that “Jefferson commissioned Nicholas Philip Trist to recreate a list of the books sold to Congress in the order he had originally defined,” citing Gilreath and Wilson (“Trist Catalogue,” http://tjlibraries.monticello.org/tjandreading/trist.html, accessed April 7, 2021).<lb/>
Tay has recently noted that Trist’s 1823 manuscript served Jefferson as a reference list “as he began to plan the library collection for the University of Virginia,” though does not explore how these catalogs were textually linked or related. (“Forming the Body of a Library,” 221n32). We return to this point below.</note>

<p>Writing to Jefferson from Louisiana on October 18, 1823, Trist says: “I avail myself of<lb/>the first opportunity that offers to return your catalogue, the absence of which will have<lb/>proved, I fear, a greater inconvenience than can be compensated by the copy I have<lb/>made.” Jefferson replied on his eighty-first birthday, April 13, 1824: “The catalogues,<lb/>printed and ms. were safely received. The last has given you more trouble than I ought<lb/>to have subjected you to. It is very precious to me, and I am thankful to you for it.”21<lb/>Comparing the 1823 and 1815 catalogs reveals that their entries match exactly<lb/>(though in a different order), with no additions and only very few apparently ac-<lb/>cidental deletions. Accordingly, the Trist catalog could not have been produced<lb/>without a copy of the 1815 printed catalog on hand. But while Gilreath and Wil-<lb/>son interpret the “manuscript” catalog Jefferson cites here to be the manuscript<lb/>copy that Trist made (i.e., the 1823 Trist catalog), we believe that Jefferson instead<lb/>refers to his original 1783 manuscript catalog.</p>

<p>The manuscript catalog returned by Trist was, Jefferson writes, “precious to<lb/>me.” It is unlikely that a manuscript copy of a printed catalog Jefferson owned in<lb/>triplicate would qualify as precious, however significant its arrangement.22 The<lb/>1783 catalog, on the other hand, was indeed precious, given its long tenure as<lb/>Jefferson’s primary reference tool and bibliophilic companion at Monticello; this<lb/>catalog was the only remaining record of a cherished collection of books that<lb/>Jefferson no longer owned. Equally suggestive, Trist observes to Jefferson in his<lb/>letter of October 18 that he is returning “your catalogue” and worries apolo-<lb/>getically that its “absence” had inconvenienced his soon-to-be grandfather-in-<lb/>law.23 The 1783 catalog, a working document for Jefferson’s library at Monticello,<lb/>would have been closely associated in Trist’s mind with Jefferson himself (hence<lb/>“your catalogue”), while the absence of a single copy of the 1815 printed catalog<lb/>(which reproduced Watterston’s alphabetical method of organization rather than<lb/>Jefferson’s own) would not have inconvenienced Jefferson.</p>

<p>21. Gilreath and Wilson, Thomas Jefferson’s Library, 6.</p>
<p>22. Jefferson’s correspondence reveals that he owned at least three copies of the 1815<lb/>printed catalog. See his letter to George Watterston on March 2, 1816: “I received three copies<lb/>of the Catalogue from mr Millegan for which I thank you” (Founders Online, National Archives,<lb/>https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/03-09-02-0366). One of these copies was<lb/>bound with the blank leaves that would become the 1823 Trist catalog, a second was likely<lb/>retained, and a third was sent to Joseph C. Cabell with a letter from Jefferson in which he<lb/>complains about the 1815 catalog’s alphabetical reorganization (“Thomas Jefferson to<lb/>Joseph C. Cabell, 2 February 1816,” Founders Online, National Archives,<lb/>https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/03-09-02-0286).</p>

<p>bound 1783 catalog, lent to Trist as a copy text; and (2) an unannotated copy of<lb/>
the 1815 printed catalog that was eventually bound with Trist’s 1823 manuscript<lb/>
copy. Patterns of “foxing,” or oxidized impurities on the final leaf of the 1823<lb/>
Trist catalog have transferred to the facing title page of the 1815 printed catalog,<lb/>
and vice versa, suggesting that they were bound together early in their shared<lb/>
history. Tellingly, the text in the 1823 Trist catalog is occasionally trimmed away<lb/>
in the outer margin, demonstrating that it was bound after copying.24 While we<lb/>
have not been able to locate a record of payment for the binding of these two<lb/>
documents in Jefferson’s correspondence, memorandum books, or the Proctor’s<lb/>
Papers at the University of Virginia, they have long been paired. While this is<lb/>
not proof that the copy of the 1815 printed catalog bound with 1823 catalog was<lb/>
the same copy Trist used in copying out his manuscript, the suggestive implica-<lb/>
tions of the binding evidence and the resulting pairing of documents demand<lb/>
consideration.<lb/>
</p>
<p>More significant is the textual evidence that inheres in the catalogs them-<lb/>
nselves. Collating Jefferson’s 1783 catalog and the 1823 Trist catalog suggests<lb/>
that the Trist manuscript could have derived from the 1783 catalog and an<lb/>
unmarked copy of the 1815 printed catalog alone. Textual and formal idio-<lb/>
syncrasies shared by the 1783 catalog, the 1815 printed catalog, and the 1823<lb/>
Trist catalog suggests that the 1823 catalog derives from two sources, employing<lb/>
the <hi>sometimes chronological, sometimes analytical</hi> arrangement of the 1783<lb/>
catalog but transcribing the content and descriptive form of the entries as they<lb/>
appear in the 1815 printed catalog. For instance, the 1823 catalog frequently<lb/>
replicates Jefferson’s method of ordering entries in the 1783 catalog: the 1783<lb/>
catalog’s earliest entries were recorded on the verso of each leaf, so that later<lb/>
entries, rather than being interlined between existing entries, could be added to<lb/>
the facing recto at the appropriate point in Jefferson’s sequence. The 1823 Trist<lb/>
manuscript seems to follow this order at various points, transcribing books listed<lb/>
across two pages in the 1783 catalog in a single sequence. When entries faced<lb/>
each other across the verso-recto opening of the 1783 catalog with no apparent<lb/>
priority, the verso entry on the left usually took precedence and was listed first<lb/>
(see figs. 2a and 2b; fig. 3 shows the corresponding section of the 1823 Trist<lb/>
manuscript). Meanwhile, Trist seems to have occasionally corrected ambiguities<lb/>
or discrepancies in the verso-recto ordering of the 1783 catalog by following<lb/>
the shelf mark numbers that accompany the corresponding entries in the 1815<lb/>
printed catalog. For instance, Trist’s decision to list 33. Herodianius. Gr. Lat. Eng.<lb/>
2 v. 12° before 34. <hi>Biographia Classica</hi> 2 v. 12° in figure 3 was likely guided by<lb/>
the sequence of these shelf marks.<lb/>
</p>
<p>The 1783 catalog also contains annotations written in Jefferson’s hand that<lb/>
seem to have guided Trist’s enumerative work, particularly at points where the<lb/>
sequence of Jefferson’s entries is unclear. These annotations did not reflect changes<lb/>
introduced by new acquisitions: Jefferson’s verso-recto method of ordering entries<lb/>
limited the need for recopying, interlineation, and erasure when adding new titles<lb/>
24. See 13 verso in Thomas Jefferson and Nicholas Philip Trist, “Catalogue” [1823],<lb/>

<p>to the 1783 catalog.<sup>25</sup> Instead, this additional marginal numbering appears to have<lb/>
served an editorial purpose for an external reader—we believe for Trist. On the<lb/>
opening formed by pages 234 and 235 of the 1783 catalog, for instance, a series of<lb/>
<note n="25">Jefferson occasionally marked the point at which a book was to be inserted by indexing titles on the facing recto with a siglum, usually letter, and adding a labelled arrow at the appropriate point on the verso (see, for example, pages 104 and 105 of the 1783 catalog).</note>

<pb n="138"/>
<p>numerals from 1 to 41 is faintly penciled in the left margins. These numerals, all<lb/>
in Jefferson’s handwriting, assign a revised sequence to the books listed on these<lb/>
pages. Comparing the marginal numerals with the order of the corresponding entries in the Trist manuscript (found on 109 verso and 110 recto, Chapter 43, “Criticism, Languages”) reveals that Trist followed this later sequence in copying entries<lb/>
from the 1815 printed catalog. Another example of Jefferson’s marginal ordering<lb/>
guiding Trist’s own comes in Chapter 20, “Law Merchant.” In this brief chapter<lb/>
(comprising only ten titles), each entry in the 1783 catalog is accompanied by a<lb/>
numeral in the left margin, as above.26 While the 1815 printed catalog arranges<lb/>
the ten entries in this chapter alphabetically by author, Trist’s copy follows the<lb/>
order set out by Jefferson’s annotations in the 1783 catalog (see figs. 4a-b and 5a-b).27 In other words, while the entries in the 1823 Trist catalog follow the format,<lb/>
spelling, and syntax of those in the 1815 printed catalog (i.e., shelf number, author,<lb/>
title, volume count, format, date), they are arranged according to the sequence<lb/>
stipulated by these marginal ordinals found in the 1783 catalog.28</p>
<p>In addition to these marginal numerals, the 1783 catalog contains discursive<lb/>
notes in Jefferson’s handwriting, which may have served to augment or reiterate<lb/>
points made verbally to Trist during one of Trist’s stays at Monticello.29 These<lb/>
cryptic marginal and interlinear instructions are almost always expressed in brief<lb/>
imperatives, prescribing Jefferson’s desired arrangement of entries in the 1783<lb/>
catalog. One such note, on page 197 in Jefferson’s Chapter 24 on “Politics,” superscribes a list of eighteen books. The note reads, “this should follow Brady of boroughs.” Of these eighteen books, sixteen appear in the 1815 printed catalog. While<lb/>
Trist apparently failed to transcribe one of these sixteen—a copy of “Junius’s letters, 2.v. 12mo”—the remaining fifteen titles appear in Trist’s 1823 catalog after<lb/>
(as we might expect, and as Jefferson’s note stipulated) “Brady on Boroughs.”30 We<lb/>
might assume, for the sake of argument, that Jefferson’s instructions were meant<lb/>
to guide the arrangement of his lost 1812 catalog, a fair copy of the 1783 catalog.</p>
<p>26. An unnumbered eleventh title, “Cunningham’s Law of bills, 8vo” was not listed in the<lb/>
1815 printed catalog and so was not included by Trist in his 1823 manuscript copy.</p>
<p>27. Another series of marginal numbers in Jefferson’s hand appears on page 155 of the<lb/>
1783 catalog. These numbers order books listed in “Chapter 27, Geometry” according to a<lb/>
new sequence: Tacquet’s Euclid precedes Stone’s Euclid and Stone’s Euclid precedes Simpson’s.<lb/>
Eventually, at the bottom of the list, De Brahm’s tract on leveling tools is labeled “21.” Excepting the titles that do not appear in the 1815 catalog (and thus were not copied by Trist), Trist<lb/>
follows the order provided by these marginal numbers without deviation in preparing this section of the 1823 manuscript, again suggesting that Trist might have consulted these marginal<lb/>
annotations when arranging entries in his copy.</p>
<p>28. While Sowerby observed that changes in ordering made between the 1783 catalog<lb/>
and the 1812 fair copy “were not confined to the chapter arrangement, but apply also to the<lb/>
position of individual book entries,” she did not speculate on the purpose behind Jefferson’s<lb/>
revised ordering of the entries in some subject chapters. Instead, Sowerby silently amended the<lb/>
order of the entries to reflect Jefferson’s annotations. See Sowerby, “Foreword,” Catalogue of the<lb/>
Library of Thomas Jefferson, 4:8.</p>
<p>29. Trist and Jefferson’s correspondence confirms that Trist was at Monticello in 1817,<lb/>
1821, and 1823. It was likely during this final stay that Jefferson enlisted Trist’s help on the University’s library catalogs. See Heidi Hackford, “Nicholas Philip Trist,” Thomas Jefferson Encyclopedia, https://www.monticello.org/site/research-and-collections/nicholas-philip-trist.</p>

<pb n="141"/><p>In a note that appears on page 24, for instance, Jefferson bracketed off a section<lb/>of books, writing “to be inserted between the history of Italy, Spain, Portugal, and<lb/>France, and that of the northern nations of Europe.” While a number of the titles<lb/>in the bracketed section were excised (evidently rubbed out prior to Jefferson’s<lb/>annotation), Trist executed this marginal instruction in making up his copy: the<lb/>bracketed books appear between the histories of southern and northern Europe,<lb/>as specified. In a similar note on page 29A of the 1783 catalog, Jefferson wrote<lb/>that books on southern European subjects were to be arranged in the following<lb/>order, “General works, Italy, Rome, Florence, Naples, Venice, Spain, Portugal,<lb/>France.”31 Tellingly, Trist used this idiosyncratic geographical and national order<lb/>throughout the 1823 catalog when applicable, with books on Italian subjects preceding<lb/>titles on Spanish, Portuguese, and French subjects. A related note on page<lb/>31 of the 1783 catalog specifies the arrangement of books on Northern European<lb/>and non-European cultures. This arrangement proceeds from “general works,”<lb/>to works on Lapland, Russia, Poland, Hungary, Sweden, Denmark, Prussia, Germany,<lb/>Flanders, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Geneva, Turkey, Asia, and finally<lb/>Africa. This typical, if sometimes variable, progression from south to north, from<lb/>west to east, from general to particular, and from ancient to modern in Jefferson’s<lb/>historical chapters recurs in his literary and linguistic chapters and was often<lb/>adopted by Trist seemingly by default. With basic verbal or written instructions<lb/>from Jefferson, Trist would have been able to construct this geographical arrangement<lb/>unaided. No marked copy text would have been required to produce Trist’s<lb/>1823 entries that relate to these cultures, languages, or regions.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, there are many exceptions to the patterns and textual parallels we<lb/>describe here. Most entries in the 1783 catalog lack Jefferson’s clarifying<lb/>ordinal numbers or marginal comments, for instance. In these cases, Trist could<lb/>have departed from the verso-recto ordering of the 1783 catalog and instead<lb/>employed the order provided by Jefferson’s shelving numbers as they appear in<lb/>the 1815 printed catalog.32 As Gilreath and Wilson note, “the initial number as-<lb/>signed to each entry [in the 1815 catalog] refers not to its catalog order but to its<lb/>shelf position” on Jefferson’s shelves.33 Jefferson arranged books at Monticello by<lb/>size, and each chapter of the 1815 printed catalog numbers entries accordingly by<lb/>bibliographic format.34 In a way, then, an unannotated copy of the 1815 printed<lb/>catalog was already “annotated” with helpful ordinal guides. Trist could rely on<lb/>31. 1783 Catalog of Books, page 29A.<lb/>32. Watterston’s catalog records the shelf marks that Jefferson’s books bore upon arrival<lb/>at the Library of Congress. Judging by Jefferson’s 7 May 1815 letter to Watterston, the 1812<lb/>catalog also included shelving numbers: “on every book is a label, indicating the chapter of the<lb/>catalogue to which it belongs, and the order it holds among those of the same format. so that,<lb/>altho’ the Nos seem confused on the catalogue, they are consecutive on the volumes as they<lb/>stand on their shelves,” “Thomas Jefferson to George Watterston, 7 May 1815,” Founders Online,<lb/>National Archives, https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/03-08-02-0376.<lb/>33. Gilreath and Wilson, Thomas Jefferson’s Library, 7.<lb/>34. These shelving numbers, which precede each entry in the 1815 printed catalog and<lb/>are copied out by Trist in Trist’s 1823 manuscript, were devised and affixed to Jefferson’s books<lb/>during the production of the 1812 fair copy. The 1783 catalog only loosely reflects the order of<lb/>Jefferson’s shelves and none of the 1783 entries include shelf marks or numbers.</p>
<pb n="142"/>
<p>these printed shelving numbers to reconstruct Jefferson’s preferred order of books<lb/>
when other forms of guidance (e.g., Jefferson’s marginal numbering) were lacking.</p>
<p>Jefferson’s subject chapter on “<hi>Chemistry</hi>” shows how Trist might have occa-<lb/>
sionally relied on shelving numbers printed in the 1815 catalog when ordering the<lb/>
entries in his 1823 manuscript copy. In this chapter, the numbered series runs as<lb/>
follows: numbers 1–6 are duodecimos, numbers 7–29 are octavos, and number 30<lb/>
is a quarto. In copying the thirty titles that appear in this chapter from the 1815<lb/>
printed catalog, Trist first transcribed the entries for the chapter’s first (and only)<lb/>
quarto (“30. Neumann’s chemistry, by Lewis”), its first octavo (“7. McQueer’s<lb/>
chemistry”), and the chapter’s first duodecimo (“1. Dictionnaire de Chimie de<lb/>
Macquer’s”). In this case, Trist roughly followed the order of the 1783 catalog,<lb/>
which lists these three titles at the head of the chapter, likely due to their general-<lb/>
izing treatment of the subject. Following these three titles, however—perhaps due<lb/>
to the ambiguous arrangement of the remaining books in this chapter in the 1783<lb/>
catalog and the absence of Jefferson’s ordinal annotations—Trist deferred to the<lb/>
shelf marks in the 1815 printed catalog to order the entries in his 1823 copy (fig.<lb/>
6). The sole exception—the appearance of a duodecimo, “6. Jacob’s Chemical pocket<lb/>
companion,” among an uninterrupted sequence of octavos—is likely the result of<lb/>
Trist returning to the order of the 1783 catalog, which collocates “Jacob’s chemical<lb/>
pocket companion” and “Jacob’s experiments on Urinary and Intestinal Calculi”<lb/>
(an octavo).</p>

son’s shelving numbers recurs across the 1823 Trist catalog, and for good reason:<lb/>
if a sequence of titles of the same format was ambiguous in the 1783 catalog, Trist<lb/>
no doubt knew that transcribing them in the order in which they were shelved<lb/>
would (in most cases) preserve Jefferson’s chronological-analytical arrangement.<lb/>
While the examples detailed here do not fully account for the similarities and<lb/>
points of divergence between the 1783 catalog and Trist’s copy, they reveal much<lb/>
about how and why Jefferson enlisted Trist to compile the 1823 catalog. Not only<lb/>
do these notes and markings demonstrate that Jefferson undertook a final, belated<lb/>
revision of the 1783 catalog (most excisions, annotations, and additions dating<lb/>
from this period appear in slightly darker ink or pencil), they also show an appar-<lb/>
ent and complex dialogue between the 1823 Trist manuscript and the 1783 cata-<lb/>
log. This is a crucial point: it was a dialogue, and the 1823 Trist manuscript could<lb/>
have been produced by means of collation. This, we admit, is a radical argument,<lb/>
given that it removes some agency from Jefferson and grants agency to Trist. But<lb/>
to suggest that Trist played a sizable role in interpreting and converting the ar-<lb/>
rangement of Jefferson’s scheme as represented in the 1783 catalog in compiling<lb/>
his 1823 manuscript is far from baseless: during this period Jefferson was occupied<lb/>
with a variety of projects concerning the foundation of the university and himself<lb/>
acknowledged that his skill for library classification and recondite questions of<lb/>
epistemology had atrophied with time: in a letter sent to Augustus Elias Brevoort<lb/>
on 24 March 1824 Jefferson described changes he’d prefer to make to his original<lb/>
system of arranging books but concludes by remarking, “these are speculations in<lb/>
which I do not now permit myself to labour. [M]y mind unwillingly engages in<lb/>
severe investigations. [I]t’s energies indeed are no longer equal to them.”36<lb/>
If Jefferson’s notes in the 1783 catalog were not intended for Trist, for whom<lb/>
were they penned? While Jefferson may have intended them as notes to himself,<lb/>
perhaps to guide the completion of his lost 1812 fair copy, the consistency with<lb/>
which these instructions are executed in the 1823 Trist catalog suggests that they<lb/>
were written to aid Trist, with some of the arrangement left to Trist’s informed<lb/>
discretion. Another possibility, potentially coexistent, is that Trist had written in-<lb/>
structions from Jefferson in some form other than an annotated copy of the 1815<lb/>
printed catalog. These might have taken the form of a list of rules elaborating Jef-<lb/>
ferson’s “chronological-analytical” system, or notes that would have prescribed, at<lb/>
least in outline, how the entries in the 1815 printed catalog were to be reordered.<lb/>
Our interpretation of the evidence, rather than disproving or refuting Wilson<lb/>
and Gilreath’s argument, simply offers an alternative account that relies less on<lb/>
Jefferson’s direct involvement, more on Trist’s informed resourcefulness, and no-<lb/>
tably does not require the existence of a methodically annotated copy of the 1815<lb/>
printed catalog. This last point raises the crucial question: if such a copy text did<lb/>
exist, with ordinal numbers next to each entry in the 1815 printed catalog, why<lb/>
would Jefferson require Trist’s assistance? The task would have been reduced to<lb/>
mere copying, something that could be done relatively quickly and by anyone<lb/>
in Jefferson’s household possessing an abundance of patience and an even hand.<lb/>

<pb n="144"/>The epistolary record shows that Jefferson’s granddaughters worked regularly as<lb/>his amanuenses in 1823 and 1824.<lb/>But Trist was enlisted instead; and the project,<lb/>far from requiring days or weeks, was completed apparently over several months,<lb/>after Trist had left Monticello and taken his copy texts with him.<lb/>The timeline, as<lb/>well as Jefferson’s apologetic response to Trist seeking pardon for "the difficulty"<lb/>of the task, conspire to suggest that the textual history of the 1823 Trist catalog is<lb/>more complex than Gilreath and Wilson’s account allows.<lb/>It might be suggested<lb/>that Jefferson was here referring to the "difficulty" of Trist’s writing out the 114<lb/>pages of the 1823 catalog, but that ignores an alternate reading of Jefferson’s letter: the "difficulty" to which Jefferson "subjected" Trist was that of disentangling<lb/>his system of organization with recourse only to the 1783 catalog, its sporadic<lb/>notes and marginal instructions, and an unannotated 1815 printed catalog.<lb/>After recounting the evidence, our theory can now be laid out in full: our<lb/>account of the copy text(s) of the 1823 Trist catalog renders an annotated 1815<lb/>catalog unnecessary.<lb/>We might go even further: with only the 1783 catalog (and<lb/>its notes) and a copy of the 1815 catalog to hand, anyone well versed in Jefferson’s<lb/>shelving schema and his epistemological habits of thought could produce a document nearly equivalent in form and makeup to the Trist manuscript, though with<lb/>occasional variants resulting from ambiguities in the arrangement of entries in the<lb/>1783 catalog.<lb/>In Trist’s case, with the written instructions from Jefferson in the<lb/>1783 catalog and some verbal preparation—likely imparted while Trist was at<lb/>Monticello after June 1821, or when he began studying law with Jefferson at Monticello in spring of 1823—Jefferson’s desired order could have been reconstructed.<lb/>Where ambiguities arose or when a revised order was required, Jefferson’s<lb/>marginal instructions in the 1783 catalog guided Trist’s work; or alternatively,<lb/>Trist could fall back on his own knowledge of Jefferson’s "sometimes chronological, sometimes analytical" arrangement or the order of Jefferson’s shelving, as<lb/>recorded in the shelf mark numbers printed in the 1815 printed catalog.<lb/>Having introduced the first four catalogs relevant to our argument—the<lb/>1783 catalog, the 1812 fair copy, the 1815 printed catalog, and the 1823 Trist<lb/>catalog—we advance the pattern of filiation illustrated in the stemma in figure 7.<lb/>This stemma, and the bibliographical evidence enumerated above offer a new<lb/>textual account of the 1823 catalog, but leaves the reason for its production obscure: what was its purpose and the uses to which it was put?<lb/>Why would Jefferson want Trist to laboriously compile an eclectic catalog, reproducing the contents of the 1815 printed catalog and the arrangement of the annotated 1783 catalog,<lb/>as late as 1823?<lb/>Was it because Jefferson simply hoped to recover the extent and arrangement of his library before its sale to Congress in 1812?<lb/>Or was it because Jefferson was engaged in the most significant and demanding project he undertook in retirement: the formation and planning of the University of Virginia and its library?<lb/>Douglas Wilson allowed this point in his article announcing the rediscovery of the 1823 catalog.<lb/>Similarly, Endrina Tay has linked the 1823 Trist<lb/>catalog to Jefferson’s plan for the university’s library, noting that Trist’s copy was made "so that [ Jefferson] would have on hand a reference list of the books in his previous library ordered by subject as he began to plan the library collection for<lb/>37.

In the second half of this study, we present textual<lb/>

<head>The “Lost” 1824 Catalog</head>

<p>In September 1824, Francis Walker Gilmer, a young Virginian lawyer, ordered<lb/>
509 books for the University of Virginia from London bookseller John Henry<lb/>
Martin Bohn (1757–1843).40 The Board of Visitors had sent Gilmer to England<lb/>
to recruit the University’s first professors and to buy books “deemed indispens-<lb/>
able for a beginning.”41 But how did Gilmer know which books to buy? Although<lb/>
Jefferson had Trist’s 1823 catalog on hand several months before Gilmer’s de-<lb/>
parture, there is no evidence to suggest that Jefferson or the Board supplied<lb/>

Nearing the end of his time in London, Gilmer wrote to Jefferson to report that he had contracted with Bohn to supply the university’s first books, noting that he had “made out a catalogue of such as we must have, and have ordered the books & instruments, to be shipped as soon as possible” (“Francis Walker Gilmer to Thomas Jefferson, 15 September 1824,” Founders Online, National Archives, https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/98-01-02-4545).

The figure of 509 books is based on an examination of Bohn’s invoices, some of which survive in the Albert & Shirley Small Special Collections Library at the University of Virginia (UVA MSS 11848, 11902).

A list of books supplied to Gilmer by the University’s first professor of mathematics, Thomas Hewitt Key, and a list of Hebrew books, evidently supplied by the University’s first professor of Ancient Languages, George Long, survive in the Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library at the University of Virginia (UVA MSS 106).<lb/></note>

Instead, it seems they stipulated little and left much to Gilmer’s discretion.42<lb/>Gilmer’s acquisition of the university’s first books should not suggest that the university’s library was formed without Jefferson’s direction.<lb/>Far from it; surviving correspondence reveals that while Gilmer was shopping in London’s book-selling districts, Jefferson was at work on yet another list of books, this one meant to be a full and final enumeration of the university’s inchoate and still largely theoretical library.<lb/>This 1824 catalog was aspirational rather than descriptive, insofar as it listed books Jefferson hoped the university would acquire to fill the Rotunda’s yet-unbuilt shelves.<lb/>It was, in other words, a list of desiderata—a list of books to buy, rather than books already obtained.<lb/>It had been long assumed that this Jeffersonian 1824 catalog was lost in a fire that gutted the University of Virginia’s Rotunda and destroyed many of its books in October 1895.43<lb/>However, a leaf apparently removed from the 1824 catalog’s front matter was recently rediscovered in the Rare Book Division of the Library of Congress.44<lb/>This rediscovered leaf shows that Jefferson’s 1824 catalog and the books it enumerates were divided into 42 subject classifications, a modified version of Jefferson’s schema used to arrange his books at Monticello (see fig. 8).<lb/>Jefferson’s correspondence indicates that he enlisted the help of friends and acquaintances in supplementing subject classifications that treated disciplines unfamiliar to him.<lb/>Yet as the catalog’s unique subject categories show, the bulk of the 1824 catalog was likely Jefferson’s work alone.<lb/>In a letter to James Madison written on August 8, 1824, Jefferson reports beginning his new list: <hi>“I have undertaken to make out a catalogue of books for our library, being encouraged to it by the possession of a collection of excellent catalogues, and knowing no one, capable, to whom we could refer the task.”</hi><lb/>This “collection of excellent catalogues” presumably…</p>

<p>42. The possibility that Gilmer took the 1823 Trist catalog (completed in October, 1823, and received by Jefferson in time to be advanced to Gilmer before his departure for London) or a copy of the 1815 printed catalog is easily disproved: of the 509 known titles shipped to the University by Bohn, only a few are listed in the 1815 printed catalog (and thus in the Trist 1823 catalog). In many cases, Gilmer’s stamp on the collection is clear; for instance, Gilmer ordered a near complete set of Leonard Euler’s works on optics and mechanics—ten titles in all—none of which Jefferson had owned, and none of which are listed in Trist’s 1823 manuscript. If the 1823 Trist catalog had served as an enumerative desiderata in ordering books from Bohn, there is little evidence for it.</p>
<p>43. This “lost” catalog was first described by University librarian Frederick Winslow Page in an article published in September, 1895—a month before the fire. In this article, Page characterized the catalog as “a manuscript volume, without date, but evidently prepared by [Jefferson] between the years 1820 and 1825, which [Jefferson] styles ‘A Catalogue of Books Forming the Body of a Library for the University of Virginia,’ prefaced by an explanation of the views on which it is based, and by his classification into forty-two chapters, embracing 6,860 volumes.” See F. W. Page, “Our Library,” The Alumni Bulletin of the University of Virginia 2, no. 2 (1895): 78–85.</p>

<p>included booksellers’ catalogs Jefferson had acquired in the past or recently so-<lb/>
licited, but his preferences and experience in forming libraries over the course of<lb/>
his life would also have exerted a governing influence; Jefferson’s existing library<lb/>
catalogs were his likeliest and most reliable source in creating the 1824 catalog.<lb/>
Indeed, a catalog of the University of Virginia’s library printed in 1828 (that is,<lb/>
after Jefferson’s death and after most of the books listed in the lost 1824 catalog<lb/>
had been ordered, delivered, and installed in the Rotunda) lists a collection of just<lb/>
over 3,400 titles in 8,000 volumes.46 Of these titles, a majority are listed in the<lb/>
1823 Trist catalog—the catalog most recently commissioned by Jefferson when<lb/>
he began his desiderata list in 1824.<lb/>
The simplest explanation for this coincidence of entries is that Jefferson em-<lb/>
ployed the 1823 Trist catalog as a base-text in compiling the 1824 catalog. And<lb/>
as such, the 1823 Trist catalog was not an attempt at reconstituting Jefferson’s<lb/>
“lost” ordering of his books; or at least not only. While it did reorder the entries<lb/>
in the 1815 printed catalog according to Jefferson’s “chronological-analytical”<lb/>
arrangement, it also provided a baseline enumeration of the titles and editions<lb/>
intended to fill the Rotunda’s shelves. In the next section, we examine two cata-<lb/>
logs subsequent to Jefferson’s 1824 desiderata to show that the evidence for a<lb/>
filiation linking the 1823 Trist catalog and the lost 1824 catalog is textual, rather<lb/>
than merely circumstantial. We contend that the 1823 Trist catalog was the<lb/>
textual foundation of the University of Virginia’s first library and was compiled<lb/>
and commissioned with the impending creation of the 1824 catalog in mind.47<lb/>
More precisely, we suggest that the primary purpose of Trist’s 1823 catalog was<lb/>
one of expedience. In planning the university’s library, Jefferson required a full<lb/>
and clear record of his own library at its greatest extent—that is, immediately<lb/>
before it was sold to Congress in 1814 —but arranged in a manner that was<lb/>
familiar to him.</p>
<p>46. The University of Virginia Library published a facsimile reproduction of this catalog<lb/>
in 1945. See University of Virginia Library and William Peden, <hi>1828 Catalogue of the Library of the University of Virginia: Reproduced in Facsimile with an Introduction by William Harwood Peden</hi>, University of Virginia Bibliographical Series (Charlottesville: Printed for the Alderman Library of the University of Virginia, 1945).</p>
<p>47. While Jefferson’s so-called “retirement library” catalog may have served as another<lb/>
copy text, the extent and topical range of Jefferson’s 1783 catalog was a better model for the<lb/>
University of Virginia’s first library. In contrast, Jefferson viewed the retirement library as “a<lb/>
collection for my self of such as may amuse my hours of reading” (Thomas Jefferson to David<lb/>
Bailie Warden, 27 February 1815, polygraph copy in Thomas Jefferson Papers, Library of<lb/>
Congress, https://www.loc.gov/item/mtjbib021010/). The retirement library also comprised<lb/>
only 1600 volumes, many of which also appear in the 1783 catalog. We exclude the retirement<lb/>
catalog from our stemma, as it is textually unrelated to the seven catalogs and lists we examine<lb/>
here. The books that formed this “retirement” library were, however, willed to the University<lb/>
after Jefferson’s death. In advance of the transfer of these books to the University, titles that<lb/>
were already held in the Rotunda were marked with an “L” in Jefferson’s retirement catalog.<lb/>
These were presumably withheld from the bequest to avoid duplication on the Rotunda’s<lb/>
shelves. The Thomas Jefferson’s Libraries project has published a detailed account of the retire-<lb/>
ment catalog’s origins and compilation. See <hi>“Retirement Library Catalogue,”</hi> Thomas Jefferson’s Libraries, http://tjlibraries.monticello.org/tjandreading/retirement.html.</p>

  <head>The 1825 John Vaughn Kean Catalog & Jefferson’s Last Booklist: The University of Virginia’s First Books Arrive in Charlottesville</head>
  <p>As Gilmer’s order of books began to arrive in crates from London and Europe,<lb/>
a catalog was required to make the new library useful to students and faculty in<lb/>
the fledgling university.48 This first catalog, extant in the Albert & Shirley Small<lb/>
Special Collections Library at UVA, is what is known as a holdings catalog, in<lb/>
that it describes a collection of books on shelves, in contrast to the aspirational list<lb/>
Jefferson was then at work compiling. It is a small manuscript booklet prepared<lb/>
by the university’s first librarian, a recently enrolled undergraduate named John<lb/>
Vaughn Kean.49 Inscribed on the catalog’s improvised title page is “May 16th<lb/>
1825,” presumably the day on which Kean finished the catalog.50</p>
  <p>Kean’s catalog is the product of a meticulous amateur. It is crudely bound<lb/>
with multiple gatherings chain-stitched together and covered in gray pulp paper.<lb/>
On the recto of its first leaf, Kean inscribed a provisional title—“A catalog of the<lb/>
Library of the University of Va.”—and below this, added his name three times<lb/>
in a flourishing script. Despite the homespun quality of Kean’s catalog, its front-<lb/>
matter demonstrates a working familiarity with Jefferson’s bibliographical habits<lb/>
and system of library organization. For example, after providing an itemized<lb/>
account of the library’s holdings by format (“168 folios, 388 4tos, 1609 8vos ...”)<lb/>
Kean drew a table of classifications comprising 42 subject chapters (<hi rend="italic">fig. 9</hi>).<lb/>

<p>Jefferson’s earlier catalogs—including the 1783 catalog and his “retirement library” catalog (see footnote 48)—arrange their respective schemata in a dendritic, horizontal pattern that forms a series of interlinked and branching lines that terminate in the names of individual subject chapters (fig. 10).<lb/>
Kean’s catalog, by contrast, follows the unique columnar format found on the rediscovered leaf of the 1824 catalog with no apparent deviation. However, the most striking visual resemblance between Kean’s diagram and Jefferson’s 1824 original is the position and appearance of the final subject chapter’s title, “42. Polygraphical.”<lb/>
This chapter, which Jefferson devised to contain books that address all or several intellectual “faculties promiscuously,” held books on hybrid or various subjects.<sup>51</sup><lb/>
Because of its varied makeup, this final chapter is classed across all three of Jefferson’s Baconian faculties, involving “Reason,” “Memory,” and “Imagination.”<lb/>
In both Kean’s copy and on the rediscovered leaf of Jefferson’s 1824 catalog, this chapter stretches across the tables’ five columns, indicating its variety of subjects, languages, and disciplines.<lb/>
Similarly, both Kean’s diagram and Jefferson’s 1824 table assign the name “Technics” to chapter 14, a subject classification which Jefferson elsewhere termed “Technical Arts.”<sup>52</sup><lb/>
While Jefferson’s so-called retirement library also assigned the name “Technics” to its eighth subject chapter, the retirement library comprised fewer chapters (33), and never employed the 42-chapter, columnar schema in use at the University of Virginia and represented in Kean’s 1825 catalog and on the rediscovered 1824 leaf.<sup>53</sup><lb/>
Jefferson’s 1824 catalog and its 42-chapter table of subject classifications thus offered Kean a model in preparing his own catalog.<lb/>
Whether Kean was solely responsible for arranging the university’s first books in these 42 chapters is doubtful, however; it is more likely that Jefferson somehow indicated their place in Kean’s list by marking their respective classifications in the 1824 catalog before sending it to Kean, or by annotating another list that no longer survives.<sup>54</sup><lb/>
Without such a guide, the chronological-analytical way in which Jefferson ordered books within the chapters of the 1824 catalog would have been inscrutable to Kean, who (unlike Trist) was unversed in Jefferson’s system.<lb/>
It is safe to assume, then, that the catalog “made for” Kean and referenced in Kean’s 22 April letter provided some welcome guidance—much like, for instance, Jefferson’s annota-</p>
<p>51. Volume 7: Jefferson’s Second Library, 1829, Manuscript/Mixed Material, Library of Congress; leaf 2 recto. https://www.loc.gov/item/mtjbib026579/.<lb/>
52. In the 1783 catalog and the 1815 printed catalog, this subject appears as “Technical Arts” and is assigned to Chapter 15.<lb/>
53. A manuscript diagram of the schema used by Jefferson to organize his retirement library survives at the Library of Congress: Volume 7: Jefferson’s Second Library (see note 52). The revised terminology (from “Technical Arts” to “Technics”) is also evidence of the LoC leaf’s late composition, as Jefferson apparently only began to use the term “Technics” in retirement and after the sale of his Monticello library to Congress in 1815.<lb/>
54. It is probable that Jefferson added entries for books ordered by Gilmer to the 1824 catalog after receiving Gilmer’s invoices or report. While the 1824 catalog mainly listed books that were on order and not yet received, it would in time become a complete record of the University’s library. Presumably, Gilmer had ordered books that Jefferson never owned, and therefore were not listed in the 1823 Trist catalog that formed the basis of the lost 1824 catalog. Kean could have consulted these added entries, arranged in their appointed subject chapters, in determining how to shelve and classify books shipped from Bohn. While some itemized invoices from Bohn, apparently incomplete, survive in the Albert & Shirley Small Special Collections Library (MSS 11902), no full enumeration of Gilmer’s order placed with Bohn survives.</p>

<t>tions to the 1783 catalog had done for Trist. (In a June 19, 1825 letter, Kean goes<lb/>
so far as to invite Jeffersons help arranging the universitys first books in their<lb/>
subject classes. Kean adds that <hi>Dr. Blaetterman</hi> has commenced &amp; will complete it, if Jefferson is unable to do the arranging himself.55) Ultimately, though,<lb/>
the question of who was responsible for categorizing the universitys books into<lb/>
the 42 chapters of Keans catalog is immaterial. Comparing the rediscovered<lb/>
leaf of the 1824 catalog and Keans carefully copied table of classifications makes<lb/>
clear that Keans catalog derived from Jeffersons lost 1824 catalog.<lb/>
The occasion for creating the 1825 Kean catalog has already been stated: with<lb/>
Jeffersons lost 1824 catalog to guide him, Kean listed the books that made up<lb/>
Gilmers order from Bohn and arranged them in their appointed places according<lb/>
to the 42-chapter system devised by Jefferson—a task completed presumably when<lb/>
Kean dated the catalogs cover on 16 May 1825.56 But Keans catalog had another<lb/>
purpose besides. As Jefferson finished work on his 1824 desiderata— copying from<lb/>
the 1823 Trist catalog and consulting his correspondence with friends, his retirement<lb/>
library catalog, and his collection of booksellers lists—he encountered a<lb/>
problem that only Kean and his catalog could solve. Because Gilmer had acquired<lb/>
most of the universitys first books without consulting any of Jeffersons evolving<lb/>
booklists, Jefferson needed to ensure that duplicate titles werent ordered from<lb/>
the universitys newly appointed bookseller, Cummings &amp; Hilliard of Boston.57<lb/>
In other words, Jefferson needed Keans catalog to determine which books in the<lb/>
1824 catalog had been ordered and would need to be omitted from a final list.<lb/>
Jefferson had reason to hurry. By July 14, 1824, William Hilliard had written<lb/>
offering to supply your University with such Books as may be wanted for Your<lb/>
course of studies.58 Jefferson replied on September 6, 1824, expressing his interest<lb/>

shipment of books was part of a subsequent order of books placed with Boston booksellers,<lb/>
Cummings &amp; Hilliard, described below.<lb/>
56. In a January 20, 1825, letter to Gilmer, Jefferson remarks, Our books &amp;c (8. boxes)<lb/>
are arrived. I have had the covers of the boxes taken off to admit dry air, but we cannot take<lb/>
them out for want of the catalogue; because if we do not assort them under their proper heads<lb/>
of arrangement when first taken out, it would be infinitely difficult afterwards. will you be so<lb/>
good as to send me the catalogue by return of mail, for I think they are suffering from damp<lb/>
(Thomas Jefferson to Francis Walker Gilmer, 20 January 1825, Founders Online, National<lb/>
Archives, https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/98-01-02-4890). Evidently, no<lb/>
such catalog existed, nor was one forthcoming. This necessitated John Vaughn Keans catalog<lb/>
listing this first shipment of books. Keans catalog also contains entries for books sent by<lb/>
Bohns successor as the Universitys bookseller, Cummings &amp; Hilliard of Boston. Most of these<lb/>
later arrivals are classed in a subsection of Keans catalog labeled, supplementary catalog;<lb/>

<p><pb n="154"/>and assent but enclosing no catalog. This means that from September 1824 Hilliard was awaiting Jefferson’s itemized order in Boston. While Hilliard had enclosed<lb/>
<hi>“a Catalogue of a small part of my recent importations”</hi> with his 14 July letter, he<lb/>
left the decision to Jefferson, whose reputation for discernment in books and libraries no doubt preceded his reply. “[W]hether you should select from this [catalog],”<lb/>
Hilliard wrote, “or give orders for the importation of others, you may depend upon<lb/>
the prompt & faithful execution of such orders, & upon the lowest terms.”59<lb/>
What list did Jefferson send to Hilliard? Given that the lost pages of the<lb/>
1824 catalog listed all the books Jefferson hoped to acquire for the university’s<lb/>
library, it was useless as a list of desiderata by January 1825 when Bohn’s 509<lb/>
books began to arrive in Charlottesville. As we note above, if Jefferson had sent<lb/>
the 1824 catalog (or a copy) to Cummings & Hilliard without first omitting these<lb/>
titles ordered in London, the Rotunda’s shelves would have held duplicates, redundancies, or conflicting editions—an embarrassing outcome and a waste of<lb/>
the funds that had been set aside for the purchase of the university’s books. To<lb/>
complete the order with Cummings & Hilliard, then, Jefferson had to create yet<lb/>
another list of desiderata, enumerating all of the titles in his 1824 catalog, but<lb/>
omitting books ordered from Bohn and listed in Kean’s catalog. This second list<lb/>
of desiderata survives in the Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library<lb/>
at the University of Virginia.<lb/>
This list of desiderata, the 1825 Trist catalog, would be the last booklist<lb/>
that Jefferson took part in compiling before his death in July 1826.60 Like the<lb/>
1823 Trist catalog before it, the 1825 Trist catalog was penned under Jefferson’s<lb/>
direction by Nicholas P. Trist, who by then was well versed in the organizational<lb/>
and bibliographic minutiae of the university’s first library. Demonstrating the<lb/>
commercial function of this catalog, at the foot of its last page is a brief note in<lb/>
Jefferson’s handwriting explaining that, “the preceding catalogue is that of the<lb/>
books with the purchase of which Mr. Wm. Hilliard is charged on behalf of the<lb/>
University of Virginia.” The note is signed, “Th[omas] Jefferson Rector” and<lb/>
dated June 3, 1825. The 1825 Trist catalog was sent to Cummings & Hilliard;<lb/>
William Hilliard acknowledged its receipt in a letter dated 22 June, and books<lb/>
began to arrive from Boston and Europe shortly thereafter.61<lb/>
An examination of the 3,113 entries (numbered sequentially in red ink by<lb/>
Hilliard) of the 1825 Trist catalog reveals that it systematically excludes books<lb/>
that appear in Kean’s catalog while replicating many of the entries that appear<lb/>
in Trist’s 1823 catalog. It can be inferred that these replicated entries also appeared in the lost 1824 catalog, which was almost certainly Jefferson’s and Trist’s<lb/>
copy text in compiling the 1825 desiderata for Cummings & Hilliard. This textual<lb/>

<p>evidence spans four booklists (only three of which survive) and confirms that all<lb/>
of the catalogs we examine in this study share a filiation. Namely, the 1825 Trist<lb/>
catalog is an eclectic text, comprising the entries in Jefferson’s lost 1824 list (itself<lb/>
an expanded and revised copy of the Trist 1823 catalog), but omitting books that<lb/>
had been ordered from Bohn by Gilmer and listed in Kean’s 1825 catalog.<sup>62</sup> Evidence for this filiation via selective recopying and methodical omission abounds.<lb/>
Figures 11 and 12 collate corresponding entries in the second subject chapter.<lb/>
The theorized pattern of hybrid and selective copying that produced the 1825 Trist<lb/>
catalog can be expressed formulaically. That is, if n = the contents of the 1825 Trist catalog,<lb/>
i = the contents of the lost 1824 catalog, and z = the contents of the 1825 John Vaughn Kean<lb/>
catalog, then n = i – z.</p>

<p>“<hi>Modern History, Foreign</hi>” of the 1823 and 1825 Trist catalogs. These respec-<lb/>
tive sections list many of the same books in approximately the same order; and<lb/>
the arrangement of the entries’ content—title, format, and occasionally volume<lb/>
count—is roughly equivalent. The sole difference is the removal of Weeks’<lb/>
<hi>Introduction to Chronology</hi>, a 12mo, from the 1825 list. The simplest explanation for<lb/>
these points of similarity is that the 1823 and 1825 Trist documents share a textual<lb/>
filiation, with Jefferson’s lost 1824 desiderata occupying the intermediary place.<lb/>
<lb/>
The first entries in Jefferson’s chapter on British History offer more evidence<lb/>
(figs. 13 and 14). Here again, the order of the entries in the 1823 Trist catalog<lb/>
is replicated in the 1825 Trist catalog—a copy of the <hi>Domesday book</hi> opens<lb/>
the chapter, followed by Camden’s <hi>Britannia</hi> (the later list omits the Latin edi-<lb/>
tion that appears in the 1823 Trist catalog, preferring Gibson’s English transla-<lb/>
tion), and ending with Sheringham’s <hi>De Anglorum Gentis Origine</hi> [On the Origin of<lb/>
the English People]. There are discrepancies, however. To the later list, Jefferson<lb/>
added Thomas Hearne’s edition of Leland’s <hi>Itinerary and Collectanea</hi> and omitted<lb/>
Verstegan’s <hi>Antiquities</hi>. In the second case, the reasoning behind Jefferson’s omission<lb/>
is clear: a copy of Verstegan’s book is listed in the 1825 John Vaughn Kean catalog,<lb/>
ordered from Bohn by Gilmer and delivered the year before. Listing it again in the later<lb/>
catalog would have authorized Cummings &amp; Hilliard to purchase a duplicate copy. The<lb/>
addition of the two titles by Leland demonstrates another category of revision undertaken<lb/>
by Jefferson as he prepared the university’s first library—that is, the addition of titles never<lb/>
owned by Jefferson and therefore not listed in the 1823 Trist catalog. This evidence of<lb/>
addition and omission encapsulates Jefferson’s scribal method in compiling the lost 1824<lb/>
catalog, which sits between the 1823 and 1825 Trist catalogs, both chronologically and<lb/>
textually. Working with Trist’s 1823 catalog as a basis-text, Jefferson copied out a more<lb/>
complete collection in the 1824 catalog, adding titles or modifying editions to update his<lb/>
library for a modern university and its students. Trist then copied this fuller list, omitting<lb/>
titles in Kean’s 1825 catalog, to form the final 1825 catalog sent to Cummings &amp; Hilliard.<lb/>
<lb/>
Perhaps the strongest evidence for the 1825 Trist catalog’s systematic omis-<lb/>
sion of books ordered from Bohn and listed in Kean’s catalog appears in its final<lb/>
chapter. The last chapter of the 1823 Trist catalog, “<hi rend="italic">Polygraphical</hi>,” lists copies<lb/>
of Bacon’s <hi>Works</hi> and <hi>Advancement of Learning</hi> followed by copies of Locke’s <hi>Works</hi> and <hi>Familiar Letters</hi> (Locke’s <hi>Posthumous Works</hi> and “a collection of his pieces” are<lb/>
nested below these titles, with a parenthetical note indicating that they appear “in op.”: in<lb/>
operibus, or in the multivolume Works) (fig. 15). After Locke appears Milton’s <hi>Prose Works</hi> in two volumes and a copy of King James’s <hi>Works</hi>. Collat-<lb/>
ing this section of the 1823 Trist catalog with the corresponding section of the<lb/>
1825 Trist catalog, however, reveals that Jefferson ordered no works by Locke<lb/>
or Bacon from Cummings &amp; Hilliard. Instead, in the 1825 Trist catalog Milton’s<lb/>
<hi>Prose Works</hi> and King James’s <hi>Works</hi> follow Cassiodori <hi>Op[era]. Omn[ia].</hi>, with no<lb/>
intervening entries (the omission of Andrew Dalzel’s two <hi>Collectanea</hi>, listed above<lb/>
Bacon’s <hi>Works</hi> in the 1823 Trist catalog, is due apparently to Jefferson’s decision<lb/>
not to acquire it for the university’s library) (fig. 16). This would have amounted<lb/>
to a significant oversight: Jefferson revered both Bacon and Locke—indeed,<lb/>

<p>none of his libraries or booklists were without their works.<lb/> But this was not a lapse in Jefferson’s usual preferences; rather, Gilmer had ordered multi-volume editions of both Bacon’s and Locke’s <hi>Works</hi> from Bohn, both of which were duly listed in the 1825 Kean catalog after their arrival in Charlottesville (fig. 17).<lb/> Including entries for either Bacon or Locke in the 1825 Trist catalog would have resulted in the purchase of duplicates of both authors.<lb/></p>
<p>There are exceptions to the patterns of copying and omission that govern our proposed filiation between both Trist catalogs, Jefferson’s lost 1824 catalog, and the 1825 Kean catalog.<lb/> For example, the 1825 Trist catalog includes an entry<lb/></p>

<lb/>
researching and ordering later editions or new titles on familiar subjects, we cannot know the full extent of the revisions Jefferson made without the 1824 catalog on hand.65<lb/>
As with any comparatively complex textual genealogy involving multiple copy texts—some of which, in this case, remain unknown (Jefferson’s “excellent catalogues”), or are lost—the evidence supports interpretation, not demonstrable proof.<lb/>
Nevertheless, the common textual evidence across these catalogs supports a line of textual descent moving from the 1823 Trist catalog, through the 1825 Kean catalog, and into the 1825 Trist catalog—indicating, in other words, that the 1823 Trist catalog was compiled for the purpose of planning and ordering the University of Virginia’s first library.<lb/>
By collating the contents of these documents, we see Jefferson, Trist, Kean, and the university’s booksellers collaborating to selectively reinscribe the original 1823 Trist catalog to form a final list of the university’s first books.<lb/>
This final list—sent to Cummings & Hilliard in June, 1825 and returned on 11 July, 1826 with a letter from William Hilliard terminating their contract—is not only linked to Jefferson’s original 1812 fair copy (and, ultimately, the 1783 catalog before it), but was its textual descendant.66<lb/>
In light of this new evidence concerning the seven catalogs that we have examined here, our stemma tracing their filiation takes final shape (fig. 18).<lb/>

</figure><lb/>
The stemma in figure 18 can be reduced to a narrative that situates the seven catalogs we examine above in four distinct phases of work:<lb/>
first, the 1815 printed catalog and the 1783 manuscript catalog formed a dual copy text for Trist’s 1823 manuscript catalog;<lb/>
second, the 1823 Trist catalog served as the primary copy text for Jefferson’s lost 1824 catalog, supplemented by Jefferson’s retirement library catalog, Jefferson’s correspondence with James Madison, George Ticknor, and others, as well as Jefferson’s collection of “excellent” bookseller’s catalogs and several lists of books supplied by the university’s first professors (see supra note 41);<lb/>
third, the John Vaughn Kean catalog, finished in May 1825, derived its format and organizational schema from the 1824 catalog, as demonstrated by the rediscovered leaf at the Library of Congress; and<lb/>
fourth, and finally, Trist and Jefferson worked to compile the 1825 Trist catalog, replicating the contents of the 1825 catalog sent to Cummings & Hilliard (Inventory of Books for the University of Virginia, Cummings, Hilliard and Co., 1825–1827, RG-2/1/6.026, Special Collections, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Va.).<lb/>
For example, next to <hi>Phillips Mineralogy</hi>, Trist copied a note from Jefferson requesting the “last edition,” while next to the entry for La Cepede’s edition of <hi>Buffon’s Natural History</hi>—70 volumes in 12mo—another note requests that “if the 8° ed[itio]n by La Cepede be as comprehensive, prefer it” (Chapter 11, Natural History – Zoology; p. 27).<lb/>
The letter from Cummings & Hilliard closing their contract is UVA MS 11910. Having obtained as many of the books listed in the 1825 Trist catalog as possible, Hilliard observed that “the amount furnished for the purchase of Books, was altogether inadequate to the accomplishment of the Catalogue made out; therefore many Books are omitted, & especially those, the most expensive, and many more, which could not be procured. I had positive instructions from Mr. J not to exceed the sum of 10,000 dollars, & have been studious not to exceed my instructions. The Books already viewed, & those on the way, together with the commission, will amount nearly to the sum appropriated. In some cases, there will probably be found duplicates, which may be handed over to my agent Mr. Jones— Otherwise, I shall expect that none will be returned, as a discretionary power was given, in regard to editions.”<lb/>

<lb/><hi>Epilogue: The Unrecognized Provenance of the 1823 Trist Catalog</hi>
<lb/>
<lb/>The textual evidence inhering in these seven catalogs demonstrates that each
<lb/>represents a phase of work in Jefferson’s planning the University of Virginia’s
<lb/>first library. The idea that Trist’s and Jefferson’s work on the 1823 catalog was
<lb/>intended only to reconstruct a lost order for Jefferson’s books is not supported by
<lb/>the catalogs that Jefferson penned or planned subsequently. Each of these later
<lb/>lists is textually and formally related to Trist’s 1823 manuscript, tracing a line
<lb/>of filiation from Jefferson’s original 1783 manuscript catalog through to the final
<lb/>list sent to Cummings & Hilliard in June 1825. The newly uncovered evidence
<lb/>supporting this filiation is not only textual, however. In a letter sent to Trist on
<lb/>October 4, 1826, James Madison—then Rector of the University— offered
<lb/>Trist the job of Secretary to the Board of Visitors and an additional $50 “in
<lb/>consideration of yr. service in relation to the Catalogue for the Library.”<lb/>67

<p><pb n="162"/>manuscript and the 1825 manuscript that followed—was not only in service to<lb/>Jefferson, but was done rather in a semi-official capacity for the university. In<lb/>other words, the timing of Trist’s commission to compile the 1823 catalog was<lb/>driven primarily by Jefferson’s interest in developing a final list of books that<lb/>would form the University of Virginia’s first library. In the event, Trist declined<lb/>the payment, explaining that his “motive in undertaking it was to gratify Mr<lb/>Jefferson ... and as part of that gratuitously done by him for the Un[iversit]y.”<ref>68</ref><lb/>A further clue regarding the origin and purpose of the 1823 Trist catalog<lb/>hides in plain sight in Gilreath and Wilson’s 1989 account: their observation that<lb/>the catalog was for many years “mistakenly labeled as a catalog of the library<lb/>at the University of Virginia.” Closer examination of the catalog’s provenance<lb/>and the manuscript itself reveals that this association was not a “mistake,” but<lb/>rather was based on a clearly traceable history that connects the catalog to the<lb/>university rather than to Jefferson’s personal estate. If Trist’s manuscript had<lb/>been privately prepared for Thomas Jefferson, it would most likely have been<lb/>retained by Jefferson’s family among Jefferson’s other personal papers and ulti-<lb/>mately consigned to the Massachusetts Historical Society along with the rest of<lb/>the Coolidge Collection—including the 1783 catalog. This was not the case. As<lb/>Gilreath himself writes in the introduction to his edited collection <hi>The Judgment of Experts</hi>, “provenance is the one unfailing guide when used in conjunction with a<lb/>critically intelligent examination of the physical properties and text of any docu-<lb/>ment … when considered along with other methods of checking a document, it<lb/>will certainly improve the reliability of any conclusion.”<ref>69</ref><lb/>Our early examination of the 1823 Trist catalog was conducted using a scan<lb/>of the document, but when we later examined the manuscript in person we found<lb/>what is perhaps the catalog’s most tantalizing piece of provenance evidence. On<lb/>the front pastedown in the original binding, the number “41” appears penciled<lb/>in the upper left corner (<hi>fig. 19a</hi>).</p>

<p>This number matches the method and placement of shelf-marking used in the<lb/>University of Virginia’s first library (see <hi>fig. 19b</hi>), suggesting that the<lb/>number indicates the book’s subject chapter and shelving location in the Rotunda<lb/>or in Pavilion VII—a structure on the University of Virginia’s quadrilateral “lawn” that housed the university’s books before the Rotunda was completed and the books installed under its dome.<lb/>While the 1823 Trist catalog would likely have been classified in Chapter 40, “<hi rend="bold">Bibliography</hi>,” the penciled “41” could be the result of human error: Chapter 40 contained only five titles prior to 1826. In contrast, the adjacent Chapter 41, “<hi rend="bold">Philology</hi>,” contained<lb/>over 100 titles. In installing the constituent volumes of these two chapters onto<lb/>their shelves and labelling them, books from Chapter 40 could have been easily</p>

the notation suggests that the 1823 Trist catalog should be directly associated<lb/>  
with the library of the University of Virginia.<lb/>  
In fact, the 1823 Trist catalog did not remain with Jefferson but was kept<lb/>  
at the university as late as 1834. On this point the provenance evidence in the<lb/>  
catalog itself is unequivocal. The original cover bears a later label that states<lb/>  
7University of Virginia7; we believe this was added when the book was donated<lb/>  
to the Library of Congress in 1917. More revealing is the presence on the front<lb/>

The signs of his interaction with<lb/>
the catalog indicate that the volume remained at the university until at least that<lb/>
date. Thereafter, Lewis appears to have taken the catalog to his native Georgia,<lb/>
where it remained until 1916 when it was found by Frederick (Frank) Goodell<lb/>
in 1916 while he was serving as camp librarian at Camp Wheeler near Macon.<lb/>
The provenance and textual evidence in the manuscript suggest that Douglas<lb/>
Wilson’s conclusion that the 1823 catalog “proves to be a copy of the catalog of<lb/>
the library sold to Congress with the entries in Jefferson’s order and corrected in<lb/>
his own hand” is then only one part of a fascinating story.72<lb/>

ally prepared for the university in the earliest phase of the library’s planning and<lb/>
was retained by the university until its removal by Pearce Lewis. Yet we remain<lb/>
alive to other possibilities. Millicent Sowerby observed in her introduction to the<lb/>
<hi>Catalogue of the Library of Thomas Jefferson</hi> (1952) that “the number of manuscripts<lb/>
to be read and examined was so overwhelming that it is impossible not to suggest<lb/>
that the student of Jefferson will be repaid by further reading of these, or that the<lb/>
publication by Princeton of the volumes of <hi>The Papers of Thomas Jefferson</hi> will
<pb n="166"/>
not provide undiscovered material.”73<lb/>
Her remarks have proved prescient. If we<lb/>
have succeeded in expanding Gilreath and Wilson’s reading of the catalogs, it is<lb/>
in part because we have adduced additional information from manuscripts in the<lb/>
Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library at the University of Virginia<lb/>
and the Rare Books Division at the Library of Congress as well as in newly published Jefferson correspondence made available through Early Access documents<lb/>
and the Jefferson Papers project. As future bibliographers make additional discoveries about the University of Virginia’s library and develop new methodologies—particularly around the interpretation of provenance evidence—we look<lb/>
forward to reading the yet unknown stories they have to tell.<lb/>

TEASER CHAPTERS AND MARKETING<lb/>
STRATEGIES IN VICTORIA OCAMPO’S SUR</head>
<p>by<lb/>
Nora C. Benedict<lb/>
One of the greatest contributions to Latin American literary culture in the twentieth century came in the form of Victoria Ocampo’s literary<lb/>
journal Sur (1931– 92).1 With an unparalleled life span —when compared with<lb/>
similar literary magazines of the time — and an astounding list of international<lb/>
authors who lined its pages, Sur is an exemplar of literary excellence. Count<lb/>
less scholars and critics have discussed the pivotal role of Sur in introducing<lb/>
international writers to Latin American readers and simultaneously putting<lb/>
Latin American writers on the map for international readers.2 Above all, there<lb/>
has been a marked interest in examining Sur’s impressive networks (Willson;<lb/>
Larkosh; Majstorovic [2013]), its lasting impact on Latin American letters<lb/>
(King [1981;1986]), and its political stance (Majstorovic [2005]). However, to<lb/>
date there has been no consideration of the marketing tactics employed by<lb/>
Ocampo to help sell the books that she produced with her publishing firm of<lb/>
the same name, Editorial Sur (1933 – 85).3 While a close examination of all<lb/>
of these marketing strategies is out of the scope of this paper, I focus on one<lb/>
particular method that points to Ocampo’s deep-seated understanding of the<lb/>
book industry as well as to her life’s work to popularize both national and in-<lb/>
ternational works of great renown.4<lb/>
More specifically, I examine the function<lb/>
of pre-publication— or teaser—book chapters in the literary journal Sur. In<lb/>
particular, I analyze which Editorial Sur books were excerpted in the literary<lb/>
journal Sur.<lb/>
<pb n="168"/>
<p>journal and consider why certain titles might have been promoted more than<lb/>
others. In this way, I show how Ocampo’s decision to establish this publishing<lb/>
house was not merely to finance her literary journal, but rather a part of her<lb/>
business plan and overarching mission to introduce international writers to<lb/>
Latin American readers.<lb/>
</p>
<head>From Serial Publication to Teaser Chapter</head><lb/>
<p>Serial publications— or serialized publications—appear frequently throughout<lb/>
the nineteenth century.5 “<hi>Serialization</hi>,” in the words of Catherine Delafield,<lb/>
“was the process by which many nineteenth-century novels were published prior<lb/>
to their appearance in discrete volume form.”6 Certain nineteenth-century au<lb/>
thors even began to construct chapters of a particular style and length to fit<lb/>
within the parameters of a serial publication. In England, Charles Dickens ex<lb/>
pertly used this method for the publication of many of his novels and is perhaps<lb/>
its best-known practitioner. In America, according to Michael Lund, “the sheer<lb/>
number of significant authors and works first appearing in part from 1850 to<lb/>
1900 suggest that a central mode of the American literary tradition was the se<lb/>
rial form, the continuing story.”7<lb/>
The serial publication format also was popu<lb/>
lar in France (feuilleton) and Spain (folletín) during the nineteenth century,8<lb/>
and examples cropped up in Russia as well with the works of Dostoyevsky and Tol<lb/>
stoy. Instances of serial publications, such as Edith Wharton’s <hi>The House of Mirth</hi><lb/>
(Scribner’s Magazine, 1905), James Joyce’s <hi>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</hi><lb/>
(Egoist, 1914–15), and Ernest Hemingway’s <hi>A Farewell to Arms</hi> (Scribner’s Magazine,<lb/>
1929) continued to appear in later decades, but in the early part of the twentieth<lb/>
</p>

<note n="5">While serial publications were most prominent in the nineteenth century, they have much earlier origins: “Serial fiction was not a Victorian invention. As R. M. Wiles has shown, already by the second quarter of the eighteenth century ‘number books, independently issued in weekly or month parts, wrapped in blue paper covers, had become a common commodity in the publishing business’ (<hi>Serial</hi>, 75). By 1750 works thus published in fascicles already totaled several hundred and were occasionally issued in editions of as many as two or three thousand copies. Among them were both original and reprinted works, translated texts as well as those in the vernacular, and, among a wide variety of other genres, a number of examples of prose fiction, including Cervantes, Defoe, and imitations of Richardson such as <hi>Pamela in High Life</hi>.” Graham Law, <hi>Serializing Fiction in the Victorian Press</hi> (London: Palgrave, 2000), 3.</note>

<note n="8">Alexandre Dumas’s <hi>The Count of Monte Cristo</hi> (1844–45) and Gustave Flaubert’s <hi>Madame Bovary</hi> (1856) originally appeared as serial publications in magazines in France. Many of the works of Benito Pérez Galdós also appeared in serial format in Spain. See Wright for more details on the development of the serial novel throughout Spain and Mexico.</note>
</div>
<pb n="169"/>
<p>century the use of this print format declined alongside the advent of new forms<lb/>
of media, namely radio and television.<sup>9</sup><lb/>
With this background of serialized publications in mind, I argue that Ocampo’s literary journal <hi>Sur</hi> in the late 1930s presented a new form that borrowed<lb/>
certain aspects of serialized publications with an eye toward marketing. While<lb/>
the teaser chapters that Ocampo presented to readers have their roots in earlier<lb/>
serial publications, her excerpts were slightly different. Unlike serialized publica-<lb/>
tions that printed an entire work in installments, or fascicles, the teaser chapter<lb/>
is exactly what its name describes: a single chapter (or, at times, two) that aimed<lb/>
to excite readers about a forthcoming book and, by proxy, encouraged them to<lb/>
buy the book once it was released. In a sense, these teaser chapters throughout<lb/>
the pages of <hi>Sur</hi> are a type of predecessor for the sample chapters— or “sneak<lb/>
peaks” of forthcoming works—that appear at the end of many of today’s popular<lb/>
novels.<sup>10</sup> That is to say, these teaser chapters are a hybrid of a serialized install-<lb/>
ment publication and a sample of forthcoming works. Readers can get a taste for<lb/>
certain books through a periodical publication (like serial publications), but they<lb/>
must purchase the book to read it in its entirety (like sample chapters at the end of<lb/>
contemporary novels). As I will show in the following sections, the teaser chapters<lb/>
that Ocampo appears to have included strategically in her literary journal from<lb/>
a variety of forthcoming Editorial <hi>Sur</hi> works align with her mission to encourage<lb/>
a broader readership while also boosting sales.<lb/>
</p>
<div type="section">
<head>Sampling Editorial Sur</head>
<p>Before diving into the teaser chapters in <hi>Sur</hi> I want to reflect briefly on the dif-<lb/>
ferences between marketing and propaganda. Both seek to persuade people, but<lb/>
whereas marketing attempts to sell goods or services, propaganda tries to pro-<lb/>
mote a political cause or point of view. Ocampo certainly was concerned with<lb/>
the marketing strategies of <hi>Sur</hi> and Editorial <hi>Sur</hi>. The impetus behind those<lb/>
projects was her drive to promote important works of literature. In a footnote to<lb/>
the introduction of a special quadruple issue of <hi>Sur</hi> dedicated to English litera-<lb/>
ture she made clear how she had helped to bring this about: “En 1933, antes de<lb/>
la fiebre editorial argentina, <hi rend="bold">SUR</hi> publicó las primeras traducciones de Aldous<lb/>
Huxley (<hi>Contrapunto</hi>), D. H. Lawrence (<hi>Canguro</hi>), Virginia Woolf (<hi>Un Cuarto Propio</hi>)<lb/>
</p>
<p>Fitzgerald’s <hi>This Side of Paradise</hi> (1920) and <hi>The Beautiful and Damned</hi> (1922) present an-<lb/>
other kind of serialization, yet this example is that in which the periodical publication in install-<lb/>
ments comes after the publication of the work as a single volume (Chicago <hi>Herald and Examiner</hi> &<lb/>
<hi>Atlanta Georgian</hi>, 1921; <hi>The Washington Herald</hi>, 1922), which suggests an even greater marketing<lb/>
strategy since these second serializations tend to appear after large sales of the single-volume<lb/>
work (<hi>West</hi> III).<lb/>
</p>
<p>A number of recent publishing manuals encourage authors to include sample chapters<lb/>
for their forthcoming or already published books in their back matter, especially if the book is<lb/>
part of a larger series (<hi>Coker</hi>; <hi>Crayton</hi>; <hi>Lynch</hi>). I should note, however,<lb/>
that I have yet to see an example of this publishing phenomenon in Spanish-language books.</p>

<p>y Orlando) y <hi>James Joyce</hi> (<hi>Desterrados</hi>).”11 Ocampo’s decision to include in <hi>Sur</hi><lb/>
various promotional materials like teaser chapters from forthcoming Editorial<lb/>
<hi>Sur</hi> titles signals a logical approach to introducing Latin American readers to<lb/>
international authors and to selling her editions of their works.<lb/>
</p>
<p>The range of writers Ocampo published was itself evidence that she was not<lb/>
attempting to promote a narrow party line. Broadly speaking, throughout her<lb/>
literary journal she strived to maintain a neutral stance that was “outside politi-<lb/>
cs,” especially in light of the censorship measures that Perón instituted during<lb/>
his dictatorship.12 This neutral position could itself be viewed as political, but<lb/>
throughout a variety of journal issues Ocampo explicitly reiterated her hostility<lb/>
to partisan bias. For instance, in the same introduction to the quadruple issue<lb/>
of <hi>Sur</hi>, Ocampo discusses the monstrous qualities of propaganda: “En este siglo<lb/>
la Propaganda devora al hombre como un nuevo dios que ni siquiera trata de<lb/>
disimular que es un monstruo. Vivimos, dice C. Day Lewis, en un ‘pandemonio<lb/>
de slogans, de himnos nacionales, de titulares, de altoparlantes, de manifiestos,<lb/>
de coimas, de chismes desatinados e ideales altamente explosivos.’”13 She con-<lb/>
tinues her diatribe by stating that <hi>Sur</hi> is against any type of political propaganda<lb/>
and, instead, simply wishes to provide its readers with examples of outstanding<lb/>
literature: “En atmósferas de pandemonio ni poetas, ni artistas verdaderos pu-<lb/>
den respirar. No ha sido, ni será la atmósfera de nuestra revista. Y por eso este<lb/>
número especial de <hi>Sur</hi> no es un número de propaganda. . . . Sólo se propone<lb/>
dar a conocer algunos nuevos valores.”14<lb/>
</p>
<p><hi>Editorial Sur</hi> published forty-three books between the years 1936 and 1971<lb/>
that have teaser chapters in <hi>Sur</hi> (table 1).15 These pre-publication texts found<lb/>
throughout the pages of Ocampo’s literary journal <hi>Sur</hi> were not reserved for<lb/>
one specific genre or type of literature, but rather reflected virtually every genre<lb/>
published by <hi>Editorial Sur</hi> during its decades-long run. More specifically, there<lb/>
were excerpts of poetry, theater, novels, essays, short stories, and even memoirs<lb/>
in <hi>Sur</hi> that were later included in full-length books published by <hi>Editorial Sur</hi>.16<lb/>

<p>In essence, these teaser chapters showcased the breadth and depth of material<lb/>
that this publishing firm produced. What is more, the authors who penned these<lb/>
diverse works hailed from around the globe (England, France, Argentina, Italy,<lb/>
Chile, Russia, Spain, the United States,17 Ireland, and Germany). However, the<lb/>
names of virtually all the authors of these sample chapters would have been<lb/>
known to readers, especially for the educated and elite consumers of <hi>Sur</hi>. For<lb/>
instance, a few of the authors whose sampled works appeared in these issues<lb/>
included James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, Aldous Huxley, George Orwell, Gabriela<lb/>
Mistral, Albert Camus, and T. E. Lawrence, as well as Victoria Ocampo herself.<lb/>
When viewed in tandem with the numerous ads that filled the opening and clos-<lb/>
ing pages of each issue of the literary journal <hi>Sur</hi>, these teaser chapters reveal<lb/>
one potential way in which Ocampo might have marketed select works as a part<lb/>
of her more general mission to promote certain authors for her Latin American<lb/>
readers.18</p>
<p>While Ocampo’s literary journal tended to include only one pre-publication<lb/>
chapter from each of these books, there were instances in which several chap-<lb/>
ters—or even entire works—appeared in <hi>Sur</hi> prior to the book publication with<lb/>
<hi>Editorial Sur</hi>. Consider, for instance, the following titles that had at least two<lb/>
chapters published in <hi>Sur</hi> prior to their releases as single-volume works with Edi-<lb/>
torial Sur: <hi>André Gide’s Perséphone</hi> (1936), Eduardo Mallea’s <hi>La ciudad junto al río<lb/>

esclavos en la noria</hi> (1937), <hi>Victoria Ocampo’s Virginia Woolf, Orlando y Cía</hi> (1938),<lb/>
and <hi>Silvina Ocampo’s Autobiografía de Irene</hi> (1948).19 Multiple poems from Gabri-<lb/>
ela Mistral’s <hi>Tala</hi> (1938) as well as Eduardo González Lanuza’s <hi>La degollación de los<lb/>
inocentes</hi> (1938) and <hi>Transitable cristal</hi> (1943) also appeared in the pages of <hi>Sur</hi> prior<lb/>
to their official release with <hi>Editorial Sur</hi>. It is telling that early on multiple teaser<lb/>
chapters from <hi>Editorial Sur</hi> books—if not the entire works—appeared in <hi>Sur</hi>. In<lb/>
essence, these early pre-publication chapters highlight the residual influence of<lb/>
serial publications. The only two books that were published in an entirely serial-<lb/>

<pb n="175"/>
<p>impact of serial publications on marketing strategies in literary journals like Sur.<lb/>
In fact, Woolf’s work overtly harkened back to earlier serialized installments with<lb/>
the use of phrases like “continuará” [will continue] and “concluirá” [will conclude] at the end of each separate chapter publication in Sur, which were spread<lb/>
out over four different issues from December 1935 to March 1936.<lb/>
Editorial Sur’s single-volume book publication of <hi>Un cuarto propio</hi> appeared in July 1936.</p>
<p>In contrast to the multiple-teaser-chapter model, single teaser chapters became more common in the literary journal.<lb/>
The single-teaser chapter model coincided with Editorial Sur’s publication of the works of more high-profile, international authors.<lb/>
Generally speaking, this shift to a single-teaser chapter model not only would allow for the inclusion of more authors’ works, which certainly would have appealed to Ocampo’s more general goals, but also might be a logical change in light of the differences in sales that result from serialized publications and teaser chapters.<lb/>
While the presence of serialized publications within a journal might generate an uptick in buyers—or subscribers, these individuals will only be purchasing issues of one particular journal, not separate books, and they might even stop their subscriptions after the last installment of a given work.<lb/>
On the other hand, the use of pre-publication chapters entices readers not only to continue to buy a given journal for the carefully curated snippets of forthcoming works, but also to purchase the books that are marketed with these teaser chapters.<lb/>
If the journal and publishing house are owned by the same individual, which is the case for Sur and Editorial Sur, this model would be the most logical and economically sound option as it encourages the largest amount of profit as well as the greatest number of readers and buyers.</p>
<p>Another more subtle clue that these teaser chapters functioned as a type of marketing to help sell Editorial Sur editions are the footnotes that accompanied over half of the periodical publications.21<lb/>
More specifically, the majority of these teaser chapters brought readers’ attention to the fact that the excerpt that they were about to read in Sur was part of a forthcoming Editorial Sur book.</p>
<p>For instance, James Joyce’s <hi>Desterrados</hi> alerted readers that the “versión castellana publicará próximamente la Editorial SUR” [the Spanish version will be published shortly], while Conrado Nalé Roxlo’s <hi>Claro desvelo</hi> was already “en prensa” [in production] with Editorial Sur, and Gabriela Mistral’s <hi>Tala</hi> “publicará este mes” [will be published this month].22</p>
<p>In comparison with these slight hints, Ocampo took a more direct route with other works.<lb/>
In particular, she endorsed Huxley’s <hi>Con los esclavos en la noria</hi> and Cyril Connolly’s <hi>La tumba sin sosiego</hi> more explicitly.<lb/>
Immediately before the first teaser chapter of Huxley’s work was a long introductory text about the publication and the “esfuerza editorial” [editorial effort] to produce this work in Spanish.23<lb/>
What is more, this gloss did not simply announce the publication of the forthcoming volume; it also sought to foreground the editorial labor involved in the Spanish edition.</p>
<div type="footnotes">
  <note place="foot" n="21">Over half of these Editorial Sur books that are promoted through teaser chapters are also reviewed in Sur.</note>
  <note place="foot" n="22">Virtually all of the other footnoted teaser chapters presented a similar linguistic formula to announce that these textual fragments were part of a larger work.</note>
  <note place="foot" n="23">I should note that both of the introductory texts that I discuss here only appeared before the excerpted teaser chapters in the literary journal Sur and were not included in the full book-length publications with Editorial Sur.</note>
</div>
<pb n="176"/>
<p>tion of Huxley’s novel with <hi>Editorial Sur</hi>, it conveyed the unique opportunity<lb/>
that readers had to acquire “una obra de gran importancia” [a work of great<lb/>
importance].24 The editors of <hi>Sur</hi> also stressed that this was the “primera traduc-<lb/>
ción [española] que aparece, pues el público no conoce aún más que la edición<lb/>
inglesa” [first Spanish translation to appear since the public does not know any-<lb/>
thing other than the English edition].25 This particular tactic of emphasizing the<lb/>
fact that no other Spanish-language version of a given work exists is one that<lb/>
<hi>Editorial Sur</hi> employed frequently throughout the 1930s with great success.26<lb/>
Similar to Huxley’s teaser chapters, the pre-publication chapter from Connolly’s<lb/>
<hi>La tumba sin sosiego</hi> was prefaced by a lengthy two-page parenthetical note by<lb/>
Ricardo Baeza, the novel’s translator. Aside from providing a brief biography of<lb/>
Connolly and details on his other works, Baeza mentions that the complete trans-<lb/>
lation of his most recent novel (<hi>La tumba sin sosiego</hi>) “publicará en breve la <hi>Editorial Sur</hi>”<lb/>
[will be published soon by Editorial Sur] (95). These two examples point to<lb/>
Ocampo’s meticulous attention to the promotion and marketing of her books.<lb/>
For most of these titles, the pre-publication chapters appeared in <hi>Sur</hi> at least<lb/>
one to two months before their release as books by <hi>Editorial Sur</hi>. In this way,<lb/>
readers were made aware of forthcoming titles and given a preview of com-<lb/>
ing attractions with the hopes of building anticipation for the entire book. This<lb/>
marketing strategy makes sense given that over half of these works were the<lb/>
first authorized translations of foreign works available to readers in Latin America,<lb/>
which also aligned with Ocampo’s overarching mission and, given their unique<lb/>
status in the Spanish-language book industry, made their availability more de-<lb/>
sirable. That said, there are a few outliers (nine in total) whose teaser chapters<lb/>
appeared in <hi>Sur</hi> in the same month as their full-length book publication. The<lb/>
vast majority of titles that fall into this camp of simultaneous publication are<lb/>
those by authors whose works appeared in Spanish and, as a result, did not re-<lb/>
quire translation, namely Conrado Nalé Roxlo, Gabriela Mistral, José Bianco,<lb/>
Juan Goyanarte, H. A. Murena, and Victoria Ocampo.27 The only exceptions<lb/>
are Alexandre Arnoux’s <hi>La cifra</hi>, which was published as a book with <hi>Editorial Sur</hi><lb/>
in November 1955 and then excerpted in the January/February 1956 issue<lb/>
of <hi>Sur</hi> (238: 87–90), and T. E. Lawrence’s <hi>Siete pilares de la sabiduría</hi>, which was<lb/>
published as a book with <hi>Editorial Sur</hi> in September 1944 and then excerpted in<lb/>
the October 1944 issue of <hi>Sur</hi> (120: 35–54). Given Ocampo’s interest in promot-<lb/>

<pb n="177"/> 
<p>ing exemplary literary works from writers of her time, it makes sense that she<lb/>
would have fueled anticipation for coming titles. The longer timeline involved in<lb/>
producing translations of these foreign works also might have factored into the<lb/>
months-long gap between teaser chapter publication in <hi>Sur</hi> and full-length book<lb/>
publication with <hi>Editorial Sur</hi>.28<lb/>
</p>
<head>Promotional Trends</head>
<p>Certain trends emerge with these pre-publication texts. In the pages that follow I<lb/>
explain why certain <hi>Editorial Sur</hi> works might have been promoted more heavily<lb/>
than others and, with the help of extant archival material, reveal additional financial<lb/>
pressures that might account for some of Ocampo’s marketing decisions. In<lb/>
general terms, the rationale for the use of teaser chapters in <hi>Sur</hi> falls into one of two<lb/>
categories: promotion of best sellers, or questions of copyright and authors’ permissions.<lb/>
Even though these two categories overlap in a number of ways, it will be useful to<lb/>
conceptualize the use of pre-publication chapters through these two lenses.<lb/>
</p>
<p>If a publisher is looking to capitalize on international literary trends, then<lb/>
producing translations, especially the first authorized translations, of works that<lb/>
have already become commercial successes in other countries is a sound decision.<lb/>
Ocampo’s editorial selections and keen eye for the best literary trends,<lb/>
therefore, made her a savvy businesswoman. In fact, <hi>Editorial Sur</hi> made many<lb/>
international best sellers available to Spanish-language readers for the first time.<lb/>
Perhaps more surprising is the fact that some of her firm’s translations are still<lb/>
the only Spanish-language translations available for certain foreign works. Here<lb/>
I examine two examples of best-selling authors whose work <hi>Editorial Sur</hi> translated,<lb/>
published, and excerpted with teaser chapters in the literary journal <hi>Sur</hi>:<lb/>
<hi>Aldous Huxley</hi> and <hi>Albert Camus</hi>.<lb/>
</p>
<p><hi>Editorial Sur</hi> published two of <hi>Aldous Huxley</hi>’s novels—<hi>Contrapunto</hi> and<lb/>
<hi>Con los esclavos en la noria</hi>—as well as his short pamphlet <hi>¿Cómo lo resuelve usted? El<lb/>
problema de la paz constructiva</hi>. In fact, Huxley’s <hi>Contrapunto</hi> is the first work that<lb/>
Ocampo’s firm published, and one of the author’s most successful. A short three<lb/>
years later, in 1936, Ocampo acquired the translation and publication rights for<lb/>
Huxley’s <hi>Eyeless in Gaza</hi>, which was already creating a stir: “That <hi>Eyeless in Gaza</hi><lb/>
was awaited with growing interest is attested by its first-year sales in England,<lb/>
which at 26,700 copies […], were more than double those of <hi>Brave New World</hi>.<lb/>
The reviews of <hi>Eyeless in Gaza</hi> were the fullest and quite often the most analytical<lb/>
of any novel Huxley wrote.”29<lb/>
</p>
<p>According to the book’s colophon, <hi>Con los esclavos en la noria</hi> was the first and only authorized Spanish translation of <hi>Eyeless in Gaza</hi>, which accentuates its unique importance.<lb/>
</p>
<p>Unlike <hi>Contrapunto</hi>, the publication of Huxley’s <hi>Con los esclavos en la noria</hi> with <hi>Editorial Sur</hi> was preceded—and highly anticipated—by two teaser chapters in Ocampo’s literary journal. What is more, as previously mentioned, the first of these<lb/>

<pb n="178"/>
<p>two teaser chapters was introduced with a lengthy page-and-a-half note to readers<lb/>
that emphasized the importance of this literary work.<lb/>
From its opening line, this introductory note presented an air of marketing: “La Editorial SUR dará pronto al público de habla española una obra de gran importancia: la reciente y ya famosa novela con que el autor de <hi>CONTRAPUNTO</hi> ha igualado y aún sobrepasado los valores extraordinarios en cuanto a inteligencia y estilo que señalaron a ese título como el de una de las novelas más importantes de nuestro tiempo.”<note target="#fn30"/>30<lb/>
Apart from singing the praises of this new novel, this note mentioned Huxley’s previous novel published by Editorial Sur (<hi>Contrapunto</hi>), which linked the two works and appeared to encourage readers to purchase this earlier title if they had not done so already.<lb/>
Finally, the author of this note suggested that this edition would be to the liking of Sur’s many readers: “SUR espera que sus ya muchos millares de lectores aprecien el esfuerzo editorial que comporta el ofrecerles en forma tan rápida y prolija la gran obra, de la que podrán leer hoy un capítulo escogido al azar y cuyo texto se halla en prensa.”<note target="#fn31"/>31<lb/>
Along with this laudatory introductory note, the novel was reviewed in Sur by Julio Irazusta, the work’s translator.<note target="#fn32"/>32<lb/>
More than a traditional book review, this note focused on the difficulties of translating Huxley’s style and highlighted the literary achievements of the work, like the development of a “verdadera caracterización, personajes de inconfundible vida propia” [true depiction (of) characters with an unmistakable life of their own] and “un hondo drama según las mejores reglas, con catharsis y todo” [an intense tragedy that follows the best rules, with catharsis and all].<note target="#fn33"/>33<lb/>
In the process, Irazusta referred extensively to Huxley’s previously translated work that Editorial Sur published (<hi>Contrapunto</hi>), which might have further served to promote the firm’s books.<lb/>
As it had done with Aldous Huxley’s <hi>Con los esclavos en la noria</hi>, Editorial Sur publicized its edition of Albert Camus’s <hi>La peste</hi> extensively.<lb/>
In particular, a pre-publication teaser chapter appeared within the pages of Sur alongside numerous advertisements for the edition.<lb/>
While Editorial Sur employed comparable marketing techniques for other books that they published, Huxley’s and Camus’s works needed almost no introduction given their level of international recognition (and subsequent anticipation).<lb/>
Originally appearing in French in 1947, “<hi>La Peste</hi> was published in a printing of 22,000 copies” according to Herbert Lottman, which was “high for that time, high for a serious novel, but an underestimate”<lb/>
</p>
<div type="footnotes">
  <note xml:id="fn30" place="foot">“Editorial SUR will soon provide the Spanish-speaking public with a work of great importance: the recent and already famous novel with which the author of <hi>Point Counter Point</hi> has equaled and even surpassed the extraordinary values of intelligence and style that made this book one of the most important novels of our time.” “Un capítulo de Eyeless in Gaza,” 47.</note>

<p>on the part of the Librarie Gallimard of the suitability of the book for its era.”34<lb/>
Lottman goes on to describe the incredible financial success of Camus’s novel: <hi>By the fall [of 1947] it had sold nearly 100,000 copies and Camus was joking to Michel and Janine Gallimard that henceforth he’d have to pick up everybody’s restaurant checks.</hi>35<lb/>
These publishing successes of <hi>La Peste</hi> were not just reserved for its first edition in the original French, but also spilled over to the first edition of its Spanish translation with <hi>Editorial Sur</hi>.<lb/>
</p>
<p>Editorial Sur’s first edition of <hi>La peste</hi> appeared in July of 1948 and was promoted quite extensively by the literary journal <hi>Sur</hi>.<lb/>
Immediately following its initial publication, <hi>Sur</hi> advertised the novel in virtually every issue, describing the work as <hi>“la novela más famosa aparecida en Francia en los últimos veinte años. El gran éxito de la post-guerra”.</hi>36<lb/>
What is more, these same advertisements informed readers that this first edition of <hi>La peste</hi> was <hi rend="bold">“agotada”</hi> [sold out] within a year of its publication date, but that it would be reissued in a second edition.<lb/>
This new edition came out in December 1949 and not only was heavily advertised in <hi>Sur</hi>, just like the first edition, but also had a noticeable price increase from nine Argentine pesos to twelve.<lb/>
The popularity and extensive sales of <hi>La peste</hi> were further attested in its publication eight more times from 1951 to 1961.37<lb/>
Coupled with these publications and sales tactics was the review of <hi>La peste</hi> by <hi>Rosa Chacel</hi>, who also happened to be the translator of the work for <hi>Editorial Sur</hi>.<lb/>
Throughout her lengthy article on this novel and her work in translating it into Spanish, she praised Camus for his literary accomplishments: <hi>“Ante todo, este libro es un ejemplar gloriosamente logrado de arte dirigido”.</hi>38<lb/>
When viewed together, all of these marketing materials for <hi>La peste</hi>—from a pre-publication teaser chapter to its numerous advertisements and reviews—highlight Ocampo’s aim to promote the works of foreign authors through both the journal articles and books that she published.<lb/>
</p>
<p>Related to capitalizing on international bestsellers is Ocampo’s knack for identifying widely anticipated books.<lb/>
Take, for instance, T. E. Lawrence’s <hi>The Mint</hi> (1955). <hi>Publishers’ Weekly</hi> advertised the first edition of this work in their July 31, 1954 issue: “DOUBLEDAY will bring out in February a limited edition of 1,000 copies of ‘The Mint,’ a little-known work by T. E. Lawrence. . . . In his will, Lawrence stipulated that the book should not be published, however,<lb/>

35. Lottman, <hi>Albert Camus</hi>, 427.<lb/>
36. <hi>Sur</hi> 166 (1948): n.p.<lb/>
37. There were several subsequent Spanish-language editions that appeared shortly after <hi>Editorial Sur</hi>’s first authorized Spanish translation of <hi>La peste</hi> in 1948. Virtually all of these new editions name <hi>Rosa Chacel</hi> as the translator (with the exception of those produced by Aguilar), which indicates that these “new” editions appear to be reprintings of Chacel’s original translation of <hi>La Peste</hi> for <hi>Editorial Sur</hi>. Some of the firms that published their own editions of <hi>La Peste</hi> include <hi>Ediciones Azteca</hi> (1956), <hi>Taurus</hi> (1957), <hi>Ediciones Cid</hi> (1958; 1960), <hi>Aguilar</hi> (1960; 1961; 1971; 1973; 1979), <hi>Editorial Sudamericana</hi> (1973; 1974), and <hi>Edhasa</hi> (1977; 1981; 1983). For a full list of these later editions and their respective publishers, as well as a brief discussion of censorship surrounding this novel and its dissemination in Spain, see <hi>Fondebrider</hi>.<lb/>

<pb n="180"/>
until certain people died.<lb/>
In 1936, Doubleday wished to publish the book, but because of the provisions of the will, was unable to do so at that time.”39<lb/>
In their February highlights section from 1955, this same periodical noted that the publication of <hi>The Mint</hi> “is certain to be hailed as a major literary event.”40<lb/>
In its issue of March 19, 1955, <hi>Publishers’ Weekly</hi> stated that “[the first limited release was] oversubscribed, and no more copies were available by March 9,” which showcased readers’ interest in and demand for the work.41<lb/>
A short few months after its initial publication with Doubleday, <hi>The Mint</hi> appeared in translation with <hi>Editorial Sur</hi> (on May 28, 1955).42<lb/>
However, it is important to note that this edition was originally scheduled to appear simultaneously with the first English and French editions in February 1955: <quote>“SUR publicará este libro extraordinario en el mes de febrero del año próximo, simultáneamente con las ediciones inglesa y francesa”</quote> [SUR will publish this extraordinary book in the month of February next year, simultaneously with the English and French editions].43<lb/>
Perhaps sensing the splash that this book would have, along with her own personal interest in Lawrence’s writings, Ocampo excerpted various chapters and pre-published them in <hi>Sur</hi> as teasers in 1947 and 1951, well before the work’s slated release date.<lb/>
While the former publication in <hi>Sur</hi> consisted of a few pages of fragments, the latter presented readers with an introductory note on the work, the difficulties of its translation, and a whopping eight chapters.44<lb/>
From its paratextual material, readers learned that Ocampo, unlike any other publisher around the globe, “[ha recibido] autorización de publicar ocho capítulos” [received the authorization to publish eight chapters], which spoke to her literary connections and editorial prowess as a publisher.45<lb/>
She even goes so far as to note how this material “[n]o es mucho, pero nos da un pregusto del libro extraordinario de que forman parte” [is not much, but it gives us a taste of the extraordinary book of which it forms a part].46<lb/>
Her subtle use of the word pregusto here hints at how these chapters served as a preview of coming attractions and signaled her desire to develop readers’ interest in the entire book that she would publish a few years later.<lb/>
While a large number of the authors whose works appeared with <hi>Editorial Sur</hi> might have been household names to an educated international audience, not all of their titles that appeared with Ocampo’s publishing house were critically acclaimed bestsellers, commercial successes, or the most adequate representations of their respective oeuvres.<lb/>
For these reasons, heightened marketing tactics might have been
<p><pb n="181"/><lb/>necessary. Take, for instance, James Joyce’s only surviving play, <hi>Exiles</hi>, which was<lb/>
translated and published by Editorial Sur in 1937 as <hi>Desterrados</hi>. Unlike <hi>Ulysses</hi> or<lb/>
even <hi>The Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</hi>, Joyce’s <hi>Exiles</hi> is considered by many to<lb/>
be his least successful play and was hardly ever performed.47 When analyzing these<lb/>
examples, one might be tempted to argue that Ocampo had an eye toward the<lb/>
most accessible works—in terms of both the level of difficulty of the works them‐<lb/>
selves and the ease of access to the rights for translation and publication—for her<lb/>
publishing firm. However, this is not the case since Editorial Sur published some<lb/>
of the first and only authorized Spanish translations of works of key twentieth‐<lb/>
century writers, such as Virginia Woolf, William Faulkner, Graham Greene, Nor‐<lb/>
man Mailer, Samuel Beckett, Albert Camus, and Aldous Huxley.48 And many of<lb/>
these authors’ translated and published works with Editorial Sur were their most<lb/>
notable, which is certainly what we saw with Aldous Huxley and Albert Camus.<lb/>
Another instance in which Editorial Sur heavily marketed a lesser‐known<lb/>
work from a well‐known author is with Graham Greene’s <hi>Un caso acabado</hi> (1961).<lb/>
Ocampo developed a close relationship with Greene after they first met in 1938<lb/>
and remained in his inner circle throughout her life.49 Apart from his stays at<lb/>
her homes in Argentina, he dedicated his novel <hi>The Honorary Consul</hi> to her and<lb/>
she, in turn, published a total of sixteen of his books with Editorial Sur.50 While<lb/>
a number of Greene’s novels reached the status of best‐sellers, most notably <hi>The Heart of the Matter</hi> (1948), which Editorial Sur translated and published in 1949,<lb/>
<hi>Un caso acabado</hi> did not receive anywhere near the same amount of interest as<lb/>
his other works.51 However, Ocampo promoted Greene’s <hi>Un caso acabado</hi> with a<lb/>
teaser chapter in the January 1961 issue of <hi>Sur</hi>, a full five months prior to its book‐<lb/>
length publication with Editorial Sur.52 Even though this work was not as success‐<lb/>
ful as his previous novels, it is possible that Ocampo relied on the cultural capital<lb/>

in Britain. It was also a main selection of the Book-of-the-Month Club in America. Though<lb/>

la novelística actual” [A new work by Graham Greene is always an opportunity to rekindle the<lb/>
pleasure that the mastery of one of the best narrators of current collections of novels produces]<lb/>
(104). That said, Puglia concedes that the novel is “menos rica en matices y de contrucción<lb/>
menos rigurosa que las mejores obras de Greene” [less rich in nuances and constructed less<lb/>
rigorously than Greene’s best works] (Puglia, “Un caso acabado,” 106).<lb/></p>
<pb n="182"/>
of his name, which she had already popularized through previous <hi>Editorial Sur</hi> translations of his best-selling works, to help promote and sell <hi>Un caso acabado</hi>.<lb/>
Finally, there is the question of author’s rights. Other writers and intellectu-<lb/>
als involved in the Argentine publishing industry have noted the difficulty and<lb/>
extremely high cost of acquiring authors’ rights, which might account for why<lb/>
Ocampo focused on promoting the works of authors for whom she had already<lb/>
secured the translation rights.53 Not only that, most of the Spanish-language edi-<lb/>
tions that she produced were the first and only authorized translations of these<lb/>
works, which made them all the more valuable. That is to say, Ocampo identified<lb/>
a number of the best international literary works earlier on in her career as a<lb/>
publisher and then proceeded to corner the market by acquiring the translation<lb/>
and publication rights for these titles. One of the ways in which Ocampo might<lb/>
have been able to skirt the issue of paying large sums of money to acquire au-<lb/>
thors’ rights was through her impressive networks of contacts. Her close friend-<lb/>
ships with <hi>Virginia Woolf</hi>, <hi>Igor Stravinsky</hi>, and <hi>Rabindranath Tagore</hi> are well<lb/>
known and these connections undoubtedly provided her with a great deal more<lb/>
publishing freedom and access than most Latin American editors of the time. In<lb/>
fact, her teaser publications of <hi>T. S. Eliot’s Sobre la poesía y los poetas</hi> and <hi>Cyril Connolly’s La tumba sin sosiego</hi>, both of which appeared in 1947 in the special<lb/>
quadruple issue of <hi>Sur</hi> dedicated to English literature, illustrated her impressive<lb/>
literary connections. In her introductory note to the entire issue, Ocampo alludes<lb/>
to her networks by stating that <hi>“la lista de agradecimientos, en lo que respecta a</hi><lb/>
mis relaciones personales con Inglaterra, sería tan larga que no intentaré agotarla<lb/>
en este prólogo”</hi> [the list of acknowledgements, with regard to my personal rela-<lb/>
ciones con Inglaterra, sería tan larga que no intentaré agotarla en este prólogo].54<lb/>
However, she still mentions several individuals by name who helped<lb/>
her fill the pages of the issues at hand. In particular, she notes her conversations<lb/>
with Connolly <hi>“sobre este número y sus hints me han sido preciosos”</hi> [about<lb/>
this issue and that his hints have been very valuable].55 She also discusses Eliot’s<lb/>
foundational role in deciding on writers to include and the overall shape of the<lb/>
four-issue publication: <hi>“Yo quería saber lo que los ingleses pensaban de su propia<lb/>
literatura contemporánea y no cansaba de interrogarlos. . . . Así fué el propio T.<lb/>
S. Eliot quien eligió entre sus obras ¿Qué es un clásico? para este número de <hi rend="bold">SUR</hi>”</hi> [I wanted to know what the English thought of their own contemporary literature<lb/>
and I didn’t tire of asking them. . . . Thus, it was T. S. Eliot himself who chose<lb/>
What is a Classic? from among his works for this issue of SUR].56<lb/>

<pb n="183"/>
<p>In a similar vein is the question of literary agents. <lb/>
Unlike other countries, literary agents did not become a staple of the publishing industry in Latin Amer-<lb/>
ica until the mid-twentieth century. One of the most well-known and successful<lb/>
literary agents in Argentina during this time, who worked extensively with Oc-<lb/>
ampo and <hi>Editorial Sur</hi>, was Lawrence Smith.57<lb/>
These individuals would benefit financially from selling translation rights to publishing firms like<lb/>
<hi>Editorial Sur</hi>. In particular, according to Smith himself, “It is inadvisable to sell translation rights<lb/>
outright except in special cases. They should be paid for by a sum in advance on royalties,<lb/>
or per edition published.”58<lb/>
Extant archival documents reveal that Smith followed his own advice quite closely.<lb/>
More specifically, he helped facilitate Ocampo’s acquisition, and ultimate publication,<lb/>
of works by <hi>William Faulkner</hi>, <hi>Christopher Isherwood</hi>, <hi>George Orwell</hi>,<lb/>
<hi>H. G. Wells</hi>, and <hi>T. E. Lawrence</hi> for <hi>Editorial Sur</hi>.59<lb/>
What is more, these same documents clearly stated the required royalty payment of 5% of<lb/>
the sale price of any and all books. While these same upfront costs and royalty pay-<lb/>
ments might not have factored into every work that Ocampo published with <hi>Editorial Sur</hi>,<lb/>
they help account for why the works of certain authors—namely those with heftier<lb/>
price tags for the publisher—were marketed more heavily than others. That is to say,<lb/>
Ocampo most likely would not have wanted to lose exorbitant sums of money just to<lb/>
publish the work of internationally acclaimed authors or of her close friends for that matter.<lb/>
Regardless of the specific rationale for every teaser chapter that appeared<lb/>
in <hi>Sur</hi> prior to the release of its full-length book with <hi>Editorial Sur</hi>, what all of<lb/>
these examples show is that Ocampo had a well-developed plan to popularize the<lb/>
works of international writers not just in her literary journal, but also through her<lb/>
publishing house. That is to say, taking a closer look at the teaser chapters that<lb/>
appeared throughout Ocampo’s literary journal reveals her shrewd instincts for iden-<lb/>
tifying national and international authors whose literary works would interest her<lb/>
readers and, as a result, sell well in their full-length book form. Moreover, many of<lb/>
the titles that she selected to publish with <hi>Editorial Sur</hi> were the first authorized Spanish translations<lb/>
of best sellers by well-known authors, such as <hi>Albert Camus</hi> or <hi>Virginia Woolf</hi>, which resulted<lb/>
in large sales as is evident by the fact that the first editions of these works were<lb/>
very often sold out within the first few months of their publication. Even though<lb/>
Ocampo funneled a great deal of her own money and resources into <hi>Sur</hi> and<lb/>
<hi>Editorial Sur</hi>, she continued to publish both the journal and books for nearly<lb/>
half a century, an impressive feat made possible by her constant attention to the<lb/>
financial details of her literary enterprise as well as her own personal mission to present<lb/>
readers with exemplary works of international fiction and nonfiction.<lb/>
Besides Lawrence Smith, the only other two major literary agents in the Spanish-<lb/>
speaking world during the twentieth century were <hi rend="bold">Carmen Balcells</hi> and<lb/>
<hi rend="bold">International Editors</hi>.<lb/>
Lawrence Smith, “<hi>Translation Sales Down South</hi>,” <hi>Publishers’ Weekly</hi>, September 13,<lb/>
1941, 909.<lb/>
The extant correspondence between Ocampo and Smith, currently housed at <hi>Villa Ocampo</hi><lb/>
in Argentina, mentions the following titles: <hi>William Faulkner’s Light in August</hi>; <hi>Christopher<lb/>
Isherwood’s Goodbye to Berlin</hi>; <hi>George Orwell’s Critical Essays</hi>; <hi>H. G. Wells’ The Fate of<lb/>

  <head>THE ENGRAVINGS OF POPE’S WORKS II (1735): ‘ENVY MUST OWN, I LIVE AMONG THE GREAT’</head>
  <byline>by James McLaverty</byline>
  <p>On 24 April 1735, or perhaps a little earlier, Pope published the second volume of his Works.<lb/>
  1 It contained: <hi>‘Ethic Epistles to Henry St. John L. Bolingbroke’</hi> (<hi>An Essay on Man</hi>), <hi>‘Ethic Epistles, the Second Book. To Several Persons’</hi>, imitations of Horace and Donne, and the <hi>Dunciad Variorum</hi>.2<lb/>
  Like the first volume of Works, which had been published just after his twenty-ninth birthday, on 3 June 1717 (Griffith 79–86), the second volume was issued in the formats of his Homer translations – small folio, large folio, and quarto – and both the large folios and the quartos had illustrative headpieces, tailpieces, and initials.<lb/>
  The engravings of 1717 have been subject to lively critical engagement, and the thematic importance of the illustrations, symbolizing and reflecting on the poems, has been recognized.3 But the engravings in the second volume of Works have until recently been largely neglected.<lb/>
  Close attention to them reveals that they were part of a considered, though hesitantly executed, plan to emphasize Pope’s</p>
  <div type="footnotes">
    <p n="1">I am deeply grateful to David Vander Meulen for his corrections and advice, and for providing the illustrations for this essay from his own copies. A preliminary version of the essay was read for me by Dr Corrina Readioff at a session at the ISECS conference in Edinburgh in 2019. I am indebted to her for her generous assistance and for her report of the session’s discussion.</p>

His accounts of the folio (370), large-paper folio (371), and quarto (372) are still valuable. Subsequent references are to Griffith and item number.</p>

<p>place in a group that, though it was out of power, was politically and socially<lb/>
distinguished – an opposition aristocracy.4<lb/>
The incomplete success of the plan for the Works II illustrations arose paradox-<lb/>
ically from Pope’s gaining more direct control over the printing and publishing of<lb/>
his work. The 1717 volume, though closely supervised by Pope, was published by<lb/>
one of the trade’s most successful booksellers, Bernard Lintot, and printed by one<lb/>
of its most distinguished printers, William Bowyer. It everywhere shows signs of<lb/>
generous investment. In comparison the 1735 volume was something of a scram-<lb/>
ble. By the time Works II was published Pope was financing his own publications<lb/>
and working with the young bookseller Lawton Gilliver and the experienced but<lb/>
unspectacular printer John Wright.5 As money-sparing as he was paper-sparing,<lb/>
Pope’s aim seems to have been to publish his poems first individually but with<lb/>
extra sheets printed so that they could be used for the Works. That project was,<lb/>
however, at odds with his constant itch to revise, and the resulting volumes of<lb/>
Works are combinations of new printings and sheets published at various earlier<lb/>
times. Their incoherent collations reflect their piecemeal assemblage, and the<lb/>
texts in the three formats can be significantly different. The engravings show the<lb/>
consequences of this cheese-paring approach. There were to be new engravings<lb/>
for the Dunciad, where Gilliver owned the copyright and would have had to pay,<lb/>
but the general money-saving plan was to decorate the book with the plates that<lb/>
had been prepared by William Kent and Paul Fourdrinier for Pope’s translation<lb/>
of the Odyssey (1725 – 6). Pope eventually proved willing to pay for modification of<lb/>
the Odyssey engravings and for some new ones to emphasize the thematic unity of<lb/>
the two books of ‘Epistles’, but the reuse of the Odyssey plates draws attention away<lb/>
from what was potentially a coherent plan for illustration of the Works.<lb/>
The Plan for Works II (1735)<lb/>
The Works falls into four sections, marked by heraldic headpieces and tailpieces.<lb/>
Pat Rogers has demonstrated that some of the early work in Pope’s career had<lb/>
a heraldic underpinning, especially the imagery in Windsor-Forest (1713), which<lb/>
Rogers connects with the Stuart claim to the throne.6 In 1735 heraldry was used<lb/>
to mark Pope’s social status and commitments.<lb/>
The first section consists of the four epistles of An Essay on Man, addressed to<lb/>
Henry St. John, Viscount Bolingbroke, the leader of the opposition to Sir Robert<lb/>
Walpole’s ministry. It begins with an engraving including his coat of arms.7</p>

  <p>7. Heraldic designs accompanying these epistles and those noted in the next paragraph are<lb/>
illustrated below: Essay on Man (figs 6-7); To Cobham (figs 8-9); To Burlington (fig. 10); To Oxford<lb/>
(fig. 11); To Arbuthnot (fig. 12).</p>
</div>
<pb n="189"/>
<p>
The second section has four main epistles (those that became known through<lb/>
the Twickenham edition as the Epistles to Several Persons), plus a further three.<lb/>
Four of the seven are addressed to dissident aristocrats (Richard Temple, Viscount Cobham; Allen, Baron Bathurst; Richard Boyle, Earl of Burlington; and<lb/>
Robert Harley, Earl of Oxford), one is addressed to a woman from an ancient<lb/>
Roman Catholic family, Martha Blount, one to Joseph Addison, and one to the<lb/>
Queen’s physician, Dr Arbuthnot. Addison stands outside this group through<lb/>
his role in the Whig government, but the poem celebrates him for his attempt<lb/>
to recover the values of ancient Rome and for his friend, James Craggs, Jr. The<lb/>
engravings reinforce the social and historical standing of this group, illustrating<lb/>
the arms of Cobham, Burlington, Oxford, and, most strikingly, at the end of To<lb/>
Arbuthnot, those Pope imagined to be his father’s.<lb/>
</p>
<p>
In the third section that follows these epistles, Pope finds space to explore<lb/>
and justify his oppositional stance in relation to court and ministry, laying out<lb/>
precedents through his imitations of Horace and Donne. Both Horace and<lb/>
Donne, we are to understand, satirized the powerful, treating vice and folly<lb/>
with contempt:<lb/>
</p>
<quote>
Both these Authors were acceptable to the Princes and Ministers under whom they lived:<lb/>
The Satires of Dr. Donne I versify’d at the Desire of the Earl of Oxford while he was Lord<lb/>
Treasurer, and of the Duke of Shrewsbury who had been Secretary of State; neither of<lb/>
whom look’d upon a Satire on Vicious Courts as any Reflection on those they serv’d in.<lb/>
</quote>
<p>
(<hi>Advertisement</hi>, <hi>Satires of Horace</hi>, <hi>Works II</hi>, italics reversed)<lb/>
</p>
<p>
The most important of these imitations was The First Satire of the Second Book of<lb/>
Horace Imitated, a poem that in the title page to its first edition (Griffith 288) first<lb/>
named Pope esquire (‘Alexander Pope in Com. Midd. Esq;’) and that closed<lb/>
with a careful evocation of Pope’s social circle. The circle is aristocratic – ‘Envy<lb/>
must own, I live among the Great’ (line 133) – but these men enjoy a special<lb/>
oppositional distinction; they are ‘Chiefs out of war, and Statesmen out of place’<lb/>
(line 126).<note place="foot"><ref target="#note8">8.</ref> Imitations of Horace, ed. John Butt, Twickenham Edition of the Poems of Alexander Pope, vol. 4, 2nd edn (London: Methuen, 1953), 16–17. In subsequent references these editions will be referred to as Twickenham.<lb/></note>
This praise of Pope’s association with men out of power had been<lb/>
anticipated in the <hi>Letter to the Publisher</hi> signed by William Cleland in the<lb/>
Dunciad Variorum, where Pope was commended because ‘his Panegyricks’ were<lb/>
‘bestow’d only on such persons as he had familiarly known, only for such virtues as he had long observ’d in them, and only at such times as others cease<lb/>
to praise if not begin to calumniate them, I mean when out of Power or out of<lb/>
Fashion.’<note place="foot"><ref target="#note9">9.</ref> The Dunciad (1728) & The Dunciad Variorum (1729), ed. Valerie Rumbold, Longman Pope, III (Harlow: Pearson Longman, 2007), 133–4. Subsequent references will be to this edition.<lb/></note><lb/>
In a footnote Pope gave the names of Wycherley, Walsh, Trumbull,<lb/>
Bolingbroke, Oxford, and Craggs, but in the Works he expanded the focus to<lb/>
include significant aristocratic and political figures such as Cobham, Bathurst,<lb/>
and Burlington.<lb/>
</p>
<p>
In this third section the dignity of Pope’s friendships is represented not by<lb/>
engravings but by a motto, a line of the poem, distinguished by capitals, in both<lb/>
Horace’s Latin and Pope’s English:<lb/>
</p>
<pb n="190"/>
<p><hi>Uni Æquus virtuti atque ejus amicis</hi><lb/>
<hi>To Virtue only and her friends, a friend</hi><sup>10</sup><lb/>
But the motto had already been given its engraving, which is to be found on the<lb/>
title page of the Works. The medallion of Pope’s head, embraced by putti representing poetry and painting, that had closed the Odyssey, is now made the title<lb/>
page vignette, with the motto of virtue and friendship engraved round it.<lb/>
</p>
<p>In the fourth and final part of the Works, the Dunciad, the heraldry of friendship<lb/>
gives way to the heraldry of folly. The serious use of coats of arms in the Epistles<lb/>
in new engravings or modified Odyssey headpieces is replaced by a mock-heroic<lb/>
one. The mock-heraldic quality of these engravings has been well established<lb/>
in the accounts by Elias F. Engel, Jr., and Nicholas Savage. New headpieces<lb/>
complement the one with an owl and asses that was originally designed for the<lb/>
Dunciad Variorum and is now reused as a tailpiece. They are modelled on the lines<lb/>
of the Odyssey’s headpieces, but show those motifs being abused: the heraldic<lb/>
supporters become asses; asses play lyres and harps; the characteristic central medallion is occupied by Orator Henley or Harlequin; and the royal motto <hi>‘Nemo me impune lacessit’</hi> is given to these emblems of folly. The Dunciad heraldry<lb/>
indirectly reflects on the monarch and edges him into the satire.<sup>11</sup> Lurking in the<lb/>
background – it came to realization in the author’s ‘Declaration’ in the Dunciad<lb/>
in Four Books in 1743 – was the possible mockery of the royal arms themselves as<lb/>
they represented the Hanoverian dynasty. George II’s heraldic home was in the<lb/>
Dunciad rather than in the ‘Epistles’.<lb/>
</p>
<p>Although I believe Pope had a plan of this sort in mind for Works II, it was<lb/>
not straightforwardly realized. In the remainder of this essay I try to trace the<lb/>
development of the engravings from the Odyssey, through the Dunciad Variorum<lb/>
and some individually published epistles, into Works II, noting changes as the<lb/>
project developed. I examine some of the detail of Pope’s conception, but also<lb/>
the difficulty he experienced in realizing it in the books themselves.<lb/>

The contract between Pope and Lintot for the Odyssey had specific provisions for<lb/>
the engravings, making them Pope’s responsibility:<lb/>

Lintot, therefore, kept the engravings after they had been used in the <hi>Odyssey</hi>,<lb/>
but Pope had the right to use them. In the summer of 1732 he had discussions<lb/>
with Samuel Buckley about whether they could be used in the edition of Jacques<lb/>
Auguste de Thou’s <hi>Historiarum Sui Temporis</hi> (1733), a large showy book on excep-<lb/>
tionally thick paper that Buckley, the printer of the <hi>London Gazette</hi> and govern-<lb/>
ment informant, had been planning since before January 1728.13 In a letter of 16<lb/>
June [1732], Pope said he had had the articles of his contract checked and could<lb/>
now confirm his offer to lend the engravings to Buckley. These discussions with<lb/>
Buckley probably alerted Pope to the possibility of using the same engravings<lb/>
when later that year he made plans for collecting his works. In an agreement<lb/>
with Lawton Gilliver on 1 December 1732, he said he was planning to publish a<lb/>
series of epistles (<hi>To Burlington</hi> had been published a year before, on 14 Decem-<lb/>
ber 1731) and was willing to sell the publishing rights of each one to Gilliver for<lb/>
one year for £50, the rights then to revert to Pope. In a memorandum that was<lb/>
most probably written at the same time, Pope recorded his intention of allowing<lb/>
Gilliver to collect all these epistles and <hi>The Dunciad</hi> (of which Gilliver owned the<lb/>
copyright and had an edition in quarto and folio ‘lying by’) in <hi>The Works of Mr<lb/>
Alexander Pope. Volume the Second</hi>.14 The full range of the plan for the epistles<lb/>
was originally printed at the end of the first collected edition of <hi>An Essay on Man</hi>,<lb/>
published 20 April 1734, and is recorded by Spence.15<lb/>
The engravings from the <hi>Odyssey</hi> (headpieces, initials, and tailpieces) that<lb/>
Pope lent to Buckley and decided to reuse himself were designed by William<lb/>
Kent and engraved by Paul Fourdrinier.16 They have recently been subjected<lb/>
to a detailed and appreciative analysis by Nicholas Savage.17 I share his admi-<lb/>
ration for them. The headpieces are not deep, with the height a little more than<lb/>
a third of the width (the image approx. 6 cm high by 16 wide), but these propor-<lb/>
tions worked well on the quarto page of the subscription editions. Figure 1 is an<lb/>

example from <hi>Odyssey</hi>, Book I, reused for the <hi>Works II</hi> <hi>Epitaphs</hi>. These headpieces<lb/>
have a central circle (3·5 cm in diameter), which usually depicts a figure from the ac-<lb/>
tion of the poem. To either side of the circle are placed objects that evoke the world<lb/>
of the epic, either symbols of war (spears, shields, helmets) or of peace (lyres, goblets,<lb/>
bowls), often enwrapped by fertile vegetation. The whole is contained in a decorative<lb/>
frame. Usually the initials ‘W.K. inv.’ and ‘P.F. sc.’ appear on opposite sides of the foot<lb/>
of the plate. Savage argues persuasively for the close relation between the headpieces
<p><pb n="194"/>and the action that is to follow in the <hi>Odyssey</hi>, both in the scene depicted and in the<lb/>
surrounding objects. The engraved initials that accompany the headpieces are simple<lb/>
but with a frame that echoes that of the headpiece. The tailpieces are more freely<lb/>
imaginative, representing fantastic, sometimes grotesque, creatures or decorated objects.<lb/>

18. William Kent: <hi>Designing Georgian Britain</hi> illustrates many objects that have something in<lb/>
common with the engravings: the Prince of Wales’s barge with its mermaids and dolphins (fig. 12.1); the mermaids at the base of a settee in Wanstead House (fig. 17.10); a figure very like Leucothea in a chandelier for the King (fig. 19.8); mermaids at the foot of girandoles for the Leineschloss, Hanover (fig. 19.10); putti are pervasive.<lb/>
19. David Foxon, <hi>English Verse, 1701–1750</hi> (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1975), gives the date of publication as 13 March 1729 (P771–2).<lb/>

Vander Meulen (Charlottesville: University Press of Virginia for the Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia, 1991).<lb/>
21. For discussion of this frontispiece, see Engel, ‘The Dunciad Illustrations’, 164; Savage, ‘Kent as Book Illustrator’, 427.<lb/>

<pb n="195"/>
<p>In this context ‘Sculpture’ means engraving, and, contrary to the ridicule implicit<lb/>
in these lines, Pope had a childhood love for John Ogilby’s translation of Homer – ‘It was that great edition with pictures’ – even though he did not admire the translation.22<lb/>
David Foxon has argued that Ogilby’s illustrations even helped shape those of Pope’s Iliad.23<lb/>
I suspect Pope had a similar ambivalent relationship to the stamping of arms by Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle, referred to in the next line. Pope added a note to the Variorum edition explaining, ‘Langbaine reckons up eight Folio’s of her Grace’s; which were usually adorn’d with gilded Covers, and had her Coat of Arms upon them’ (Dunciad 1728 & 1729, 193).<lb/>
The covers of her books are regularly stamped with gold fleurons in the corners just like the book in Pope’s owl frontispiece, but I have not found a cover stamped with her arms.24<lb/>
What the Duchess of Newcastle does do, and in this she was followed in 1735 by Pope, is use coats of arms in headpieces.<lb/>
Ogilby in his Homer (1660) and Tonson in the subscription edition of Dryden’s Virgil (1697) included plates that at their foot contained the coat of arms of a subscriber.<lb/>
The coat of arms proclaimed the aristocratic patronage of the volume.<lb/>
But in the Duchess’s books the arms in the headpieces advertised not the patron’s but the author’s status.<lb/>
In <hi>Philosophical Letters: or, Modest Reflections upon Some Opinions in Natural Philosophy</hi> (London, 1664), a woodblock headpiece of the royal arms of England appears above the first poem, ‘To Her Excellency The Lady Marchioness of Newcastle, on her Book of Philosophical Letters’ and is then used several more times.<lb/>
The deployment of heraldry is more sophisticated in the Latin translation of her life of her husband, <hi>De Vita et Rebus Gestis Nobilissimi Ilustrissimique Principis, Guilielmi, Ducis Novo-Castrensis</hi> (London, 1668), where elements of the Ogle (a star and crescent) and Cavendish (simplified bucks’ heads caboshed [without neck]) arms are combined with differing supporters to represent different aspects of his career.<lb/>
How far this practice may have influenced Kent in preparing Pope’s headpieces (they similarly deploy central arms with putti supporters) it is difficult to determine, but the illustrations in the Dunciad Variorum and Works (1735) show a similar complexity, exploring the ways heraldry might be used not only to decorate a book but to reinforce its themes.<lb/>
When it came to designing the Dunciad Variorum, the splendid engraving on the title page – an ass carrying a burden of books – was supplemented by a headpiece for Book I modelled on the Odyssey headpieces and later used in the Works (figure 3).<lb/>
I agree with Savage that this headpiece, like the owl, it is likely to be Kent’s work (‘Kent as Book Illustrator’, 427).<lb/>
Such engagement is very much in keeping with his patron Burlington’s support for the publication of the Variorum.<lb/>
In a letter George Sherburn dates 23 December 1728, Pope reveals that Burlington has acted for him by showing some papers to the<lb/>

engravings, to Kent. It is highly likely that while Burlington was helping Pope<lb/>
protect himself from prosecution, Kent was illustrating his book. A letter from<lb/>
the same period suggests that the Burlingtons had pre-publication knowledge<lb/>
of the frontispiece, Pope interpreting it as a representation not of the King but<lb/>
of himself: ‘I beg my Lady Burlington’s Patronage of the Ass &amp; the <hi>Dunciad</hi>,<lb/>
me and my burden.’25 When the three lords (Burlington, Oxford, and Bathurst)<lb/>
protected Pope by temporarily buying the copyright to the <hi>Dunciad Variorum</hi>, a later as-<lb/>
signment makes it clear that Burlington was the leading figure, while Kent was<lb/>
one of the witnesses.26<lb/>
In the centre of the <hi>Dunciad Variorum</hi> headpiece, later used in the <hi>Works</hi>,<lb/>
where an action of the Odyssey might be depicted, is the head of an owl, crowned<lb/>
with a jester’s cap; his supporters are two asses; the foliage that customarily links<lb/>
the design consists of thistles. J. Paul Hunter points to the proximity of the asses’<lb/>
ears to the ‘Ear of Kings’ in the <hi>Dunciad Variorum</hi> just below the headpiece, in the<lb/>
second line of the poem. A multivalent indication of Pope’s attitude lies in the<lb/>
motto ‘<hi>Nemo me impune lacessit</hi>’: no one attacks me with impunity. The motto<lb/>
is that of the Order of the Thistle. Pope had shown an interest in the thistle<lb/>
as a symbol in his first Pastoral, in a riddle that marked the union of Scotland<lb/>
and England, the thistle having replaced the French lily in the first and fourth<lb/>
quarters of the national shield.27 Pope’s riddle was possibly designed to honour<lb/>
Queen Anne, who had revived the Order of the Thistle in 1703, but she was<lb/>
only repeating the more significant revival of her father, James II of England<lb/>
and VII of Scotland, in 1687. This was inescapably a Scottish and, in origin, a<lb/>
Stuart order. Mengel notes the suitability of the thistle as an emblem for satire<lb/>
and suggests possible connection with ideas of Scottish stupidity, but the motto<lb/>
fits as uncomfortably with George II as it does with the owl dunce, both of<lb/>
whom were being attacked with impunity. Pope claimed in the <hi>Works</hi> that the<lb/>
<hi>Dunciad Variorum</hi> had been presented to the King: ‘We are willing to acquaint<lb/>
posterity that this Poem (as it here stands) was presented to King George the<lb/>
Second and his Queen, by the hands of Sir R. Walpole, on the 12th of March<lb/>
1728/9’ (<hi>Works II, Dunciad</hi>, 87). William Kupersmith points to Erasmus ‘<hi>Similes habent labra lactusas</hi>’, which is equivalent to the English ‘A thistle is a fat<lb/>
salad for an ass’s mouth’.28 A bad patron (including the King) and bad writers<lb/>
go together.</p>

  <head>Collected Horatian Satires and Essay on Man</head>
  <p>
    The first opportunity to try out William Kent’s <hi rend="italic">Odyssey</hi> engravings as accompa-<lb/>
    niments to Pope’s poems came with the collected editions of <hi rend="italic">An Essay on Man</hi> (Foxon P850–3, pub-<lb/>
    lished 20 April 1734) and of the Horatian Satires <hi rend="italic">II.i</hi> and <hi rend="italic">II.ii</hi> (Foxon P893–5, 4 July 1734). The col-<lb/>
    lections seem to have been planned together, with some <hi rend="italic">Odyssey</hi> engravings being retouched to suit their new role<lb/>
    and some left unchanged. Both collections were printed with reissue in the <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> <hi rend="italic">II</hi> in mind, and,<lb/>
    though in some cases that plan did not come to fruition, the engravings did reappear when <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> <hi rend="italic">II</hi> was<lb/>
    published a year later. Although the two Satires were published over two months later than <hi rend="italic">An Essay on Man</hi>, it was<lb/>
    one of their engravings that proved most significant for the <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> the following year.<note place="foot">Foxon, English Verse, P893–5, gives the date of publication as 4 July 1734. Although the collected Essay on Man was issued in the usual three formats, I suspect there were no large-paper folios of the Satires issued. The ESTC does not record one and Foxon’s possible example, P895, has no engravings.</note> There are no headpieces to the Satires, only tailpieces to mark the ends of the parallel Latin and English texts, and there is no room for a tailpiece at the end of the Latin of Satire <hi rend="italic">II.ii</hi>. Of the three illustrations, two were simply taken from the <hi rend="italic">Odyssey</hi>: the Latin of Satire <hi rend="italic">II.i</hi> closes on p. 18 with an altar adorned with the image of the helmeted Minerva,<note place="foot">I have followed Pope’s practice, using the Latin names in his Index.</note> an ornament that originally appeared at the end of <hi rend="italic">Odyssey</hi> Book XVII; the English of Satire <hi rend="italic">II.ii</hi> closes on p. 40, with the goblet Mulius ‘crown’d / With purple juice’ at the end of <hi rend="italic">Odyssey</hi> Book XVIII. Neither engraving seems particularly appropriate to its poem, though they are concerned with wisdom and feasting. But the vignette at the end of the English of Satire <hi rend="italic">II.i</hi> (p. 19) — the one that was to find its way to the <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> title page — is appropriate and changes had been made to enforce its significance (figure 4).

    It had originally appeared at the end of the last book of the <hi rend="italic">Odyssey</hi>, where Kent abandoned the usual task of illustrating the poem in order to symbolize his friendship and collaboration with Pope. Two putti, representing poetry and painting, embrace above a medallion of Pope’s head. One putto holds a lyre, and a sheet of text and a palette lie below the medallion. The paper is marked ‘W. Kent inv.’ while below it is ‘P. Fourdrinier sc.’<note place="foot">The engraving is No. 17 in William Kurtz Wimsatt, The Portraits of Alexander Pope (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1965), 125–6. Wimsatt traces Pope’s subsequent use of the image.</note> For the collected edition of the Satires the symbolism of the vignette was broadened to include all Pope’s friends. Added to the medallion is a quotation from the poem, ‘UNI ÆQVVS VIRTVTI ATQ. EIVS AMICI’, the words Pope had capitalized in the text since its first publication on 15 February 1733, and imitated as ‘to Virtue only and her friends a friend’. Pope had found in Kent’s affectionate commemoration a visual representation of friendship founded on virtue. This symbolism proved of growing importance in shaping the illustration of Pope’s books in the next few years. We

Pope had published the four epistles of <hi>An Essay on Man</hi> in folio independently at intervals between February 1733 and January 1734, but he published all four together in quarto and large and small folio in April 1734.<lb/>
The single epistles were decorated with simple woodblock printer’s ornaments, but the collected edition, perhaps because the aim was to reuse it in the <hi>Works</hi>, called for something more elaborate.<lb/>

The change would be similar to the more radical adjustments to some of the headpieces. An exceptionally full account of changing a plate, though for a later period, is given in Roy J. L. Cooney, ‘Chart Engraving at the Admiralty’s Hydrographic Department, 1951–1981’, <hi>Journal of the Printing Historical Society</hi>, 25 (1996), 31–46.

Buried in the surrounding debris in the title-page engraving are contrary maxims,<lb/>
largely taken from scholasticism, though not without reference to contemporary<lb/>
debates. The reasons for rejection of the tag furthest left, and most important, <hi>a priori</hi>, are made clear by Warburton’s note on those who take the ‘high Priori<lb/>
road’ in the Dunciad: ‘those who, instead of reasoning from a visible World to an in-<lb/>
visible God, took the other road; and from an invisible God (to whom they had given<lb/>
attributes agreeable to certain metaphysical principles formed out of their own<lb/>
imaginations) reasoned downwards to a visible world in theory, of Man’s Creation’.35<lb/>
The next phrase is <hi>substantiae immateriales</hi> (immaterial substances), an impor-<lb/>
tant idea in the first part of Aquinas’s <hi>Summa Theologiae</hi>, the centre of a series of<lb/>
questions about men and angels.36 Next comes <hi>locus [est] ubi</hi>, which I suspect,<lb/>
on the basis of the sketchy skulls that lie beneath, is short for <hi>Hic locus est ubi<lb/>
mors gaudet succerre vitae</hi> (this is the place where death delights in aiding the<lb/>
living), the inscription over the University of Padua’s anatomical theatre. Then<lb/>
comes <hi>universale a parte rei</hi> (the universal part of the thing), a much despised<lb/>
position in the debate about universals, and said by Bayle to be ‘a mere subtlety<lb/>
of Metaphysics, and . . . generally exploded now by the best Philosophers as a<lb/>
dispute about words only’; it is also mocked in the <hi>Memoirs of Martinus Scriblerus</hi>.<lb/>
Finally come <hi>ens rationis</hi> (an abstract logical entity) and <hi>Essentia intelligibil[es]</hi><lb/>
(intelligible essences), both instances of the abstract knowledge rejected here by<lb/>
Pope and by Bolingbroke in his philosophy.38 The engraving is well proportioned<lb/>
in relation to its pages, but neither inventor nor engraver is identified, and, in<lb/>
comparison with its companions by Kent, it lacks boldness and clarity; the mot-<lb/>
tos seem to testify to a lack of confidence in the visual symbols’ ability to speak<lb/>
to the reader. I suspect Pope was the inventor and that he may have had help<lb/>
from Bolingbroke.<lb/>
At the end of the ‘Design’, explaining his conception of the poem, Pope<lb/>
placed the vignette that had been adapted from the end of the Odyssey to illustrate<lb/>
Satire II.i with the motto <hi>UNI ÆQVVS VIRTVTI ATQ. EIVS AMICI</hi>. That<lb/>
symbol of friendship complemented and highlighted the meaning of the head-<lb/>
piece that then appeared on the first page of the poem. The early editions of the<lb/>
epistle, with the title <hi>An Essay on Man. Address’d to a Friend</hi>, had begun <hi>Awake!<lb/>

<p>Gaius Laelius, the friend of Scipio Aemilianus, was famed for wisdom and friendship. His name prefixes the title of Cicero’s <hi>De Amicitia</hi>, a work in whose dialogue he plays a leading part. The name also provided a further link between <hi>An Essay on Man</hi> and Horace’s <hi>Satire II.i</hi>, where Laelius appears with Scipio, listening happily to Lucilius’ satires (lines 62–74). In Pope’s imitation Scipio becomes the Earl of Peterborough and Laelius Lord Bolingbroke (Pope himself immodestly supplying the place of both Lucilius and Horace, lines 127–32). The appearance of Bolingbroke’s name, instead of Laelius’s, in the first line of the new collected poem, therefore, made specific the connections that already existed between the two poems. It must nonetheless have been a shock to those who had not seen Pope as willing to ally himself with opposition to Walpole and the Hanoverian court to read the first lines:<lb/>
Awake! my St. John! leave all meaner things<lb/>
To low Ambition and the Pride of Kings.<lb/>
In the new context, it is difficult to see how ‘the Pride of Kings’ can avoid reflecting on George II.</p>
<p>The declaration of Bolingbroke’s importance to the poem is reinforced by the headpiece, which takes one of the <hi>Odyssey</hi> engravings and places Bolingbroke’s coat of arms at its centre (<hi>figure 6</hi>). This headpiece had been the first to appear in the <hi>Odyssey</hi>, with a profile of Homer in the centre, heading ‘A General View of the Epic Poem’ on p. i. The alteration stands out through its white background (no hatching), and faintness. The accompanying initial ‘A’ is from <hi>Odyssey, IV</hi>. Bolingbroke is not, of course, being accorded quite the same status as Homer held in Pope’s <hi>Odyssey</hi>, but he is the aristocratic friend who is to share the new investigation: ‘Let Us . . . expatiate free, o’er all this Scene of Man’ (lines 3–5). In 1715 Bolingbroke had lost his titles and property as punishment for his flight to the court of the Pretender at St Germains, but they had been restored after his pardon in 1723, though he was not allowed to take his place in the House of Lords.39 He was at this time leading the opposition to Walpole and symbolized in himself the friend who in his independence presented a challenge to the new order. The arms in the engraving projected the public as well as the private man.</p>
<p><hi rend="bold">Works II (1735)</hi><lb/>
When Pope came to plan the details of <hi>Works II</hi>, probably sometime in the autumn of 1734, he recognized that the theme of aristocratic friendship symbolized by the headpiece to <hi>An Essay on Man</hi> could be used to shape the first half of his volume and offer an illuminating contrast to the second half. A major decision was to place the ‘<hi>UNI ÆQVVS VIRTVTI ATQ. EIVS AMICI</hi>’ vignette on the title page. In 1717 a large poster-sized portrait of Pope had served as a frontispiece; now the author was presented as a classic by a simple medallion in which</p>

<p>
his image was surrounded by the profession of virtuous friendship. Initially Pope<lb/>
may have intended to follow up this design with heraldic headpieces for his friends<lb/>
adapted from the <hi>Odyssey</hi> headpieces, but at a later stage, while various poems<lb/>
were in press, he obtained fresh engravings of these arms from Kent and included<lb/>
them instead. When the ‘large Quarto’ was advertised in the <hi>Grub-street Journal</hi> on<lb/>
24 April 1735, it was with ‘Copper Plates, design’d by Mr. Kent’ (Griffith, 2:287).<lb/>
</p>
<p>
Different engravings show up in the different formats of the <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>. In the case<lb/>
of the first poem in the collection, <hi>An Essay on Man</hi>, the large-paper folios used the<lb/>
sheets of the collected edition of 1734 (Foxon P851). I suspect that by this point in<lb/>
his career Pope had recognized that large-paper folios were difficult to sell. The<lb/>
subscription editions of the Homer translations had been in quarto and readers<lb/>
who needed to make up large folio sets would have been difficult to identify. For<lb/>
the <hi>Iliad</hi>, 250 large-paper folios were printed, but I should be surprised if Pope<lb/>
and Gilliver persisted with so many. From the number of surviving copies, it<lb/>
seems that the large-folio edition of the Works was quite small.40<lb/>
</p>
<p>
For the quarto, however, <hi>An Essay on Man</hi> was newly printed, and Pope took the opportunity to replace the modified <hi>Odyssey</hi> headpiece with a new one (<hi>figure 7</hi>). The result is bolder and clearer. The supporting falcons have been removed and the motto has been taken out of the central oval and placed on an outside ribbon. The lyres are still there but the foliage is wrapped gracefully in circles round them. Pope clearly liked the heraldic effect of the original Odyssey adaptation and was prepared to pay for an engraving that presented it more clearly. I suspect the design was Kent’s, though only Fourdrinier has signed it.41<lb/>

<p>
The poem that follows the <hi>An Essay on Man</hi> and introduces the second sequence of epistles also starts with variant forms of the heraldic headpiece. To Sir Richard Temple Lord Viscount Cobham begins in the quarto (<hi>figure 8</hi>) with another adapted <hi>Odyssey</hi> engraving (from Book V), and in the folio with a new specially designed one (<hi>figure 9</hi>). In the thick-paper copy of the enhanced <hi rend="italic">Works II</hi> (Griffith 514) that Pope seems to have published in 1739, the Odyssey headpiece appears unaltered. Presumably the sheet containing the first page must have been printed first back in 1735 (the most expensive copies impressed while the type was clean), and sent off to the rolling press, where the unaltered engraving was used. Before the appropriate sheet of the ordinary paper quarto arrived, the engraving must have been altered (perhaps all this activity was in Fourdrinier’s shop), and before the large folio was impressed the new engraving must have been prepared.<lb/>

Pope changed his mind about the order of the four epistles that begin this second section. They ended up To Cobham, To a Lady, To Bathurst, and To Burlington, but in the quarto Cobham’s second page is numbered ‘48’ and Bathurst’s ‘8’. The folio was tidied up and impressed later, but it was from the same setting of type and its first page number in this section, ‘8’, suggests a merely partial<lb/>

There are many oddities of signatures<lb/>and paper in this sequence in the quarto but it is noteworthy that all the poems<lb/>except <hi>To a Lady</hi> begin with a single leaf. The reason must be that the numbers<lb/>of the epistles on the dropped heads (‘<hi>EPISTLE I</hi>’ etc. as in figure 8) had to be<lb/>changed, and that was done by supplying a new leaf.42 The present first page of<lb/>quarto <hi>To Cobham</hi>, therefore, was printed at a late stage, but before the type was<lb/>rearranged for the folio. The page lacks line numbers on both recto and verso<lb/>and it has two readings corrected in the <hi rend="bold">Errata</hi>: line 9 ‘the fate of all Extremes<lb/>are such’ and line 14 ‘those from Guess’. The large paper folio catches and cor-<lb/>rects the first but not the second of these. The quarto page must then have been<lb/>printed just too early to catch the revised headpiece. If it had not been printed<lb/>quite so hastily, we might never have seen the adapted <hi>Odyssey</hi> ornament.<lb/><lb/>The adapted headpiece in the quarto <hi>To Cobham</hi> (figure 8) comes from <hi>Odyssey Book V</hi>. Savage is surely right in suggesting that Kent’s original decision to<lb/>represent Calypso’s cave as a grotto was intended as a tribute to Pope; his own<lb/>sketches of Pope and his grotto are celebrated.43 The central circle in which<lb/>Ulysses was building his ship has been replaced by a simplified version of Cob-<lb/>ham’s arms, though Mercury, flying to bring Jupiter’s message, is still visible to<lb/>the left. The replacement engraving (figure 9), which does bear Kent’s initials,<lb/>is more straightforwardly heraldic. Whereas in the adapted engraving the shield<lb/>has only one eagle displayed, the new one has quartered arms with the eagles<lb/>displayed in the first and fourth quarter. Although it is not altogether clear, the<lb/>second and third quarters have two bars each, charged with three martlets. Sir<lb/>Bernard Burke says these are the arms of the kingdom of Mercia, borne by the<lb/>family since the Temples were earls of Mercia.44 But although<lb/>the shield is heraldically correct, the supporters are not. The lions rampant on the adapted <hi>Odyssey</hi> headpiece have been replaced by the putti of the ‘<hi>UNI ÆQVVS VIRTVTI ATQ. EIVS AMICI</hi>’ ornament. Temple’s aristocratic dignity is playfully<lb/>surrounded by symbols of friendship.<lb/><lb/>The putti will reappear as supporters on the ornament that concludes <hi>To Oxford</hi>, but the next two poems. <hi>To a Lady</hi> and <hi>To Bathurst</hi> lack heraldic orna-<lb/>ments, though <hi>To a Lady</hi> concludes with the <hi>Odyssey</hi> fountain engraving. I have no<lb/>explanation for the non-appearance of Bathurst’s arms. His poem has no engrav-<lb/>ings, and neither does <hi>To Burlington</hi> in the quarto, but in the large-paper folio <hi>To Burlington</hi> concludes with an ornament that was obviously designed by Kent (who<lb/>initials it) as a headpiece (figure 10). The Greek key molding that provides a plat-<lb/>form for the design is characteristic of many of the <hi>Odyssey</hi> headpieces, including<lb/>figure 6, as is the firm oblong shape of the plate, occupying the width of the page.<lb/>I think Pope uses this headpiece (and the one for <hi>To Oxford</hi>) as a tailpiece in order

to prepare for the presentation of his father’s arms at the end of <hi>To Arbuthnot</hi>,<lb/>
where it constitutes a conclusion to his argument and self-presentation. Although<lb/>
the Burlington ornament lacks the putti as supporters, Kent has again substituted<lb/>
his own ideas. Burlington’s funerary monument at Londesborough church shows<lb/>
the same shield but the supporters are a rampant lion and a dog.45 Here in the<lb/>
<hi>Works</hi>, where the supporters should be, are wreathed roundels containing heads<lb/>
in profile. Pope’s poem celebrates Burlington’s publication of <hi>Palladio’s Designs of</hi><lb/>
the Baths, Arches, Theatres, &amp;c. of <hi>Ancient Rome</hi>, that is, <hi>Fabbriche antiche disegnate da Andrea Palladio Vicentino</hi> (1730), and Kent balances Andrea Palladio on the left<lb/>
with Inigo Jones on the right, just as the outer staircase at <hi>Chiswick House</hi> does,<lb/>
with statues.46 Burlington, very much the aristocrat, takes his place at the centre<lb/>
of a trio of architects, their status as artists balanced by his authority as a scholar.<lb/>
Although the image of Jones bears some resemblance to the much-copied portrait by Van Dyck in the Hermitage, that of Palladio bears closer resemblance<lb/>
to Kent himself.47<lb/>

<p>
‘To Mr. Addison’, which in the quarto immediately follows the poem to Bur-<lb/>
lington, has a preceding row of flowers and a concluding tailpiece from Odyssey<lb/>
Book I. The engraving represents an eagle with Minerva’s spear and helmet,<lb/>
evoking lines quoted by Nicholas Savage:<lb/>
Abrupt, with eagle-speed she cut the sky;<lb/>
Instant invisible to mortal eye . . . 48<lb/>
Although To Addison has a line on eagles, ‘And little Eagles wave their wings in<lb/>
gold’ (30), the tailpiece eagle is not little and if an engraving was to be chosen to<lb/>
reflect the poem it would surely have been ‘UNI ÆQVVS VIRTVTI ATQ. EIVS<lb/>
AMICI’, where Pope is himself depicted on a medal and the embracing cherubs<lb/>
reflect the relationship in the poem’s most famous lines:<lb/>
The verse and sculpture bore an equal part,<lb/>
And Art reflected images to Art.49<lb/>

both the Garter motto, encircling the shield, as in Burlington’s arms, and Ox-<lb/>
ford’s own motto. In the most striking adjustment, however, he has replaced<lb/>
the tall, adult angels who are formally supporters with the two putti that have<lb/>
become customary for the volume. Oxford too is embraced as a friend.<sup>50</sup>

<p>The final poem in the second book of epistles, <hi>To Arbuthnot</hi>, brings the serious<lb/>
heraldry of the volume to a close with a large engraving of Pope’s father’s arms,<lb/>
or Pope’s idea of them (figure 12). This heraldic engraving reveals the purpose<lb/>
of the others by including Pope himself in the distinguished group of friends. The
<pb n="210"/>
general nature of this engraving was first identified by <hi>Howard Erskine-Hill</hi>, who<lb/>
suggested it was ‘<hi>heraldically competent</hi>, but does not purport to be Pope’s own<lb/>
coat of arms’.51 I am sympathetic to the desire to absolve Pope from the sin of<lb/>
misrepresentation – he was not using it formally or claiming he had approval<lb/>
from the College of Heralds – but I think this must nevertheless be a serious and<lb/>
important claim about his family and its status. Sir <hi>Anthony Wagner</hi> in his study<lb/>
of the arms of outstanding figures from the history of the <hi>United Kingdom</hi> names<lb/>
Pope as one of those who were not armigerous, but he also points to <hi>Joshua Reynolds</hi><lb/>
and <hi>John Locke</hi> as among those who used arms ‘but without apparent<lb/>
right.’52 Pope used them, I suspect, only in the specific context of this poem, and<lb/>
it may not have mattered to him at all that they were not ratified by a College<lb/>
that served a regime he did not respect. In so advertising his family, Pope may<lb/>
have recollected the introduction by <hi>Caleb D’Anvers</hi> to his family history in<lb/>
<hi>Craftsman</hi> 28 (13 March 1727): ‘Though it is generally esteem’d an indecent, as<lb/>
well as an invidious <hi rend="bold">Task</hi>, for a Man to mention himself, or extol his own Fam-<lb/>
ily; yet in some Cases it becomes not only excusable, but even praise-worthy;<lb/>
especially when it is made necessary for our Self-defence’. D’Anvers goes on to<lb/>
associate his family’s place in ‘<hi>Books of Heraldry</hi>’ with a patriotism ‘exposed to<lb/>
‘Obloquy and Reproach’.53<lb/>
<lb/>
To <hi>Arbuthnot</hi> clearly responds to the attacks on Pope by <hi>Lord Hervey</hi>, or Lady<lb/>
<hi>Mary Wortley Montagu</hi>, or both, in <hi>Verses Address’d to the Imitator of Horace</hi> (March<lb/>
1733) and by Hervey in <hi>An Epistle from a Nobleman to a Doctor of Divinity</hi> (November<lb/>
1733). Pope says as much in the ‘<hi>Advertisement</hi>’ prefixed to the first edition; his<lb/>
notes to <hi>To Arbuthnot</hi> refer to the <hi>Verses</hi>; and a new edition of the <hi>Verses</hi> seems to<lb/>
have been printed especially to accompany <hi>To Arbuthnot</hi> in January 1735. The<lb/>
heraldic image at the end of <hi>To Arbuthnot</hi> responds to a particular attack on him<lb/>
in the <hi>Verses</hi>:<lb/>
<quote>none thy crabbed Numbers can endure,<lb/>
Hard as thy Heart, and as thy Birth obscure.54</quote><lb/>
<lb/>
In an ‘<hi>Advertisement</hi>’ prefixed to the first edition of <hi>An Epistle from Mr. Pope to<lb/>
Dr. Arbuthnot</hi> which was substantially repeated in the <hi>Works</hi> Pope says he had no<lb/>
thought of publishing the poem till it pleas’d some Persons of Rank and Fortune to<lb/>
attack in a very extraordinary manner, not only his Writings, but his Morals, Person, and<lb/>
Family: of which he therefore thought himself obliged to give some account. (Works II,<lb/>

<lb/>
The impression given by Pope’s note is reinforced by the engraving. The central<lb/>
shield is quite a small part of the design. On it the arms of his father’s family are<lb/>
impaled with those of his mother’s, as those families are identified in the note<lb/>
to the poem. The dextra has the arms of the Oxfordshire Pope family to which<lb/>
the Earl of Downe belonged. In Guillim’s <hi>A Display of Heraldry</hi> (1724), 183, they<lb/>
appear under Baronets: ‘Sir William Pope of Wilcot in Oxfordshire, Kt. since an<lb/>
Irish Earl, viz. Earl of Downe. Parted per Pale [halved vertically], Or and Azure<lb/>
[gold and blue], on a Chevron between three Griffins Heads erased [torn off ],<lb/>
four Fleurs de Lys, all Counterchanged [reversing colours]’. The engraving has<lb/>
only three fleurs-de-lis, but Kent probably felt pressed for space.<lb/>
<!-- Image link to be added during image export workflow --><lb/>
The sinister has the arms of the Turnor or Turner family. They are illustrated and described<lb/>
56. Sir Bernard Burke, The General Armory of England, Scotland, Ireland, and Wales (London,<lb/>
1884), s.n. agrees about the four fleurs-de-lis and adds a crest of griffins’ heads.<lb/>
</p>
<pb n="212"/>in Guillim, 323: ‘He beareth Ermines, on a Cross quarter pierced Argent [silver],<lb/>
four Fer-de-molines sable [black millrind crosses], by the Name of Turner; and is<lb/>
the Coat-Armour of Sir Edward Turner of Parendon in Essex, Kt. Chief Baron of<lb/>
his Majesty’s Court of Exchequer’. Sir Bernard Burke in the General Armory has<lb/>
similar arms for the Turnor family of Stoke Rochford in Lincolnshire but has five<lb/>
fers-de-molines for the Turner family of York. Again, Pope and Kent may not<lb/>
have been concerned for details; no crest has been supplied for the coat of arms.57<lb/>
Kent has supplied his design with the usual foliage, but the putti are absent.<lb/>
This is a memorial to Pope’s parents and to right and left are what I take to be<lb/>
torches, signifying Pope’s devotion to his family home and values, flames that he<lb/>
keeps alive. The motto, ‘<hi>HEU PIETAS HEU PRISCA FIDES</hi>’, is a quotation<lb/>
from Book VI of the <hi>Aeneid</hi> (line 878) where Anchises laments the early death of<lb/>
Marcellus, ‘a youth of passing beauty in resplendent arms’. The Loeb translation<lb/>
is ‘Alas for his goodness! alas for his chivalrous honour’, but in this context it<lb/>
might be ‘Alas for faithfulness to natural ties and duty! Alas for old faith!’58<lb/>
The engraving unquestionably represents Pope’s commitment to his family, its<lb/>
values, and its religion, even though he and his friends find themselves in a form of<lb/>
internal exile. The original context of the quotation gives it a curious doubleness:<lb/>
the lament is for Pope’s parents but also, through the allusion to Marcellus, for<lb/>
their love of him. The motto and the grandeur of the engraving counterbalance<lb/>
the simple ‘<hi>Et Sibi</hi>’ designed for Pope’s own place on his parents’ monument in<lb/>
Twickenham church. Ironically, in a poem famous for its condemnation of Ad-<lb/>
dison, the words had been used as the epigraph for the Spectator paper recording<lb/>
the death of Sir Roger de Coverly.59<lb/>
The two Horatian satires that follow <hi>To Arbuthnot</hi> have the same illustrations<lb/>
as in the separate quarto, Satire II.i bringing its picture of Pope’s life to a close<lb/>
with the ‘<hi>UNI ÆQVVS VIRTVTI ATQ. EIVS AMICI</hi>’ vignette. The Donne<lb/>
satires that follow have simply two closing tailpieces from the <hi>Odyssey</hi>, Proteus<lb/>
from Book IV, here half a boar (lines 617–18), and the familiar siren. The section<lb/>
Epitaphs that comes between the epistles and satires and the Dunciad, however,<lb/>
has an appropriate headpiece from the <hi>Odyssey</hi>, that from Book I (the initial from<lb/>
Book IV) where Phemius is depicted singing ‘the direful woes Which voyaging<lb/>
from Troy the Victors bore’ and is rebuked by Penelope, ‘ev’ry piercing note<lb/>
inflicts a wound’ (Twickenham, 9:53, lines I.422–3, 440). It now has on it<lb/>
‘<hi>DIS MANIBUS</hi>’, short for ‘dis manibus sacrum’, meaning ‘sacred to the ghost gods’<lb/>
or ‘in memory of’. This is a case of skilful appropriation. Two pages later a tailpiece<lb/>
of an altar with a bucranium and trident evokes ‘King Nestor’s sacrifice of a heifer<lb/>
to Pallas Athene’60 and reinforces the sombre mood.<lb/>
The Dunciad that begins the fourth and final main section of <hi>Works II</hi> quarto<lb/>
provides new illustrations developing the motifs found in the Variorum edition of<lb/>
57. Sir Bernard Burke has a crest with a lion holding a fer-de-moline, s.n.<lb/>
58. <hi>Virgil</hi>, trans. H. Rushton Fairclough, rev. G. P. Goold, 2 vols (Cambridge, MA: Harvard<lb/>
University Press, 1999), 1:594, lines VI.861 and 878. Unfortunately the engraver for the<lb/>
Works has misunderstood his instructions: all the copies seen read ‘PLETAS’.<lb/>
59. The <hi>Spectator</hi>, ed. D. F. Bond, 5 vols (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1965), 4:339 (No. 517,<lb/>

60. Savage, ‘Kent as Book Illustrator’, 423. The tailpiece comes from <hi>Odyssey</hi>, Book III.
<pb n="213"/>
1729. These engravings provide the heraldry of the dunces, as Mengel and Savage have demonstrated in their important essays.<lb/>
The headpiece to the first book of the Dunciad Variorum is now used again as a tailpiece at the end of the Arguments, at the end of Book I, at the end of Book II, and at the end of the notes to Book II.<lb/>
Each book of the quarto, however, has a new headpiece.<lb/>
The first picks up the asses and owl motif from the Variorum headpiece, and, in a mockery of the Odyssey’s harps and lyres, has asses playing their instruments with their hoofs, while an owl in a bow tie admires himself in a mirror.<lb/>
The engraving, in an Odyssey-like elaborate frame – the Variorum headpiece did not have a frame – conjures up a world of elaborate narcissistic self-congratulation.<lb/>
In the nearby initial, repeated in Book III, a creature Engel and Savage take to be a mole attempts to read with the help of spectacles.<lb/>
At the beginning of Book II comes a headpiece with its central circle devoted to one of Orator Henley’s medals, with Henley or Curl pictured in the stocks.<lb/>
The initial on this page has Mercury’s caduceus crowned with a fools’ cap.<lb/>
The final headpiece refers to the pantomimes criticized in the poem, with harlequin submitted by a monster to a perverse pattern of death and birth.<lb/>
Dr. Joseph Hone, of the University of Newcastle, points out to me with characteristic generosity that the monster is modelled on that of Hogarth’s ‘Masquerades and Operas’ (1724).<lb/>
Kent, himself Hogarth’s butt in that engraving, joins himself to the critique of popular culture.
</p>
<p>The story of the engravings to Works II is, then, a sad one of missed opportunity.<lb/>
Pope had a theme for his collection that could be represented first by heraldic headpieces and then by mock-heraldry.<lb/>
He had a brilliant if eccentric designer in William Kent, who was willing to share his interests and to celebrate their collaboration, but because of the hand-to-mouth way of proceeding with the compilation of the volume – Lawton Gilliver and John Wright were very closely supervised and afflicted with changes of plan and improvised solutions – Pope’s conception was not fully realized.<lb/>
And the Odyssey tailpieces, bold and ingenious as they were, distracted attention from the thematically conceived illustrations.<lb/>
If Pope and Lintot had not quarrelled so seriously over the Odyssey, we might have had a better book.
</p>
<head>Postscript: The Afterlife of a Mercury Plate</head>
<p>Pope’s use of these engraved ornaments did not end with the 1735 edition of Works II.<lb/>
They appeared in individual publications and in the prose works, and the treatment of a Mercury tailpiece (figure 13), shown here from its appearance in Pope’s quarto Prose Works II, 1741 (Griffith 531), p. 1, is particularly intriguing.

<pb n="215"/>published, Griffith says, on 11 January 1739, but dated 1738.<lb/>There it faces the second Bolingbroke headpiece from the Works, which was appropriate because<lb/>Bolingbroke was the Epistle’s addressee. That volume (Griffith 504) was designed<lb/>to enable purchasers of the 1735 Works quarto to update their collection, and<lb/>used sheets from Griffith 490 (Epistles of Horace Imitated), which Griffith thinks was<lb/>published in May 1738.62 There are only two surviving copies of Griffith 490,<lb/>so it may be unwise to allow it too much weight, but other evidence points to<lb/>these sheets having been printed by May 1737. The Mercury engraving appears<lb/>again above the Preface to the quarto and large-paper folio Letters of Mr. Alexander<lb/>Pope, and Several of his Friends (Griffith 454 and 456), the official edition of<lb/>Pope’s correspondence, published on 19 May 1737, but here the engraving has<lb/>been given a ribbon running across the bottom of the image, with the inscription<lb/>&lsquo;Vellem Nescire Litteras!&rsquo;, Nero’s response when required to sign a death warrant,<lb/>&lsquo;Would that I had never learned to write&rsquo; (figure 14).63 The Preface ends<lb/>with more evidence of the willingness to change engravings at this point, with an<lb/>adaptation of the Oxford tailpiece from the Works, the putti now supporting a<lb/>central circle that once held Oxford’s arms but now has an inscription in capitals,<lb/>the oddity of the breaks showing the space was not designed for the inscription:<lb/>CVM.DESIDE.<lb/>RIO.VETERES.<lb/>REVOCAMVS.AMO<lb/>RES.<lb/>ATQUE.OLIM.MIS<lb/>SAS. FLEMVS.<lb/>AMICITIAS.64<lb/>The same engraving is repeated above the first letter.<lb/>By May 1737, therefore, the Mercury ornament had been changed, which<lb/>means that the quarto sheets of the First Epistle of the First Book in Epistles of<lb/>Horace Imitated must have been printed before that date. So too had been the<lb/>version of the Key to the Lock that appeared in The Works of Mr. Alexander Pope in<lb/>Prose, Volume II in 1741 (Griffith 530–1), where the Mercury engraving appears<lb/>at the end of the piece in an intermediate state, with its ribbon but without the<lb/>lettering (figure 15). The Key was printed, therefore, after the sheets of Epistles of<lb/>62. The first edition, Griffith 480, which does not have the engravings (perhaps because<lb/>there is no room for them) and does not begin with St. John’s name, has 1737 on the title page<lb/>and was published on 7 March.<lb/>63. The story is told by Suetonius, &lsquo;Nero&rsquo;, Suetonius, trans. J. C. Rolfe, 2 vols (Cambridge,<lb/>MA: Harvard University Press, 1914), 2:101 (§X).<lb/>64. &lsquo;The regret with which we recall our old loves, and weep for long-lost friendships&rsquo;,<lb/>Catullus, XCVI [&lsquo;Ad Calvum de Quintilia&rsquo;], lines 3–4 (Catullus, Tibullus, Pervigilium Veneris,<lb/>trans. F. W. Cornish, J. P. Postgate, and J. W. Mackail, 2nd edn, rev. G. P. Goold (Cambridge,<lb/>MA: Harvard University Press, 1962), 168–9). The Loeb text and others I have consulted read<lb/>&lsquo;renovamus&rsquo; (renew, give new life to).
<pb n="216"/><lb/>
Horace Imitated but before the Preface to the 1737 <hi>Letters</hi>.65<lb/>
But by far the most surprising appearance of this Mercury engraving<lb/>
is in its original unribboned and unlettered state at the beginning of the letters<lb/>
in the 1741 volume, <hi>The Works of Mr. Alexander Pope in Prose, Volume II</hi> (Griffith 530–1) (figure 13).<lb/>
It would be expected to appear in the same revised state as it had at the beginning of the<lb/>
1737 <hi>Letters</hi>. It forms the headpiece to a letter from Pope to Swift of 18 June 1714.<lb/>
Lord Orrery had left Dublin on 5 July 1737, according to Sherburn, bringing<lb/>
with him Pope’s letters to Swift. He wrote to Swift saying Pope had the letters on<lb/>
23 July 1737.66 But this evidence of the plain engraving suggests that Pope had<lb/>
already started printing his letters to Swift before the engraving appeared in its<lb/>
enhanced form in the <hi>Letters</hi> on 19 May 1737. In a case like this, the engraving<lb/>
affords valuable bibliographical evidence. Examination on the Traherne collator<lb/>
does not suggest there were two engravings, and such duplication would in any<lb/>
case be most unlikely. The whole affair of the publication of the Pope and Swift<lb/>
letters clearly invites further investigation, as does the rest of Pope’s printing in<lb/>
quarto and folio in the summer of 1737, but it is difficult to avoid the conclusion<lb/>
that Pope had printed some of his letters to Swift before July 1737; perhaps he<lb/>
had saved copies of them; perhaps he made them up.<lb/>
65. David Foxon thinks it was intended with other prose pieces for the 1735 Works (<hi>Pope and the Early Eighteenth-Century Book Trade</hi>, 133), but that now seems unlikely.<lb/>
The First Epistle of the First Book of Horace would not have been ready in 1735.<lb/>

<head>JONATHAN RICHARDSON, CHARLES CHAUNCY, AND<lb/>
THE MANUSCRIPTS OF POPE</head><lb/>
<p>by John Considine*<lb/></p>
<p>As for his <hi>Essay on Man</hi>’, recalled the man of letters Jonathan Richardson the younger, in a volume of reflections published in 1776, five years after his<lb/>
death,<lb/>
I was witness to the whole conduct of it in writing, and actually have his original MSS.<lb/>
for it, from the first scratches of the four books, to the several finished copies, (of his own<lb/>
neat and elegant writing these last) all which, with the MS. of his <hi>Essay on Criticism</hi>, and<lb/>
several of his other works, he gave me himself, for the pains I took in collating the whole<lb/>
with its printed editions, at his request, on my having proposed to him the ‘making of an<lb/>
edition of his works in the manner of Boileau’s’.1<lb/></p>
<p>The literary manuscripts which Pope gave to Richardson ‘include’, as Margaret Smith remarks in the <hi>Index of English Literary Manuscripts</hi>, ‘some of the most<lb/>
important surviving MSS of Pope’.2 They were, as we shall see, accompanied<lb/>
in Richardson’s library by collated printed editions of Pope and some non-literary manuscripts. Their movements for a century and more after Richardson’s<lb/>
death have been summed up — not quite accurately — by Maynard Mack: they<lb/>
‘made their way, without ever going on public sale, into the collection of Charles<lb/>
Chauncy, and finally, in 1887, to the marketplace’, the last point being minimally<lb/>
elaborated on in an endnote which reads ‘See the Sotheby sale catalogue, July<lb/>
1887’.3 Charles Chauncy was a near-contemporary of Richardson the younger’s,<lb/>
a rich English physician and antiquary; the name is also spelt Chauncey, as in the<lb/>
Oxford DNB and several of the sources quoted below.<lb/></p>
<p>1. <hi>Richardsoniana, or, Occasional Reflections on the Moral Nature of Man</hi> (London: Printed for J. Dodsley, 1776), 264; for Pope and the Richardsons, see William<lb/>
Kurtz Wimsatt, <hi>The Portraits of Alexander Pope</hi> (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1965), 73 – 89 and 137–222, esp. 142 –143, Helene Koon, ‘Pope’s First Editors’, <hi>Huntington Library Quarterly</hi> 35.1 (1971), 19 –27, and James McLaverty, <hi>Pope, Print, and Meaning</hi> (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), 212 –213; for Pope and Boileau, see McLaverty, op. cit., 87–90, 210 –214.<lb/></p>

<p>3. Maynard Mack, <hi>Collected in Himself: Essays Critical, Biographical, and Bibliographical on Pope and Some of his Contemporaries</hi> (East Brunswick, NJ: Associated University Presses, 1982), 325, 346 n 24.<lb/></p>
<p>* I am grateful to Karen Thomson, who helped me to start thinking about this topic, and to James McLaverty, for his valuable comments on a draft.<lb/></p>
<pb n="222"/>
<p>The impressive terseness of Mack’s account has led to its being overlooked.<lb/>
For instance, Smith’s IELM entry records that ‘The first major dispersal of<lb/>
Pope’s MSS in the salerooms did not occur until the W. Nassau Lees Sale, at<lb/>
Christie’s, 20 [sc. 30] July 1889’ (2), and gives an account only of the sub-set of<lb/>
the Chauncy manuscripts which reached that sale, two years after the one which<lb/>
Mack mentions. Likewise, the current online catalogue record for the Morgan<lb/>
Library manuscript MA 348, the first extant draft of the <hi>Essay on Man</hi>, reads<lb/>
‘Presented by Pope to Jonathan Richardson (1694–1771); Dr. Charles Chauncey,<lb/>
and by descent in his family until at least 1860; General William Nassau Lees; his<lb/>
sale (Christie’s, 30 July 1889, lot 79)’. Moreover, the Sotheby catalogue of 1887<lb/>
to which Mack refers the reader is not widely available, and although it tells us<lb/>
much about the Richardson–Chauncy manuscripts of Pope, it does not tell the<lb/>
full story. The following is therefore the first full account of the eighteenth- and<lb/>
nineteenth-century career of the most important group of manuscripts of Pope.<lb/>
</p>
<head>I</head>
<p>Richardson evidently retained the manuscripts which Pope had given him until<lb/>
his death. They were sold in April 1776, by Baker and Leigh, with three associ-<sup>4</sup><lb/>
ated lots. The catalogue describes the four lots as follows:<lb/>
</p>
<p>3170 Two Copper Plates of Mr. Pope’s Head, one in a Circle, the other in a<lb/>
Whig [sic], by Richardson,<sup>5</sup><lb/>
3171 Most of Mr. Pope’s Poems in their first Sketches in his own hand Writing,<lb/>
and some first Editions corrected,<lb/>
3172 Mr. Pope’s Pastorals, Manuscript, neatly wrote,<lb/>
N. B. This Copy is that which passed through the Hands of Walsh, Congreave,<lb/>
Mainwaring, Garth, Granville, Southerne, Sir W. Trumbull, Lord Halifax, Lord<lb/>
Wharton, Marq. of Dorchester, Duke of Bucks, &c. The Alterations from this Copy<lb/>

Charles Chauncy did not enjoy his purchase for long, for he died on Christ-<lb/>
mas Day, 1777. His will (PROB 11/1038/53) bequeaths ‘all my Books Mss Book<lb/>
Cases Pictures’ and the like to his brother Nathaniel. When he first drafted the<lb/>
will, which is dated 10 March 1776, he added that he desired that his collections<lb/>
‘may not be seperated or disposed of but kept entire and together’ to be inher-<lb/>
ited in due course by whichever of the three sons of his deceased sister Martha<lb/>
Snell should be thought most deserving of them (Charles himself was childless,<lb/>
and neither Nathaniel nor his other brother Philip had sons, so the three Snell<lb/>
brothers were his only male nephews).9 However, he subsequently struck this<lb/>
passage out, and the will as proved on 8 January 1778 makes no restriction as to<lb/>
the future of the books or collections. Nathaniel Chauncy kept them together for<lb/>
his lifetime, but his collections of books and other objects were dispersed, ‘by his<lb/>
express order’, in a series of sales by auction after his death in 1790.10<lb/>
However, the Pope manuscripts were not among the books sold at this time.<lb/>
A note in one of them records that it passed from Charles Chauncy to Na-<lb/>
thaniel, and thence to one of the Snell nephews, another Charles, who married<lb/>
Nathaniel’s daughter Amelia, and changed his name in 1783 to Charles Snell<lb/>
Chauncy.11 Since the whole collection was still together in 1887, it must in fact all<lb/>
have passed to Charles Snell Chauncy. By his will (PROB 11/1500/155, fol. 254r),<lb/>

The manuscript of a draft of the ‘Preface’ to the 1717 Works was, in the nineteenth century, preserved in an album of materials relating to Pope which also included one of his letters to Jonathan Richardson the elder (Smith, ‘<hi>Alexander Pope</hi>’, 16–17 and PoA 400), but only very loosely could this have been called Pope’s ‘Dedication to all his Works’.

appears to have been no quarrel over the fact that the form of words ‘printed<lb/>

Charlotte Chauncy by her will, proved in 1841 (PROB 11/1940/325), but Charlotte<lb/>
appears to have predeceased her, and the movement of the books within the<lb/>
Chauncy family for the next 46 years is unclear. In 1887, however, the barrister<lb/>
and antiquary William Thorpe wrote a letter to the <hi>The Times</hi> about a completely<lb/>
different manuscript with a Chauncy provenance, in which he stated that ‘I am<lb/>
informed by the family solicitor, Mr. Teesdale ... that when the Chauncy collections<lb/>
were disposed of by ... Sotheby in 1790, the autographs were retained by<lb/>
the family, who have now sent them to the hammer’ (Times, 17 September 1887,<lb/>
7; repeated in essentials <hi>The Times</hi>, 4 October 1887, 3). The solicitor in question, John<lb/>
Marmaduke Teesdale, had married a Chauncy (see his obituary in <hi>Law Times</hi>, 16<lb/>
June 1888, 128), so he was in a good position to know the family history.</p>

<pb n="225"/>
<p>volume begins with <hi>An Essay on Man</hi>.<lb/>
14 It has not previously been identified as a Richardson–Chauncy book. The second volume, ‘<hi>The Essay on Man, with ... errata in first edition</hi>’, must be ‘the volume now in the Berg collection [79-432] that contained among other Pope material a copy of the Essay on Man and the manuscript of the First Satire of the Second Book of Horace’, for this copy, annotated in a hand or hands other than Pope’s, has Chauncy ownership inscriptions, and was, as we shall see, with the other Richardson–Chauncy books when Elwin collated it.<lb/>
478 The <hi>The Dunciad</hi>, first edition, large paper, frontispiece, filled with MS. Notes and corrections from the first Broglio MS. by Mr. Pope himself, uncut | 8vo. Dublin, 1728<lb/>
₤13 to Thompson. This is the 1728 <hi>The Dunciad</hi>, actually annotated by Jonathan Richardson rather than by ‘Mr. Pope himself’, which is now in the Berg collection of the New York Public Library (Smith, ‘Alexander Pope’, entry PoA 32), and was reproduced in facsimile with commentary by David Vander Meulen in 1991. Vander Meulen notes that this copy and the other two <hi>Dunciad</hi>s listed here all have the manuscript date 1777 on their title pages, which ‘seems to indicate that in that year they were part of a single collection, probably that of Dr. Charles Chauncy ... or his brother and heir Nathaniel. . . . But then parts of the trail become obscure’.<lb/>
We can now be confident that all three <hi>Dunciad</hi>s were Richardson–Chauncy books; that the collection was still Charles’s until the end of 1777 (he died on 25 December but his will was not proved until 1778); and that they remained in the family until 1887, when they were sold as Lots 478, 479, and 480. Thompson bought six other lots in the 1887 sale; the six others all went to the library of William Nassau Lees, sold in 1889; this is therefore doubtless the annotated <hi>Dunciad</hi> which was Lot 75 in Nassau Lees’ sale, described by Smith (‘Alexander Pope’, 2) as unlocated. It is, by the way, an odd coincidence that just as Charles Chauncy bought the Richardson manuscripts of Pope in April 1776 and died twenty months later, in December 1777, so Nassau Lees bought them in July 1887 and died twenty months later, in March 1889.<lb/>

<pb n="227"/>
<p>library, was described as an autograph MS of a text which had not been repre-<lb/>
sented at all in the 1889 sale’, namely this one, the <hi>Epistle on Taste</hi>, or <hi>Epistle to<lb/>
Burlington</hi>. We now see that it had been sold as from Charles Chauncy’s library in<lb/>
1887, but not to Thompson, and had therefore not passed to Nassau Lees. The<lb/>
1887 and 1911 catalogue entries both appear to refer to the same manuscript, an<lb/>
autograph of the <hi>Epistle to Burlington</hi> with a Chauncy provenance. Smith (<hi>Alexander Pope</hi>, 2–3 and PoA 76) discusses the likelihood of its identification with<lb/>
Morgan Library MA 352, in which one leaf of the <hi>Epistle to Burlington</hi> is followed<lb/>
by eight leaves of the <hi>Epistle to Dr. Arbuthnot</hi>. The Morgan fragment was indeed<lb/>
collated by Jonathan Richardson.19 And, as we shall see below, its readings cor-<lb/>
respond to those transcribed by Whitwell Elwin from a manuscript which, when<lb/>
he saw it, was in the possession of the Chauncy family.<lb/>

486 <hi>Ethic Epistles I to III</hi>, Autograph MS. of Pope, with numerous alterations<lb/>
and corrections by himself | 4to.<lb/>

₤20 to Thompson. This fair copy — ‘a superb example of [Pope’s] calligraphy’<lb/>
as Peter Croft called it — must be what Richardson meant by ‘the several<lb/>
finished copies, (of his own neat and elegant writing)’ which he possessed,<lb/>
‘several’ referring to the different ‘books’ of the <hi>Essay on Man</hi> identified in<lb/>
the previous clause in Richardson’s memoir.20<lb/>

The two manuscripts of the <hi>Essay on Man</hi> in the 1887 sale both passed from<lb/>
the Chauncy family via Thompson to Nassau Lees. One of the Nassau Lees<lb/>
copies (484 above) is, as we have just seen, at the Morgan Library; the other,<lb/>
Lot 80 at the Nassau Lees sale, was catalogued as <hi>Ethic Epistles I–III</hi>, and can<lb/>
surely be identified both with the present copy and with the manuscript of the<lb/>
<hi>Essay on Man</hi> now at Harvard, which bears the same title (Smith, <hi>Alexander<lb/>
Pope</hi>, 2–4 and PoA 165). The Harvard manuscript was offered for sale by<lb/>
Dodd, Mead and Co. of New York in 1910.21<lb/>
</p>
<pb n="228"/>
<p>manuscripts of the <hi>Essay on Man</hi>, the one now at the Morgan and the one now<lb/>
at Harvard, and that the latter was sold in 1887, 1889, and 1907, before being<lb/>
offered for sale by Dodd, Mead and Co. in 1910.<lb/>
Of interest to us here is the question of whether the postulated third manu-<lb/>
script could also have had a Chauncy provenance. Smith suggests that it could,<lb/>
arguing that the <hi>Epistle on Taste</hi> manuscript, 485 above, was catalogued as Lot<lb/>
111 in the Samuel sale with a note of its Chauncy provenance, and that the <hi>Ethic<lb/>
Epistles</hi> was catalogued as Lot 112, and ‘by virtue of its juxtaposition to Lot 111<lb/>
may also have come from Chauncey’. She also notes that a manuscript of <hi>Epistle<lb/>
IV</hi> of the <hi>Essay on Man</hi> was acquired by Pierpont Morgan in 1909, and argues<lb/>
that ‘this suggests that there were more Chauncy MSS in circulation than had<lb/>
reached the sale rooms in 1889’. So there were, as we have seen: the Chauncy<lb/>
family sold their manuscripts in 1887, and not all of these were bought by Nas-<lb/>
sau Lees to return to the market in 1889. But the only Pope manuscript with a<lb/>
definite Chauncy provenance which Smith can identify as having been sold after<lb/>
1889 without having been part of the Nassau Lees sale is the <hi>Epistle on Taste</hi><lb/>
manuscript which, as we have seen, was sold as Lot 485 with the Chauncy manu-<lb/>
scripts in 1887. There is no reason to believe that the Chauncy family withheld<lb/>
any of their literary manuscripts from the sale of 1887 for separate sale at around<lb/>
the same time, and the statement made at that time by their family lawyer sug-<lb/>
gests that they did not do so. In that case, if the Samuel manuscript of the <hi>Essay on<lb/>
Man</hi> is to be distinguished from the manuscripts now at the Morgan Library and<lb/>
Harvard, it was never a Chauncy manuscript. That is of course perfectly possible<lb/>
— Charles Chauncy bought all of Jonathan Richardson’s literary manuscripts of<lb/>
Pope apart from the <hi>Pastorals</hi>, but there were manuscripts which Richardson,<lb/>
and therefore Chauncy, never possessed, for instance the manuscript of <hi>Epistle IV</hi><lb/>
which has just been mentioned — but a hypothetical Chauncy provenance can-<lb/>
not be part of the argument for the existence of a third <hi>Essay on Man</hi> manuscript.<lb/>

his numerous alterations and corrections, wanting 8 lines at end. Transcript of the<lb/>

Pope’s, and is now Huntington HM 6009 (Smith, ‘Alexander Pope’, 2 and PoA<lb/>

<pb n="229"/>
<p>One final question remains to be asked about the Richardson–Chauncy manu-<lb/>
scripts in the period between their acquisition by Jonathan Richardson during<lb/>
the lifetime of Pope and their sale by the Chauncy family in 1887: what light is<lb/>
shed on them by the Elwin–Courthope edition of Pope, in which some of them<lb/>
are cited? Elwin wrote in his preface to the first volume, published in 1871, that<lb/>
Pope presented several of his manuscripts to the son of Jonathan Richardson, the portrait-<lb/>
painter. . . . Richardson’s interlined copy of the first quarto volume of Pope’s poetry passed<lb/>
into the hands of Malone, and was ultimately bought by Mr. Croker. The manuscripts<lb/>
which Richardson possessed in the handwriting of Pope were purchased by Dr. Chauncey,<lb/>
and are still the property of his descendants.<lb/>
<lb/>
‘Richardson’s interlined copy of the first quarto volume of Pope’s poetry’ is<lb/>
the copy of the 1717 <hi>Works</hi> presented by Pope to Jonathan Richardson the elder,<lb/>
bearing notes in Malone’s hand, which is now in the Berg Collection (Smith,<lb/>
‘Alexander Pope’, 12). This copy was, as Elwin reports elsewhere, annotated by<lb/>
Richardson the younger, but was evidently not included with the ‘first Editions<lb/>
corrected’ in the sale of 1776.<lb/>
Having been in Croker’s possession, it was no doubt among the materials of<lb/>
Croker’s on which Elwin founded his work, and readings from it occur in<lb/>
Elwin’s first two volumes.<lb/>
There are points at which Elwin appears to be citing, and strangely<lb/>
misrepresenting, Pope’s manuscripts, when I suspect that he is actually working<lb/>
from Richardson’s annotations.<lb/>
<lb/>
In his introduction to the third volume of the Elwin–Courthope edition,<lb/>
Courthope thanked Elwin ‘for his liberality in allowing me to use his transcript<lb/>
of the Chauncy MS., which throws so much light on the meaning of Pope’s sat-<lb/>
ires’; he referred again, a few pages later, to ‘the transcript which Mr. Elwin has<lb/>
made from the Chauncy MS.’<lb/>
This form of words suggests that Courthope did not realize that the transcript<lb/>
which Elwin had communicated to him included readings from multiple<lb/>
manuscripts.<lb/>
The first references to the ‘Chauncy MS.’ in the collations in this volume are in<lb/>
those to the <hi>Epistle to Bathurst</hi>, where its readings correspond to those of<lb/>
Huntington HM 6007 and HM 6008 (Lot 487)<lb/>

<lb/>above).29 It is then cited in the <hi>Epistle to Burlington</hi>, where its readings correspond<lb/>
to those of the first leaf of Morgan Library MA 352 (Lot 485 above).30 It is cited<lb/>
in the <hi>Epistle to Dr. Arbuthnot</hi>, where its readings correspond to those of subsequent leaves of Morgan Library MA 352 (Elwin had remarked in his introduction<lb/>
to the first volume that a copy of this poem was among ‘the manuscripts which<lb/>
Richardson possessed in the handwriting of Pope’).31 And it is cited in the <hi>The First<lb/>
Satire of the Second Book of Horace</hi>, where its readings correspond to those in the<lb/>
Berg manuscript formerly attached to a printed copy of the <hi>Essay on Man</hi> (lot<lb/>
477 part 2 above).32 So, all of these ‘Chauncy MS.’ readings are, as we might<lb/>
have expected, from manuscripts which can be identified with those sold in 1887.<lb/>
Furthermore, Courthope noted in his edition of the <hi>Dunciad</hi> that ‘Jonathan Richardson corrected the first edition of the “Dunciad” from what he calls “the first<lb/>
Broglio MS.” His corrections have been transcribed by Mr. Elwin, and are here<lb/>
preserved’; as Vander Meulen has observed, ‘Undoubtedly Elwin transcribed<lb/>
Richardson’s notes from the current Berg copy’ (lot 478 above).33<lb/>
In one other reference to ‘the Richardson papers’, I think that Elwin uses a<lb/>
form of words which, although not inaccurate, is misleading: ‘The manuscript of<lb/>
Pope’s <hi>Pastorals</hi> is still preserved among the Richardson papers’.34 His further<lb/>
description makes it certain that this is the manuscript which was Lot 3172 at the<lb/>
sale of 1776, but this manuscript was, as we have seen, not bought by Chauncy,<lb/>
and although it is possible that it might subsequently have been bought as an<lb/>
addition to the collection of Pope manuscripts which had passed by inheritance<lb/>
through the generations of the Chauncy family, it seems unlikely that it would<lb/>
then have been kept from the sale of 1887 in which the collection was dispersed.<lb/>
Elwin presumably meant simply that the manuscript had a Richardson provenance — and, interestingly, that it was not alone. He specifies one of its companions: ‘The Richardson collection contains a manuscript in which the poet<lb/>
has transcribed from his <hi>Pastorals</hi> the various lines he thought defective, and ...<lb/>
referred the task of selection to Walsh, who has jotted down his decisions at the<lb/>
bottom of Pope’s remarks’.35 This is certainly the manuscript (Smith, ‘Alexander<lb/>
Pope’, PoA 274) which, having long been a companion to the autograph fair copy<lb/>
of the Pastorals, was sold separately from it at the Houghton sale of 1980, and was<lb/>
Lot 381 in the Roy Davids sale at Bonhams, 8 May 2013.<lb/>

<p>Studies of the phenomenon of binding independent drawings, engravings, autograph letters, and other documents into printed books in the late eighteenth <lb/>century have concentrated quite naturally on the elite social groups within which many of these extra-illustrated books were created.<lb/>Less examined are the artists and booksellers who supplied the market for those books and provided the prints and drawings that adorned them.<lb/>This paper explores that world by investigating the role of Horace Walpole’s printer and amanuensis Thomas Kirgate and the Harding family of booksellers and artists in creating three extra-illustrated copies of Walpole’s <hi>A Description of the Villa of Mr. Horace Walpole, youngest son of Sir Robert Walpole Earl of Orford, at Strawberry-Hill near Twickenham, Middlesex.

This edition had a complex printing<lb/>
history, but the essential points are that it was not published or circulated during<lb/>
Walpole’s lifetime, nor was it shown to the many visitors who obtained tickets to<lb/>
be shown Walpole’s celebrated and curious house and collection.<sup>2</sup></p>
<head>I</head>
<p>For the 1784 edition Walpole provided a preface, a brief but elegant testament<lb/>
of faith, accounting for his use of Gothic ornament at Strawberry Hill, celebrating the<lb/>
great cabinets from which his collection was acquired, noting the miniatures and historic<lb/>
royal portraits and other highlights of the collection, and concluding with a flourish of<lb/>
justification, part whimsical and part defiant, of the “<hi>small capricious house … built<lb/>
to please my own taste, and in some degree to realize my own visions.</hi>”<sup>3</sup> The<lb/>
body of the text then introduces the house and its setting, and proceeds to describe its<lb/>
interior, room by room. The decorative chimney pieces and plasterwork and other<lb/>
features are recorded, and there is a minute catalogue of the furniture, pictures,<lb/>
sculpture, bronzes, china, and curiosities that each room displayed, while the accompanying<lb/>
engravings show the exterior, the grounds, a number of the chimney pieces, and some of<lb/>
the major rooms.<lb/>
The detailed account of the house and its contents of the 1784 edition invited extra-illustration,<lb/>
and in Walpole’s immediate circle there were a number of sumptuous copies—such as<lb/>
Walpole’s own, with the ninety-six quarto pages of the 1784 edition inlaid into an elephant<lb/>
folio expanded to over two hundred pages.<sup>4</sup> He employed a succession of artists to<lb/>
provide illustrations and record his creation at Strawberry Hill, of whom the most prolific<lb/>
were Edward Edwards (1738–1806) and John Carter (1748–1817). Edwards provided watercolors<lb/>
that were engraved for the prints that appear in the 1784 edition of the <hi>Description</hi>, and<lb/>
Carter, an artist, antiquary, and polemist for the conservation of Gothic architecture, worked<lb/>
at Strawberry Hill through the 1780s.<lb/>
Walpole’s copy is matched for richness by that compiled by his correspondent Richard Bull<lb/>
(1721–1805)—but then Bull’s commitment to extra-illustration was heroic in its scale, and he<lb/>
illustrated at least sixteen titles from Walpole’s Strawberry Hill Press. His copy of the <hi>Description</hi><lb/>
is enriched by more watercolors by Carter than is Walpole’s copy. Various other generously<lb/>
illustrated copies of the <hi>Description</hi> from Walpole’s circle are known, including the copy<lb/>
compiled by Carter for himself, which contains his sketches for some of the finished</p>

</p>
<p>These issues have been discussed and analyzed in detail by Nicolas<lb/>
Barker in his edition of Charles Bedford’s copy of the <hi>Description</hi> printed for the<lb/>
Roxburghe Club.6 Barker summarizes the history of extra-illustration and Walpole’s<lb/>
involvement with James Granger and the Strawberry Hill Press and the print collec-<lb/>
tors Bull and Anthony Storer (1746 –99). He points out what an appealing subject<lb/>
the <hi>Description</hi> offered, with an increasing number of engraved images of Strawberry<lb/>
Hill becoming available on the market from the 1790s.7 These engravings were<lb/>
accessible to collectors outside Walpole’s circle—and for them the essential<lb/>
providers were the Harding family of booksellers and artists, at their shop in<lb/>
Pall Mall.<lb/>

<lb/>
<p>Silvester Harding (1745 –1809) trained as a miniature painter and exhibited<lb/>
at the Royal Academy from 1776. In 1786 with his younger brother Edward<lb/>
(1755 –1840) he opened a book and printseller’s shop in Fleet Street,<lb/>
moving in 1792 to 102 Pall Mall. They specialized in theatrical and historical<lb/>
portraits, and in 1789 –93 published in numbers <hi>Shakespeare Illustrated by an<lb/>
assemblage of Portraits and Views</hi>, and in 1793 an edition of <hi>Anthony Hamilton’s<lb/>
Memoirs of Count Grammont</hi>, also illustrated with portraits. In the meanwhile<lb/>
Silvester Harding had been introduced to Strawberry Hill in the early 1780s by<lb/>
the merchant and art collector Nathaniel Hillier (c. 1707– 83) and became a<lb/>
great friend of Walpole’s printer Kirgate.8 From 1795 the Hardings published<lb/>
<hi>The Biographical Mirrour</hi>, a series of historical portraits with supporting text,<lb/>
and also in 1796 <hi>Bürger’s Leonora</hi> and in 1797 <hi>Dryden’s Fables</hi>, both with<lb/>
engravings after drawings by<lb/>

<p>Walpole’s protégée Lady Diana Beauclerk.<lb/>
In 1793 they published six plates to<lb/>
illustrate Walpole’s <hi>The Castle of Otranto</hi>, and these are often seen in those copies<lb/>
that had not already been sold and bound up of the sixth edition printed for<lb/>
Dodsley and Bodoni’s edition printed in Parma (both 1791). Sometime before<lb/>
1798 the partnership dissolved, Silvester moving along the street to 127, while<lb/>
Edward moved to 98 Pall Mall until in 1803 he was appointed librarian to<lb/>
Queen Charlotte, for whose amusement he grangerized a number of historical<lb/>
works.</p>

<p>Silvester Harding had two artist sons; Edward, who died young, and George<lb/>
Perfect Harding (1779/80–1853). George exhibited as a miniaturist at the Royal<lb/>
Academy from 1802 until 1840—in 1839 submitting <hi>The Library at Strawberry<lb/>
Hill, Seat of the Earl of Waldegrave</hi>, current whereabouts unknown. For about<lb/>
forty years, from 1804, he travelled the country copying portraits, carefully re‐<lb/>
cording dates and signatures. His watercolors are precise, finished, and compact,<lb/>
with sparing use of gold for rules and signatures. His notebooks of these travels<lb/>
survive at the National Portrait Gallery, four bound volumes of his <hi>List of Por‐<lb/>
traits, Pictures, in Various Mansions of the United Kingdom</hi>, the fourth volume<lb/>
containing a list of manuscripts and printed books illustrated by him, with a list of<lb/>
pictures in the possession of the Crown. The second volume, a 358-page manu‐<lb/>
script to which a table of contents and index are added, records the pictures he<lb/>
inspected at 141 properties, mostly country houses, but also universities, livery<lb/>
companies, and Inns of Court. At the foot of the title page is the note “Those<lb/>
that are mark’d thus X, have been copyed by G. P. Harding.” In that volume as<lb/>
in the others, most entries are of one page per property, a few extending to four<lb/>
or even five pages: for Tottenham Park in Wiltshire, for example, the seat of the<lb/>
Marquis of Ailesbury, Harding listed 101 portraits over five pages, of which six<lb/>
were marked with a cross as having been copied by him. But this, and all the<lb/>
other properties in the volume, is eclipsed by Strawberry Hill. In a list extend‐<lb/>
ing over twenty pages, with headings for the different rooms, Harding lists 433<lb/>
portraits, of which he notes with his cross that he had copied sixty-four. Where<lb/>
he adds commentary to the name of the sitter, he takes or adapts the text from<lb/>
the Description. And this wealth of images is in addition to the numerous portraits<lb/>
that his father had copied there.<note place="foot">9. NPG MS47. George Perfect Harding was the subject of a display at the National Por‐<lb/>
trait Gallery, “The Tudors Reimagined: George Perfect Harding c. 1779–1853” (2015). See<lb/>

<p>The watercolors and prints by the Hardings of portraits and other items from<lb/>
the collection at Strawberry Hill run from Silvester Harding’s introduction to the<lb/>
house in the early 1780s to George’s watercolor of the library, noted above, of<lb/>
1839. Of their published works, twenty-three of the 151 plates in the <hi>Biographical Mirrour</hi> are from portraits at Strawberry Hill, while in 1803 Silvester Harding<lb/>
published <hi>A Series of Portraits, to Illustrate the Earl of Orford’s Catalogue, of Royal and</hi><lb/>
</p>
<pb n="237"/>
<p>
<hi>Noble Authors</hi>, an eight-page pamphlet listing the authors’ portraits and the pages<lb/>
on which they appeared, providing the print collector with a checklist to work<lb/>
against. (A similar checklist for another title much favored by illustrators, <hi>A Copious Index to Pennant’s Account of London</hi>, was produced for the burgeoning army<lb/>
of illustrators by Thomas Downe in 1814.) The Hardings appear to have shared<lb/>
access to Strawberry Hill with Silvester and Edward senior’s brother-in-law, the<lb/>
engraver William Bawtree, and such access seems to have been continued to be<lb/>
afforded to them when after Walpole’s death the house was occupied by Anne<lb/>
Damer, who was there until 1811. It has long been known that Kirgate oper<lb/>
ated with increasing autonomy at the end of Walpole’s life (hence his reprinting<lb/>
<hi>Strawberry Hill Press</hi> items in the year of Walpole’s death, presumably for his<lb/>
own benefit), and he is the essential link in enabling the Hardings to accumulate<lb/>
the images they needed to satisfy the demands of their print collector customers.

Kirgate had originally been employed by Walpole for five months in 1765 to<lb/>
finish off printing the second edition of the <hi>Anecdotes of Painting</hi>, and was then<lb/>
discharged when Walpole left for Paris. He was re-engaged in April 1768 and<lb/>
stayed with Walpole until Walpole’s death nearly thirty years later, working as<lb/>
printer, secretary, and general factotum. Much has been written on his role in<lb/>
re-printing earlier Strawberry Hill pamphlets at the same press in the year of<lb/>
Walpole’s death, and the extremely modest sum of £100 left him in Walpole’s<lb/>
will.<note n="10" place="foot">See <hi>The Forlorn Printer</hi>; A. T. Hazen, <hi>A Bibliography of the Strawberry Hill Press</hi> (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1942), 12–14; Barker, <hi>Horace Walpole’s Description of the Villa</hi>, 99; and Clarke, <hi>The Strawberry Hill Press &amp; its Printing House</hi>, 47–53.</note> What is quite clear is that before leaving Strawberry Hill in 1797, Kirgate<lb/>
printed an address card for himself, “Thomas Kirgate, Late Printer at Straw<lb/>
berry-Hill, Print and Bookseller, No 127, Pall-Mall”—that being the address<lb/>
of Silvester Harding’s shop. He subsequently moved to a house in Vine Street,<lb/>
Piccadilly, where he sold books and curiosities. Kirgate’s role in satisfying the<lb/>
needs of collectors and extra-illustrators cannot be better summarized than in an<lb/>
undated letter he wrote to Charles Bedford which has been quoted elsewhere,<lb/>
but merits repeating here:

<p>This letter is revealing on a number of levels. It shows Kirgate as facilitator, orchestrating the acquisition of missing prints for the collector while complaining about the exploding market in portrait prints, and displays George Harding’s role as provider of drawings. It also illustrates the somewhat obsessional needs of the collector, has Kirgate acknowledging that he is himself compiling an extra-illustrated copy of the <hi>Description</hi>, and offers the possibly illusory prospect of “finishing” one’s extra-illustrated book.</p>
<p>Kirgate offered his own extra-illustrated copy by raffle in 1801. The broadsheet advertising the sale, <hi>“For the Benefit of T. Kirgate, Late Printer at Strawberry-Hill,”</hi> announced that:</p>
<quote>Each Leaf of the above Book is inlaid on a large Sheet of fine Dutch paper; the Pages bordered with a double Line of red Ink; the Title printed in three Colours, and ornamented with a Drawing of a Foliage of Strawberries. The whole Book adorned with upwards of Two <note place="margin">crossed through in manuscript and amended to three</note> Hundred Drawings and Prints, illustrative of the external and internal Parts of that delightful Seat, its Furniture, Pictures, Sculptures, Antiquities, &amp;c. &amp;c. Several of the Prints are scarce and valuable, and most of the Drawings were made on Purpose for the Book, by the Friends of <hi rend="caps">T. KIRGATE</hi>, who has been Fourteen Years in forming the Collection.<ref target="#fn12">12</ref></quote>
<p>Potential subscribers could inspect the book at Harding’s shop in Pall Mall. The current whereabouts of the book are unknown, but it appears to have been a particularly fine example of Kirgate’s industry in the years after he had left Strawberry Hill. Another example of his endeavors is an elephant folio scrapbook of images of Strawberry Hill and its contents, perhaps used to display to customers what images could be acquired or copied for the extra-illustrated copy they ordered: this is now in the collection of Lord Waldegrave of North Hill. There is also at the Lewis Walpole Library a volume compiled by Kirgate consisting of lists of images from the house. Firstly, there is a two-page list of forty-six pictures and sculptures there, with page references to the <hi>Description</hi>, twenty-four of them crossed through (perhaps as having already been obtained) and with Kirgate’s comments in red ink against almost all of the others—two prints of Rubens’s house “both scarce,” Anne Hyde Duchess of York “A foreign print, 8vo. scarce,” others “Engraving by Harding” or “In my List,” while of four portraits in the Gallery described on page 52 he notes “I cannot say positively if there are Prints of these, the Pictures hanging too high to examine.”</p>
<p>This is followed by a list dated 26 July 1800 of twelve drawings, with their <hi>Description</hi> page numbers and prices, and then two longer lists, one “A List of the Prints and Drawings as placed in Lord Orford’s Illustrated Copy of the <hi>Description of Strawberry-Hill</hi> printed there in 1784 by Thos. Kirgate,” the other a list of the 335 prints and drawings in his own copy. The historical portraits</p>

<pb n="239"/><p>that formed such a prominent part of the Strawberry Hill collection were pregnant<lb/>
with possibilities for any print collector who knew his Granger, and Kirgate and<lb/>
the Hardings were only too happy to meet that demand.</p>
<p>Kirgate died in 1810, and the sale of his collection was conducted by King<lb/>
&amp; Lochée over ten days that December, immediately followed by a further day’s<lb/>
supplemental sale. The auction catalogue contained multiple copies of Strawberry<lb/>
Hill Press items, over eighty lots on the second day, and in the supplemental sale<lb/>
ninety-eight lots of <hi>Books Printed chiefly at Strawberry-Hill.</hi><lb/>
On the ninth day there were more than two hundred drawings and prints of the house in twenty-nine<lb/>
lots, with the artists listed including Carter, J. C. Barrow, Edwards, the Hardings,<lb/>
and Kirgate himself. This was followed by sixty-nine lots of prints in the supple-<lb/>
mental sale, many of them related to Strawberry Hill. Both Edward and George<lb/>
Harding appear among the successful bidders (Silvester had died the previous<lb/>
year) and it seems clear that what was on offer was the remains of Kirgate’s stock.</p>
<p>IV</p>
<p>The first of the three extra-illustrated copies of the <hi>Description</hi> here discussed is<lb/>
chosen because it represents precisely what a collector with no connection to<lb/>
Walpole or his circle could have acquired from the Hardings’ shop in Pall Mall.<lb/>
Unlike the two other copies that will be considered, it is known and recorded: it<lb/>
has been at the Huntington Library, San Marino, for over one hundred years,<lb/>
having been acquired by Huntington at the sale of Robert Hoe’s library. It is<lb/>
bound in green morocco with a title page printed in black, red, and blue, and it<lb/>
has a total of seventy-three additional items bound into it, the large majority of<lb/>
which have been listed by Nicolas Barker.13</p>
<p>The backbone of the illustrations is formed by thirty-two portrait prints by<lb/>
the Hardings, largely stipple engravings from portraits at Strawberry Hill, of<lb/>
which the earliest is dated 1792, the latest 1806. These stipple engravings are<lb/>
almost all after Silvester Harding, who with his brother Edward was the leading<lb/>
figure in providing drawings for engraving in stipple, whereas it appears that his<lb/>
son George was primarily a painter and copyist.</p>
<p>In addition to the Harding stipple engravings, there are twenty-nine miscel-<lb/>
laneous prints or printed items. These vary from the readily obtainable, such as<lb/>
the views of Strawberry Hill from <hi>Délices de la Grande Bretagne</hi> (1791) and<lb/>
from <hi>Boydell’s History of the River Thames</hi> (1794–96), to items more directly as-<lb/>
ociated with the Press at Strawberry—for example, Edwards’s scarce etching of<lb/>
Kirgate, scarce because (as Edwards explained to Bull in a letter of 18 December<lb/>
1784, when presenting him with a copy) “Mr. Walpole thought fit to be offended<lb/>
at its being done & therefore its publication will be suppressed.” Bull of course<lb/>
pasted Edwards’s print and his letter into his copy of the Description, whereas the
<pb n="240"/>anonymous compiler of the Huntington volume had to be content with the print.<lb/>But he was also able to obtain a copy of Walpole’s printed <hi>Rules for obtaining a Ticket to see Strawberry Hill</hi> of 1784, and six drawings and six watercolors, quite possibly all of them by the Hardings, including Charlotte de Tremouille, Countess of Derby, the defender of Latham Castle in the Civil War, from the painting in the Tribune, a highly finished portrait in court dress, and Sir Christopher Wray, Queen Elizabeth’s Lord Chief Justice, and Sir Robert Walpole in the robes of the Order of the Bath, from the Great North Bedchamber.<lb/>The prints underline the strength of Walpole’s holdings of 16th- and 17th-century portraits, though there is a real contrast between the quality of the Hardings’ finished watercolors, which have been commended as painstaking in their detail and accuracy, and their stipple engravings, which when seen en masse can appear repetitive and somewhat mechanical.<lb/>The six watercolors and six drawings enliven the volume, as does Walpole’s <hi>Rules for obtaining a Ticket</hi> from the Strawberry Hill Press. But this is Strawberry Hill at one remove, the images taken in the very last years of Walpole’s life, or after his death. There is no involvement whatever by Walpole, and also none by that central figure in the dissemination of Strawberry Hill Press in the years after Walpole’s death, Thomas Kirgate.<lb/>What our second copy of an extra-illustrated <hi>Description</hi> shows is what Kirgate could offer from his stock to a favored customer. The copy does not provide any evidence as to its original purchaser, but it was subsequently acquired by Henry Probasco (1820–1902), a Cincinnati hardware magnate, and was listed in the catalogue of his collection that he had printed in 1873 —with the result that it is in turn listed by A. T. Hazen in his <hi>Bibliography of the Strawberry Hill Press</hi>, where he describes it from Probasco’s catalogue entry, and suggests that it may have been the copy which was lot 411 on the second day of Kirgate’s sale.<sup>14</sup> This seems unlikely, as lot 411 is simply described as being the 1784 edition with plates, with no suggestion that it was extra-illustrated over and above the standard plates with which it was issued (none of the copies of the <hi>Description</hi> in Kirgate’s sale are described as extra-illustrated), and it is more likely that Kirgate sold the copy before his death. Curiously, what both Hazen and Lewis appear not to have realized was that in 1889 Probasco, who had suffered financial losses, sold his collection to the Newberry Library, Chicago, which is where the book remains.<sup>15</sup><lb/>14.

the wealth of extra-illustrated examples of the <hi>Description</hi> at Farmington.<lb/>
But Probasco’s copy has stayed at the Newberry and has never been fully described.<lb/>
The book is half-bound in mid nineteenth-century red morocco, with the Newberry’s label dated 1890 identifying it as part of Probasco’s collection.<lb/>
Many of the illustrations are annotated by Kirgate, but none of his notes are on the sheets of the bound volume, which would have been bound up after his death.<lb/>
The annotations consist of two notes in ink by Walpole, one recording the price he paid for Reynolds’s painting of the Ladies Waldegrave in the Refectory, the other mentioned below; twenty-two notes in ink on the prints and drawings by Kirgate; two images inscribed by G. P. Harding; pencil numbers by an unidentified hand, giving the page numbers of the text in which the items illustrated are described; and a few pencil notes in an unidentified hand, identifying the illustrations, and in one case mentioning the 1842 sale of the collection, so possibly made by whoever is responsible for the present binding.</p>
<p>As for the illustrations, these break down as thirty-four miscellaneous engravings; twenty-five portrait prints in stipple after drawings by Silvester Harding and published by the Hardings, nine of which also appear in the Huntington copy; three portrait prints by the Hardings but published by others; four watercolors by George Harding of items at Strawberry Hill, including two drawings of chimney pieces at the house; eight drawings unsigned but I believe by the Hardings, mostly of seals, but including a watercolor of the oaken Gothic bench in the Chapel in the Woods mentioned on page 81 of the <hi>Description</hi>; five signed colored drawings by or prints colored by Kirgate; seven unsigned drawings by Kirgate; and twelve other drawings.</p>
<p>The combination of prints, of drawings by Kirgate and the Hardings, and of Kirgate’s notes on them, make this a volume of real interest: but the excitement lies in the last group, the twelve other drawings, as this is where the book has most to tell us about the creation of Strawberry Hill, displaying the potential for extra-illustrated copies to illuminate their subjects.<lb/>
Some are alternative versions of known images, such as a watercolor by Edwards of the south front of the house that was subsequently engraved in etching and aquatint by Jukes, and a copy colored by Edwards of the etching by Jukes of the Printing House; there is an unsigned pencil sketch of the Gothic lantern in the hall, similar to the finished watercolor in Bawtree’s copy of the <hi>Description</hi>; an unsigned wash drawing, perhaps by Kirgate or one of the Hardings, of the couvre-feu in the library, of which Carter’s drawing is in Bull’s copy; and a finished wash drawing, perhaps by George Harding, of the urn erected by Walpole to commemorate the actress Kitty Clive, related to the drawing in Walpole’s own copy of the <hi>Description</hi>.</p>
<p>Of the seven other images, two (facing page 32) are drawings of a previously unrecorded design by Carter of a series of shields each impaled over a trefoil so as to form an inverted triangle that would have provided a series of inverted triangles to fill the areas above the Gothic arched arcading over the bookshelves in the Library.<lb/>
One of these drawings, with the shield blank, is inscribed by Kirgate “Sketch 16. For the two Edwards views see Clarke, <hi>The Strawberry Hill Press &amp; its Printing House</hi>, plates 28 and 25; for the urn to Mrs. Clive, see the frontispiece to Horace Walpole’s <hi>Fugitive Verses</hi>, ed. W. S. Lewis (New York and London: Oxford University Press and Humphrey Milford, 1931).”</p>
<pb n="242"/>
<p>by Carter, for the Library” (figure 1) while the other, in which Walpole’s arms<lb/>
have been sketched in to the shield, is inscribed by George Harding “Taken from<lb/>
a Sketch by Carter for the Library at Strawberry Hill.” These triangular designs<lb/>
have not been previously recorded, though there is a reference in Walpole’s <hi>Strawberry Hill Accounts</hi><lb/>
under 22 October 1789 “for painting Triangles in the library £6 – 6 – 0,” the relevance<lb/>
of which has not previously been clearly understood.17<lb/>
If the painted triangles were realized, we do not know when they were painted over,<lb/>
but they would have represented Carter’s only known design contribution to the<lb/>
building, as opposed to watercolors and drawings recording it. In any event, if one<lb/>
looks at any of the surviving views of the interior of the Library one can see how a<lb/>
succession of shields on trefoils running around the room, immediately beneath the<lb/>
armorial fantasy of the painted ceiling, would have enriched its heraldic impact.18</p>

<p>Three of the remaining images are wash drawings of chimney pieces. A number<lb/>
of the chimney pieces at Strawberry Hill were designed by Richard Bentley (1708–82),<lb/>
son of the great classicist of the same name, who with Walpole and John Chute<lb/>
(1701–76) made up the Committee that was responsible for the developing design of<lb/>
the house in the 1750s. Bentley’s contributions are marked by a creative excess of<lb/>
decorative Gothic and rococo detail. One of the drawings of chimney pieces designed<lb/>
by Bentley, pasted into the endpapers of the book, appears to be by George Harding<lb/>
and is inscribed “Chimney in Red Bedchamber” by Kirgate, who has added measurements.<lb/>
More important, though, is a wash drawing facing page 15, which is inscribed in<lb/>
Walpole’s own hand “Chimney piece of the little parlour at Strawberry hill, taken from a<lb/>
tomb in Westminster Abbey” (figure 2). It is a design drawing with the left jamb of the<lb/>
chimney piece only outlined, and with a plan of the base of the right jamb and<lb/>
measurements given for the opening. It also shows mantling around the shield, which is<lb/>
not present in the surviving chimney piece, or in the similar but finished drawing in<lb/>
Bull’s copy of the <hi>Description</hi>. The text of the <hi>Description</hi> does not specify the<lb/>
designer, but the image relates in the use of wash and looseness of line to the Bentley<lb/>
chimney piece designs at the <hi>Lewis Walpole Library, Yale University, Bentley Album</hi>,<lb/>
both stylistically and in the paper used, though the paper on which those designs are<lb/>
drawn has been given a brown wash.19 And on closer inspection the mantling consists<lb/>
of writhing serpents’ heads, a conceit that Bentley was also to use in the charged and<lb/>
disturbing fantasy known as <hi>A Prospect of Vapourland</hi> of 1759.20 Apart from the<lb/>
mantling and the Walpole’s family crest of a Turk’s head above the shield, the drawing is<lb/>
virtually indistinguishable from the chimney piece as built. Walpole’s inscription does not<lb/>
mention Bentley’s name any more than does the text of the <hi>Description</hi>, but the<lb/>
drawing provides a strong case for Bentley’s being responsible for the design.</p>

<p>The third image, though also unsigned, is clearly by Bentley.<lb/>
It is an unre-<lb/>
corded, unexecuted scheme for an original and idiosyncratic chimney piece de-<lb/>
sign, the jambs faced with pyramidal forms topped with flambeaux, with a half<lb/>
quatrefoil over the lintel within an arched hood, topped with another flambeau<lb/>
reflecting those above the jambs (figure 3). A vase is placed within the reveal of the<lb/>
quatrefoil, with small pots to either side, and there are two other vases in outline<lb/>
behind the flambeaux at the head of each jamb. Like the Little Parlour drawing, it<lb/>
relates directly to the Bentley chimney piece designs at the Lewis Walpole Library.<lb/>
Both stylistically and in similarity in format to those designs it seems clearly to be<lb/>
by Bentley and might conceivably be a preliminary design for the China Room or<lb/>
perhaps the Waiting Room. It is a vibrant and idiosyncratic design, consistent with<lb/>
Bentley’s surviving chimney pieces in the Beauty Room and the Blue Bedchamber.<lb/>

<p>previously unknown, shows the applied wooden moldings that line the passage,<lb/>
the rounded ceiling, and at the end of the passage the arched window that was<lb/>
subsequently removed when the passage was extended in the nineteenth century<lb/>
to connect through to the Great North Bedchamber. It appears to be a design<lb/>
drawing, perhaps associated with Chute, but it is Harding who has inscribed it.<lb/>
The final drawing is inscribed by Kirgate <hi rend='italics'>Plan for a Gothic Mirror at Strawberry Hill</hi> (figure 4). It has measurements in ink in feet and inches, a sketch plan</p>
<pb n="247"/>
<p>of the projecting canopy above, and a note at the side “a. looking glass / no back.<lb/>
from the canopy / to the glass / Canopy projects,” that appears to be in Bentley’s<lb/>
hand, though the drawing (as opposed to the design) is not immediately recognizabl2 as Bentley’s. The design consists of a projecting arched and pierced canopy<lb/>
over a mirror of quatrefoil shape with pointed projections, and the pierced canopy<lb/>
closely relates to the pierced canopy of the chimney piece in the Refectory as<lb/>
designed by Bentley. It seems most likely that the drawing, whoever it is by, is of<lb/>
an unrealized Bentley design, and I am indebted to Michael Snodin for the suggestion that it may have been an early design for the mirrors on either side of the<lb/>
window in the Refectory. The proportions of the sections of wall on either side of<lb/>
the Refectory window are consistent with the area of wall shown in the drawing,<lb/>
and the overall size of the mirror as shown in the drawing is broadly similar to<lb/>
that of the mirrors actually commissioned for these positions, which are arched<lb/>
and with Gothic moldings and a portrait roundel beneath the top of the arch.21</p>
<p>The Newberry volume shows how a selection of the Hardings’ prints and<lb/>
drawings could be supplemented and enhanced from Kirgate’s extensive stock,<lb/>
and enriched by drawings of unexecuted designs so as to convert that extra-illustrated copy into a living part of the unfolding story of the development of<lb/>
Walpole’s house and collection. But that sense of immediacy with the creation of<lb/>
the house and its collection is, if anything, only strengthened with the last of our<lb/>
three copies of the Description.</p>
<head>VI</head>
<p>The third copy of the Description differs most immediately from the other two in<lb/>
that with the exception of two unsigned drawings, and six small pencil sketches<lb/>
probably by Kirgate, it has no illustrations—not even the twenty-eight plates<lb/>
that Walpole commissioned for the 1784 edition. It is a proof copy, interleaved,<lb/>
and bound in early nineteenth-century half calf. Now in the collection of Charles<lb/>
Sebag-Montefiore, it more than makes up for its lack of plates by its wealth of ad-<lb/>
ditional material and annotation. It opens with a transcription dated 6 February<lb/>
1780 by Kirgate on one folded leaf of the sixth and last of Walpole’s fantastical<lb/>
<hi>Hieroglyphic Tales</hi>, <hi>“A True Love Story,”</hi> tipped into the front endpapers. Walpole had written the Tales by 1772, but they were not printed by Kirgate at the<lb/>
Strawberry Hill Press until 1785, and then in only seven copies. This holograph<lb/>
therefore pre-dates the first printing and was presumably copied from Walpole’s<lb/>
manuscript. A comparison with the text as first printed five years later shows that<lb/>
the printed text did not follow Kirgate’s capitalization or repeat one spelling er-<lb/>
ror, and it expanded some abbreviations (presumably it would have been taken<lb/>
from Walpole’s manuscript), but the differences are not significant.22</p>
<p>Also among the preliminary pages at the front are a drawing pasted down<lb/>
of Walpole’s coat of arms resting on three of the books he had written, with<lb/>
Strawberry Hill in the distance; and a pencil drawing of an ossuarium from the<lb/>
Armoury. There are in addition two separate lists compiled by Kirgate both
<pb n="248"/>
<p>headed “Index of Rooms,” giving page numbers of the 1784 edition. <lb/>
At the foot of the second Index Kirgate has added a pencil note giving information on the number of visitors to the house: <lb/>
In 1786, Eighty tickets were given to different People for admission to view <lb/>
<hi>Strawberry Hill</hi> <lb/>
In 1787, Seventy <hi>Ditto</hi> were given <lb/>
In 1789, One Hundred were given <lb/>
In 1807, Mrs. Damer says about 80 or 90 are used yearly <lb/>
Upon an average, about 80 were given yearly <lb/>
For the period 1784–96 we have Walpole’s manuscript <hi>“Book of Visitors,”</hi> which broadly confirms the first three entries, but there is no comparable evidence for the number of visitors after his death in the years of Anne Damer’s occupation. <lb/>
The note also confirms that the volume, in which the earliest entries are proofing corrections that are part of the process of printing the 1784 <hi>Description,</hi> was annotated by Kirgate until at least 1807, only three years before his own death. <lb/>
</p>
<p>Between the two versions of the Index of Rooms is a list in pencil by Kirgate headed <hi>“The following Drawings were made by Mr. Carter for Mr. Bull & Mr. Walpole”</hi> (see appendix below). <lb/>
It lists thirty-six drawings created for Bull’s copy of the <hi>Description,</hi> while five of them were also in Walpole’s. One drawing, <hi>“Gallery 10 G[uineas],”</hi> is crossed through and marked <hi rend="bold">“bought by Mr. Baker”</hi>—presumably the Strawberry Hill Press collector and bibliographer George Baker (1781–1858). It is correct that Bull’s copy, despite its wealth of Carter watercolors and drawings, does not have his view of the Gallery. <lb/>
</p>
<p>But as well as this additional material, there are many annotations to the text by Kirgate, for this is his interleaved proof copy of the 1784 text. It preserves a number of cancels that were corrected in the text as issued, and contains numerous notes by him as the orchestrator of extra-illustration, and even a few notes inserted or initiated by Walpole that throw shafts of light on Walpole’s last years at Strawberry Hill. It is very likely that this is the copy that was lot 413 on the eighth day of the sale of Kirgate’s library, where it was described as <hi>“containing many Notes in MS. by T. Kirgate,”</hi> and was bought by George Baker for £16. <lb/>
</p>
<p>At Baker’s sale in 1825, it appears among some seventy-six Strawberry Hill Press and related books and ephemera as <hi>“A Description of Strawberry Hill, with several loose pieces interleaved, with M.S. memoranda throughout.”</hi> It was bought by Longman for a far more modest £1.19s., a reflection of the depression in book prices that was to be lamented in <hi>Bibliophobia</hi> (1832). <lb/>
</p>
<p>To begin with Walpole’s notes, these are only on the text pages (pre-dating the book’s being bound up interleaved) and are limited but essentially corrections. <lb/>

<p>tive, and largely relate to those sections of the proof that were cancelled so that<lb/>
corrected text could be printed. Sections D, E, L, and O are cancels, and in the<lb/>
case of section O there are two variant cancels: in one Kirgate has noted the need<lb/>
to add “A small whole length of Dryden, in oil, by Maubert” as the third line of<lb/>
“More Additions” on page 93, and in the other he has marked a change to the<lb/>
heading of page 94. It is possible that some of the minor typographical corrections<lb/>
on these pages may be by Walpole rather than Kirgate, but certainly Walpole wrote<lb/>
the notes on page 26, crossing through in ink an entry for James 5th and Mary of Lorraine his Queen, a watercolor by Wale, adding the instructions<lb/>
“This is now in the Holbein Room, where you must insert it,” and adding against<lb/>
a Flemish picture of Boors reading “it was in Sir R. Walpole’s collection”—which<lb/>
note duly appears in the printed text of the corrected sheet.</p>
<p>There are notes by Walpole adding anecdotal details and provenance information<lb/>
to the printed text, while his correction on page 24 of Benedict 13th to<lb/>
Benedict 14th has Kirgate’s marginal note “worked so.” That is Kirgate speaking<lb/>
as printer, and another, later example appears on page 92, which concludes the<lb/>
Appendix: “The small 4to. Edit [that is, the original edition of 1774] was printed as<lb/>
far as here, but the Preface was not, I believe, printed for it.” This must have been<lb/>
written by Kirgate as an older man, as he himself had printed the preface in 1786.</p>
<p>There is a sense of conversations overheard, as in Kirgate’s note on page 67,<lb/>
on the famous silver bell in the Tribune attributed to Cellini, “Mr. W called it, as<lb/>
Madame de Montbazon was called, ‘La Belle des Belles.’” Similarly, there is his<lb/>
note at the foot of page 56, devoted to the cabinet of miniatures in the Tribune:<lb/>
“This Collection cost Mr. W upwards of 1300£” immediately followed by “Columb<lb/>
[Walpole’s manservant] says under 1200£,” while of the cameo of Tiberius<lb/>
in onyx in the box of antique rings in the Tribune he adds “Mr. W. says, very<lb/>
fine.” Some notes serve as an aide memoire, as on page 34, against the account<lb/>
of a brass padlock in the shape of a hand, he writes “ask Carter for this” [that is,<lb/>
for a drawing of it]. Again, against the footnote on page 65 describing a table of<lb/>
polished pebbles at Chiswick House, he notes “Go to Chiswick to see it.”</p>
<p>We also get a sense of items in the collection moving around and out of the<lb/>
house, as in Kirgate’s comment on page 73 that the whole-length portrait of<lb/>
Henry Vere, Earl of Oxford, in the Great North Bedchamber was “Now on the<lb/>
back Stairs” and a landscape by Müntz after Gaspar Poussin had been moved<lb/>
to the Little Parlour, while Vanloo’s whole-length portrait of Sir Robert Walpole<lb/>
was “Removed, and given I think to Mrs. Keppel.”</p>
<p>For some items in the collection Kirgate provides supplemental information.<lb/>
Of the Turkish dagger (now lost) believed by Walpole to have belonged to Henry<lb/>
VIII and displayed in the Tribune he notes that “on one side of the Blade are Arabic Characters in Gold. The Handle and Case have on them, 127 Rubies and<lb/>
6 Diamonds.” He also notes the verses written by Walpole on the back of Lady<lb/>
Craven’s picture and the verses on the stand of the Sevres figure of Cupid, both<lb/>
in the Breakfast Room.</p>
<p>Kirgate’s entry on page 3, “The Staircase and Hall were repainted, in 1793,<lb/>
by Mr. Cornelius Dixon, in a much more accurate and picturesque Stile, tho from<lb/>
the same model, and cost 250-12-6,” supplements the entry in the Strawberry Hill<lb/>
Accounts and (within two shillings) confirms the cost, while the final blank leaf<lb/>
of the book has Kirgate’s note identifying the builder and cost of the offices that<lb/>

<pb n="250"/>Walpole had built in about 1790 —he also added to the Directions to the Binder<lb/>
the titles of the two plates of offices, engraved after the sheet had been printed<lb/>
off.25 Other entries illustrating life at the house include Kirgate’s note against<lb/>
the description of the building of the Gallery and Round Tower that “Cowie,<lb/>
the Gardiner, says he placed Medals and a Copper-plate, with an Inscription,<lb/>
on the Foundation Stone of the above Buildings, which is under the Scullery of<lb/>
the Round Kitchen.” Equally evocative is his recording that most of the small<lb/>
Etruscan and black Staffordshire vases in the Little Library in the Cottage in the<lb/>
Garden “were broke by an Owl getting down the Chimney into the Room.”<lb/>
Of particular importance are two short lists, the first at the end of the<lb/>
<hi>More Additions</hi> appendix on page 96, the other on one of the blank leaves at the back.<lb/>
They record late acquisitions for the collection, after the printing of<lb/>
<hi>More Additions</hi> in 1791. Timothy Wilson has quoted Walpole’s letter to Sir Horace Mann<lb/>
of 1785, in which he asks him to find some examples of a particular Florentine<lb/>
ceramics manufacture, and then adds “but am I not an old simpleton to be wanting<lb/>
playthings still?”26 These lists show the elderly Walpole, still adding to the<lb/>
collection to within three years of his death. The first list is:<lb/>
Brown earthen Miraculous Pitcher—Earthen Bottle, labelled, Claret<lb/>
A Miniature in enamel of [gap] Lord Bute, by Spencer; bought at Dalton’s Sale, 1791.<lb/>
Six Portraits, with Pen and ink, of Mr. Walpole, Mr. Chute, Mr. Spence, &c.<lb/>
drawn by Rosalba, when those Gentlemen were in Italy, unknown to them, when at some public<lb/>
Place; yet very like<lb/>
Dead Christ, by Carrache, small oil painting on Copper, from Sir Laurence<lb/>
Dundas’s Sale, in 1794.<lb/>
Miniature Portrait of Charles James Stuart, eldest son of the Pretender;<lb/>
Given by Mrs. Hunter, In 1794.<lb/>
The second has five more items:<lb/>
A carved Ivory Cup, with a Bacchanalian Procession, in relievo, set in Silver,<lb/>
with the Orford Crest on the Cover; from Houghton.<lb/>
Two Cocoa Nuts, carved with the Arms of Orford, and mounted with Silver gilt feet;<lb/>
from Ditto, 1793.<lb/>
Two silver filigraine Hampers; from Ditto, 1794.<lb/>
A Portrait of the Rev. William Cole, of Botesham Hall, Cambridge, on painted Glass.<lb/>

<p>Of these, three are Walpole silver, presumably acquired through family piety,<lb/>
and two come from sales of 1791 and 1794. One is a gift, and one a plaster bust of<lb/>
the actress Elizabeth Farren by his admired cousin. The portraits by Rosalba are<lb/>
curious—it would be surprising that they only came into Walpole’s possession<lb/>
in the 1790s, over fifty years after his Grand Tour, and some years after all the<lb/>
other persons mentioned had died; or perhaps they were existing possessions that<lb/>
had not previously been listed. And the portrait on glass of his correspondent,<lb/>
the antiquary William Cole, who had died in 1782, is intriguing. Some of the<lb/>
Rosalbas are at The Vyne (John Chute’s house), the carved ivory cup is in the<lb/>
Derby collection at Knowsley Hall, and the mounted coconuts are in a private<lb/>
collection: the rest have disappeared, but the group of items do display the still<lb/>
dedicated collector, adding to his treasures and adorning his house to the last.<lb/>

There are, however, three topics that constitute by far the largest number<lb/>
of Kirgate’s annotations. The first of these is the cost of items—what Walpole<lb/>
had paid for them. These can be treated anecdotally, as in Kirgate’s note at the<lb/>
foot of page 72 of the painting over the chimney piece of the Great North Bed-<lb/>
chamber: “the Picture of Henry 8th. and Children, which Mr. Walpole bought<lb/>
for 80 Guineas, was formerly sold on London Bridge for 5 Pounds.” Of the bust<lb/>
of Vespasian in the Gallery described at page 50 he comments “it was reckoned<lb/>
the 7th Bust in Rome, and cost under 20£,” while the Boccapadugli eagle in the<lb/>
Gallery “Cost but 50£. Mr. W. has been offered 1000£ for it. The pedestal cost<lb/>
25£.” Mostly, though, he simply notes the price paid by Walpole in the margin<lb/>
against objects, doing so for about fifty-five of them.<lb/>

The other two series of annotations bring us back to Kirgate as dealer in prints<lb/>
of the collection. They are notes as to whether there are available prints of items<lb/>
in the collection, and descriptions of the poses of portraits. There are over 130<lb/>
notes querying whether a print or drawing exists, or if there is a print, by whom<lb/>
it is engraved. At the foot of page 24 of the book, for example, the text lists three<lb/>
portraits in the Green Closet, of Henry Carey, Earl of Monmouth, Pope Benedict<lb/>
XII, and Lady Newburgh: against the first two Kirgate has noted “Engraved by<lb/>
S. Harding,” but against the third he has written “Q. if engraved by Harding?”<lb/>
and added “No. But I have a copy by Harding.” On the preceding page, against<lb/>
Scott’s view of Pope’s house in Twickenham, he asks “See if Sayer has not a<lb/>
Print like this”—a reference to the printseller Robert Sayer (1725–94). There<lb/>
are page after page of such entries, many just noting that there is a mezzotint, or<lb/>
an engraving by Harding, or noting a print’s scarcity: as a random selection, of<lb/>
the Maid of Honour Mrs. Trevor “No Print in that name in Bromley [Bromley’s<lb/>
Catalogue of Engraved British Portraits (1793)] Q. was She married? Drawing of her<lb/>
by G. Harding”; various notes as to whether antiquities that Walpole had bought<lb/>
from Conyers Middleton were engraved in his Antiquities (1745); and of an antique<lb/>
silver figure of a seated muse in the Tribune Kirgate writes “Beg a Drawing of<lb/>
it,” to remind himself to ask (presumably) Mrs. Damer for permission to have it<lb/>
copied. But especially revealing is his comment on the ancient oak chair in the<lb/>
Holbein Chamber that Walpole believed to have come from Glastonbury Abbey:<lb/>
“Engraved by Captn. Grose, Prints of which may be had of T. Kirgate.”<lb/>

<pb n="252"/>
Almost as frequent, though, are Kirgate’s annotations as to the poses of<lb/>
portraits at Strawberry Hill. There are approximately one hundred of these,<lb/>
carefully written out in pencil. A good example of this is provided by the nineteen<lb/>
heads in oil from the Court of Charles II, copied by Jarvis, and hung by Walpole<lb/>
in the Beauty Room. Kirgate has numbered these from 1 to 19 and written out<lb/>
descriptions of them on the facing interleaved blank sheet. There is, for instance,<lb/>
King William when Prince of Orange, “In armour, truncheon in right hand, left<lb/>
on a helmet, point cravat, dog’s head looking up, battle in the background,” and<lb/>
Frances Stuart, Duchess of Richmond, “Standing in a wood, leaning on left arm<lb/>
on bank, right cross’d to ditto, mantle tied with pearls over left breast, curl on<lb/>
ditto.” For a number of the portraits, Kirgate’s notes seek to distinguish between<lb/>
the Strawberry Hill picture and other similar prints: from the same group of<lb/>
nineteen, there is Henry, Earl of Ogle (with in his case an additional note in ink<lb/>
“No Print of him”), described as “Standing, full faced, flowing hair, point cravat,<lb/>
left hand in robe, right hand pointing with fore finger, Curtain behind. A print<lb/>
of Sir Thomas Isham, Bart (D. Loggan exct.) is exactly like this of Ogle, except<lb/>
the face. A ditto of Sir [blank] Fielding is also, the face excepted, more so.” He<lb/>
is followed in the list by Lady Elizabeth Percy, later Duchess of Somerset “Sitting<lb/>
on a bank, supported by right hand, left pointing to a parrot in an orange<lb/>
tree in a vase, lock of hair on left breast, column at left”: this has two additional<lb/>
notes on the text page “Mezzo[tint] Print of her, sold by Browne,” and “A Print<lb/>
of Madam Lucy Loftus is much like the Dss. of Somerset.”<lb/>
What these notes represent is Kirgate’s index for identifying prints from<lb/>
Strawberry Hill portraits when he did not have the originals in front of him.<lb/>
If he were to see in the London print trade a mezzotint of a Lady Elizabeth<lb/>
Percy, he could turn to his notes to see if the print showed her pointing to the<lb/>
required parrot in an orange tree, and if so it could be added to stock for his<lb/>
Strawberry Hill customers. There is even a memorandum to himself “remr.<lb/>
to describe this” against the Van Dyck of Soldiers at Cards, in the manner of<lb/>
Teniers, in the Tribune. The notes serve a similar function of identification to<lb/>
the briefer summaries of poses that appear in some of the entries in Granger’s<lb/>
Biographical History.<lb/>
It is no surprise that Kirgate kept the book until his death, for the function<lb/>
of this copy had been transformed. What had started as a proof copy with his<lb/>
master’s corrections had been interleaved, and become a repository for information<lb/>
and anecdote, opening a window onto Walpole’s last thirteen years at<lb/>
Strawberry Hill. It had then become the essential reference source for Kirgate’s<lb/>
later career as book and printseller and purveyor of illustrations of the house<lb/>
and its collections. This was a cottage industry by which—as the three copies<lb/>
of the Description discussed in this paper illustrate—he and the Harding family<lb/>
not only helped to support themselves, but disseminated to a wider audience<lb/>
Walpole’s vision of Strawberry Hill. The second and third of these volumes provide<lb/>
a wealth of supplemental information and some previously unknown design<lb/>
drawings for Strawberry Hill—but all three together also give us an unusual<lb/>
opportunity to see extra-illustration and annotation from the perspective of the<lb/>
booksellers, printsellers and artists who facilitated the leisured amusement of a<lb/>
generation of collectors.<lb/>

  <title>CHARLES DIBDIN AND THE MAKING OF THE MUSICAL TOUR OF MR. DIBDIN (1788): A NEW <hi>“COMPACT WITH THE PUBLIC”</hi></title>
  <byline>by David Chandler</byline>
  <p>On 17 March 1787, Charles Dibdin (1745–1814) took the stagecoach from London to Oxford, “with a few shirts and books in a trunk, [and] a well-digested plan in [his] head.”<note place="foot" xml:id="n1">Charles Dibdin, <hi>The Musical Tour of Mr. Dibdin</hi> (Sheffield, 1788), 13–14. Subsequent references are noted parenthetically in the text.</note><lb/>
Famous first as an actor-singer, then as a theatre composer who collaborated with such luminaries as David Garrick and Isaac<lb/>
Bickerstaff, then as a writer for the theatre himself, Dibdin was “an extremely<lb/>
well-known public character”<note place="foot" xml:id="n2">Oskar Cox Jensen, David Kennerley and Ian Newman (eds.), <hi>Charles Dibdin and Late Georgian Culture</hi> (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2018), 1. This volume is the best introduction to the great variety of Dibdin’s achievements and cultural impacts, though it has little to say about him as a writer or solo performer.</note> who was now, in the spirit of entrepreneurship<lb/>
increasingly shaping his activities, seeking to integrate his talents. The “well-<lb/>
digested plan” was for a one-man musical show which Dibdin intended touring<lb/>
round the country to fund his family’s planned emigration to India; standing be-<lb/>
hind a piano (an instrument he had introduced in Britain), he would alternately<lb/>
speak and sing to his audience. By appearing as poet, composer, performer and<lb/>
“band,” Dibdin later wrote, he was doing something “so unprecedented, that<lb/>
one should rationally suppose, if it were only for the novelty, it were likely to<lb/>
attract curiosity, and ensure encouragement.”<note place="foot" xml:id="n3">Charles Dibdin, <hi>The Professional Life of Mr. Dibdin</hi>, 4 vols. (London, 1803), 1:4.</note> <hi>Readings and Music</hi>, as he called<lb/>
his entertainment, was to prove personally, professionally, even culturally trans-<lb/>
formative; with it, the second half of Dibdin’s career commenced. In the end,<lb/>
he never did go to India, but he decided that the one-man show, which he<lb/>
began calling a <hi>“Table Entertainment,”</hi> on the model of <hi>“table talk,”</hi> was his<lb/>
natural medium, and he went on developing the form. For a time, his shows<lb/>
were sensationally popular, and between 1791 and 1805 Dibdin even had his<lb/>
own London theatre, the <hi>Sans Souci</hi>, specifically to present them. The songs he<lb/>
produced for these <hi>Table Entertainments</hi> had an immense impact on the popu-<lb/>
lar song repertoire, making Dibdin overwhelmingly the leading anglophone<lb/>
singer-songwriter of the age. The form of the shows, too, had a huge influence<lb/>
on popular entertainment, almost every subsequent proponent of the one-man<lb/>
show with music owing something, directly or indirectly, to Dibdin. They very</p>
</div>
<pb n="256"/><p>likely also influenced the culture of London’s “song-and-supper rooms” which<lb/>
started opening in 1815 —the direct ancestors of the later music hall.4<lb/>
The <hi>Readings and Music</hi> tour proved transformative in another way, too: it<lb/>
persuaded Dibdin that he could and should produce books. Although from the<lb/>
early 1770s onwards his literary ambitions were steadily developing, there is no<lb/>
evidence prior to 1787 of a serious interest in book production. He had published<lb/>
librettos, a polemical pamphlet, <hi>The Royal Circus Epitomized</hi> (1784), and his own<lb/>
periodical, <hi>The Devil</hi>, which ran for 22 issues in 1786 and 1787. But after his<lb/>
1787–88 tour produced the <hi>Musical Tour of Mr. Dibdin</hi>, a 450-page quarto far<lb/>
bigger in size and scope than anything he had written before, he began thinking on a different scale, publishing three three-volume novels between 1793 and<lb/>
1807, a five-volume <hi>Complete History of the English Stage</hi> between 1797 and<lb/>
1800, two large volumes of <hi>Observations on a Tour Through Almost the Whole of<lb/>
England, and a Considerable Part of Scotland</hi> in 1801 and 1802, and four volumes of<lb/>
<hi>The Professional Life of Mr. Dibdin</hi> in 1803. The <hi>Musical Tour of Mr. Dibdin</hi> directly anticipates,<lb/>
in different ways, most of the major publications that followed. Dibdin discovered a taste for autobiographical writing mixed with anecdotes, opinions and polemics; although he has, at most, appeared as a footnote in accounts of Romantic autobiography,<lb/>
no British writer published more about themselves in the decades between 1780<lb/>
and 1810.<lb/>
</p>
<p>Despite the great importance of the <hi>Musical Tour of Mr. Dibdin</hi> (hereafter MT) in Dibdin’s<lb/>
polymathic career, it is as flawed as it is fascinating. It did not develop smoothly<lb/>
and Dibdin had written much of it before deciding on the final shape and content of the volume. Moreover, he was often juggling the historical aspects of his account with a desire to comment on his present circumstances. When Dibdin left London, he had no idea of recording his experiences: “at my first setting out”<lb/>
“I had not the smallest idea of writing any account of my Tour at all” (43–44).<lb/>
Not until August did he lay plans for a book, and not until October did he begin<lb/>
systematically writing it. Given that the tour itself continued until March 1788,<lb/>
this meant that for a long time Dibdin was having to catch up with himself, and he recognized almost immediately the parallels with Laurence Sterne’s 1760s<lb/>
novel, <hi>Tristram Shandy</hi> (10). As the project developed, it came to unite the different<lb/>
worlds of self-publishing, provincial printing, financing by subscription and—belatedly—royal patronage. Scholars have paid some attention to the tour itself, and to <hi>Readings and Music</hi>,<lb/>
but there has been no separate analysis of the complex vehicle through which Dibdin preserved a record of these things. The published MT is the more interesting in that, uniquely among Dibdin’s major prose publications, a complete fair copy manuscript of the book has been preserved, held in the Fellows’ Library at Winchester College (MS 61). Although there are few significant departures from this bound manuscript volume in the printed text, the<lb/>
<pb n="257"/>
<p>manuscript provides fascinating clues to the process by which the book came to be made, and it is regularly cited in the history reconstructed here.6<lb/>
The story of the tour commences on page 15 of the published MT; the history of the book about the tour effectively commences on page 91, when Dibdin<lb/>
describes his return to Worcester on 31 July 1787 after an earlier visit in the<lb/>
spring. There follows one of the most ambiguous and conflicted passages in the<lb/>
volume:<lb/>
I never experienced more milk and water treatment in my life. I advertised my entertainment however and was tolerably attended. . . . I sincerely believe, had it not been for the<lb/>
interference of a friend, I must have used the word intolerably. To this gentleman,<lb/>
who is no other than T. S. Esq.[,] I shall beg leave to say, that if he meant his friendship<lb/>
and attention to my interest should finish where it apparently has— God forbid I<lb/>
should load him with more trouble than he is willing to suffer! So far from it—I here,<lb/>
in the face of the world, acquit him of any intentions in relation to me, but those of<lb/>
serving, obliging, and pleasing me; and should it so happen that neither upon paper,<lb/>
nor any other way, we again exchange a single word, my wishes towards him are, may<lb/>
he enjoy a long life of health, happiness, and prosperity! And I hope he retains so<lb/>
much of his former good wishes for me, as to return an equal portion of esteem, with<lb/>
equal sincerity. (91)<lb/>
Readers are expected to recall that the first eleven letters of the MT had been addressed “To T. S. Esq.” Dibdin later chose to reveal the identity of this individual,<lb/>
for in his <hi>Professional Life</hi> he states: “The name of Theophilus Swift, Esq. will be<lb/>
seen at the head of some of the poetry. . . . To this gentleman I addressed a few<lb/>
letters in my original Tour.”7 Swift (1746–1815), whose parents were both cousins<lb/>
of Jonathan Swift, the author of <hi>Gulliver’s Travels</hi>, was an eccentric Irish barrister.<lb/>
The fullest contemporary description describes him as “an excellent classic [sic]<lb/>
scholar, and versed likewise in modern literature and belles lettres. . . . [He was]<lb/>
a sincere, kind-hearted man; but . . . at the same time, the most visionary of created beings. He saw every thing whimsically—many things erroneously—and<lb/>
nothing like another person.”8 Swift had just commenced a literary career by<lb/>
publishing a lengthy poem, <hi>The Temple of Folly</hi>. It is not clear when or where he<lb/>
and Dibdin first became connected, but it was sometime prior to this consequential meeting in Worcester, as a cryptic clue inserted into the MT indicates. In a<lb/>
letter to Swift of 16 October 1787, Dibdin writes: “You may remember, in a letter<lb/>
written to me some time ago, you wondered at my advertising my entertainment<lb/>
at Birmingham” (25). Dibdin performed at Birmingham in between his two visits<lb/>
to Worcester. The reference to the earlier letter suggests that Swift was probably<lb/>
not at Worcester when Dibdin first visited, or he would hardly have needed to<lb/>
</p>
<note n="6" place="foot">I am much indebted to Richard Foster, the Fellows’ Librarian, Winchester College, for<lb/>
allowing me access to the manuscript, for his generous hospitality when I visited Winchester,<lb/>
and for the information that the manuscript was donated to the College in the 1830s or 1840s<lb/>
by the Rev. Peter Hall (1803–49), a prolific collector of books and manuscripts and a former<lb/>
Winchester student. The records show that the manuscript was bound when first acquired by<lb/>
the College, though it was subsequently rebound in the twentieth century. The history of the<lb/>
manuscript before Hall acquired it, presumably no earlier than the 1820s, is unknown, but it<lb/>
seems likely that Dibdin’s printer, Joseph Gales, made the original decision to bind together<lb/>
the letters that constitute it.</note>

<p>write on the subject of the latter’s “advertising . . . at Birmingham.” His presence on the second visit may have something to do with it coinciding with “the <lb/>
race week” (56), which in 1787 ended on 7 August.9 More importantly, the 16 <lb/>
October letter establishes that Dibdin was on terms of correspondence with Swift <lb/>
before summer 1787.</p>
<p>Worcester, a city with a population of around 11,000 at the time, was a regional <lb/>
shopping centre with substantial gloving and porcelain industries. A theatre had <lb/>
been opened in 1781, but Worcester was not known for its culture. Swift, though <lb/>
mostly resident in Dublin, owned a house there. His father, Deane Swift, died at <lb/>
Worcester in 1783, and the dedication to <hi>The Temple of Folly</hi> is dated “Worcester, <lb/>
April 12th, 1787.”10 It is easy to imagine an eccentric Irishman with strong literary <lb/>
interests being glad to welcome the diversions Dibdin offered. Dibdin stayed in <lb/>
Worcester a full two weeks on his second visit, considerably longer than he usually <lb/>
stayed at one place on his tour; there was thus plenty of time for him and Swift to <lb/>
see each other. It is possible Dibdin had already conceived the idea of publishing <lb/>
an account of his tour in a series of letters; but, even if this were the case, it was <lb/>
the conversations with Swift that prompted him to start work. Given the dates, <lb/>
though, it is more likely that the whimsical, “visionary” Swift came up with the <lb/>
idea of a <hi>Musical Tour</hi>—perhaps in response to Dibdin’s lively stories about his <lb/>
experiences—making him, given what I have suggested above, a vital influence <lb/>
on Dibdin’s career, though one which has gone entirely unrecognized.</p>
<p>Dibdin directed a first MT letter to Swift on 16 August, just two days after <lb/>
leaving Worcester. It can certainly be called “visionary” in the plans it lays out. <lb/>
Dibdin, now in Hereford, promises that, in addition to a basic narrative of his <lb/>
movements and experiences, the planned book will</p>
<quote>
<p>give the public some useful hints relative to inns, manufactories, natural and artificial <lb/>
curiosities, the state of the country as to cultivation, and such other particulars as have <lb/>
cursorily struck me. . . . Having also had many opportunities of conversing with men of <lb/>
genius, I shall communicate my remarks on those conversations; in which, in particular, <lb/>
will be comprised my sentiments on Music in all its points of view. . . . Another object <lb/>
which peculiarly demands my attention is the Theatre. Nor will a fair exposition of <lb/>
its arcana come by any means improperly through the medium of this publication. An <lb/>
account of the motives which induce me to quit my native country are a part of my <lb/>
compact with the public, and they cannot be enumerated without relating many theatrical <lb/>
transactions. . . . These matters, together with a prodigious number of observations, <lb/>
both of my own and others, on all general subjects—anecdotes, and the essence of what <lb/>
I have delivered, at different places, under the title of <hi>Readings and Music</hi>, will make <lb/>
up a series of letters. (2–4)</p>
</quote>
<p>Importantly, this first letter shows Dibdin envisaging a much more dialogic work <lb/>
than that which eventually emerged. He describes Swift, remarkably, and with <lb/>
a good deal of flattery, as “the best judge I know of all general subjects, whether <lb/>
natural or acquired” (1). And crucially, in the conclusion, he expresses a hope <lb/>
that the letters “with the advantage of your [Swift’s] sentiments on each separate <lb/>
letter, [will] be found to excite and satisfy public curiosity” (4). This suggests that <lb/>

<pb n="259"/>
<p>he imagined a book in which his letters would be interspersed with Swift’s replies.<lb/>
Whether there had been any talk of Swift benefitting from this financially is unclear, but he was a rich man, unlike Dibdin, and may have suggested some such scheme both to help his friend and raise his own profile in the world of letters.<lb/>
As well as dispatching letters to Swift, Dibdin began making copies of his letters complete with headings and footnotes that would eventually serve as copy for his printer; these fair copies are preserved in the Winchester volume.<lb/>
In the first letter in the manuscript, Dibdin originally had the subtitle <hi>To Theophilus Swift Esq.</hi> but the name was subsequently crossed out and replaced with <hi>T. S. Esq.</hi> which is then consistently used in the Winchester volume and in the printed MT.<lb/>
Dibdin clearly expected a reply to this first letter but did not get one.<lb/>
He then waited six weeks before writing to Swift again, this time from York, on 28 September.<lb/>
At this juncture, it is clear, he had abandoned any hope of obtaining regular commentary from his friend, and quickly followed this with three more letters, on 30 September and 4 and 5 October.<lb/>
It is significant, I suggest, that the last of these, detailing Dibdin’s experiences in Bath the previous March, is mostly taken up with a story about an Irishman (21–22).<lb/>
The Irishman had promised he would ensure a good audience at the Assembly Rooms if Dibdin could set to music a poem written by a lady he was courting and allow him to claim the music as his own.<lb/>
Dibdin set the song, but the <hi>nefarious</hi> Irishman did not keep his promise.<lb/>
In context, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that the story was pointed at Swift, implicitly accusing him of betrayal.<lb/>
Swift himself may have read it that way, for he now, at last, replied.<lb/>
His letter was not published, but Dibdin’s brief reply to it, dated 14 October, is included in the MT.<lb/>
Dibdin could now, at last, write:<lb/>
<quote>I cannot have a stronger stimulative to proceed than your kindness. The praise you are pleased to afford my introductory letter—which cannot, from its nature, be so entertaining as those of which it is the harbinger—gives me very flattering hopes that this testimony of public gratitude will hold some rank in the world’s estimation. (5)</quote><lb/>
Dibdin gave this letter the title <hi>“Encouragement to Proceed”</hi> and rather misleadingly placed it second in the MT, allowing the casual reader the impression that Swift had responded reasonably promptly to the initial letter, though giving the date at the bottom to make clear to the careful reader that this was not the case.<lb/>
By this time, it must have been obvious to Dibdin that he was not going to get Swift’s “sentiments on each separate letter,” but he felt encouraged enough to go on, as the Irishman had clearly made some sort of assurance that he would try to do better.<lb/>
Dibdin despatched further letters on the 16, 17, 21 and 22 October, the last with a dramatic postscript which could have come straight from a sentimental novel of the period: “Why have I not heard from you!” (39).<lb/>
The next letter, the following day, similarly states: “’Tis hard you will not write to me” (41).<lb/>
These might be read as rhetorical flourishes, designed to make the published tour more readable, but it appears that frustration lay behind them, and Dibdin now abruptly stopped directing his letters to Swift.<lb/>
His complex, hurt feelings regarding the correspondence are illustrated in a footnote: 11. In the Winchester manuscript, interestingly, Dibdin first dated the letter <hi>Nov 14th</hi> before correcting <hi>Nov</hi> to <hi>Oct</hi> (Letter 2). This suggests that it may have been written some time after its putative date, and for artistic purposes more than anything else. (The Winchester manuscript numbers the letters in their headings, rather than by pages or folios.)<lb/>
</p>
<pb n="260"/>
<p>ing the latter’s <hi>friendship and attention to my interest</hi> were later expressed in<lb/>
his account of his second Worcester visit, quoted above.<lb/>
The two or three weeks subsequent to the last letter to Swift were the most<lb/>
critical in the history of the MT. Dibdin’s next letter signals a general redirection<lb/>
by being addressed “To the Public” and emphatically stating “I shall address no<lb/>
more letters to T. S. Esq.” (42). Dibdin reports, a little accusingly, that Swift<lb/>
“very lately told a particular friend of mine that my seven first letters—I use his own<lb/>
words—‘are wonderfully well written’” (42). He wants to insist, then, that Swift<lb/>
had received and approved the letters, even though he only answered one. On<lb/>
a more extenuating note, though, he also refers to “chance having thrown this<lb/>
gentleman [Swift] and I such a distance from each other” (42–43)—a probable<lb/>
reference to Swift having returned to Ireland. The biggest question Dibdin faced<lb/>
at this juncture was whether he should replace Swift with some other correspon-<lb/>
dent. The second letter subsequent to the Swift letters, dated from Hull on 4 No-<lb/>
vember, was initially addressed “To Mr. Boyton” in the Winchester manuscript,<lb/>
but the “oyton” was then crossed out to leave “The Mr. B.” which appears in the<lb/>
published MT.<lb/>
12 This was the exceptionally obscure William Boyton, a music<lb/>
teacher, harpsichordist (one of the best in the country, according to Dibdin), and<lb/>
minor composer.<lb/>
13 Dibdin clearly had an excellent relationship with Boyton,<lb/>
who is mentioned eight times in the MT. The 4 November letter ends on a rather<lb/>
ambiguous note, and it is not clear whether Dibdin intended to make Boyton a<lb/>
regular correspondent or not: “As to the musical taste of Bristol, the treatment<lb/>
at inns, and other indispensible [sic] matters, I shall mention them when I return;<lb/>
for I will not give you pain by speaking truth of your neighbours” (49).<lb/>
Immediately after this, the whole concept of the still largely unwritten book<lb/>
was rethought. The next letter, dated 6 November, is addressed to Dibdin:<lb/>
When I had the pleasure of witnessing your performance, I said but the truth when I<lb/>
assured you it would be no trifling satisfaction to me to promote whatever you should<lb/>
consider as your interest. As to your request of addressing your public letters to me, I<lb/>
embrace with great satisfaction an opportunity of receiving an earlier entertainment from<lb/>
them than the rest of your friends. Nobody can be more zealous in your cause. There is,<lb/>
I confess, one consideration that will make me read them with reluctance—every suc-<lb/>
ceeding letter will be one approach nearer to your departure, which you know I never<lb/>
cordially liked—though I own you have conquered every scruple but one. Answer me.<lb/>
What will the people of INDIA say of you, when they see in your book that you make<lb/>
a visit to them, your forlorn hope? You see I begin the office of a friend by treating you<lb/>
with freedom. My remarks, however, will not be very troublesome to you. Your career<lb/>
is brilliant, and it were pity to stop it. Adieu. I have read thirteen letters, and be assured<lb/>
I shall make a perusal of the rest supercede every other consideration of business or<lb/>
pleasure—being<lb/>
Your sincere friend,<lb/>
And obedient servant. (50)<lb/>
12. Letter 13.<lb/>
13. Roger Fiske estimates Boyton’s dates as c. 1750 to c. 1800 in <hi>English Theatre Music in the Eighteenth Century</hi> (London: <hi>Oxford University Press</hi>, 1973), 651. I suspect he was the “Mr.<lb/>
BOYTON sen.” who was given a benefit concert in Bristol in 1816, however: see “Assembly-<lb/>
Rooms, Prince’s Street,” <hi>Bristol Mirror</hi>, 9 November 1816, 2. Boyton’s son Richard, also a<lb/>
teacher of music in Bristol, was active by the 1810s and died in 1846.</p>
<p><pb n="261"/>Dibdin responded to this in a letter of 9 November, addressed “To the Rev. Mr. —,” and from this juncture on, all his letters are similarly addressed.<lb/>The timing of the letter from the “Rev. Mr. —” was singularly timely, and the letter itself reads as more akin to an extract from an epistolary novel than a genuine correspondence from a real clergyman.<lb/>In fact, a careful reading of the Winchester manuscript and the published MT makes it clear that the “Rev. Mr. —” is an imaginary correspondent introduced as a literary convenience.<lb/>The first and most irrefutable clue is in the manuscript.<lb/>The letter has several crossings out and corrections, such as “<hi>nobody can be more zealous in the your cause &amp; nobody wishes you better.</hi>”<sup n="14"/> This strongly points to its being Dibdin’s composition, not a transcription of someone else’s letter.<lb/>A second clue is in the letter itself: the giveaway detail “I have read thirteen letters,” in other words all the letters of the MT written to that point.<lb/>To try and explain this, in the Winchester manuscript Dibdin initially dated the letter from Lincoln, where he had been on 6 November.<lb/>The implication, then, was that the “Rev. Mr. —” met him there and was shown the growing set of letters that Dibdin was assembling.<lb/>Yet on the subscription list there is only one reverend listed under Lincoln, a “Rev. Dr. Gordon” who obviously cannot be the man in question.<lb/>It is impossible to believe that such an ardent supporter of Dibdin would not have been a subscriber, as both Swift (listed under London) and Boyton (listed under Bristol) were.<lb/>And if the “Rev. Mr. —” was only visiting Lincoln in November, it was an odd time and place for a clergyman to be taking a holiday.<lb/>Apparently realizing that he had evoked an unlikely scenario, Dibdin crossed out the word “Lincoln,” which does not appear in the published MT.<lb/>But if the “Rev. Mr. —” was not in Lincoln, how could he have read all thirteen letters, the latest written just two days earlier?<lb/>A third clue is that the MT never refers to Dibdin meeting the “Rev. Mr. —.”<lb/>This is crucial, for in general Dibdin was keen to name and praise his supporters, and to detail where he met them.<lb/>He refers to his meeting with Swift, as noted above, possibly suppressing the Irishman’s full name because, by the time he described the meeting, he felt Swift had let him down.<lb/>Dibdin also refers in more detail to his time with Boyton, and, as noted above, mentions him eight times.<lb/>Yet we are supposed to think that by 6 November Dibdin had found a very willing friend and supporter who goes wholly unmentioned in the narrative.<lb/>Moreover, the name of the “Rev. Mr. —” is ostentatiously suppressed.<lb/>In Dibdin’s first letter to him, he says he will publish the latter’s letter, but:<lb/>&#x201C;It shall be printed … without your name—nor shall I publicly use it [the name] at all, though out of kindness you have stipulated for no such arrangement. My reason is, that though I may find it necessary to go to loggerheads with witlings and crotchet-mongers, it would be unhandsome to bring you in as my second, or even bottle-holder.&#x201D;<lb/>The reader, then, is meant to accept that the name is concealed, not because the “Rev. Mr. —” stipulated this, but because Dibdin now wants to protect his correspondent from his, Dibdin’s, quarrels.<lb/>Dibdin had not chosen to protect Swift and Boyton so carefully.</p>
<pb n="262"/>
<p>A fourth and final clue, and the decisive one, is that having introduced the fiction of a <hi>“New Correspondent,”</hi> Dibdin does remarkably little with it.<lb/>
After the initial letter of 6 November, there are no more letters from the <hi>“Rev. Mr. —”</hi> until 17 February.<lb/>
This represents him as now thoroughly persuaded that Dibdin should go to India, and makes a particular dig at Nottingham, where Dibdin had experienced an unfavourable reception: <hi>“The nasty Snottinghamites alone would have sickened me to such a degree, that when I appeared before them, it would have given me all the qualmishness and have produced all the effect of an emetic”</hi> (132).<lb/>
Nine days later, Dibdin wrote to acknowledge another communication from the <hi>“Rev. Mr. —”</hi> which this time had enclosed a satirical <hi>“impromptu,”</hi> <hi>“On hearing of Mr. Dibdin’s ill success at Nottingham”</hi> (152).<note place="foot" n="15">Interestingly, in the following decade George Moutard Woodward quoted a slightly different version of the <hi>“impromptu”</hi> with the statement that it was <hi>“said to be written by the celebrated Mr. Dibden [sic] (from woeful experience) and supposed to be addressed to himself.”</hi> See his <hi>Eccentric Excursions: Or, Literary &amp; Pictorial Sketches</hi> (London, 1796), 178.</note><lb/>
The reader, then, is left to conclude that of all the strong views Dibdin expresses on people, places and issues in the course of the MT, the only one which really exercised the feelings and pen of the <hi>“Rev. Mr. —”</hi> were the remarks on Nottingham!<lb/>
If this was meant to hint that the <hi>“Rev. Mr. —”</hi> might be a disgruntled member of the Nottingham clergy, or perhaps based in Derby, Nottingham’s great regional rival, it was a red herring: no <hi>“Rev. Mr.”</hi> appears on the subscribers’ lists for these towns.<lb/>
In general, Dibdin went on writing letter after letter to the <hi>“Rev. Mr. —”</hi> without any stated expectation of a reply or frustration at the lack of one.</p>
<p>Altogether, then, the evidence is overwhelmingly against the <hi>“Rev. Mr. —”</hi> being a real person, suggesting that Dibdin significantly rethought the nature of his book in early November 1787.<lb/>
The advantages were obvious: he would no longer need to make duplicate copies of his letters, would no longer need to wait for replies that might never come, and could, when in the mood, write his own replies.<lb/>
Nevertheless, it is possible that Dibdin hoped his readers would link the <hi>“Rev. Mr. —”</hi> address of the letters to an actual person.<lb/>
Of the 25 people with that designation in the subscribers’ lists, one was a major literary figure, with several interests coincident with Dibdin’s: William Mason (1725–97), the rector of Aston.<lb/>
He had subscribed in Sheffield, which is presumably where he saw Dibdin’s entertainment, and Dibdin had been there in October 1787.<lb/>
Dibdin may have hoped that curious readers would make the link with Mason, and the signature <hi>“*****”</hi> suggested a name of five characters.<lb/>
Dibdin was often less than polite when assessing the merits of his contemporaries, but he would later describe Mason as <hi>“a sweet and beautiful writer, and a man universally beloved and esteemed.”</hi></p>
<p>The removal of Swift from Dibdin’s publishing plan appears to have significantly impacted the planned book in another way, too.<lb/>
Dibdin’s letter <hi>“To the Public”</hi> of 24 October—the one in which he states <hi>“I shall address no more letters to T. S. Esq”</hi>—also contains this information:</p>
<note place="foot" n="16">Charles Dibdin, <hi>A Complete History of the English Stage</hi>, 5 vols. (London, 1797–1800), 5:289.</note>
<pb n="263"/>
<p>Five minutes before I sat down to this table where I am now writing, being at Beverly in<lb/>
Yorkshire, I dispatched to the printer at Hull a manuscript of the proposal for publishing<lb/>
my Musical Tour. (45)<lb/>
Hull was just nine miles by road from Beverly, and the printing was clearly done<lb/>
quickly, so when Dibdin later came to his account of these days he could state<lb/>
“At Beverly I first issued my proposals for printing this work” (139). Dibdin had<lb/>
now decided to make the MT a subscription volume and realized his tour offered<lb/>
him a wonderful opportunity for collecting subscribers. It may be just a coinci-<lb/>
dence that he took his first steps toward this just after breaking with Swift, but<lb/>
the evidence suggests it was part of his larger rethinking of the book at this time.<lb/>
Swift had recently published The Temple of Folly with the well-known London<lb/>
publisher Joseph Johnson, and may have believed that he had the influence, and<lb/>
perhaps the money, to ensure the acceptance of a completed manuscript volume<lb/>
by an established publisher. Dibdin now concluded, probably correctly, that he<lb/>
stood to make rather more money if he became his own publisher and used his<lb/>
performances as a way of advertising for subscriptions. In the future, he would<lb/>
regularly be his own publisher.<lb/>
</p>
<p>Dibdin provided a good deal of business for printers in the course of his tour.<lb/>
On arriving in a new area, he would employ the local printer to produce hand-<lb/>
bills advertising his performances. We even know how much he expected to pay<lb/>
for these, for on his second visit to Derby he complained that the printer John<lb/>
Drewry wanted “to charge half-a-crown [i.e., 30p] a hundred for the same sort of<lb/>
bills which he had printed the first time I was there for eighteen-pence” (153–54).<lb/>
From November 1787 onwards, these handbills probably routinely mentioned<lb/>
the planned subscription volume, and for anyone wanting to know more, Dibdin<lb/>
had his separate “proposal.” Working with Dibdin in this way, it would not be<lb/>
surprising if regional printers showed an interest in printing the MT itself, and<lb/>
Dibdin assures his readers that this was the case: “Before I ever saw Mr. Gales I<lb/>
had received numberless civilities at the hands of different printers, from many of<lb/>
whom I have had offers to print my Tour—after I knew Mr. Gales, I preferred<lb/>
him to all the printers I had seen” (207). Joseph Gales (1761–1841), remembered<lb/>
most of all for his radical views and later career in America, was a young printer<lb/>
who had set up business in Sheffield in 1784. Dibdin’s first visit to Sheffield took<lb/>
place in mid-October 1787, and lasted two or three days (129). He makes no<lb/>
mention of having met Gales on that occasion, but he probably did so, for at the<lb/>
end of the year he received a letter from the printer, seemingly inviting him to<lb/>
return to Sheffield, which he promptly did, arriving on 31 December. Because<lb/>
of this return, Dibdin later wrote, he “acquired the friendship of Mr. Gales, and<lb/>
the satisfaction of employing him to print this work” (208).<lb/>
Dibdin remained in Sheffield until 12 January 1788 (213) and in this period<lb/>
must have made definite plans with Gales for the printing of the volume, con-<lb/>
tracting for 600 copies (Advertisement). Dibdin then took off to Manchester for<lb/>
ten days or so before returning to Sheffield; “on the following week,” he then<lb/>
writes, “this Tour was put to press” (242). Although Dibdin does not specify the<lb/>
date, these clues suggest that Gales and his apprentices probably started work<lb/>
on Dibdin’s incomplete manuscript on Monday 28 January. Dibdin was able to<lb/>

<p>
<pb n="264"/>
inspect 64 pages (four sheets) of proofs before leaving Sheffield again, this time<lb/>
for Leeds, where he performed on 11 February. Dibdin later wrote that “it was<lb/>
utterly impracticable I should myself superintend more than the first sixty-four<lb/>
pages” (435). A comparison of the Winchester manuscript with the published<lb/>
MT shows that he made several corrections at this stage. He must also have<lb/>
approved Gales’ typography and generous page layout: there is no doubt that<lb/>
the intention was to produce a large, impressive volume. From this time on, he<lb/>
would send Gales regular instalments of the work through the post: “more than<lb/>
three-fourths of the copy has gone, letter after letter by the post,” Dibdin noted<lb/>
as he approached the end of his book (436). Although he seems to imply here that<lb/>
the letters were sent individually to Gales, it is hard to believe that he would not<lb/>
have sometimes bundled several together. The Winchester manuscript supports<lb/>
this, a certain number of pages containing Gales’ address and post stamps but<lb/>
the number of these far less than the number of letters.<lb/>
</p>
<p>
Dibdin’s position in late January 1788 was almost comically desperate. He<lb/>
had written less than a quarter of the final MT and brought his story up to<lb/>
around the end of August 1787. When he commenced serious work on the MT<lb/>
in October, he had around six months with which to catch up. Now, in January,<lb/>
he was still nearly five months behind himself. Yet his stated intention was<lb/>
to sail for India in April, by which time the MT needed to be completed,<lb/>
published, and<lb/>
delivered to subscribers. The only realistic solution was to accept that the MT<lb/>
would not be able to cover the entirety of the still ongoing tour. Dibdin did so,<lb/>
and on 17 February wrote to Gales from Newcastle, asking him to advertise that<lb/>
“The subscription will finally close by the fifteenth of March and the publication<lb/>
be out by the twenty fifth.”17<lb/>
</p>
<p>
Go to India— dig in mines—tempt any danger— do any thing to better your fortune—to<lb/>
place yourself beyond the power of such humiliation! I declare to heaven I could not sustain<lb/>
the mortifications that you have smiled at, let what might be the consideration. (132)<lb/>
</p>
<p>
Two days later Dibdin replied to this in a manner that suggests he believed he<lb/>
was concluding the MT. This letter of 19 February is entitled “The Duty of a<lb/>
Public Man” and it sets out a general account of Dibdin’s “public conduct” before<lb/>
swelling to a magniloquent conclusion unlike anything he had written before:<lb/>
I believe the best command and obedience within the exercise of the human mind, is a<lb/>
peremptory subduction of all feelings but those which tend to the expansion of the heart,<lb/>
and promote the wide and benevolent circulation of universal liberality, and an implicit<lb/>
submission to all those moral duties which soften the manners, humanize the soul, and<lb/>
impel us to beneficent acts of general fraternal kindness that can alone dignify reason, and<lb/>
lift us into manly preeminence. (138)<lb/>
</p>
<p>
Had the book concluded here, it would have been less than a third of its eventual<lb/>
length and detailed the tour up to the beginning of November 1787.<lb/>
</p>
<p>
17. This letter is preserved in the Winchester manuscript of the MT, between letters 31<lb/>
and 32.<lb/>
</p>
<pb n="265"/>
<p>But Dibdin almost immediately changed his mind.<lb/>
The next letter is dated the following day, 20 February, though there must be some suspicion that Dibdin backdated this in an attempt to disguise the sense of a grand terminus.<lb/>
The really consequential decision behind this was the determination to delay the move to India, thus allowing the tour to be extended and the publication date of the MT to be significantly postponed.<lb/>
He later obliquely explained the change of plan in a letter of 28 April 1788: “I found, should I do so [sail for India in April], I must have gone abroad in a more unpleasant way than—I thank my able and willing friends—I am now likely to do” (423).<lb/>
The reference seems to be primarily to the fact that, by extending the tour, he realized he could make a good deal more money.<lb/>
But the delay also allowed him to finish his book to his satisfaction, and to turn it into a monumental farewell to England.<lb/>
In the end he would not set out on his abortive journey until August.<lb/>
</p>
<p>Between 20 February and 4 March, Dibdin composed ten further letters, adopting a more summary style of narration that took advantage of the fact he had visited many places more than once.<lb/>
This allowed him to bring his account up to mid-December, meaning he was now only three and half months behind himself.<lb/>
Had Dibdin continued at this rate, he could probably have caught up with his own movements in five or six weeks.<lb/>
But he was now returning to Liverpool, a city which had proved particularly welcoming and supportive, and he could potentially make a lot of money there.<lb/>
Dibdin accordingly found himself in a dilemma: should he concentrate on his performances, and all the social networking that ensured good attendance at those performances, or should he concentrate on the MT?<lb/>
The solution he adopted is explained in the penultimate letter in the MT:<lb/>
</p>
<p>When I went last from Sheffield to Liverpool, the matter then written went no farther than Letter 44 —which the reader will see is dated Sheffield, March 4.<lb/>
As I well knew the hospitality I should find at Liverpool, on my return, and the variety of pleasures that would be kindly chalked out for me, I felt myself conscious that to keep pace with Mr. Gales would be no easy matter.<lb/>
We therefore agreed that as soon as Letter 44 should be finished, to go on upon Letter 75, which begins The Readings; as, instead of inventing, I should in that case have nothing to do but copy.<lb/>
Thus we calculated that there would be a vacancy of thirty letters—a number sufficient to contain all that it would be necessary to say on the Tour itself, and the statement of pieces.<lb/>
We outreckoned ourselves however two ways.<lb/>
In the first place, in bringing up the matter to page 307, instead of 305 or 309, we found ourselves entangled with an odd quarter of a sheet, and were thus obliged to have duplicates of the pages 307 and 308, though the matter will be found different.<lb/>
This will all be clearly understood by noticing that Letter 44, is dated as above Sheffield, March 4, Letter 75 —which begins The Readings—is dated Liverpool, March 6, Letter 98 —which finishes The Readings—is dated London, March 22, and Letter 45 —which returns again to the main subject, is dated London, March 25. (438)<lb/>
</p>
<p>There is much to think about in this fascinating glimpse behind the scenes.<lb/>
Dibdin’s report makes it clear that, unsurprisingly, he wanted to publish the finished Tour as soon as possible after completing it; and that by March 1788 he had decided that the completed book should contain the full text of Readings and Music.<lb/>
His initial plan, as set out in the first letter, it may be recalled, involved “the essence of what I have delivered, at different places, under the title of Readings and Music.”<lb/>
It seems unlikely that he meant by that the complete, extended text of his entertainment.<lb/>
But what is most remarkable about the early March<lb/>

<p><pb n="266"/>plans is their grandiosity.<lb/>
On 4 March, Dibdin had brought his narration up to<lb/>
mid-December, and his book up to 183 pages. So far, then, he had worked at<lb/>
a rate of approximately twenty pages per month of tour. By now allowing 123<lb/>
pages for the rest of the tour, he was apparently thinking it might continue to<lb/>
June, or, alternatively, planning a great deal more digression.<lb/>
Dibdin’s later working practice with his <hi>Table Entertainments</hi> was to write<lb/>
out the text he intended to perform, but then to make numerous additions, de-<lb/>
letions and rearrangements as he continued to refine and adapt his work.<note place="foot" xml:id="n18">There are three manuscript volumes of Dibdin’s performance texts for the <hi>Table Entertainments</hi> in the British Library (Add. Mss. 30,960–30,962). From these, notably, <hi>Retrospect Opera</hi> has recently been able to create a performance edition and recording of <hi>The Wags</hi> (1790), Dibdin’s biggest success in the genre (RO008).</note><lb/>
Assuming that <hi>Readings and Music</hi> existed in some comparable form, Dibdin’s job in<lb/>
Liverpool was indeed to “copy,” but also to tidy and regulate. Although the epistolary format made<lb/>
little sense when it came to presenting a supposedly continuous dramatic text, he<lb/>
continued to employ it. <hi>Readings and Music</hi> is thus divided into no less than 24 letters,<lb/>
each one commencing on a new page: the headings, each occupying a third of the<lb/>
page, the spaces at the ends of the letters, and some added footnotes, extend the text<lb/>
to a remarkable 100 pages, not counting the unnumbered pages of score expanding<lb/>
it still further. Even the casual reader can be in no doubt that Dibdin is seeking to fill<lb/>
as many pages as possible. What he presents is not equivalent to any single performance<lb/>
of the show, but a sort of aggregate of all the versions through which it had evolved.<lb/>
Thus the published version in the <hi>MT</hi> includes 50 songs, though Dibdin’s normal<lb/>
performance practice was to sing 24. As he notes in the passage quoted above, Dibdin<lb/>
prepared a text of this “ideal,” extended version of the show between 6 and 22 March.<lb/>
After a brief rest, on 25 March Dibdin began work on the 123-page missing section he<lb/>
would require to complete his volume, and that in the end needed to be 125 pages long.<lb/>
What Dibdin and Gales had forgotten is that the nature of the printing process meant the<lb/>
total number of pages prior to the new material (i.e., <hi>Readings and Music</hi>) needed to be divisible by four—to avoid a single leaf having to be inserted—which would have been the case had they started printing <hi>Readings and Music</hi> on page 305 or 309.<note place="foot" xml:id="n19">Strictly speaking, I believe Dibdin was wrong to say they were “entangled with an odd quarter of a sheet”: they were “entangled” with an odd eighth of a sheet, i.e., 2 pages.</note><lb/>
Dibdin did not find it as easy to fill the gap as he apparently expected. His account of the tour<lb/>
proper was completed on 17 April, but this only brought him to page 249, leaving another 59<lb/>
pages of additional content urgently needing to be filled. Here Dibdin announces that he<lb/>
will “wind up” with a “running account of places, inns, &c. and a few more gleanings,” as<lb/>
well as more “remarks on the subject of music” and a catalogue “of my [theatrical] pieces,<lb/>
and the profits which arose from them” (249). It was the catalogue that served Dibdin best,<lb/>
for, rather absurdly divided into letters like everything else, it filled 24 pages. His original<lb/>
plans for the <hi>MT</hi> had mentioned “many theatrical transactions,” but it is hard to believe<lb/>
that he then imagined it encompassing this sort of career overview. Given that a persistent<lb/>
theme of the book is Dibdin’s not being properly appreciated in England—hence the intended<lb/>

<pb n="267"/>
removal to India—the catalogue allowed him to settle a few more scores and it is not too obviously out of place in what was already a very heterogeneous vol-<lb/>
ume. To modern Dibdin scholars, it has proved invaluable. Dibdin completed<lb/>
the catalogue on 25 April, at which point he had just over 400 consecutive pages<lb/>
of the MT completed.<lb/>
</p>
<p>Dibdin was still not done. The following day he headed a new letter “The<lb/>
Corps de Reserve” and claimed to have “purposely reserved about forty pages<lb/>
for general observations” (407). These were mostly concerned with newspapers<lb/>
and the culture of reviewing and criticism—themes which had earlier loomed<lb/>
large in <hi>The Devil</hi>. Dibdin was, among his many other talents, a notable amateur<lb/>
artist who was able to exhibit at the Royal Academy in 1801, and he drew on<lb/>
the vocabulary of painting to justify this final section of the book: he would “rub<lb/>
off hardnesses, and throw in some finishing touches, to make this picture have a<lb/>
proper roundness and harmony in its general effects” (422). It was an awkward<lb/>
metaphor given that he could not change what had already been printed, and<lb/>
it is unlikely that any reader has ever found the book particularly harmonious:<lb/>
nevertheless, it is significant that Dibdin wanted his work judged this way. He<lb/>
dated the last letter—Letter 107— on 1 May, the day he initially closed the sub-<lb/>
scription, and the volume was finally complete. Toward the end of his labours,<lb/>
Dibdin claimed that the MT had been “written in a greater hurry than ever book<lb/>
was” (419). Even allowing for his proclivity to exaggeration, he surely cannot<lb/>
have considered this the case prior to March 1788. But nearly two-thirds of the<lb/>
volume had been written in March and April, and though hardly unprecedented,<lb/>
this was certainly impressive, especially as there is no obvious falling off in the<lb/>
quality of Dibdin’s writing in these months.<lb/>
</p>
<p>In this final period of intense work, Dibdin enjoyed a remarkable piece of<lb/>
luck which seemingly did a good deal to ensure the success of the MT. In a let-<lb/>
ter dated 23 April, and significantly entitled “The Coup de Theatre,” Dibdin<lb/>
explains that his “kindest and most generous friend” had arranged an audience<lb/>
for him with the Prince of Wales, the future George IV (282). This audience can<lb/>
be dated 5 April 1788 with some precision.<note n="20" place="foot">Dibdin says that it was the evening when “Marchesi Marchesi … made his first appearance<lb/>
at the Opera” (283). Luigi Marchesi was one of the most celebrated singers of his<lb/>
time and his London debut was seen as a major cultural event.<lb/></note> Dibdin played some twenty songs<lb/>
for the prince, some of them certainly drawn from <hi>Readings and Music</hi>, and the<lb/>
climax of the evening came when the future king said “I might use his name in<lb/>
any way that I thought would be of service to me” (283). Dibdin was thus able to<lb/>
dedicate—or, in his preferred term, “inscribe”—the book to the prince, “With<lb/>
pride of heart, humble deference, and grateful susceptibility.” The Winchester<lb/>
manuscript gives some idea of whom the book might have been dedicated to,<lb/>
had this meeting with the prince not been arranged. It contains four dedications<lb/>
each designed for a “single book”: to Dibdin’s wife; to William Davis (eventually<lb/>
the dedicatee of Dibdin’s <hi>Collection of Songs, Selected from the Works of Mr. Dibdin</hi><lb/>
of 1790); to Thomas Preston; and to Gales. The most interesting of these is the<lb/>
inscription to “Mrs. Dibdin / in return for the chearfulness and kind attention<lb/>

<p><pb n="268"/>with which she alleviated the fatigues and inconveniences of / This Tour.”<lb/>
She goes entirely unmentioned in the MT itself.<lb/>
The Prince of Wales’s patronage gave a late boost to the subscription and<lb/>
Dibdin seems to have been quite overwhelmed by it. Indeed, the royalist senti-<lb/>
ments in the MT represent another aspect of this remarkable book’s transfor-<lb/>
mative significance in his career, for Dibdin had previously felt very differently<lb/>
about the House of Hanover. The major royal event during the period he pub-<lb/>
lished <hi>The Devil</hi> was the death of Princess Amelia, George III’s aunt and the last<lb/>
surviving child of George II, on 31 October 1786. <hi>The Devil</hi> includes a complaint<lb/>
that “THE papers, and indeed the whole town [are] at this time absurdly full<lb/>
of the death of the Princess Amelia,” and offers, as an antidote, a humorous<lb/>
<hi>Impromptu</hi>:<lb/>
Amelia in the ground doth lie,<lb/>
And black of course is worn in common;<lb/>
Hard that so many men must dye!<lb/>
In compliment to one old woman.<lb/>
This was probably, though not certainly, written by Dibdin, who in either case<lb/>
was happy to print it, as his only comment on the Princess’s death. After the MT,<lb/>
such sentiments disappear from his writing, and on the contrary he went out of<lb/>
his way to celebrate royal events, as for example with his <hi>Ode in Honour of the Nuptials of Their Royal Highnesses the Prince and Princess of Wales</hi> (1795). In the wake<lb/>
of the French Revolution, Dibdin’s popular brand of royalism, diffused through<lb/>
dozens of songs, did much to shore up loyalist feeling in England.<lb/>
The publication of the MT was set for 12 May. On 26 April, Dibdin and<lb/>
Gales claimed they had “nearly five Hundred” subscribers, some of whom had<lb/>
subscribed for multiple copies, and that the subscription would close on 1 May.<lb/>
By the time Gales printed the list of “Subscribers’ Names,” 557 copies were<lb/>
accounted for, though my own amended copy of the MT, seemingly used by<lb/>
Gales as a sort of reference copy, shows that a few subscribers had withdrawn,<lb/>
or been wrongly recorded in the first place. Dibdin intended to take the remain-<lb/>
ing copies to India. When the volume appeared on 12 May, an “Advertisement”<lb/>
at the front written by Dibdin— occupying the final leaves of the Winchester<lb/>
manuscript— claimed there had been a late surge of interest, with “nearly two<lb/>
hundred” extra copies subscribed for; Dibdin was accordingly extending the sub-<lb/>
scription to 12 June, after which a “second edition” would be printed by John<lb/>
Preston in London (Gales having “a prior engagement”). This may in part have<lb/>
been marketing hype, for I have found no evidence that any second edition was<lb/>
actually produced. A balanced reading of the evidence would suggest that the<lb/>
book was probably oversubscribed, but not to such an extent that it made sense<lb/>
to print a new edition. Nevertheless, despite his tendency to grumble, it seems<lb/>
that both the musical tour and the volume he wrote about it succeeded beyond<lb/>
Dibdin’s expectations.<lb/>

<p>The consequences were momentous. Having worked the idea of India out<lb/>

<head>STAGES OF COMPOSITION IN<lb/>
CHARLOTTE BRONTË’S FAIR-COPY<lb/>
MANUSCRIPT OF SHIRLEY</head>
<p>by<lb/>
Barbara Heritage</p>
<p>On September 8, 1849, James Taylor traveled from London to Haworth, Yorkshire, to collect the manuscript of Charlotte Brontë’s novel Shirley for<lb/>
publication.^1 His firm, Smith, Elder and Co., had been awaiting the completion<lb/>
of the book for nearly a year. Readers both in England and abroad were eager<lb/>
to read the next work by Currer Bell, whose first published novel, Jane Eyre, had<lb/>
attracted so much notice. Before that, the previously unknown writer had co-<lb/>
written and published only an obscure collection of poetry with Acton and Ellis<lb/>
Bell that few had read. The public continued to speculate about the identity of<lb/>
this new author, who had written with such power and originality.</p>
<p>Composed in three physically distinct volumes for publication as a three-<lb/>
volume novel, the fair-copy manuscript of Shirley consists of high-grade writing<lb/>
paper—a mixture of wove and laid folded half-sheets— copied out in a clear,<lb/>
legible hand with a steel-tipped dip pen. Although the first two volumes of the<lb/>
manuscript are each made up of about 140 bifolia or approximately 280 leaves,<lb/>
the third volume is noticeably longer, composed of about 160 bifolia or 320<lb/>
leaves. Examining these, one finds that the novel’s text has been carefully written<lb/>
</p>
<p>1. The summary description conveyed at the outset of this essay draws on my biblio-<lb/>
graphical findings, described in detail later in this work. The dates are from correspondence<lb/>
collected in Margaret Smith’s invaluable edition, The Letters of Charlotte Brontë (Oxford:<lb/>
Clarendon Press, 2000). For more on Taylor’s invitation to Haworth, see Letters, 2:247. The<lb/>
research presented in this essay was made possible by a 2019 research award from the Wil-<lb/>
lison Foundation Charitable Trust as well as a 2015 award from the Friends of Princeton<lb/>
University Library. I am grateful to Karen Chase, Jerome McGann, and Michael F. Suarez,<lb/>
S.J. for supporting those projects. A number of other colleagues greatly aided this work: Ann<lb/>
Dinsdale and Sarah Laycock at the Brontë Parsonage Museum provided not only access to<lb/>
rare and fragile materials, some of which were on display, but also expert guidance on their<lb/>
respective collections. Alexandra Ault, Karen Limper-Herz, Alexander Lock, and Laura<lb/>
Walker provided key assistance at the British Library. I am also grateful to Tim Dolin and<lb/>
David Vander Meulen, who both provided feedback toward the final stage of publishing this<lb/>
article. I am most indebted, however, to Terry Belanger, for reading this essay in its own vari-<lb/>
ous stages of composition during what turned out to be an unprecedented global pandemic.<lb/>
His bibliographical expertise, learned observations, and helpful suggestions improved this<lb/>
work at every turn. Finally, my own bibliographical research would not have been possible<lb/>
without his support and the early training that I received at Rare Book School. This work<lb/>
is dedicated to him.</p>

<p>out onto the recto of each leaf. (Only two leaves contain any content from the<lb/>
novel on their versos.) The upper right-hand corner of each leaf bears numbering<lb/>
in brown ink. At the beginning of the manuscript, the sequence appears to be<lb/>
regular enough. But starting in the second volume, the brown-ink numbers have<lb/>
been crossed out and replaced by a new series written in red ink that continues<lb/>
to the end of the third volume.</p>
<p>The manuscript’s widely spaced lines provide ample room for alterations<lb/>
to its text. Although some leaves bear no revisions at all, most reflect at least<lb/>
some kind of change, whether the crossing-out of a sentence, the re-wording<lb/>
of a phrase, or the insertion of new writing in the author’s clear hand. More<lb/>
remarkable though are other, more structural changes: a number of the manu-<lb/>
script’s leaves exhibit large excisions — conspicuous gaps where portions of<lb/>
paper have been cut out with a blade. Some leaves are two-thirds of their<lb/>
original size, while others are less than half the height of other full leaves in<lb/>
the manuscript. One leaf has been sliced down to a small fragment containing<lb/>
just a few lines.</p>
<p>These gaping excisions appear to have been made with a pen knife. The<lb/>
edges where the unwanted parts have been excised are jagged—not the smooth<lb/>
continuous cuts made by scissors. It is likely that some, but not all, of the leaves<lb/>
bearing excisions were still conjugate, over the fold, with their companion<lb/>
leaves, when Brontë gave the manuscript to Taylor on September 8. In ad-<lb/>
dition, some of the manuscript’s quires, or groupings of nested bifolia, would<lb/>
likely have appeared to have been opened or sliced along their conjugate folds<lb/>
and then rearranged.<sup>2</sup> And some singleton leaves would have been inserted in<lb/>
various places.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>Upon Taylor’s return to London, the fair-copy manuscript was probably<lb/>
reviewed by Brontë’s publisher, George Smith, before being delivered to the<lb/>
printing house of Stewart and Murray, where it served as the printer’s copy.<lb/>
There, the remaining folds of the manuscript’s gatherings would have been<lb/>
opened with a knife or paper cutter, dismantling the manuscript’s nested bifolia<lb/>
into individual leaves, and enabling their circulation in small batches among the<lb/>
</p>
<div type="footnotes">
<note n="2" place="bottom">I discuss the manuscript’s quire structure, as well as the sale of stationery in quires,<lb/>
in more detail below. There are instances where entire leaves were fully excised from the<lb/>
manuscript volumes, which would have necessitated splitting the manuscript’s bifolia. For<lb/>
example, a leaf occurring in volume 2, which would have been numbered in pencil and<lb/>
brown ink as 374, is missing from Brontë’s brown-ink numbering sequence in volume 2. It<lb/>
was removed as part of a revision to “Mr. Donne’s Exodus” that entailed partial excisions to<lb/>
neighboring leaves 373 and 375 (BM ff. 94 and 95). The excisions and removal of the leaf, in<lb/>
this instance, pertain to a conversation in which the novel’s heroines, Caroline Helstone and<lb/>
Shirley Keeldar, are discussing Robert Moore’s guarded interest in Caroline. The extracted<lb/>
leaf, which almost certainly contained Shirley’s outspoken thoughts on the matter (“In what<lb/>
way does it pique you?”), was removed by Brontë as part of the third state of the manuscript’s<lb/>
composition—before the “C” stage of red ink numbering, a process also described in more<lb/>
detail below.</note>
<note n="3" place="bottom">This aspect of the manuscript’s composition, described in more detail below, is evident<lb/>
in the occasional insertion of odd numbers of leaves, given that the manuscript was in large<lb/>
part composed on bifolia.</note>

<p>
compositors.<sup>4</sup> In the printing house, each chapter of the manuscript was divided<lb/>
among the men, who would set their particular portion into type.<lb/>
Wilson began work on leaves one through three, his name appearing in pencil on the first recto of the batch.<lb/>
The name of another compositor, Courtney, appears at the head of the first full paragraph on the recto of the fourth leaf; he started setting the next few pages.<lb/>
Ross began work at the paragraph beginning on the middle of the seventh leaf, and Walter Beck (signed as “Walter”) took the first full paragraph beginning on the tenth leaf.<lb/>
Robertson started with the thirteenth leaf—Allen, with the sixteenth leaf.<lb/>
Bicknell began with the nineteenth leaf and set the end of the chapter.<lb/>
And so the crew of compositors worked, collectively setting each handwritten chapter into type.<lb/>
The dust and grime from the sorts of lead type dirtied their hands, which sullied the fine linen paper of the manuscript with their fingerprints.<lb/>
Within a matter of days, Charlotte Brontë received by mail the first proof sheets of her novel, along with suggested revisions from James Taylor and W. S. Williams, her readers at Smith, Elder.<sup>5</sup><lb/>
By September 17, she had marked up and returned the first batch of proof sheets for review by her publishers, who would then have sent the corrected sheets to the printing house.<sup>6</sup><lb/>
As part of this multi-stage process, Brontë agreed, at the suggestion of her publisher, to rewrite in English an essay that had appeared in French in the third volume of the manuscript; for this purpose, she asked for the return of the requisite portion.<lb/>
Her editors received and approved the new leaves of the manuscript<sup>7</sup> and the proofs passed quickly back and forth between Haworth and London.<lb/>
A set was sent to New York to Harper & Brothers, which had paid George Smith £50 for the “first sheets of Currer Bell’s new work” on September 20.<sup>8</sup>
</p>
<note n="4" place="foot">
The fair-copy manuscripts for <hi>Jane Eyre</hi> and <hi>Villette</hi> also served as printer’s copy. As with the manuscript for <hi>Shirley</hi>, both were divided among the compositors, with sections of each chapter distributed to various typesetters. This procedure conformed with the general practices summarized by the printer William Savage, who notes: “Copy is generally given out to the compositor in regular portions … if in manuscript, a chapter, or section, as it may be; for the compositor has never the whole volume in his hands at once, excepting it be bound and not allowed to be cut up, or taken to pieces.” See <hi>A Dictionary of the Art of Printing</hi> (London: Longman, Brown, Green, and Longman, 1841), 187. The printer Caleb Stower advises: “With manuscript copy it will be better to take one from the other in such a manner as not in the smallest degree to delay the imposition, or block up the letter; that is, that no compositor may retain the making up too long by holding too large a taking of copy.” See <hi>The Compositor’s and Pressman’s Guide to the Art of Printing</hi> (London: B. Crosby and Co., 1808), 93.

10. When I began comparing copies of the first American edition with the manuscript<lb/>
and first London edition in the autumn of 2020, I discovered a series of variants in the<lb/>
earliest state of the last chapter of the first American edition that are reflected in the<lb/>
fair-copy MS, but not in the first London edition, as printed by Smith, Elder. My<lb/>
curiosity had been spurred by an observation made by Walter E. Smith, who noted in<lb/>
<hi>The Brontë Sisters: A Bibliographical Catalogue</hi> (Los Angeles: Heritage Book Shop, 1991) the presence of additional text on p. 206 of “some copies” of the first American<lb/>
edition in wrappers, published by Harper & Brothers (HB) in 1849, that was not<lb/>
present in any of the other editions he had seen: “You may meet these two again,<lb/>
reader, one day, or you may not; none but the presumptuous promise for the future:<lb/>
we know not what a day or an hour may bring forth” (Smith, 125). Smith did not<lb/>
trace this variant to the MS; but when I did, I found numerous other instances that<lb/>
clearly show that the English proofs initially used to compose the first American<lb/>
edition did not reflect Brontë’s final text for the first London edition, but rather an<lb/>
earlier set of proofs that retained language from the MS and that were later altered or<lb/>
removed as part of subsequent proof-stage revisions. For example, on p. 203 in the<lb/>
second column of the first HB edition, the text reads: “a rose-tree, transplanted from<lb/>
the Hollow, which bloomed”—language appearing in the MS (BM f. 311); the Smith,<lb/>
Elder (SE) edition reads: “a rose-tree, which bloomed” (p. 306). Page 206 of the HB<lb/>
edition reads “stone or brick and ashes,” as with the MS (BM f. 322), while the SE<lb/>
edition reads “stone and brick and ashes” (p. 316). Some instances include<lb/>
early text entirely removed from Smith Elder’s edition of the novel. For example, the<lb/>
following text appears on BM f. 306 of the MS and in column two on p. 202 of the HB<lb/>
edition, but not in the SE edition: “I don’t know whether I have duly disposed of all<lb/>
minor characters; I fear not; but if any friend wishes to know more, a note addressed to<lb/>
Mr. Currer Bell, Haylane Cottage, Hay, near Millcote, may be expected to meet with<lb/>
prompt attention. I confess this promise seems given in rather equivocal terms—no<lb/>
matter: the experiment, if approved, might be tried.” A full list of variants from the<lb/>
first state of the N gathering of the HB edition will appear in a forthcoming critical<lb/>
edition of <hi>Shirley</hi> that I am co-editing with Tim Dolin for Cambridge University Press.<lb/>
These variants provide valuable additional insight into the texts of the proofs, which<lb/>
are no longer extant. I also located variants at the end of the first printing of the HB<lb/>
edition of <hi>Villette</hi> that correlate with the surviving proofs for <hi>Villette</hi> located<lb/>
in Sterling Library, University of London.<lb/>

<note place="foot" n="14">Scholarship conducted on Emily Dickinson’s poetry manuscripts is well known, including R. W. Franklin’s foundational edition, <hi>The Manuscript Books of Emily Dickinson</hi> (Cambridge, MA: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1981) and Marta L. Werner’s <hi>Emily Dickinson’s Open Folios: Scenes of Reading, Surfaces of Writing</hi> (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1995), as well as more recent studies, such as Cristanne Miller’s <hi>Emily Dickinson’s Poems as She Preserved Them</hi> (Cambridge, MA: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 2016). Other notable and influential studies of manuscripts include: Charles Robinson’s study of Mary Shelley’s “Frankenstein notebooks,” which includes highly detailed information, such as beta-radiographs of the watermarks found in the notebooks; Fredson Bowers’ bibliographical scholarship on the manuscripts of Walt Whitman, including <hi>Whitman’s Manuscripts: Leaves of Grass (1860): A Parallel Text</hi> (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, [1955]); William M.

This is, of course, just a small sample of the important work that has been done on modern literary manuscripts.

<p>on manuscripts still concentrates on pre-modern documents.15 <lb/>
The term <hi>codicology</hi> therefore may hold little meaning for English-language scholars interested <lb/>
in nineteenth-century materials.16 Even so, this systematic way of studying the <lb/>
structures of manuscripts takes into account all kinds of material evidence crucial <lb/>
for understanding how authors composed their works. Supplies such as writing <lb/>
instruments, inks, and paper stocks, along with processes such as ruling, copying, <lb/>
excising and inserting, paginating, and binding, can usefully (and sometimes criti- <lb/>
cally) inform our understanding of how writing is composed, revised, or otherwise <lb/>
altered. Additional information, including how individuals other than authors <lb/>
(e.g., printers, publishers, later owners, bookbinders, curators, and conservators) <lb/>
have altered manuscripts, is essential for understanding exactly whose “hands”— <lb/>
and whose handiwork—we see when we ourselves handle and study these artifacts.</p>

<p>It may surprise some readers that the Brontës’ literary manuscripts have not <lb/>
yet received this kind of close codicological and bibliographical attention, given <lb/>
the sisters’ international fame and cultural stature. Scholars have tended to rely <lb/>
on biographical explanations for interpreting the Brontës’ manuscripts. Some of <lb/>
these assessments have focused on the patriarchal systems and cultural condi- <lb/>
tions that challenged and limited the work of nineteenth-century women writers. <lb/>
Other accounts have traced the Brontës’ writing practices to imaginative and <lb/>
even unconscious, trance-like states.17 Few have attempted a more holistic and <lb/>
methodical examination of the documents’ material construction.</p>

<p>In the case of <hi>Shirley</hi>, Charlotte Brontë made numerous partial-leaf excisions <lb/>
to her fair-copy manuscript in the late spring and summer of 1849 as part of late- <lb/>
stage revisions to its text before handing over the manuscript to her publisher in <lb/>
September of that year. These visible extractions have intrigued and puzzled the <lb/>
handful of scholars and editors who have worked closely with the novel’s three <lb/>
manuscript volumes. Most of these writers have discussed the excisions in connection with</p>

<p>tion with the deaths of Charlotte Brontë’s three remaining siblings—Branwell,<lb/>
Emily, and Anne—which took place while the novel was still awaiting comple-<lb/>
tion. They have described with poignance the deep grief that Brontë endured,<lb/>
and they have speculated about the particular challenges that she likely faced in<lb/>
response to her profound loss—accounts that have impressed subsequent gen-<lb/>
erations of readers and writers. At the same time, the perceived impact of this<lb/>
loss has overshadowed other details of importance pertaining to the manuscript:<lb/>
why the excisions were made, when they were made, and how they relate to the<lb/>
overall material structure of the manuscript in its many stages of composition.<lb/>
The present study offers a fresh interpretation of the manuscript and, by<lb/>
extension, Charlotte Brontë’s own practices as a woman writer. Here I have at-<lb/>
tempted to provide an intensive analysis of the manuscript’s physical features—<lb/>
its paper, leaf and page numbering, inks, excisions, and insertions—by drawing<lb/>
on a variety of bibliographical and codicological methods that, taken together,<lb/>
yield new insight into Brontë’s compositional practices. The evidence result-<lb/>
ing from this analysis calls into question standard critical accounts of how the<lb/>
manuscript was composed and edited. My findings include the discovery of late<lb/>
additions, significant expansions, and previously undetected revisions that are<lb/>
documented within the very structure of the manuscript. Hidden within plain<lb/>
sight, these changes bear silent but powerful witness to Brontë’s strategic ap-<lb/>
proach to crafting her narrative. At the same time, when interpreted alongside<lb/>
Brontë’s correspondence, these alterations to the manuscript tell a more nuanced<lb/>
story of the woman writer at work. Among the strata of the manuscript’s leaves,<lb/>
we can trace gaps in writing when Brontë was primarily serving as a caregiver for<lb/>
her dying siblings. The manuscript was inadvertently shaped by these caregiving<lb/>
duties, which required Brontë’s emotional and physical attention and which often<lb/>
took priority over the labor of writing itself. The manuscript thus makes mate-<lb/>
rial the kinds of hard, practical challenges that women writers such as Charlotte<lb/>
Brontë faced in caring for their families while pursuing careers as authors.<lb/>
Modern manuscripts, like all historical artifacts, are subject to alteration and<lb/>
modification over time—their handling by compositors and press readers, the<lb/>
sequences of their leaves (whether unbound or as the result of a later binding<lb/>
process), and even their contents, in the event that new leaves are introduced or<lb/>
existing leaves are repaired. In the case of <hi>Shirley</hi>, the manuscript has been sig-<lb/>
nificantly altered through interventions made by those who have been in contact<lb/>
with it over more than a century and a half.<lb/>
The manuscript volumes thus present various strata of data— different forms<lb/>
of handwriting, numbering, and leaf placement—that are the result of various<lb/>
agencies at work, sometimes with different intentions that are not clearly de-<lb/>
lineated as such. The surviving manuscript of <hi>Shirley</hi> is not just the product of<lb/>
one individual, but of many—not a solo aria, but rather like a chorus that is, at<lb/>
times, discordant. Just as one must attune one’s ear to identify different voices<lb/>
and instruments in the study of music, we must train our eyes to read various<lb/>
hands and the work of their tools.<lb/>
Brontë composed <hi>Shirley</hi> as a three-volume novel, and its narrative is contin-<lb/>
gent on its intended format in three parts, its word count, its pacing—and, as we<lb/>
</p>
<pb n="278"/>
<p>shall see, its physical structure.<lb/>
Each of the three novels that Charlotte Brontë wrote and that were published during her lifetime—<hi>Jane Eyre</hi>, <hi>Shirley</hi>, and <hi>Villette</hi>18—were formulated and composed for publication as three-volume novels in print.19<lb/>
Her publisher specifically sought novels in this format to meet the demands of circulating libraries, whose terms and conditions, in turn, proved lucrative for both parties.20<lb/>
As others have noted, the divisions between volumes were integral to the novel’s overall structure and plot.21<lb/>
The complex editorial process underlying <hi>Shirley</hi>’s own three-volume structure is made apparent, in part, by evidence found in paper stocks—a bibliographical analysis that can usefully inform our critical interpretations with regard not only to the novel’s shape, but also its meaning.<lb/>
</p>
<p>Since <hi>Shirley</hi>’s initial publication in 1849, much of the criticism on the novel has had to do with the unity of its structure or the lack thereof.<lb/>
George Henry Lewes, who had so warmly championed <hi>Jane Eyre</hi> after its publication in 1847, asserts in an unsigned review that Currer Bell’s second published novel is “not a picture; but a portfolio of random sketches.”22<lb/>
He writes: “The book may be laid down at any chapter, and almost any chapter might be omitted.”23<lb/>
This strand of criticism has continued in various forms into the twenty-first century.<lb/>
Various rationales have been proposed for Brontë’s organization of <hi>Shirley</hi>.<lb/>
The novel’s collage-like quality, perceived as a flaw by Lewes for its lack of “artistic fusion,”24 has been interpreted by others as a deliberate, experimental approach.<lb/>
For instance, in her chapter “The Terrible Handwriting: Shirley,” Heather Glen interprets <hi>Shirley</hi> as a “self-conscious play with the fictional medium itself”25—a heteroglossia, cacophony of voices not unlike the Tower of Babel, which, as Glen shows, was both the subject of other artists known to the Brontës and a shaping influence on them.26<lb/>
</p>
<p>In their respective analyses and opposing views, Lewes and Glen both gesture toward physical media—the portfolio and handwriting—to make their points.<lb/>
But for Lewes and Glen, these analogies are merely figurative; they are not intended to refer to the actual physical presentation of Brontë’s manuscript, which holds little interest for them, despite the intriguing parallels their comparisons suggest.<lb/>
Lewes speaks of the “portfolio” of the visual artist, while Glen considers not the handwrit-<lb/>

<head>1. The Current State of the Manuscript</head><lb/>
<p>Even a quick glance at the fair-copy manuscript of Shirley suggests that many<lb/>
hands have modified the manuscript since it left Charlotte Brontë’s custody. Currently, volumes 1 and 3 are three-quarter bound in boards covered in brown<lb/>
goatskin and fine-grained book cloth. These recent bindings date from August<lb/>
1976, when volumes 1 and 3 of the manuscript were rebound by the BL,28 according to a “Record of Treatment” tipped in onto the rectos of the first of three rear<lb/>
free endpapers.29 Volume 2 of the manuscript is still in a binding that was likely<lb/>
commissioned by Brontë’s publisher, George Smith. The binding of volume 2<lb/>
consists of worn, three-quarter tan calf and boards covered in marbled paper,<lb/>
in a manner typical of the last quarter of the nineteenth century; the volume<lb/>
contains light brown uncoated endpapers with a single flyleaf at the front appearing to have been introduced as part of the binding process.30 When the BL later<lb/>

<p>Although such information may seem peripheral to the study of Brontë’s own<lb/>document, it is crucial for any editor or critic to note. Any time a book is rebound,<lb/>additional materials can be introduced into its structure; the leaves of a manuscript<lb/>can be removed or added to— or reorganized and joined in various ways—par-<lb/>ticularly in this case, in which they have been supplemented and altered. Often<lb/>binders and conservators will make repairs to paper leaves as part of the rebind-<lb/>ing process. Such alterations can materially influence the shape of a work. (I once<lb/>discovered, for instance, that one of Brontë’s early manuscripts, held in a leading<lb/>research library, had been rearranged and digitized out of order after it had been<lb/>treated by a conservator, who was presumably well intentioned but apparently<lb/>unfamiliar with the manuscript’s textual contents.) Today, professional conserva-<lb/>tors routinely and very carefully document their alterations to books, a trend that<lb/>started in the 1970s according to Cathleen Baker.<note place="foot" n="32">Cathleen Baker addressed this issue as part of a discussion she led on RBS Online in<lb/>October 28, 2020: “How Making Paper by Hand and by Machine Impacts Its<lb/>Characteristics.”</note> In the nineteenth century,<lb/>however, bookbinders who performed restoration work did not usually note their<lb/>modifications. Even with respect to changes made in the twentieth century, one<lb/>cannot rely on accurate recordkeeping. For example, the BL has no documenta-<lb/>tion available outlining any former alterations made to the paper leaves of the<lb/>manuscript volumes of <hi>Shirley</hi>—a troubling oversight, as this valuable<lb/>manuscript bears many excisions and repairs, as well as additions and rearrange-<lb/>ments.</p>
<p>To undertake my study, I created a table to document the manuscript’s paper<lb/>stocks, its multiple forms of leaf and page numbering, its writing media (i.e., dif-<lb/>ferent colored inks and pencil), its excisions, the compositors’ markup, and other<lb/>notable features (e.g., paper repairs, sewing holes, &c.). Using a light sheet, I<lb/>moved through the manuscript, page by page, recording this information for all<lb/>of its 896 leaves; I performed this work at the BL twice, first in 2017, and then<lb/>again in 2019 to check my earlier work and to record additional details about the<lb/>manuscript’s leaf and page numbering, which turned out to be more complicated<lb/>than expected.</p>
<p>Paper-based evidence confirms that one full wove leaf (vol. 1, BM f. 215) was added<lb/>to the manuscript as part of its nineteenth-century binding—an alteration that was<lb/>also documented by the British Museum staff when they officially acces-<lb/>sioned the manuscript in 1949.<note place="foot" n="33">The note reads: “the blank leaf between ff. 214 & 216, inserted in place of the original<lb/>f. 215, was in its present position when the MS. was received in the B.M.” The note is<lb/>written in blue pen on the label appearing on the verso of the first of three endpapers<lb/>at the back of volume 1, Add MS 43477.</note> This full leaf apparently replaced a fragment<lb/>of a leaf that had been so heavily excised by Brontë and, consequently, so small,<lb/>
<pb n="281"/><p>that it appears to have been lost before the manuscript was first bound at the<lb/>instruction of George Smith.<sup>34</sup><lb/>Later, another full wove leaf (BM f. 22, vol. 1)<lb/>seems to have been added by the BL conservators during the 1976 rebind to fill<lb/>in a gap in the manuscript’s foliation—an omission, notably, in the numbering<lb/>to the leaves falling between the novel’s first and second chapters, but entailing<lb/>no loss to the text.<sup>35</sup> We will return to this detail, which is significant.<lb/>Drawing on this evidence, as well as the chronology of the binding work<lb/>itself, we can deduce who made the paper repairs to Brontë’s partial-leaf excisions.<lb/>Except for two early repairs made by Brontë herself, all of the repairs to<lb/>the leaves in the second volume of the manuscript appear to have been made as<lb/>part of the nineteenth-century binding.<sup>36</sup> How can one tell? The second volume<lb/>was not rebound by the BL, and so many of the leaves (particularly those whose<lb/>partial-leaf excisions run the full width of the leaf) could not have been guarded<lb/>or safely patched without first disbinding the volume. Notably, the red ink of the<lb/>British Museum stamp, applied to the versos of select leaves of the manuscript<lb/>when it was accessioned in 1949, appears on top of one of these pre-existing repairs<lb/>(BM f. 10). Of the fifteen partial-leaf excisions<sup>37</sup> in volume 2 unrepaired by<lb/>Brontë, only four (or 27%) were patched with new partial leaves pasted onto the<lb/>versos of the leaves to stabilize them.<sup>38</sup> The glue used to affix these nineteenth-century patches has damaged the manuscript’s leaves in places, probably owing to the acidity of the adhesive.</p><note n="34" place="foot">Following the text of the 1849 London edition of <hi>Shirley</hi>, this missing fragment would have read as follows, “where, and whom she would. Rose was to have a fine, generous soul, a noble intellect profoundly cultivated, a heart as true as steel, but the manner to attract was not to be hers.” (See p. 204 of volume 1 of the London edition, printed by Smith, Elder, or p. 174 of the Clarendon edition.) Presumably, the excised text that followed the fragment pertained to Rose Yorke’s inability to attract others. This interpretation must remain speculative, given that the proof sheets do not survive.</note><lb/><note n="35" place="foot">Unlike BM f. 215, this blank leaf was not noted as being in the manuscript when it was accessioned. Also, this leaf was not foliated with the other leaves in 1949, and it matches the same wove paper used to mount all of the leaves for the 1976 BL rebinding.</note><lb/><note n="36" place="foot">Both of the repairs made by Brontë in volume 2 entail textual changes in the running texts falling on BM ff. 270 and 280. BM f. 270 consists of two joined fragments of leaves: the first fragment is 8.65 cm tall (9 lines); the second fragment is 6 cm tall (6 lines). Both are 18.5 cm wide (as with all other leaves in the MS). Both the cut at the bottom edge of the upper fragment and the cut at the top edge of the lower fragment are wavy, suggesting that Brontë excised a portion of text from the middle of a full leaf, and then joined the upper and lower fragments together. The upper leaf is pasted on top of the upper portion of the lower leaf. No marginal stub from the original MS appears to be present, suggesting that the leaf may have been a singleton—hence the necessity for joining the fragments resulting from the excision. BM f. 280 consists of a similar case: two fragments of leaves were mended together; the upper leaf is pasted on top of upper portion of the lower leaf. The upper fragment measures from 4.1 to 5 cm in height, and the lower fragment 11.2 to 11.7 cm in height. Taken together, the entire mended leaf measures 16 cm tall.</note><lb/><note n="37" place="foot">There are 17 partial-leaf excisions in volume 2; yet one of them, BM f. 159, which has been “counted” as an excision by past editors and tracked as such in this study, is likely a half-leaf insertion that entailed no removal of text from the MS.</note><lb/><note n="38" place="foot">It appears that the aim of that first series of nineteenth-century repairs was to stabilize vulnerable leaves that had been heavily excised in the middle—but not the half-sheet excisions or smaller excisions made by Brontë to the tops or bottoms of leaves. The wove paper used to repair these leaves appears to match the aforementioned white wove paper at BM f. 215, vol. 1, which consists of a blank leaf paginated in pencil brackets in a nineteenth-century hand.</note>

<p>to the adhesive’s high acidic content. In addition, these older repairs39 are identifi-
able as such, as they bear visible acid damage from the iron gall ink that Brontë<lb/>
used— damage that is not yet visible on the more recent repairs made to the<lb/>
manuscript in the twentieth century.40<lb/>
In contrast, four (or 57%) of the seven leaves bearing partial-leaf excisions in<lb/>
BL-bound volume 3 have been repaired. These patches appear to be made with<lb/>
paper matching the blank, unpaginated, full wove cream-colored leaf (BM f. 22,<lb/>
vol. 1) inserted into volume 1 during the 1976 rebind, as well as the paper of the<lb/>
new guards used to mount the leaves in volumes 1 and 3 as part of the conserva-
tion and rebinding process. The paste used to make these repairs does not exhibit<lb/>
the damage evident to the earlier repairs made in volume 2. And, tellingly, the<lb/>
BM stamp appears neither on these repairs nor in the center of unrepaired leaves<lb/>
(as it does in the second volume), but rather on the remaining fragmentary por-
tions at the margins of the leaves (e.g., BM ff. 99 and 100, vol. 3). Why is this<lb/>
so? Either the excised central portions of these leaves were still unrepaired and<lb/>
missing when the BM accessioned and stamped the binding nearly thirty years<lb/>
earlier; or cruder repairs already made in the nineteenth century were replaced<lb/>
by the BL as part of the 1976 conservation of manuscript volumes 1 and 3. Re-
sidual damage to the paper affecting the original leaf, but not to the wove repair<lb/>
itself, suggests that the latter could have been the case. No repairs were made to<lb/>
the four excisions in volume 1, beyond the two leaves that Brontë mended herself<lb/>
(BM ff. 126 and 144).41</p>
<head>2. Brontë’s Alterations to the Manuscript</head>
<p>Having established the scope of the binders’ and conservators’ interventions,<lb/>
we can now turn to Charlotte Brontë’s own work with the volumes. This aspect<lb/>
of the manuscript requires more interpretation and bibliographical analysis, as<lb/>
much of the evidence pertaining to Brontë’s own alterations has been either<lb/>
destroyed or hidden.</p>
<p>The current manuscript consists of 896 leaves, including both the leaf added<lb/>
during the BL rebind and the replacement leaf added during the nineteenth-cen-
tury binding of the manuscript. Volume 1 contains 284 leaves; volume 2 consists<lb/>
of 289 leaves; and volume 3 includes 323 leaves. Volume 3 appears to have been<lb/>
originally planned on a scale similar with volumes 1 and 2, but, as we shall see,<lb/>
it was expanded in the late stages of the novel’s composition. In all, Brontë’s fair<lb/>
copy would have consisted of 895 leaves.</p>

replace a stanza of poetry that was probably excised. With respect to BM f. 144, it appears as<lb/>
though she removed two lines from within the leaf following the poem and preceding the nar-
rator’s wry comment about the poem not reflecting on the relationship between Caroline and<lb/>
Robert Moore. The fragments were joined by Brontë, but a gap remains unrepaired following “Robin-a-Ree.”</p>

The manuscript contains a number of conspicuous partial-leaf excisions that<lb/>
require interpretation. Although one critic has speculated that the paper was cut<lb/>
away with sewing scissors, it is more likely that Brontë made the excisions with<lb/>
the blade of a quill cutter42 to remove portions of leaves (and their text) from<lb/>
the manuscript during various stages of its composition and revision. I note 28<lb/>
partial-leaf excisions made by Brontë—just one more than was identified by<lb/>
Herbert Rosengarten and Margaret Smith, the editors of the 1979 Clarendon<lb/>
edition, which remains the most textually authoritative edition of the novel to<lb/>
date.43 Rosengarten and Smith argue that these partial-leaf excisions, combined<lb/>
with other revisions to the document, “reflect Charlotte’s difficulties in writing<lb/>
the novel.”44 Surveying the many changes made to volumes 2 and 3, they note<lb/>
Brontë’s “‘dark and desolate’ period of bereavement in 1849,” and they argue<lb/>
that, when compared to the fair-copy manuscript volumes of Jane Eyre, the manu-<lb/>
script volumes of Shirley offer “physical evidence of Charlotte’s greater uncer-<lb/>
taity of composition and more laborious revision.”45 Notably, the Clarendon<lb/>
editors rely on a biographical explanation for many of these changes, including<lb/>
the weight of Emily Brontë’s death on her sister: the “painful, even raw, reality,<lb/>
that will not, perhaps, easily be adapted into the fictional framework.”46 One<lb/>
comes away with the overwhelming sense that the excisions to the manuscript<lb/>
are akin to scars—physical scars—resulting from the real and multiple traumas<lb/>
that Brontë endured while writing it. Recently this sentiment has been echoed,<lb/>
if not somewhat distorted, by another critic, who characterizes the manuscript as<lb/>
“a text of grief” that “makes material a sorrowful mind.”47 Yet, while the death<lb/>
of Charlotte Brontë’s sisters unquestionably influenced the writing of the novel,<lb/>
this tendency to interpret the manuscript through the lens of biography has ob-<lb/>
scured our understanding of it. So powerful has been the pull of this wrenching<lb/>

<note n="43">The Clarendon edition of Shirley uses the first edition as its copy text, and incorporates emendations “wherever possible” from the manuscript or second edition. As part of that enterprise, editors Rosengarten and Smith attempt to identify all of the significant revisions that Brontë made to the manuscript; their careful analysis was limited, however, by their methods in examining the manuscript itself. The various states of the manuscript and its stages of composition become evident when analyzing the paper stocks along with the manuscript’s multiple forms of leaf/page numbering. The Clarendon editors do not identify the former (it was not part of the scope of their project), and they document the latter only in part. Notably, the final page-numbering so often referred to by scholars was not made by Brontë at all, but rather was the work of BM curators who foliated the manuscript in the twentieth century— circumstances that I describe in more detail below.</note><lb/>

<p>A close study of the manuscript’s paper and leaf and page numbering reveals<lb/>
that a number of expansions were made to the manuscript, as well as significant re-<lb/>
visions (in the way of removed and recopied leaves). In all, Brontë added 51 leaves<lb/>
to the manuscript. This includes 22 leaves of new material that she incorporated<lb/>
into the manuscript while modifying her fair-copy manuscript—the most notable<lb/>
being a ten-leaf expansion to the chapter “Written in the Schoolroom” in volume<lb/>
3 that I discovered as part of this study.<sup>48</sup> In addition, 29 leaves bear evidence of<lb/>
having been added to the manuscript by Brontë as part of a later stage of extensive<lb/>
revision and recopying.<sup>49</sup> The most significant group among these particular leaves<lb/>
are those that replaced Brontë’s original first chapter, strongly suggesting that<lb/>
she revised and recopied it. This new evidence challenges the long-held scholarly<lb/>
belief that Brontë resolutely refused to modify her first chapter despite pressure<lb/>
from her publisher to alter it.<sup>50</sup> Lastly, I found that Brontë probably removed 32<lb/>
leaves from the manuscript at various stages during which she copied and recop-<lb/>
ied it; many of these changes were part of an early state of the manuscript and its<lb/>
copy text, and they can be identified by studying Brontë’s leaf numberings made<lb/>
in pencil within the manuscript. Some of these removed leaves were replaced with<lb/>
new, expanded material—most of which was copied out on fresh bifolia; in other<lb/>
instances, Brontë appears to have dropped substantial sections of text from the<lb/>
novel. All in all, including the 28 partial-leaf excisions, Brontë made 111 changes<lb/>
either to the leaf size or to the codicological structure of the manuscript, amount-<lb/>
ing to approximately 12% of its combined total of 896 leaves.<sup>51</sup></p>
<p>This new data counters the findings of a 2013 article published in <hi>Brontë Studies</hi> that claims that Brontë’s activities while revising <hi>Shirley</hi> were chiefly aimed<lb/>
at removing text from her manuscript. In her article, Ileana Marin interprets</p>
<div type="footnotes">
<note place="bottom" n="48">Only eight of these 22 new leaves were identified by the Clarendon editors as definitively being part of any expansion to the manuscript—their focus being on the “late insertion of the ‘Femme Savante’ essay in chapter 27” (xxv; also see p. xxvii). The expansion to “Written in the Schoolroom” has not, to date, been documented (so far as I can tell) by any editor or scholar.</note>
<note place="bottom" n="49">The Clarendon editors missed the majority of these, although they speculated in two instances that leaves could have been introduced owing to “rewritten or expanded material.” In their introduction, the editors note a repetition in the numbering of ff. 299 and 300 in volume 2 “possibly because new material had been added” (xxv). The Clarendon edition does not track penciled numbering (or lack of) or red numbering, but later notes some additional differences in numbering: “Leaf 43, which contains less text than usual, may be rewritten. Leaves 42 and 43 were originally numbered 324 and 325; no original number is visible on f. 44; ff. 45 and 46 were also numbered 324 and 325: perhaps the error was caused by an insertion of rewritten or expanded material” (see p. 269). In this case, one of these leaves appears to be recopied material (or text of approximately the same length as what was cut), while three new leaves of material were added, increasing the overall numbering of leaves in volume 2. See table 2 below.</note>

The BM/BL leaf count of 896 leaves includes f. 22 from volume 1—a leaf that they added to the manuscript to replace a leaf that was almost certainly removed by Brontë as part of the revision of chapter 1.</note>

<p>Brontë’s excisions as a deliberate attempt to conceal and “censor” its content<lb/>
from her publishers: “Charlotte came up with a system of revision that allowed<lb/>
her to conceal from her publishers the revision process and bolster her identity<lb/>
as a professional writer. . . . The pressure of conceiving female characters that<lb/>
did not seem to be the schematic creations of a female author meant to Charlotte<lb/>
that she would need to excise passages which might have betrayed personal de-<lb/>
tails about the author.”52 The result, according to Marin, is “a more fragmented<lb/>
narrative.”53 She identifies these excisions as the “symptoms of a writing disorder<lb/>
or disease,” which she calls the <hi>‘Jane Eyre’ complex</hi>:<lb/>
</p>
<q>The Jane Eyre complex describes the author’s contradictory desire to reveal and<lb/>
conceal personal, even intimate or offensive, occurrences in her own life. . . . She under-<lb/>
stood that the interpretation of her first readers (Smith and Williams) was decisive for<lb/>
the publication of her work and thus used the process of revision to withdraw or, more<lb/>
accurately, to censor what seemed to her excessive, exaggerated, or too explicit references<lb/>
to her personal life, even willing to jeopardize the novel’s narrative coherence by<lb/>
doing so.54</q><lb/>
<p>It is unusual to claim that any author who was deliberately preparing a novel<lb/>
for publication would feel the need to censor her own fair copy after writing it<lb/>
out, and Marin does not provide any parallel instances for the purposes of com-<lb/>
parison. Instead, she pursues an interpretation that centers on the anxiety of the<lb/>
woman author, and turns to fiction for her answers. Material and mind mimic<lb/>
one another: the novel’s apparent fragmentation lacks coherence and serves as<lb/>
a mirror of Brontë’s own psychological “disorder.” The partial-leaf excisions are<lb/>
evidence of a form of self-censorship and psychological withdrawal. Life, in this<lb/>
instance, imitates art; the process of revising the manuscript reenacts conflicts<lb/>
apparent in the narratives of Brontë’s own novels.</p>
<p>This interpretation is problematic for a number of reasons. First, the claim<lb/>
pursues a reading of the manuscript that subjects Brontë herself to the kind of<lb/>
“suspicious” and gendering gaze that, according to Marin, Brontë sought to<lb/>
avoid. In doing so, Marin’s analysis reinscribes the flawed, essentialist notion of<lb/>
the woman writer as a neurotic (the infamous “madwoman in the attic” analogy<lb/>
that feminists both invoked and, in some cases, later fought to dispel55) without</p>

Gilbert and Susan Gubar, <hi>The Madwoman in the Attic: The Woman Writer and the Nineteenth-Century Literary Imagination</hi> (New Haven; London: Yale University Press, 1984), xi, xii, 69.

<p>the manuscript of Shirley has been bound and rebound, its paper stocks can offer<lb/>
substantial information about its production and Brontë’s own writing practice.<lb/>
Charlotte Brontë used four different varieties of high-grade stationery to<lb/>
copy out her manuscript. As described in more detail below, the writing paper<lb/>
she used was sold in quires or partial quires of nested bifolia. Each bifolium<lb/>
consisted of two leaves or four pages. Although the leaves in the manuscript<lb/>
are not uniform in height, at 18.3 cm wide they are now all uniform in width,<lb/>
suggesting that the manuscript was trimmed for the purposes of binding. These<lb/>
bifolia would have measured 38 cm wide or thereabouts when opened, but the<lb/>
size would have slightly varied among manufacturers. The four paper stocks<lb/>
included in the manuscript are:<lb/>
(1) London Superfine, a high-quality wove paper measuring 23.2 cm tall, with a<lb/>
blind-embossed stationer’s crest often appearing, when visible, in the upper<lb/>
left-hand corners of the rectos of both leaves of the bifolium (though often<lb/>
much fainter, if present, on the second leaf ) and containing the (embossed)<lb/>
lettering “LONDON | SUPERFINE” inside a circle; the crest features an<lb/>
embossed crown in its center;<lb/>
(2) Cream Laid, another high-quality paper of approximately the same height<lb/>
as London Superfine, and exhibiting chain lines and wirelines that appear<lb/>
to be real, as opposed to being made with a dandy roll; here, when visible,<lb/>
the embossed stationer’s crest features the words “CREAM | LAID” within<lb/>
an oblong octagon, positioned as described above;<lb/>
(3) Royal Superfine, a smooth-surface (possibly glazed) laid paper that is notice­ably shorter, measuring 22.65 cm; when visible, the stationer’s crest contains<lb/>
the words “ROYAL | SUPERFINE”, again inside a circle, featuring an<lb/>
embossed crown in its center, positioned as described above; and<lb/>
(4) A laid paper, likely made by the Whatman firm, with a crown, shield, and<lb/>
posthorn with a pendant cursive “W” watermark; its watermark is posi­tioned as when appearing in a quarto format (i.e., across the fold and run­ning parallel to the top and bottom edges of the bifolium);59 a very small,<lb/>
round watermark crest frequently appears in the position where stationers’<lb/>
crests usually are embossed (i.e., the upper left-hand corner of the recto of<lb/>
the closed bifolium— or the crown side of the sheet), though not on second<lb/>
leaf of the bifolium (i.e., the “W” side); this paper measures 22.6 cm in<lb/>
height.<lb/>
The average dimension of a leaf from the manuscript in its present state is about<lb/>
18 cm wide by 23 cm tall— or about 7 by 9 inches. Using a dip pen, Brontë<lb/>
copied out her novels onto the rectos of these leaves when creating her fair copy<lb/>
manuscripts.<lb/>
Prior to making her fair copies, Brontë’s drafting process was quite different.<lb/>
She tended to use both sides of the leaf while initially composing her writing—<lb/>
sometimes drafting her manuscripts on smaller (and likely less expensive) pa­pers and writing in pencil, as we can see in the portions of the manuscript for<lb/>

<p>“<hi>Emma</hi>.60 When she did use larger, fine writing papers for drafting her work,<lb/>
she either folded the pre-made bifolia in half, creating smaller units, in which<lb/>
she wrote on both sides of the leaf, or else she carefully tore them in half, again<lb/>
using both sides of the paper for drafting her work.61 These pencil drafts were<lb/>
able to fit easily within her portable writing desk, which has been preserved by<lb/>
the Brontë Parsonage Museum.62<lb/>
All the extant fair copies of Charlotte Brontë’s major novels were written<lb/>
on high-quality writing paper typically described by mid-nineteenth-century<lb/>
stationers as “quarto-size” or “post.”63 Local stationers, such as John Greenwood<lb/>
of Haworth, would have sold paper in quires from reams or half-reams.<lb/>
Indeed, Greenwood told Charlotte Brontë’s first biographer, Elizabeth Gaskell,<lb/>
that he walked ten miles to Halifax on many occasions to buy half-reams of<lb/>
paper to try and ensure that he had a ready supply of paper for the Brontë<lb/>
sisters: “When I was out of stock, I was always afraid of their coming; they<lb/>
seemed so distressed about it, if I had none.”64 Only some of these letter papers<lb/>
bear watermarks; as described earlier, nearly all are marked by stationers’</p>

As I learned when examining the contents of the Brontës’ writing desks at the<lb/>
Brontë Parsonage Museum in Haworth, the writing papers they used were sold<lb/>
in partial quires of nested bifolia measuring about 19 cm wide by 23 inches tall<lb/>
when closed (about 7.5 inches wide by 9 inches tall).66 Although typically sold<lb/>
retail in this convenient folded form, the writing papers that Charlotte Brontë<lb/>
used were pre-cut, originating from larger, full-formed sheets.<lb/>
Contemporary trade sources indicate that 24 sheets of writing paper made<lb/>
up a complete quire, as marketed for sale; and 20 quires made up a ream. For<lb/>
context, a full-formed sheet of “large post” writing paper is advertised as mea-<lb/>
suring about 40 by 52 cm (or 16 by 20.5 inches) alongside <hi>quarto</hi>-sized letter<lb/>
paper measuring only 20.32 cm wide by 26.67 cm tall (or 8 inches wide by 10.5<lb/>
inches tall).67 Large sheets of writing paper were advertised for sale to stationers<lb/>
and others by the quire, “packet” (i.e., partial ream consisting of five quires),<lb/>
and ream.68 Although, as another contemporary source notes, “the post papers<lb/>
[were] seldom sold retail in the . . . original size . . . being usually cut in half,<lb/>
folded, and ploughed round the edges, forming, in that state, quarto post, the<lb/>
</p>
<p>65. Studying the septernion from Emily Brontë’s desk, it became clear to me that the mark<lb/>
was embossed only after the bifolia were nested together: the recto of the first leaf bears a strong<lb/>
impression, with each following leaf bearing fainter and fainter successive impressions. This<lb/>
kind of evidence could prove very useful in establishing a sub-order within the drafting process<lb/>
itself. The other paper stock I located in Emily Brontë’s desk, London Superfine, matched a<lb/>
paper used in the manuscript of <hi>Shirley</hi>. Very little has been written on the subject of stationers’<lb/>
crests. For an introductory overview of the use of stationers’ crests, see Joe Nickell, “Stationers’<lb/>
Crests: A Catalog of More than 200 Embossed Paper Marks, 1835–1901,” <hi>Manuscripts</hi> 45, no.<lb/>
3 (1993): 199–216.<lb/>
</p>
<p>66. When examining the contents of Emily Brontë’s desk at the Brontë Parsonage Mu-<lb/>
seum (Bon1 [v]), I found two entirely unused samples of the same paper stocks that Charlotte<lb/>
Brontë had used for copying out her novels. One stock was the same paper I had seen in<lb/>
<hi>Villette</hi>: a laid paper with an embossed crest featuring flowers. It survived in the form of an unused<lb/>
partial quire: seven bifolia nested one inside another with a bright yellow string lying in the<lb/>
center fold. The other paper stock I located in Emily Brontë’s desk, London Superfine, matched<lb/>
a paper used in the manuscript of <hi>Shirley</hi>. It was stored as a sheaf of 10 bifolia. Open, these<lb/>
bifolia measured 38 cm wide by 23 cm tall; closed, the width measured 19 cm. Juliet Barker’s<lb/>
inventory of Charlotte Brontë’s desk contains mention of two single “sheets” (presumably<lb/>
bifolia made from folded half-sheets) of unused writing paper, also of London Superfine and<lb/>
the flowered stock, folded so as to result in four leaves each—the smaller quarto format that<lb/>
Brontë used for drafting works.<lb/>

Stationers could also purchase pre-folded quarto-sized writing paper in 20-quire reams.<lb/>
Because a single gathering of 24 folded sheets would not lie flat, stationers would often break the 24-sheet quires into smaller units, for instance, into two separate groupings of 12 sheets apiece, or 24 leaves each.<lb/>
Thus, a complete 24-sheet quire could contain two sub-quires.<lb/>
</p>
<p>The dimensions of the unused bifolia of London Superfine in the Brontës’ writing desks measure 38 cm wide by 23 cm tall when fully open, or approximately 15 by 9 inches, resulting in a ratio of 1.65—a measurement that does not conform to the standard sizes of full sheets of writing paper sold at the time, whose ratios range from 1.23 to 1.29.<sup>70</sup><lb/>
These measurements indicate that these bifolia were indeed originally created from half-sheets, which, when folded, would have constituted quartos when compared to the original full-formed sheet—a fact confirmed by examining the <hi>Cream Laid</hi> paper that Brontë used in the manuscript of <hi>Shirley</hi>.<lb/>
Its wirelines run vertically (quarto-wise) instead of horizontally, as with a true folio, and the chain lines run from the gutters to fore-edges of the leaves.<lb/>
</p>
<p>Volume 3 of the manuscript contains one such 24-leaf quire of 12 folded, nested bifolia, where the exact position of the quire’s watermarks indicate that the leaves are conjugate.<sup>71</sup><lb/>
Measurements of each of these partially visible watermarks suggest that the entire watermark (i.e., as it would appear on a half-sheet) would have measured about 16.2 cm.<lb/>
A study of the measurements in this particular gathering contains notable outliers in the cut of the sheets that clearly show the conjugacy of BM f. 3 and f. 22, of BM f. 7 and f. 18, of BM f. 8 and f. 17, of BM f. 10 and f. 15, and of BM f. 11 and f. 14 (see table <hi rend="bold">1</hi>).<lb/>
</p>
<p>Other partial-quire combinations were possible.<lb/>
Printers working from manuscript copy referred to these smaller units of nested bifolia as ternions, quaternions, quinternions, &amp;c.<sup>72</sup><lb/>
Although these units could have resulted from further division and use by writers themselves, <hi>Emily Brontë’s</hi> writing desk contains an intact, unused septernion, or partial quire of seven bifolia, as well as an unused partial quire of 10 nested bifolia—suggesting that larger gatherings were also commonly made up and used.<sup>73</sup><lb/>

      <p>Because Brontë’s fair-copy manuscript of <hi>Shirley</hi> has been bound, disbound, and rebound again, it is unclear exactly how all of these bifolia were arranged.<lb/>
      The evidence suggests though that Brontë did not unnest the quires and copy out her novel on loose two-leaf bifolia arranged sequentially, one after the other, but rather that she wrote the manuscript within groupings such as the partial quire of 12 bifolia described earlier, as well as in smaller subquires, ranging from quinternions, sexternions, and septernions to larger subquires of 10 and 11 bifolia.<lb/>
      The manuscript seems to reflect the kind of relative diminishment of the impressions of the embossed stationers’ crest within each subquire, as observed in the septernion found in Emily Brontë’s desk.<sup>74</sup><lb/>
      Tellingly, the first chapter of volume 1 of <hi>Shirley</hi> is written on 21 leaves, and the stationers’ crest is clearly visible on the first leaf, and only faintly visible of leaves two through four—and not visible at all until an odd leaf is introduced (BM f. 21) that was recycled from prior use as a title-page.<lb/>
      Had Brontë separated out the bifolia and/or cut them into single leaves before using them, this relative diminishment of the blind-stamped stationers’ crests from leaf to leaf would not occur in any sort of regular order; it would be random.</p>

<p>as “<hi>Henry Hastings</hi>” at Harvard, are written in nested partial quires.<lb/>Keeping this information in mind, it seems significant that almost all of the longer revisions or expansions to <hi>Shirley</hi> that required additional paper were copied out in even numbers of leaves, suggesting the insertion of nested bifolia—the largest being the revision to the first chapter, which was likely copied out onto a new quire consisting of 20 leaves, or ten folded half-sheets.<lb/>Although the leaves are no longer conjugate (i.e., joined over the folds) and the structure cannot be ascertained, other manuscripts made by Brontë contain partial quires close in size.<lb/>Notably, the chapters as they were first copied out in the manuscript vary in length: one chapter is as brief as 13 leaves, while another is as long as 39-and-a-half leaves.</p>
<p>According to Gaskell, Brontë educated herself about how to prepare a manuscript for publication by obtaining a manual on the subject.<lb/>Studying this guide, Brontë would have learned about matters ranging from the kinds of paper and handwriting typically preferred by publishers to strategies for gauging the length and sale potential of a work.<lb/>It is apparent that, in preparing her fair-copy manuscript for submission to a publisher, Brontë followed the general practices of the day.<lb/>According to Saunders and Otley’s <hi>Advice to Authors</hi>, a resource that Brontë likely consulted, it was “much better . . . to write on separate sheets of paper, taking care to number the sheets, or folios” than to write in “pretty copy-books,” as was “the fashion much cherished by ladies.”<lb/>Copybooks, the manual notes, “must be torn to pieces before they are put upon the compositors’ cases.”</p>
<p>One of the writing papers that Brontë used while copying out <hi>Shirley</hi> bears an embossed stationer’s mark reading “London Superfine,” a substrate that was noted for being a high-grade paper made entirely from linen rags.<lb/>London Superfine was not inexpensive.<lb/>Typically sold in reams of 480 “sheets” (i.e., half-sheets), superfine writing papers like those Brontë used could have cost anywhere from six to eighteen shillings per ream—a sizable sum for a woman with limited means.<lb/>In 1841, Charlotte Brontë had earned a meager salary of just £20 a</p>

<p>year, or about seven-and-a-half shillings a week, while working as a governess<lb/>
at Upperwood House in Rawdon, West Yorkshire; her small income was further<lb/>
reduced by a deduction of about £4 per annum for laundry. Her younger sister,<lb/>
Anne, was paid £40 a year (or £10 per quarter) for her work as a governess at<lb/>
Thorpe Green Hall—about 15 shillings per week.<sup>81</sup> That was considered to be<lb/>
a very favorable salary— one near the upper end of the range for what a governess<lb/>
could earn at that time. And so one ream of high-grade “post”— or the approximate<lb/>
amount of paper that Brontë required for copying out <hi>Shirley</hi>— could<lb/>
have easily cost a woman employed as a governess an entire week of her salary,<lb/>
if not more. Although Brontë’s earning potential had significantly increased as of<lb/>
1847 with the sale of <hi>Jane Eyre</hi>, the cost of paper was still not inconsequential.<sup>82</sup><lb/>
In <hi>Advice to Authors</hi>, Brontë would have read that it was “common practice . . .<lb/>
to write only on one side of the leaf, and to leave the opposite, or under page,<lb/>
blank.”<sup>83</sup> This is generally the practice she followed. But instead of ruling her<lb/>
own paper or purchasing pre-ruled paper (as is suggested by <hi>Advice to Authors</hi>),<lb/>
Brontë likely used a separate, heavily ruled leaf of paper, such as the one kept in<lb/>
her writing desk, to slip under the surface of her letter paper.<sup>84</sup> When I placed<lb/>
the extant ruled leaf from Brontë’s desk under a leaf of London Superfine paper<lb/>
stock, its dark lines showed through the writing paper, which suggests that the<lb/>
leaf could have readily served as a guide for the copying of her manuscripts. The<lb/>
use of a ruled leaf would have allowed Brontë to regulate the number of lines per<lb/>
page and thus systematize the pace and flow of her novels.<sup>85</sup><lb/>
If this were the case, the ruled leaf that Brontë used would have provided<lb/>
a margin of at least 2 cm on the left-hand side of each bifolium onto which she<lb/>
wrote out the fair copies of her manuscripts—an inference supported by the<lb/>
fairly uniform registration of the leaves in the manuscript of <hi>Shirley</hi>. Part of this<lb/>
left-hand margin could have been removed at the printing house if the bifolia<lb/>
were sliced instead of slit; the remaining margin was likely trimmed yet again as<lb/>
part of the later binding process commissioned by George Smith. Brontë copied<lb/>
out her novel nearly flush with the right-hand margin of the leaves; occasionally</p>

<note place="foot" n="84">Ruled leaves were ephemeral, and created on an ad hoc basis. The extant ruled leaf that I studied at the Brontë Parsonage Museum in 2019 is made of wove paper. It measures 19.25 cm wide (across the leaf); 23 cm long (top to bottom). The leaf was ruled in pencil first, then in ink. It was made of a thicker weight paper than the other writing papers I found in her desk. This example has a 1.1 cm margin on the left side of the template. The lines were ruled approximately 1 cm apart from one another, with 21 lines ruled on the leaf, allowing for 22 spaces for text. I identified two small holes punctured into the sheet above and below line 6 from the bottom of the device.</note><lb/>
<note place="foot" n="85">Brontë came to adopt the use of a ruled leaf later in her process as a writer.

(In 2012, I detected the use of a ruled surface in the fair-copy manuscript of <hi>Jane Eyre</hi>, before locating an example of a ruled leaf, which I was able to do in 2019, during my research into the extant contents of the Brontës’ writing desks.)</note>

      <p>her writing touches their very edges, but without any loss to the text.<lb/>
She usually left just a centimeter of space—the same space she interposed between the lines<lb/>
of her text—at the top and bottom of each page, except at the ends and begin-<lb/>
nings of some chapters.</p>
      <p>The layout of the manuscript text, with its substantial left-hand margin—<lb/>
which she did not use when making corrections—suggests that the leaves could<lb/>
have been loosely sewn or otherwise temporarily bound. Whether or not Brontë<lb/>
did this is unclear; I have noted the presence of needle marks and holes in the<lb/>
left margins of the leaves, but those holes appear in the first and third volumes<lb/>
of the manuscript, and could have resulted from its nineteenth-century binding,<lb/>
before the leaves were individually mounted and rebound by the British Library.<lb/>
At the same time, any leaves bearing partial excisions would have been extremely<lb/>
frail and liable to tearing before they were repaired as part of the binding pro-<lb/>
cess; for this reason, it is quite possible that Brontë lightly bound her volumes<lb/>
in some fashion.</p>
      <head>4. Correlation of Paper Stocks and Variant Leaf Numbering</head>
      <p>As Brontë copied out her novel in ink onto high-grade writing paper from her<lb/>
smaller-sized penciled drafts, she first numbered the leaves of the fair copy in<lb/>
pencil before inking over the numbers at a later state of the manuscript’s prepa-<lb/>
ration.86 This underlying numbering in pencil, previously unnoted by scholars<lb/>
as far as I can tell, may have correlated to how she initially paginated her pen-<lb/>
cil drafts, which no longer survive.87 By the same token, the absence of these</p>
      <note place="foot" n="86">Brontë tended to foliate instead of paginate her fair-copy MSS. I used the term<lb/>
“numbering” to avoid any confusion with respect to this process, as well as to distinguish her<lb/>
numbering process from the BM’s own foliation of the manuscript. Brontë did paginate the<lb/>
verso of one leaf where she added writing intended for publication: BM f. 267 in volume 3,<lb/>
Add MS 43479, which she numbered as 834 and 835 in the C state of her numbering system<lb/>
(outlined in more detail below). Notably, the BM only foliated the leaf on its recto. The only<lb/>
other instance in which Brontë added content to a verso intended for publication in Shirley can<lb/>
be found on BM f. 236 in volume 2, Add MS 43478. This addendum, which was marked by an<lb/>
asterisk, makes a sarcastic reference to how Currer Bell was “charmed to meet with a complete<lb/>
exposition” on governesses in the January 1849 issue of The Quarterly—a not-so-veiled riposte<lb/>
to Elizabeth Rigby’s severe critique of Jane Eyre in the December 1848 issue of The Quarterly.<lb/>
This wording was intended to replace a portion of canceled text on BM f. 237, vol. 2; in the<lb/>
end, Brontë decided to cancel both, likely in light of her publisher’s express wish to exclude the<lb/>
defensive preface in response to The Quarterly from the published book.</note>
      <note place="foot" n="87">Because no working drafts for Shirley survive, this interpretation must remain specu-<lb/>
lative. Yet extant working drafts for other writings shed some light on her process. Although<lb/>
Brontë used smaller-sized paper and formats to draft her novels, she foliated just the rectos,<lb/>
not the versos, of her late pencil drafts; because both sides of the leaves bore writing, it seems<lb/>
that one recto and verso combined essentially worked out to the same approximate length of<lb/>
writing appearing on the recto of the larger-sized writing paper. We see this system at work with<lb/>
Brontë’s last draft for a novel, “Emma” (RTC01 no. 196 in the Robert H. Taylor Collection of<lb/>
Princeton University): the leaves measure 11.5 cm wide by 17.8 cm tall—approximately half<lb/>
the size of the full letter papers that Brontë used for making her fair copies—and she foliated<lb/>
her writing by the leaf, not by the page.</note>

  </text>
</TEI>
<pb n="295"/>
<p>numbers can also prove meaningful, as Brontë generally did not pencil in her numbering in her later rounds of editing when introducing new material into the manuscript; she simply numbered the leaf in ink instead (see table 3).<lb/>
In all, there are five different forms of numbering in the manuscript of <hi>Shirley</hi>. In chronological order, they are as follows:<lb/>
(A) the initial penciled sequence of numbers, possibly corresponding with numbering in Brontë’s penciled drafts;<sup>88</sup><lb/>
(B) numbers that Brontë copied in brown ink over her earlier penciled numbers and that occasionally vary from those underlying penciled numbers—thus reflecting changes she likely made during the initial process of copying out the manuscript;<lb/>
(C) numbering that Brontë made in a now-faded red ink (identified as a “new series of numbers in brown ink” by the Clarendon editors<sup>89</sup>) that was introduced as part of her first significant revision of the manuscript after she had fully copied out volume 3 in July and August of 1849;<lb/>
(D) a brief sequence of numbers made by Brontë in brown ink and pencil (referred to by the Clarendon editors as “three sequences” of “two cancelled numbering sequences” [xxv]) that corrects the red sequence in the middle of the third volume, after Brontë introduced yet another late, but significant, expansion to the novel in September of 1849;<sup>90</sup><lb/>
and<lb/>
(E) the penciled foliation made by British Museum staff a century later in 1949. The librarians took the liberty of striking through all of Charlotte Brontë’s own numbering as they inserted their own penciled foliation on the leaves in accordance with what appears to have been the standard, if reprehensible, practice in the BM at the time. (The foliation is documented by the staff on labels applied to the rear free endpapers in volumes 2 and 3 of the manuscript.<sup>91</sup>)<lb/>
Both the Clarendon editors and Marin generally refer to these later BM numbers when describing the manuscript—the former occasionally referring to the manuscript.
</p>
<pb n="296"/> 
<p>some of Brontë’s own preceding numbering in a few instances (viz., xxv, xxvii, <lb/> 
269)—an approach that failed to recover a great deal of additional information<lb/> 
about the earlier stages of the manuscript’s composition and revision. A full rep-<lb/> 
resentation of the numbers on the last leaf in volume 3, in order of their chrono-<lb/> 
logical written sequence as delineated above, would run as follows: A873.B873.<lb/> 
C891.[D897].E323. That is: A873[CB pencil].B873[CB brown ink].C891[CB<lb/> 
red ink].[D897; the final numbering sequence that was discontinued by CB].<lb/> 
E323[the BM foliation].<note n="92" place="foot">Brontë’s leaf count is one leaf longer than that of the BM as she paginated the verso of BM leaf 267 (CB leaf 835) in volume 3 of the manuscript.</note> In one glance, the sequence provides quite a bit of<lb/> 
data—namely, that the manuscript had increased in size by 24 leaves between<lb/> 
the time it was first copied out in full and then later revised.<note n="93" place="foot">This must be qualified, as Brontë paginated the verso of one leaf: BM f. 267 of volume 3, as indicated in the previous note.</note><lb/> 
</p>
<p>By examining the different states of the manuscript’s leaf (and occasional<lb/> 
page) numbering alongside the manuscript’s paper stocks, one can readily estab-<lb/> 
lish the various stages at which the manuscript was copied out. The great major-<lb/> 
ity of volumes 1 and 2 were copied onto Cream Laid writing paper,<note n="94" place="foot">Approximately 92% (261 leaves) of the paper in volume 1 is Cream Laid, with the remainder consisting of 21 leaves of London Superfine (7%) used for the first chapter of the manuscript, one leaf (BM f. 215) introduced as part of the nineteenth-century rebind, and one leaf of the twentieth-century cream-colored wove paper introduced during the BL rebind. Approximately 92% (265 leaves, or 11 + 23 + 114 + 114 + 3) of volume 2 is made up of Cream Laid, with 4% London Superfine (11 leaves, or 5 + 4 + 2) and 4% Royal Superfine (13 leaves, or 12 + 1). Approximately 12% of volume 3 is made up of laid watermarked paper (38 leaves, or 24 + 14), with 6% Cream Laid (18 leaves), and the rest, or approximately 82%, London Superfine (267 leaves).</note> while the majority of volume 3 was copied onto London Superfine letter paper. I believe<lb/> 
that Brontë’s use of these two principal paper stocks roughly corresponds to the<lb/> 
two main periods when she copied out her manuscript.<lb/> 
</p>
<p>Although it is generally known that Brontë wrote most of <hi>Shirley</hi> during two<lb/> 
different periods, there has been some question within the scholarly community<lb/> 
as to exactly when and why the interruption occurred between her two writing<lb/> 
stints. Examining the manuscript, it is clear that Brontë finished copying out<lb/> 
volume 1 in September 1848, as she adds her completion date (almost exactly<lb/> 
a year before Taylor arrived in Haworth to retrieve the volume) at the end of the<lb/> 
volume.<note n="95" place="foot">Volume 1 was completed in September 1848, as dated by Brontë on the last leaf of volume 1 of the manuscript.</note> Volume 2 is undated, but is largely written on the same laid paper<lb/> 
stock as volume 1. In her correspondence, Brontë indicates that she “laid aside”<lb/> 
the manuscript while she herself was ill following the death of her brother, Bran-<lb/> 
well.<note n="96" place="foot">Brontë writes to W. S. Williams: “My book, alas! is laid aside for the present; both head and hand seem to have lost their cunning; imagination is pale, stagnant, mute. This incapacity chagrins me; sometimes I have a feeling of cankering care on the subject, but I combat it as well as I can; it does no good.” Margaret Smith believes that the letter was written on October 18, 1848, based on the source. Letters, 2:128. This is the same date Clement Shorter attributed to the letter; see p. 458 of <hi rend="italic">The Brontës: Life and Letters</hi> (London: Hodder and Stoughton, 1908).</note> And in a later letter to George Smith, Brontë indicates that “two-thirds of<lb/> 
‘Shirley’” had been written while her sisters still lived and were able to respond to<lb/> 
</p>
<pb n="297"/>
<p>her work.97<lb/>
Brontë’s friend and biographer, the novelist Elizabeth Gaskell, seems<lb/>
to corroborate this history when she writes:<lb/>
She had nearly finished the second volume of her tale when Branwell died,—after<lb/>
him Emily,—after her Anne;—the pen, laid down when there were three sisters living<lb/>
and loving, was taken up when one alone remained. Well might she call the first chapter<lb/>
that she wrote after this, <hi>“The Valley of the Shadow of Death.”</hi>98<lb/>
“The Valley of the Shadow of Death” chapter mentioned by Gaskell is the first<lb/>
of volume 3; thus, according to Gaskell, Brontë resumed writing volume 3 only<lb/>
after the death of her remaining sister. In her edition of Charlotte Brontë’s letters,<lb/>
Margaret Smith disagrees with Gaskell, suggesting that, as late as February 1849,<lb/>
Brontë “writes as if she had completed no more that the first volume rather than<lb/>
the greater part of two, as Mrs. Gaskell alleged.” Smith continues: “the second<lb/>
volume, if she had begun it, was perhaps still in the form of a preliminary pencil-<lb/>
draft— CB’s normal method of composition, according to the <hi>Life</hi>.”99</p>
<p>On the contrary, the evidence found in the manuscript’s differing paper<lb/>
stocks largely corroborates Gaskell’s claim, suggesting that Brontë had copied<lb/>
out the majority of volume 2 by late September 1848. Toward the end of volume<lb/>
2, the run of Cream Laid paper abruptly ends at f. A551.B551.C557.E273 —a<lb/>
leaf that falls in that volume’s final chapter, “An Evening Out.” The remaining<lb/>
16 leaves of volume 2 contain a mixture of paper stocks (Royal Superfine and<lb/>
Cream Laid) that do not correlate with any changes to their numbering—a fact<lb/>
that seems to confirm that Brontë attempted to work on the manuscript inter-<lb/>
mittently. A letter written in September of 1850 also seems to confirm this. In it,<lb/>
Brontë recounted to James Taylor of Smith, Elder how the “great part” of Shirley<lb/>
was “written under the shadow of impending calamity” and the “last volume . . .<lb/>
composed in the eager, restless endeavor to combat mental sufferings that were<lb/>
scarcely tolerable.”100</p>
<p>Sickness had stalked the Brontë household ever since September of 1848 and<lb/>
had still not abated in January of 1849.101 After the death of her brother, Bran-<lb/>
well, on September 24, Charlotte Brontë had increasingly found herself perform-<lb/>
ing a different form of labor from that of writing: the caregiving duties of nursing<lb/>
her own family members. Whether soliciting medical advice for Emily (who ada-<lb/>
mantly refused it until her death in December), or attending to Anne and their</p>

complex, unfolding over many prior months. Branwell’s dependence on alcohol and opium had<lb/>
contributed to the deterioration of his health and had even disguised the symptoms of tuber-<lb/>
culosis. As Juliet Barker notes: “Branwell’s health had worsened so imperceptibly over the last<lb/>
eighteen months that no one had noticed how ill he had become. So often drunk or hung over,<lb/>
it could only be expected that his constitution would be affected. . . . Any sympathy Charlotte<lb/>
felt for her brother had long evaporated; now he simply irritated her.” See <hi>The Brontës</hi> (London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1995), 564–65. Branwell’s father had primarily looked after<lb/>

night (see Letters, 2:93).<lb/>

<pb n="298"/>father, who required medicines, blisters, and other treatments, Charlotte focused<lb/>
on looking after her loved ones.102 In January, she writes to Williams: “My literary<lb/>
character is effaced for the time . . . care of Papa and Anne is necessarily my chief<lb/>
present object in life to the exclusion of all that could give me interest with my<lb/>
Publishers or their connexions.”103 Her choice of the word “effaced” is suggestive<lb/>
here: in her correspondence with her publishers during this period, she sought<lb/>
to separate “Charlotte Brontë” from “Currer Bell,” indicating a pivot from the<lb/>
latter (masculine) identity: “Should Anne get better, I think I could rally and<lb/>
become Currer Bell once more.”104 In February 1849, when Anne showed some<lb/>
signs of recovery, Brontë wrote to her publisher about her attempted endeavor to<lb/>
resume her work on the novel, even as she continued to look after Anne, who had<lb/>
by that time had been diagnosed with tuberculosis. Even at this point, Charlotte<lb/>
seems only to have been able to return to the novel sporadically. In February, she<lb/>
writes: “I wish it were more than a commencement, for how it will be re-united<lb/>
after the long break, or how it can gather force of flow when the current has been<lb/>
checked— or rather drawn off so long—I know not.”105 It was at this point that<lb/>
she was likely completing work on the end of volume 2 in a series of interrupted,<lb/>
brief intervals, as evidenced by the varying stocks of paper, as described earlier.<lb/>
Although Gaskell writes that Brontë did not begin work on volume 3 until<lb/>
after Anne’s death, it seems clear that Brontë did draft and copy out the volume’s<lb/>
first three chapters intermittently during the first half of 1849. Brontë’s mixed use<lb/>
of paper continues within the first 56 leaves of volume 3 —starting with “<hi rend="italic">The Valley of the Shadow of Death</hi>”—which were copied out irregularly on Cream<lb/>
Laid paper, as well as on watermarked laid paper (yet again on leaves without<lb/>
any apparent alterations to their numbering). The abrupt changes in paper stocks<lb/>
may reflect another important fluctuation in Brontë’s life at that time: the er-<lb/>
ratic intervals during which Anne’s health temporarily improved before further<lb/>
declining.106 Brontë likely wrote on whatever high-grade writing paper was at<lb/>
hand as she copied out her work in various spurts. She seems to have regained<lb/>
her momentum only toward the end of copying out these very difficult chapters,<lb/>
whose heroine, narrowly recovering from the brink of death, was loosely mod-<lb/>
102. After Branwell’s death, Charlotte became ill, and, upon recovering in the autumn,<lb/>
she tended to her sisters, as well as her father and their servant, Tabitha Aykroyd, who was<lb/>
“suffering under serious indisposition” in November 1848; see Letters, 2:132. Emily refused<lb/>
professional medical assistance as well as other treatments, such as homeopathy; see Letters,<lb/>
2:142, 145, 146–147, 150, 152. Charlotte sought medical advice and kept a careful eye on her<lb/>
sister, despite Emily’s dogged reluctance to be helped. Charlotte finally convinced Emily to<lb/>
try homeopathic medicine in early December, and she drew up a detailed account of Emily’s<lb/>
malady; but then Emily refused to take the medicine when it was received, and she died shortly<lb/>
afterward. See Letters, 2:154. In late December, Charlotte was caring for her father and Anne,<lb/>
who became ill with influenza; Letters, 2:159, 165. In January, Charlotte was nursing Anne,<lb/>
which included administering and dressing blisters and giving her cod-liver oil (Letters, 2:166)<lb/>
and also ordering a respirator to help with her breathing (Letters, 2:171). Charlotte herself suf-<lb/>
fered from “pains” in her chest and back, which she treated with “pitch plasters and bran tea”;<lb/>

That absorption in my employment to which I gave myself up without<lb/>fear of doing wrong when I wrote <hi>Jane Eyre</hi> would now be alike impossible and<lb/>blamable; but I do what I can—and have made some little progress: we must<lb/>all be patient.”107 Brontë made her moral obligations very clear to her publisher:<lb/>Anne’s well-being came first, then writing. She would not endanger her sister’s<lb/>life for the sake of completing <hi>Shirley</hi>.”</p><p><lb/>After a prolonged and painful illness, Anne finally died on May 28 in Scarborough, where she and Charlotte had both hoped that she would eventually<lb/>recover. And so Charlotte Brontë parted with the last of her six siblings, who all<lb/>perished from the same dreaded disease, the “galloping consumption”—named<lb/>so for the swiftness of its spread and the speed with which it killed its victims.<lb/>Brontë wrote to W. S. Williams of Smith, Elder: “had a prophet warned me how<lb/>I should stand in June 1849 —how stripped and bereaved—had he foretold the<lb/>autumn—the winter, the spring of sickness and suffering to be gone through—I<lb/>should have thought—this can never be endured. It is over. Branwell—Emily—Anne are gone like dreams—gone as Maria and Elizabeth went twenty<lb/>years ago.”108 Brontë sought work—and the labor of writing, in particular—as<lb/>a remedy for the intense pain resulting from their loss. On June 25, she wrote to<lb/>Williams: “Labour must be the cure, not sympathy—Labour is the only radical<lb/>cure for rooted Sorrow— The society of a calm, serenely cheerful companion . . .<lb/>soothes pain like a soft opiate—but I find it does not probe or heal the wound—<lb/>sharper more severe means are necessary to make a remedy. Total change might<lb/>do much—where that cannot be obtained—work is the best substitute.”109 The<lb/>deliberateness of Brontë’s approach contradicts those who have characterized<lb/>her work at this time as “confused,” uncertain, and clouded by grief.110 As described earlier, such assessments have inadvertently depicted Brontë as a hapless<lb/>woman—her broken spirit reflected in the fractured leaves of her manuscript. It<lb/>can be shown, however, that she approached her work during this period with a<lb/>particularly strategic focus.</p><p><lb/>By July, Brontë had gathered her powers, resuming her work in a steady<lb/>stream of London Superfine stock, which runs throughout the rest of volume 3.<lb/>Indeed, codicological evidence seems to confirm that, after completing this volume, Brontë then used this same London Superfine paper stock as needed to go<lb/>back and carefully revise each volume as she steadily worked to polish her novel<lb/>for publication. And so while the manuscript is indeed marked by death—that<lb/>“painful, even raw, reality” described by Rosengarten and Smith—her priorities were clear. The interruptions to the manuscript’s completion resulted from<lb/>her active efforts to save the lives of her sisters. The corresponding gaps in the<lb/>107. Letters, 2:206.<lb/>108. Letters, 2:220.<lb/>109. Letters, 2:224.<lb/>110. Rosengarten and Smith characterize this period as one of “uncertainty” (Clarendon<lb/>edition, xxvi), while Deborah Lutz describes it as “confused” (<hi>The Brontë Cabinet</hi>, 184). I discuss<lb/>some of the reasons and trends unpinning these interpretations in “Reading the Writing Desk,”<lb/>518–19.
<pb n="300"/>
<p>manuscript’s paper stocks reflect her labor as a caregiver, which took precedence<lb/>
over her work as a writer.<lb/>
In fact, the evidence suggests that Charlotte Brontë made most of the exci­<lb/>
sions and revisions largely after the passing of Branwell, Emily, and Anne, not<lb/>
concurrent with them. When interpreted in this light, the excisions are not proof<lb/>
of Charlotte Brontë’s bewilderment or perplexed indecision, but rather evidence<lb/>
of her efforts to unify the novel, drawing it together after the “long break” she<lb/>
speaks of with respect to her writing process and that is evident in the very struc­<lb/>
ture of the manuscript itself.<sup>111</sup> She took care to revisit the novel as a whole—to<lb/>
suture gaps in plot, in particular—through a carefully thought-out process of<lb/>
revision and expansion.</p>
<head>5. Excisions as Expansions</head><lb/>
<p>As Brontë copied out new leaves during this late stage of revision, she inserted<lb/>
sections of London Superfine wove paper within the laid leaves of volume 1<lb/>
and volume 2 (see table 2), and thus inadvertently left evidence of her editorial<lb/>
interventions. These insertions constitute the entirety of chapter one of volume<lb/>
1: “Levitical” (BM ff. 1–21); a five-leaf section (BM ff. 12–16) in chapter one of<lb/>
volume 2: “Shirley and Caroline”; a four-leaf section (BM ff. 40–43) in chapter<lb/>
two of volume 2: “Further Communications on Business”; and a two-leaf section<lb/>
(BM ff. 158–159) in chapter seven of volume 2: “Which the Genteel Reader is<lb/>
Recommended to Skip, Low Persons Being Here Introduced.” All the wove pa­<lb/>
per sections in volume 2 were clearly later additions to the manuscript, as each<lb/>
wove section also exhibits variants in the numbering Brontë assigned them. The<lb/>
latter two sections are flanked by partial-leaf excisions—the removal of prior<lb/>
writing that was cut out of the manuscript’s leaves in order to accommodate a<lb/>
combination of new and rewritten material presented in the inserted wove leaves.<lb/>
Note that in each instance but one,<sup>112</sup> the wove insertions lack any draft numbers<lb/>
in pencil, which also suggests that these leaves were not part of the manuscript<lb/>
in its initial state.</p>
<p>The following example from volume 2 helps to illustrate the practical util­<lb/>
ity of correlating differences in numbering with the manuscript’s various paper<lb/>
stocks. In the chapter “Shirley and Caroline,” a partial-leaf excision of about<lb/>
five lines on f. A294.B294.E10 (see figure 1) precedes an extensive revision cop­<lb/>
ied out on five full leaves of London Superfine wove paper (see table 2). In this<lb/>
chapter, Brontë removed three leaves from the manuscript, as is evident in the gap in<lb/>
penciled numbering between leaves f. A294.B294.E10 and f. A299.B299.C301.E17. She then<lb/>
replaced those leaves with (presumably) revised writing on three leaves of wove<lb/>
paper, and she also expanded the section by adding two leaves—a<lb/>
change apparent in the duplication of the brown-inked numbering sequence in</p>
<note n="111" place="footnote">Letters, 2:181.</note><lb/>
<note n="112" place="footnote">A penciled “11”—possibly “211”—appears preceding the “299” (BM f. 15, vol. 2). An ink blot mars the upper right-hand corner of the leaf. It is possible that this was a draft leaf for the revised version of chapter one and was damaged and later reused here. This leaf is part of a five-leaf insertion—suggesting that one loose leaf was likely inserted along with two bifolia.</note>

<p>this section: [A11?].B299.E15 (inserted London Superfine wove paper),<lb/>
[A lacking].B300.E16 (inserted London Superfine wove paper),<lb/>
A299.B299.C301.E17 (existing Cream Laid paper),<lb/>
A300.B300.C302.E18 (existing Cream Laid paper).<lb/>
These two overlapping brown-ink sequences represent two different states of<lb/>
the MS: the numbering on the Cream Laid leaves is the earlier sequence that<lb/>
replicates the original pencil numbering, whereas the brown-ink numbering on<lb/>
the London Superfine wove leaves is likely concurrent with state C (the “red-ink<lb/>
state”) of the manuscript’s numbering. In fact, the red-ink numbers are first in-<lb/>
troduced in the manuscript directly following this insertion. The new numbering<lb/>
on the wove insertions did not need to be made in red ink, as the insertion was<lb/>
the first of its kind in the volume, and Brontë used red ink only to disambiguate<lb/>
her B sequence from her newly edited C sequence.113<lb/>
The text that was extracted from the manuscript here pertained to a conver-<lb/>
sation between the novel’s two heroines, Caroline Helstone and <hi>Shirley</hi> Keeldar, who are talking about men—particularly, the “society of clever<lb/>
men”—at the point leading up to the removal of the leaves. In the lengthy<lb/>
insertion, Caroline and Shirley pursue this engaging topic, delving into a<lb/>
discussion about the capacity for men to continue to feel affection for the<lb/>
women who live with them day after day. The young women consider both the<lb/>
character and characteristics of Caroline’s uncle, Mr. Helstone, who, according<lb/>
to Caroline, “speaks of marriage as a burden.”114 As Caroline contemplates the<lb/>
wisdom of remaining unmarried, Shirley describes her own method for<lb/>
detecting a man with a kind heart: “we watch him, and see him kind to<lb/>
animals, to little children, to poor people.”115 Shirley, we learn, trusts to the<lb/>
opinion of “the little Irish beggar that comes barefoot to my door; the mouse<lb/>
that steals out of the cranny of the wainscot . . . the dog that licks my hand<lb/>
and sits beside my knee.”116 When Shirley questions Caroline as to whether<lb/>
she recognizes anyone who meets such a description, Caroline recalls<lb/>
Robert Moore (with whom she has already fallen in love).<lb/>
These inserted leaves may serve an even greater purpose in the novel,<lb/>
however. The passage helps advance the novel’s marriage plot doubly, as it<lb/>
foreshadows Shirley’s own love for Robert’s brother, Louis. Within this<lb/>
newly added portion in volume 2, Caroline observes that “the old dog<lb/>
always comes out of his kennel and wags his tail, and whines<lb/>
affectionally”117 when Robert Moore is near; this conversation not only<lb/>
serves the practical purpose of discreetly communicating Caroline’s own<lb/>
affection for Robert to Shirley, but it also prepares Brontë’s readers to<lb/>
recognize a similar pattern in volume 3 when Shirley’s own dog,<lb/>
Tartar, shows “a single partiality” for Robert’s brother, Louis: “Tartar<lb/>
looked, slavered, and sighed . . . and coolly settled himself on his haunches<lb/>
at Louis Moore’s side. That gentleman drew the dog’s big, black-muzzled<lb/>
head on to his knee, patted him, and smiled one little smile to himself.”118<lb/>

<p>affection convey to the careful observer that Louis is probably not only beloved<lb/>
by Tartar, but also by Shirley. While it is impossible to know whether the prior<lb/>
text extracted from volume 2 of the manuscript contained a similar description,<lb/>
the parallels between the two volumes seem meaningful, and it is possible that<lb/>
this detail was added in as a late revision to strengthen the tie.</p>
<pb n="304"/>
<p>Along the same lines, the inserted leaves in volume 2 also lay the groundwork<lb/>
for Shirley’s eventual decision to subordinate herself to her chosen husband in<lb/>
volume 3. In the late addition to volume 2, Shirley proclaims on [A11?].B299.E15:<lb/>
“Indisputably, a great, good, handsome man is the first of created things. . . .<lb/>
“I would scorn to contend for empire with him,—I would scorn it. Shall my left hand<lb/>
dispute for precedence with my right?—shall my heart quarrel with my pulse?—shall my<lb/>
veins be jealous of the blood which fills them?”119<lb/>
In volume 3 —and in yet another late insertion consisting of a leaf of London Superfine wove paper: [A lacking].[B lacking].C878.E310 —the narrator describes<lb/>
Shirley’s “lost privilege of liberty” leading up to her marriage:<lb/>
Louis was himself obliged to direct all arrangements: he was virtually master of Field-<lb/>
head, weeks before he became so nominally: the least presumptuous, the kindest master<lb/>
that ever was; but with his lady absolute. She abdicated without a word or a struggle. . . .<lb/>
In all this, Miss Keeldar partly yielded to her disposition; but a remark she made a<lb/>
year afterwards proved that she partly also acted on system. “Louis,” she said, “would<lb/>
never have learned to rule, if she had not ceased to govern: the incapacity of the sovereign<lb/>
had developed the powers of the premier.”120<lb/>
The late insertion in volume 2 helps explain why Shirley, who is usually so very<lb/>
independent, eventually chooses to submit herself to the authority of this man<lb/>
toward the end of volume 3 —a development in the plot that could, in other<lb/>
circumstances, seem out of character.<lb/>
Other instances of excision and expansion offer clear evidence of even more<lb/>
strategic revisions to the novel and its plot across its several volumes. Major revisions<lb/>
to the chapter <hi>Further Communications on Business</hi> entailed two partial-leaf excisions (ff. A321.B321.C323.E39 and [A323].[B323].C328.E44), the<lb/>
removal of one full leaf (what had been f. A322.B322), and the insertion of four<lb/>
wove leaves (see table 2), likely bearing approximately three pages’ worth of new material—an alteration evident again not just in the changes to the paper stock,<lb/>
but also in differences in leaf numbering. Note that the partially excised leaf<lb/>
preceding the wove insertion is numbered A321.B321.C323.E39 —reflecting a<lb/>
difference of just two leaves apparent between its brown- and red-ink sequences—<lb/>
and the leaf following the section of wove leaves bears the sequence A324.B324.<lb/>
C329.E45. The latter numbering demarcates a difference of five leaves owing<lb/>
to the new three-leaf expansion. This revision seems to have been made at an<lb/>
intermediate stage between the brown-ink and the later red-ink sequences, as<lb/>
both brown-ink and red-ink numbering are present on the wove leaves. Were<lb/>
this section entirely concurrent with the red-ink sequence, why would brown-ink numbering have been necessary at all? In addition, this wove section is corrected<lb/>
in red ink, suggesting that the red-ink numbering was introduced only as part of<lb/>
a later round of revision. The equivalent of one full wove leaf may have entailed<lb/>
some recopying of material that was revised as part of the excisions made to<lb/>
the adjacent leaves ff. A321.B321.C323.E39 and [A323].[B323].C328.E44 (see<lb/>

<p><pb n="306"/>The writing on the newly inserted wove leaves in this chapter pertains to<lb/>
Shirley’s conversation with Robert Moore, and the addition largely has to do<lb/>
with Michael Hartley, who, as Shirley describes him, is a <hi>mad Calvinist and Jacobin weaver</hi>—a man <hi>addicted to poaching, and often goes abroad at night with his gun</hi>.<sup>122</sup> Here we learn that Moore has had an argument with Hartley.<lb/>
Examining this addition with respect to the novel’s larger narrative structure, it<lb/>
becomes clear that Brontë introduced this new material pertaining to this subplot only after writing and copying out volume 3, so as to foreshadow the action<lb/>
to come. At the end of the third volume, and at the conclusion of the chapter<lb/>
<hi>Rushedge, A Confessional</hi>, Robert Moore is shot; and we finally learn in the<lb/>
novel’s final chapter, <hi>The Winding-up</hi>, that it was Hartley who fired the shot:<lb/>
<hi>Mr. Moore knew who had shot him, and all Briarfield knew: it was no other than Michael Hartley, the half-crazed weaver once before alluded to.</hi><sup>123</sup> The fact<lb/>
that the narrator specifically makes mention of this single prior allusion—and the<lb/>
evidence of this particular insertion—offers a telling example of how Brontë’s<lb/>
composition and fair-copy process unfolded. It seems that Brontë went back and<lb/>
added this extended discussion about Hartley in volume 2 to set the stage for this<lb/>
crucial moment.<sup>124</sup> Yet, it is also important to note that there are not one, but two<lb/>
prior mentions of Michael Hartley in the novel. Indeed, the first instance occurs<lb/>
in the first chapter of the first volume—a portion of the manuscript that may<lb/>
have been revised at an even later date than <hi>Further Communications on Business</hi>, given multiple strands of bibliographical and historical evidence, discussed<lb/>
in more detail below. It is unclear whether the single prior allusion to Hartley<lb/>
described in volume 3 refers to the revised text of volume 1 or to the insertion<lb/>
in volume 2. If it refers to volume 2, that would combine with other factors to<lb/>
suggest that the first chapter was revised at an even later time. Regardless, the<lb/>
erroneous reference to a “single” allusion provides yet another indication that<lb/>
the novel was expanded to include an additional passage pertaining to Hartley<lb/>
very late in the process.<lb/>
Before delving into the complex case of volume 1’s first chapter, it is helpful to consider yet another instance of how the manuscript’s excisions relate to<lb/>
its expansions. The insertion of two wove leaves into the chapter <hi>Which the</hi><lb/>
</p>
<note place="foot">122. Shirley, Clarendon edition, 266.<lb/>
123. Shirley, Clarendon edition, 726.<lb/>
124. One could consider whether the descender visible at the top of the excision on ff. 44<lb/>
volume 2 is that of a y—and, by extension, postulate that this handwriting is possibly linked to<lb/>
some prior mention of the name “Hartley” in the earlier draft of the fair-copy manuscript of<lb/>
volume 2. The inserted text copied out on the new leaf ends: “Don’t offer yourself as a target<lb/>
to Michael Hartley, and good-night!” Yet, while it is clear that the prior, extracted text likely<lb/>
ended in “good- | night,” the spacing of this handwriting does not match that of “Hartley,<lb/>
and good- | night” as there is room for about two or three words — not one —between the<lb/>
word with the swash descender and “good”—as is evident when comparing the spacing of this<lb/>
excised text to that of the line below. It should also be noted that many words on the same leaf<lb/>
and throughout the manuscript also end in y—and that Brontë’s letterform for g often contains<lb/>
a descender of this kind, as can be seen in the formation of the g in the word “altering” on this<lb/>
leaf. In the event that Michael Hartley was mentioned, it is clear that he was mentioned only<lb/>
briefly, given the extent of the material added to the manuscript in this area, which pertains<lb/>
almost entirely to him.<lb/>

<p>“Genteel Reader is Recommended to Skip, Low Persons being Here Introduced” presents another telling instance of revision that only becomes apparent when comparing the partially excised and newly inserted material in volume 2 of the manuscript with a later expansion made to volume 3.<lb/>
As is evident in table 2, two wove leaves appear between two laid leaves (<note>see figures 4 and 5</note>) that bear both substantial partial-leaf excisions and evidence of renumbering, indicating rewriting and revision rather than an extensive expansion.<lb/>

<p>Of the two wove leaves inserted here, the second (<note>see figure 6</note>) is little more than a half-leaf ending with an asterisk corresponding to another asterisk appearing on laid f. [A438].[B438].C444.E160, where Brontë’s earlier text resumes; the net gain, in terms of length, is about only a page (i.e., one side of a leaf) of additional text.<lb/>
Furthermore, it is clear that Brontë entirely removed some content, as the mention of Juno—still visible on the fragment of partially excised laid f. A437.B437.C441.E157—does not appear within any of the newly inserted material.<lb/>
Instead, the wove leaf and half-leaf contain an impassioned speech in which Shirley dismisses John Milton’s depiction of Eve, and then questions both the poet’s morality and his capacity to understand women:<lb/>

<p>“Milton was great; but was he good? His brain was right; how was his heart? . . .<lb/>
Milton tried to see the first woman; but, Cary, he saw her not.” . . . .<lb/>
“It was his cook that he saw; or it was Mrs. Gill, as I have seen her, making custards, in the heat of the summer, in the cool dairy” . . . .<lb/>
“I would beg to remind him that the first men of the earth were Titans, and that Eve was their mother.”<sup>125</sup><lb/>
</p>
<p>This newly added speech bears a striking resemblance in tone and content to another late expansion that we find in volume 3’s chapter, <hi>“The First BlueStocking,”</hi> which is titled as <hi>“Le Cheval dompté”</hi> (<hi>“The Tamed Horse”</hi>) in the manuscript and which was only retitled as part of a later proof stage.<lb/>
</p>
<p>Although this latter chapter is entirely written on wove stock in keeping with the paper used for the majority of the third volume, variants in the chapter’s numbering (<note>see table 3</note>) reveal that it also had been extensively revised, as has already been noted, in part, by the Clarendon editors.<sup>126</sup><lb/>
Brontë removed a <hi>“long paragraph”</hi> in French appearing on ff. A658.B658 and A659.B659, and part of f. A660.B660 at the suggestion of her publishers; by this point, the manuscript was already in the custody of Smith, Elder, and so she requested that they mail the chapter back to her for this alteration.<sup>127</sup><lb/>
She then drafted an English <hi>“translation,”</hi> written on eight new leaves that apparently …<lb/>

<p>extended beyond the scope of the original paragraph, given the substantial<lb/>
increase in length. (The original passage in French would likely have run about<lb/>
two pages, and would have been introduced by dialogue.) The newly inserted<lb/>
leaves, which are numbered in pencil and brown ink, initiate the final “D” sequence of the manuscript’s numbering, which was discontinued at A664.B664.C670.E103.<lb/>
Between the expansion and the discontinuation of the sequence,<lb/>
three leaves of the existing manuscript were renumbered (A661.B661.C667.D673.E100 – A663.B663.C669.D664 [665].E102)— probably simply to clarify<lb/>
the positioning of the new leaves within the chapter’s original sequence. Furthermore, Brontë was unable to re-number the succeeding leaves following the<lb/>
chapter, as she had previously done when introducing the red-ink sequence<lb/>
</p>
<pb n="311"/>
<p>
into the novel, because the rest of the novel was already in the hands of her<lb/>
publisher. This explains the interruption to her red-ink numbering, as well as<lb/>
its disuse afterward.<lb/>
The substance of the expansion has to do with Eva, “<hi>La Première Femme Savante</hi>”—the subject of a school essay, we are told, that was written by Shirley<lb/>
in her youth and that was subsequently memorized by her teacher, Louis Moore<lb/>
(Robert Moore’s brother). Louis, as portrayed within the action of the novel, recites<lb/>
the essay aloud, in its entirety, from memory.128 Eva is Shirley’s vision of an<lb/>
early woman, living at the dawn of time—an alternative, we intuit, to Milton’s<lb/>
Eve, as mentioned in volume 2. Indeed, the name “Eva” appropriately carries a<lb/>
feminine ending, as if to demarcate the difference—reminding us that Shirley,<lb/>
not Milton, is the author of this particular narrative.<lb/>
This dialectic is emphasized by the two sections, which cross-inform one<lb/>
another. Because the meditation on Eva comes later in the novel, it serves both<lb/>
as a corrective to the Eve of Paradise Lost and as a more complete re-imagining<lb/>
of Eve as she might have been. Yet, in the chronology of Shirley’s own life,<lb/>
Shirley writes her essay on Eva before she delivers her diatribe against Milton to<lb/>
Caroline Helstone. As a result, when we read the novel’s last volume, we recall<lb/>
Shirley’s prior criticism, and we realize that Shirley, as a schoolgirl, had already<lb/>
supplied a vision of her own to challenge the Miltonic Eve that she later disputes<lb/>
as a grown woman. Indeed, it is Shirley who seems most befitting of the title<lb/>
“<hi>femme savante</hi>”— a heroine also worthy of carrying the title of this particular<lb/>
novel.<lb/>
Because these two episodes appear within different volumes—and across the<lb/>
gap of time when Brontë “laid aside” her work—an intervention was likely<lb/>
necessary in order to tighten the parallel between the sections. As with the prior<lb/>
examples of “<hi>Shirley and Caroline</hi>” and also “<hi>Further Communications on Business</hi>,” the insertion in volume 2 lays the groundwork for a later passage in<lb/>
volume 3.129 Here it is certain, however, that the revision to volume 2 preceded<lb/>
that to volume 3, as we know that the addition of the long “Eva” text was intro-<lb/>
duced extremely late in the process.<lb/>
6. <hi>Analysis of Missing and Recycled Leaves</hi><lb/>
With each of the prior three examples, changes in foliation and page number-<lb/>
ing correlate to the use of different paper stocks, and so help to establish the<lb/>
scope and approximate order in which Brontë modified her manuscript. How<lb/>
then do we approach the question of the first chapter, “<hi>Levitical</hi>,” which is not<lb/>
only written on London Superfine wove stock but, notably, is also the only part<lb/>
of volume 1 not written on Cream Laid paper? This is surely significant when<lb/>
we recall that London Superfine wove paper stock appears in volume 2 only in<lb/>
128. The narrator “translates” Louis Moore’s recitation of the essay “on pain of<lb/>
being unintelligible to some readers.” See f. D664.E91.<lb/>
129. At the time the insertion was made to volume 2, the passage it corresponded with<lb/>
would have the short essay in French, probably titled “<hi>La Première Femme Savante</hi>” and most likely focusing on Eve/Eva, in accord with the subject of the<lb/>
later expansion.<lb/>
</p>
<pb n="312"/>
<p>instances where text had been modified, until the wove stock’s principal and<lb/>
regular use in volume 3. We know that Brontë’s publishers had asked her to<lb/>
revise chapter one in February, as is documented in her correspondence.130 But,<lb/>
to date, scholars have assumed that Brontë refused to edit the opening of her<lb/>
novel, based on her responses to W. S. Williams and James Taylor of Smith,<lb/>
Elder.131</p>
<p>The leaves in chapter one do not reflect any apparent change to their inked<lb/>
numbering (see table 4) as we have seen in volume 2 in conjunction with changes<lb/>
in paper stocks. But there is a marked gap where f. 22 should appear that sepa­<lb/>
rates the wove leaves of chapter one, which concludes on f. 21, from the laid<lb/>
paper used for chapter two, which begins on f. 23.132 This omission carries with<lb/>
it no apparent loss of text, as we learn when collating the manuscript with the<lb/>
first edition—a fact that strongly suggests that Brontë removed f. 22 herself as<lb/>
part of an editorial process.133 Furthermore, f. 21 (the last leaf of chapter one) is<lb/>
written on a recycled leaf whose verso bears the title <hi>Shirley</hi>—another clue that<lb/>
the chapter was revised and recopied only at a later stage, as Brontë did not<lb/>
entirely decide on the title <hi>Shirley</hi> until August 24, 1849—long after she had<lb/>
first sent the manuscript volume 1 to her publisher in February; before that, the<lb/>
novel had been tentatively referred to as <hi>Hollow’s Mill</hi>, a title that was ultimately<lb/>
</p>
<p>130. Brontë’s correspondence, identified as likely being written on February 20, 1849,<lb/>
reads as follows: “I sincerely thank you both for the candid expression of your objections—what<lb/>
you say with reference to the first chapter shall be duly weighed—At present I feel reluctant to<lb/>
withdraw it—because as I formerly said of the Lowood-part of <hi>‘Jane Eyre’</hi>—it is true— The<lb/>
curates and their ongoings are merely photographed from the life.” <hi>Letters</hi>, 2:181.</p>
<p>131. For example, Jacob Korg writes: “Although Smith and Elder asked her to cut the<lb/>
first chapter, a satiric description of the curates at dinner, Charlotte Brontë refused, argu­<lb/>
ing that the scene was authentic.” See “The Problem of Unity in Shirley,” <hi>Nineteenth-Century<lb/>
Fiction</hi> 12, no. 2 (1957): 125–36 (126). doi:10.2307/3044150, accessed August 19, 2020. The<lb/>
general view is reflected by Rosengarten and Smith, who do not document or consider any<lb/>
of the bibliographical or codicological evidence presented here, and who write as follows:<lb/>
“Charlotte would not withdraw the offending chapter, telling James Taylor that she could not<lb/>
‘<hi rend="bold">sacrifice truth to the fear of blame</hi>’; but she accepted his strictures on ‘the bad taste of the<lb/>
opening apostrophe—that I had already condemned in my own mind.’” <hi>Shirley</hi>, xix. Further<lb/>
on, Rosengarten and Smith write: “most of the alterations are slight” in volume 1. Their<lb/>
footnotes and apparatus make no mention of the manuscript evidence that I discuss. In her<lb/>
article, Marin maintains this position: “she did not comply with her publishers’ suggestion<lb/>
to drop the first chapter because it might have offended religious readers and it might have<lb/>
destroyed the aesthetic unity of the composition.” See Marin, “Charlotte Brontë’s Heron<lb/>
Scissors,” 24.</p>
<p>132. As I mentioned earlier, the BL conservators inserted a replacement leaf as part of the<lb/>
1976 rebind—but the leaf is not clearly marked as such.</p>
<p>133. My opinion here is different from that of Smith and Rosengarten, who note: “there<lb/>
is no f. 22, but this seems to be an error: no matter is omitted at this point.” See <hi>Shirley</hi>, Clar­<lb/>
endon edition, xxiv. While Smith and Rosengarten see this as a numbering error, it is worth<lb/>
observing that Brontë was not prone to making mistakes of this kind. Indeed, there are no other<lb/>
detectable numbering errors of this sort in the entire manuscript. Also, when drawing this con­<lb/>
clusion, Smith and Rosengarten did not take into consideration the difference in paper stocks,<lb/>
the differences in leaf numbering made in pencil, or the recycled title page leaf—evidence that<lb/>
clearly suggests a revision was made.</p>

<p>rejected by her publishers.134<lb/>Cumulatively, this evidence suggests that Brontë revisited and revised the first chapter sometime after August 24.<lb/></p>
<p>Even so, it is difficult to determine exactly what revisions were made to the chapter.<lb/>There is significant variation occurring between the “A” pencil numbering sequence and the “B” brown-ink numbering of the leaves, suggesting that Brontë may have made additional changes in the pencil draft that likely served as the updated copy text for the fair-copy manuscript.135<lb/>As table 4 shows, the penciled leaf numbering skips from “10” to “13”— evidence that suggests that two pages’ worth of draft material could have been set aside at the last moment as Brontë edited the chapter.<lb/>Notably, the penciled numbering ends with f. 22 —a detail that leads one to wonder whether Brontë had set out to replace all 22 leaves that may have originally constituted chapter one, before making additional last-minute changes that led her to withdraw ff. 11 and 12, and that necessitated an additional leaf (viz., the unpaginated, recycled leaf bearing the Shirley title page on its verso).<lb/></p>
<p>The full case becomes somewhat clearer upon reviewing Brontë’s correspondence alongside this bibliographical evidence.<lb/>On February 4, 1849, Brontë mailed the first volume of her manuscript to her publisher with an accompanying letter including the following disclaimer: “The Manuscript has all its errors upon it, not having been read through since copying.”136<lb/>Although W. S. Williams’ reply has not survived, in Brontë’s correspondence with the firm later that month about their “objections” to the first chapter, she wanted to know in particular their reasons for requesting a change: “I should like you to explain to me more fully the ground of your objections—is it because you think this chapter will render the work liable to severe handling by the press? Is it because knowing as you now do the identity of ‘Currer Bell’—this scene strikes you as unfeminine—? Is it because it is intrinsically defective and inferior—? I am afraid the first two reasons would not weigh with me—the last would.”137<lb/></p>
<p>Apparently, Brontë soon afterward received a reply from Williams that, in her words, was “calculated to command careful consideration.”138<lb/>It seems that Williams and Taylor had advised her to “give up Malone and Donne”—two curates who undergo satirical treatment in the published version of the novel, but who may have been subject to even harsher treatment in an earlier version, given that her publishers apparently had told her that the chapter pushed the boundaries of good taste and “artistic treatment.”<lb/></p>
<div type="footnotes">
<note n="134">On August 21, 1849, Brontë writes to W. S. Williams: “If I remember rightly my Cornhill critics object to ‘Hollow’s Mill,’ nor do I now find it appropriate. It might rather be called ‘Fieldhead’—though, I think ‘Shirley’ would perhaps be the best title: ‘Shirley,’ I fancy, has turned out the most prominent and peculiar character in the work. Cornhill may decide between ‘Fieldhead’ and ‘Shirley.’” See Letters, 2:237. Brontë did refer to the manuscript as ‘Shirley’ in a communication sent on March 1, 1849 to James Taylor; notably, this was after she sent the first draft (and presumably the prior title of ‘Hollow’s Mill’) to Smith, Elder on February 4, 1849. See Letters, 2:188.<lb/></note>

<p><pb n="315"/>gests that Williams and Taylor found the opening scene to be<lb/>“irrelevant to the book.”139 Although Brontë did not ultimately cast aside these two characters, she<lb/>acknowledged in her reply the possible unwelcome repercussions—particularly<lb/>negative criticism from the “periodical press”—that could result from publishing<lb/>the chapter as it stood. Then, invoking her identity as the male author Currer<lb/>Bell, she writes “Currer Bell, without pretending to be David, feels no awe of the<lb/>unwieldly Anakim,” but reassured them that he (Currer Bell) would reasonably<lb/>accommodate their concerns: “comprehend me rightly, gentlemen—it would<lb/>grieve him to involve others in blame—any censure that would really injure and<lb/>annoy his publishers would wound himself—therefore believe that he will not act<lb/>rashly—trust his discretion.”140 Acknowledging his criticism of the opening apostrophe, she (resuming the voice of “C. Brontë”) wanted to move on: “Enough<lb/>said of a work in embryo—Permit me to request in conclusion that the M.S.<lb/>may now be returned as soon as convenient.”141 Weighing these communications<lb/>along with the codicological evidence, I believe that Brontë (in this case, operating as Bell) indeed reworked the first chapter in a way that would suit the need<lb/>to retain Donne and Malone (who appear elsewhere in the novel) while also addressing some of the other concerns that Williams and Taylor had raised. Indeed,<lb/>there is a letter written by Brontë to her publishers on September 19, 1849 that<lb/>begins “I have made the alteration—but I have made it to please Cornhill—not<lb/>the Public nor the critics.”142 Margaret Smith speculated that the “alteration”<lb/>pertained to the second paragraph in the first chapter; but the evidence offered<lb/>by the manuscript suggests that the revision was much larger than that.<lb/>This revision could also have entailed changes with respect to the novel’s<lb/>introduction and characterization of Michael Hartley, given Brontë’s late-stage<lb/>alterations to volume 2 of the manuscript and also given Hartley’s role in the<lb/>novel’s denouement in volume 3. Indeed, a sizable portion—ff. 16 to 20— of<lb/>chapter one pertains to Hartley. Were the material recopied and revised from the<lb/>initial, earlier draft, this extended passage would constitute the single prior allusion to Hartley mentioned at the end of volume 3. This hypothesis is supported<lb/>by the fact that the first chapter is shorter rather than longer in its revision. It<lb/>is also possible though that Brontë withdrew other, more controversial material<lb/>from chapter one and filled it out with this extended passage about Hartley; in<lb/>that case, the inserted material about Hartley in volume 2 would constitute an expansion of what would have been a brief mention about him in that volume. Both<lb/>scenarios are possible. In either case, a larger pattern and purpose is clear: Brontë<lb/>made a strategic attempt to unify the novel’s action across its three volumes.<lb/>This new evidence helps to inform our reading of Shirley as a whole. The novel’s<lb/>opening chapter has been widely discussed and debated among critics since the<lb/>novel’s initial release in 1849. Titled “Levitical,” the chapter was clearly intended<lb/>as a critique on both the privileges exacted by junior assistants to senior clergymen,<lb/>139. Ibid.<lb/>140. Letters, 2:186.<lb/>141. Ibid.<lb/>142. Letters, 2:256–57.<lb/></p>
<pb n="316"/>
<p>as well a satire on their inflated self-importance and grandiose polemical views.143<lb/>
The opening failed to succeed with a number of contemporary readers—this<lb/>
despite Brontë’s apparent late intervention at the prior behest of her publishers.<lb/>
George Henry Lewes wrote in his unsigned review of <hi rend="italic">Shirley</hi> that it was a “mistake”<lb/>
to include the three “offensive, uninstructive and unamusing” curates featured in<lb/>
the initial chapter of the novel.144<lb/>
Over time, the figures have become “infamous”<lb/>
in Brontë criticism, and they continue to be discussed in great detail (viz., Dolin;<lb/>
Perkin; Thormählen).145 An influential essay written in the mid-twentieth century<lb/>
by Jacob Korg branded the chapter as an “irrelevant” element marring the novel’s<lb/>
unity.146 In keeping with this Lewesian strain of criticism, Tim Dolin has interpreted <hi rend="italic">Shirley</hi>’s “arbitrariness” as “reinforc[ing] the sense that it resists a logic of<lb/>
historical influence or even causality.”147 He argues that the novel “is plagued with<lb/>
anagnoreses [sic], confessions pleading new beginnings, and reversals of fortune,”<lb/>
and notes that “<hi rend="italic">Shirley</hi> is one of the first English novels to display as structural<lb/>
disturbance the disquieting implications of the modern crowd . . . [a] structural<lb/>
disturbance that was, and still is, perceived to be its formal imperfection.”148 Yet<lb/>
recent critics have welcomed these same qualities as a signal innovation in Brontë’s<lb/>
writing. Justine Pizzo argues that the comic nature of <hi rend="italic">Shirley</hi>’s opening chapter<lb/>
establishes the novel’s “episodic structure and seemingly discrete, disunified vignettes that mark its difference from the rest of Brontë’s oeuvre.”149</p>
<p>If <hi rend="italic">Shirley</hi> seems to be episodic in its design, close bibliographical analysis<lb/>
indicates that this was a calculated effect. Brontë carefully considered the risk<lb/>
of retaining her first chapter, as she clearly seems to have modified an earlier,<lb/>
slightly longer version of the chapter (i.e., longer by one leaf) in order to allay at<lb/>
least some of her publishers’ concerns, while retaining the characters of Donne,<lb/>
Malone, and Sweeting for her main purpose. The free-wheeling exploits and<lb/>
haughty attitudes of these young, unmarried men starkly contrast with the condition<lb/>
in which the novel’s two unmarried heroines find themselves—a marked<lb/>
disparity between the kind of privilege that certain men had (and often abused)<lb/>
and the limitations imposed on women, who were highly restricted in what they<lb/>
could say and do. Although it remains unclear exactly what changes were made<lb/>
to the first chapter, the ultimate fates and fortunes of these curates—who appear<lb/>
elsewhere throughout the novel—are disclosed within the novel’s last chapter,</p>

<p>“<hi>The Winding-up.</hi>” Brontë’s inclusio is yet another deliberate bracketing technique that underscores the curates’ significance—as well as Michael Hartley’s—<lb/>
in the novel’s overall structure. As we have seen, it was Brontë’s practice to edit<lb/>
and tighten such parallels across the novel’s three volumes. Given the material<lb/>
evidence presented here, it is reasonable to suppose that she modified her opening<lb/>
chapter in concert with the composition of the novel’s conclusion.<lb/>
</p>
<p>7. <hi>The Role of Interpretation</hi><lb/>
This article has attempted to call attention to the kinds of rich bibliographical<lb/>
and codicological evidence found in a modern literary manuscript. It has largely<lb/>
focused on demonstrating the utility of correlating variations in the substrates of the<lb/>
manuscript with differences in its numbering. It cannot offer a close analysis of all<lb/>
of the changes made by Brontë, which is better handled in the form of a critical<lb/>
edition. At the same time, it is important to acknowledge that the manuscript contains<lb/>
some significant expansions that entail no apparent changes to its paper stocks.<lb/>
</p>
<p>One notable example, already discussed, is Brontë’s revision to her chapter<lb/>
“<hi>The First Blue-Stocking</hi>”—the “translation” of the French passage that was<lb/>
made in September 1849 per the advice of her publishers. Another even larger<lb/>
expansion preceding that one seems to have gone undetected to date. “<hi>Written in<lb/>
the Schoolroom</hi>” was copied out by Brontë in the summer of 1849. The<lb/>
chapter, which falls toward the very end of volume 3, describes Louis Moore’s<lb/>
proposal to Shirley Keeldar. Ending with f. A851.B851.C858.[D864].E290, the<lb/>
chapter was followed by “<hi>The Winding-up.</hi>” Then, as table 5 shows, a series of<lb/>
ten leaves was inserted as part of stage C of the composition process, as is evident<lb/>
by the changes to the manuscript’s red-ink and B-series brown-ink numbering.<lb/>
This new section, demarcated by a double rule of two short pen strokes in the<lb/>
manuscript, begins on the very bottom of f. A851.B851.C858.[D864].E290. Nine<lb/>
leaves later, we find A852.B852.C869.[D875].E301 and its ensuing sequence.<lb/>
What had been a difference in seven leaves between the numbering of states B<lb/>
and C later increased to a difference of 17 leaves.<lb/>
</p>
<p>This newly added section is conveniently framed as an interpolated narrative<lb/>
from Louis Moore’s blank book—a narrative device that Brontë uses earlier on<lb/>
in the third volume of the novel in the chapter, “<hi>Louis Moore</hi>,” and later again,<lb/>
at the beginning of “<hi>Written in the Schoolroom</hi>.” Critics such as Lewes found<lb/>
this tactic rather clumsy, as his following critique makes evident:<lb/>
</p>
<quote>
<p>There, again, there is Louis Moore writing long narratives in his note-book. What he<lb/>
writes is often striking; and had the authoress only thought of making him keep a journal,<lb/>
probability would have been sufficiently saved. But, instead of that, she obliges him to sit<lb/>
down in Shirley’s room, draw out a note-book, and proceed to write very circumstantially,<lb/>
for our benefit, what everyone feels he would never have written at all. And while writing<lb/>
he is so intensely conscious of being read, that he says, “I confess it—to this mute page, I<lb/>
may confess it” . . . . All that Louis Moore writes might have been told by the authoress,<lb/>
without subterfuge.<lb/>

  Brontë seems to have anticipated this very criticism. At the outset of this late expansion, her narrator addresses the novel’s readers as follows: “Yet again, a passage from the <hi>blank book</hi>, if you like, reader; if you don’t like it, pass it over:—.”<sup>151</sup><lb/>
  The device, indeed, feels most contrived at this particular point of<lb/>

<pb n="319"/>
<p>the novel—unsurprising, perhaps, given that the entry in question is literally<lb/>
appended to an existing chapter, which was already written in the style of a<lb/>
blank book entry. The later entry made by Louis Moore reports how news of<lb/>
his engagement to Shirley is received by her uncle and former guardian, Mr.<lb/>
Sympson—a scene entailing some rather charged language, owing to Mr. Sympson’s<lb/>
objection to having his niece marry her former tutor. Perhaps the narrative<lb/>
device of the blank book was especially helpful in this instance: Moore writes that<lb/>
Mr. Sympson “uttered words with which this page shall never be polluted.”152<lb/>
Yet, without a doubt, the device of Moore’s entries in his “blank book” also<lb/>
readily allowed Brontë to adjust and adapt this portion of her narrative with<lb/>
comparative ease when she was pressed for time. Indeed, as we have already<lb/>
seen, Shirley contains a number of interpolated texts that served as a convenient<lb/>
node of access for expansion and revision. This example and Shirley’s essay on<lb/>
Eva are two of six instances of such texts that were altered in a way that entailed<lb/>
partial-leaf excisions or the insertions of new leaves.<lb/>

One final and telling example of a change to an interpolated text can be<lb/>
found in the first volume of the novel within the chapter “Coriolanus,” which<lb/>
bears a partial-leaf excision and repair to f. A126.B126. The following leaf fea-<lb/>
tures two stanzas of André Chénier’s poem “La jeune captive,” which Caroline<lb/>
Helstone recites to her cousin, Robert Moore, with whom she is secretly in love.<lb/>
These stanzas clearly offer a coded commentary on her private feelings toward<lb/>
her cousin: “Mon beau voyage encore est si loin de sa fin! | . . . | Un instant<lb/>
seulement mes lèvres ont pressé | La coupe en mes mains encore pleine”; “The<lb/>
voyage of life is but begun for me | . . . | My lips have hardly touched the cup<lb/>
as yet | Still brimming in my hand.”<lb/>

Brontë cut out about five or six lines preceding the two stanzas, pasting into<lb/>
their place a slip of paper with a commentary on Caroline’s taste in poetry. The<lb/>
new text, fashioned as a footnote, reads:<lb/>

† Caroline had never seen Millevoye’s “Jeune Malade,” otherwise she would have<lb/>
known that there is a better poem in the French language than Chénier’s “Captive;” a<lb/>
poem worthy to have been written in English,—an inartificial, genuine, impressive strain.<lb/>
To how many other samples of French verse can the same epithets be applied with truth?<lb/>

Although it is unclear exactly what text was excised from f. A126.B126, one dis-<lb/>
tinct possibility is that the leaf bore the poem’s preceding stanza, which runs ap-<lb/>
proximately the same length as the prior two. The case for a third stanza having<lb/>
been present is further supported in the novel by the narrator’s reference to the<lb/>
“last three stanzas” that Caroline “rehearsed well.”153 The stanza that was proba-<lb/>
bly present in the manuscript and later removed would have likely read as follows:<lb/>

Est-ce à moi de mourir? Tranquille je m’endors,<lb/>
Et tranquille je veille; et ma veille aux remords<lb/>
Ni mon sommeil ne sont en proie.<lb/>
Ma bienvenue au jour me rit dans tous les yeux;<lb/>

<pb n="322"/>
<p>By turning our attention to the materials and mechanics of writing processes<lb/>as well as the role of women’s labor, we can gain clearer insight into the historical<lb/>practices and domestic duties that marked women’s writing. Although material<lb/>surfaces are silent, laid or wove, embossed or watermarked, excised or intact,<lb/>they can speak to activities otherwise undocumented in the historical record. By<lb/>learning how to discern the changes introduced by Brontë amid those made by<lb/>the hands of many others—printers, publishers, collectors, bookbinders,<lb/>curators, and conservators—we find the story of a rising woman author who<lb/>prioritized the care of her family over the expectations of her publishers and readers.<lb/>Having lived through a global pandemic, many of us are now more attuned<lb/>to the caregiving duties required of those coping with grave illness. It is<lb/>helpful, I think, to understand Brontë’s break from working on the manuscript as a decision<lb/>necessitated by this more urgent charge.</p>
<p>And yet we also see another choice at work at a later stage of composition: a<lb/>strategic process of revision that drew together plot points across the book’s three<lb/>volumes—deliberate changes that, when introduced, drew together the narrative<lb/>threads of Brontë’s novel. By studying the manuscript slowly, carefully, and<lb/>methodically using the techniques afforded by bibliography, these two distinct<lb/>stages emerge from among the manuscript’s complex layers of composition to<lb/>tell a more nuanced story of how Charlotte Brontë’s work as a writer intersected<lb/>with her duties as both a daughter and sister. Sometimes slowing down—as<lb/>Brontë herself was forced to—allows us to revisit our own critical assumptions<lb/>with fresh eyes and a clearer sense of purpose. Where her work as a writer left<lb/>legible traces, her labor as a caregiver created subtle absences barely detectable,<lb/>but still discernable, in the leaves she left behind.</p>

  <head>“THE BROTHERS” AND THE ENGLISH COMTE DE GABALIS</head><lb/>
  <byline><name>Joscelyn Godwin</name></byline><lb/>
  <p>Comte de Gabalis is a short novel in the form of five discourses, published anonymously in 1670 and certainly authored by the Abbé Nicolas de Montfaucon de Villars (1635?-1673).<lb/>
Anglophone readers are most likely to find it in a translation first published in 1913 and often reprinted.<lb/>
Attributed only to “The Brothers,” it carries a pseudo-scholarly commentary every verso page and on 145 pages at the end, in which Villars’ lively and satirical text is treated as a solemn source of esoteric teachings.<lb/>
Who were these Brothers? This article seeks to answer that question and to illuminate an enigmatic episode in Gabalis’ reception history.<lb/>
Villars’ novel was an instant success. It was soon banned in France, reprinted in Holland and Cologne, and supplied with spurious sequels.<lb/>
Two different English translations appeared in 1680, inspiring Alexander Pope in his <hi>Rape of the Lock</hi> (1712), and a third soon afterwards.<lb/>
Pope’s mock epic introduced English readers, as Villars had the French, to the picturesque realm of the elementals: sylphs, salamanders, undines or nymphs, and gnomes.<lb/>
Gabalis, a German count, claims deep knowledge of them and their habits, as well as of Kabbalah, alchemy, and occult mysteries.<lb/>
He urges the sceptical narrator to renounce human women and to marry a sylph, adding that the greatest ones of the past were all the result of such inter-species intercourse.<lb/>
  </p>
  <p>The 1913 translation is accurate, if ponderous, and omits Villars’ more salacious passages.<lb/>
The Brothers are named as publisher and copyright holder, and leave us to draw our own conclusions from their oval emblem (figure 1), which appears insistently: twice on the dust jacket, twice embossed on the cover, and four more times inside the book.<lb/>

<p>
The printer was the Old Bourne Press, a private press founded in London in<lb/>
1902 by W. Herbert Broome that produced illustrated books in limited editions.<lb/>
<hi>Comte de Gabalis</hi> fits the profile of a private commission, using the resources of<lb/>
Broome’s workshop. It is richly illustrated in line, sepia, and photogravure. The<lb/>
unsigned decorations are typical of the Symbolist period of the late nineteenth<lb/>
century, such as the chapter heading (figure 2) which shows the four types of<lb/>
elementals gathered around a philosophical family. The initial letter on page<lb/>
274 (figure 3) is copied, line by line, from Elihu Vedder’s famous painting <hi>The Questioner of the Sphinx</hi> (the lesser-known version of 1875, in semi-profile). Other<lb/>
illustrations are taken with due acknowledgment from museums.<lb/>
</p>
<p>
There is only one reference to The Brothers in the body of the book, and it is<lb/>
a teasing one. The photograph opposite p. 297 of a half-length, turbaned figure<lb/>
is captioned: “Portrait of a Master. Painted by R. Owned by The Brothers.” It is<lb/>
visibly an “old master” oil painting with a crackled surface. Since Rembrandt’s<lb/>
<hi>Polish Rider</hi> (now in the Frick Collection, New York) is the only other painting<lb/>
reproduced in the book, and the artist was known for his love of Oriental cos-<lb/>
tume, the reader is free—perhaps even invited—to imagine The Brothers as<lb/>
custodians of priceless art treasures.<lb/>
</p>
<p>
Examples of this edition are sometimes seen with the imprint of William<lb/>
Rider &amp; Son, the London publisher of much occult literature, and the date 1922.<lb/>
A new title page has been pasted in, reading: “<hi>Comte de Gabalis. Discourses on<lb/>
the Secret Sciences and Mysteries, in accordance with the principles of the<lb/>
Ancient Magi and the Wisdom of the Kabalistic Philosophers. By the Abbé N.<lb/>
de Montfaucon de Villars. Newly rendered into English with Commentary and<lb/>
Annotations.</hi>” A catalogue entry of Weiser Antiquarian Books comments: “We can<lb/>
only presume that Rider took over the already bound stock of books from ‘The<lb/>
Brothers’ and had a new title-page printed and inserted, and (perhaps later) a dust<lb/>
jacket printed.”4 This<lb/>

copyright line.<lb/>
The true second edition appeared in New York, 1914, identical to the first in<lb/>
binding, format, font, and design. However, the text has been reset, so that the<lb/>
pagination differs by a few lines, and the italics and capitals are different. The<lb/>
commentaries lack the London edition’s identifying letters, from A to HHH. A<lb/>
few footnotes are added. If there was a dust jacket, I have not seen it. The obverse<lb/>
of the half-title names “New York / Harry B. Haines, 527 West 110th Street / London”<lb/>

page: “Published by The Brothers,” and on the obverse: “Copyright 1914,<lb/>
/ By The Brothers. / [symbol] / the news printing company / paterson<lb/>
n.j.” Harry B. Haines (1882-1972) was editor and publisher of the Morning/<lb/>
Evening News of Paterson, New Jersey. Evidently this edition was another private<lb/>
commission, executed by Haines’s printer.</p>
<p>The third edition (New York, 1922) contains a real surprise. It was issued by<lb/>
a commercial house, the well-known Masonic publisher Macoy. The dust jacket<lb/>
carries advertisements for books by Theosophical authors (William Q. Judge,<lb/>
Anna Kingsford, Mabel Collins, Franz Hartmann), and the spine shows the Ma-<lb/>
sonic square and compass in place of The Brothers’ emblem, which now occurs<lb/>
only on the copyright page. The quality of production is hardly inferior to the<lb/>
preceding editions, except that the photographs and half-tone illustrations are in<lb/>
gray, not sepia, and without tissue guards. The text has again been reset and the<lb/>
footnotes numbered, rather than identified by symbols. The portrait by “R” is no<lb/>
longer said to be owned by The Brothers. The surprise is that the translation is<lb/>
now described as “Rendered out of French into English with a Commentary by<lb/>
Lotus Dudley,” and “Copyright 1914, 1922 Sarah Emery Dudley.” Lotus Dudley<lb/>
also signs a new Foreword, inserted on a formerly blank page. All this is con-<lb/>
firmed in the U.S. Catalogue of Copyright Entries.5</p>
<p>Lotus and Sarah Dudley were in fact the same person, and quite conspicu-<lb/>
lar in certain circles. Sarah Lotta Emery Dudley (1878-1954) was a daughter of<lb/>
George Daniel Emery (1833-1909), a wealthy industrialist in Buffalo, New York.6<lb/>
She was educated at the Cambridge School for Girls and at Bryn Mawr College.7<lb/>
In 1904 she married Charles Tarbell Dudley, a Harvard graduate and mining<lb/>
engineer. They settled in San Francisco and had two children, but their marriage<lb/>
was short-lived, for in 1908 Charles died of tuberculosis.8 According to the Bryn<lb/>
Mawr alumnae newsletter, Sarah went to England the following year, 1909.9</p>
<p>The same newsletter announces in June 1914 that “Lotta Emery Dudley<lb/>
(Mrs. Charles Tarbell Dudley), has been spending several months in America.<lb/>
She came over to supervise the publication of her book [my italics].”10 This ex-<lb/>
plains how the second edition of Comte de Gabalis appeared from its American</p>
<p>5. Catalogue of Copyright Entries, New Series, 1922, entry no. 8317 for Comte de Gabalis is<lb/>
dated May 3, 1922, under the number A 674197 and the name of “Sarah Emery Dudley, c/o<lb/>

Lotus Dudley.”</p>

<p>
press so soon, and so faithfully to the original design. It also staked a claim for<lb/>
Dudley to The Brother’s production, if only among her collegiate friends.<lb/>
From July 1915 until 1919, Dudley directed a small private school in Green-<lb/>
wich, Connecticut. It was called the Wabanaki School, after the indigenous tribe<lb/>
of the region, and was situated next to the estate of Ernest Thompson Seton<lb/>
(1860-1946). He had been instrumental in founding the Boy Scouts of America<lb/>
and other movements favoring the free, outdoor education of the young, and had<lb/>
a particular admiration for the Native Americans and their culture.<lb/>
So did Dudley. After she retired from the school she became a psychic or<lb/>
spiritual adviser, notably of the socialite and diarist Mabel Dodge Luhan (1879-<lb/>
1962), who knew her as “Mrs. Lotus Dudley.”11 In 1919 Mabel was considering<lb/>
settling in Taos, New Mexico, and marrying Tony Luhan, an Indian of the Tiwa<lb/>
tribe. Dudley assured “Mrs. Sterne” (as Mabel then was) that she (Mabel) was<lb/>
destined to build a bridge between Indian wisdom and the West. Taos was to<lb/>
be a great spiritual center, indeed the “heart of the world.”12 Due to Mabel’s<lb/>
magnetism and wealth, the town would soon become a meeting-point of cultural<lb/>
celebrities.<lb/>
Dudley’s later career included international conferencing with influential<lb/>
connections.13 On one occasion her sense of entitlement went too far, and she<lb/>
spent two days in detention by the Paris police.14 In 1935 she contributed a long<lb/>
introduction to excerpts from the <hi>Ramayana</hi>, published by the London orienta-<lb/>
list house of Luzac.15 By 1937 she appears to have become a Muslim.16 She was<lb/>
evidently a complex woman, whose biography would reward further research.<lb/>
But was the <hi>Comte de Gabalis</hi> really her work?<lb/>
No such idea was current on the other side of the Atlantic, where the clues<lb/>
converged on a character known only as M. In 1927, an “occult autobiography”<lb/>
titled <hi>The White Brother</hi> appeared under the name of Michael Juste.17 It describes<lb/>

<p> 
  a group of young aspirants living a Bohemian existence in postwar Bloomsbury.<lb/>
  Their mentor, the White Brother of the title, is an older occultist called “Brother<lb/>
  M” who takes them on astral journeys and other adventures.<lb/>
  The book is actually a roman à clef. Michael Juste was a pseudonym of Michael<lb/>
  Hurwitz (1897–1961), author, poet, playwright, and, under the name of Michael<lb/>
  Houghton, founder and proprietor of the Atlantis Bookshop, which still exists<lb/>
  (as of 2024) near the British Museum. His nephew, the eminent English violinist<lb/>
  Emanuel Hurwitz, remembered him as “a benevolent white magician.”18<lb/>
  Michael’s friend, called “David” in the book, is securely identified as Raphael Hurst<lb/>
  (1898–1981), who would become a best-selling author on spirituality under the<lb/>
  name of Paul Brunton.19 Brunton’s son, Kenneth Thurston Hurst (1923–2009),<lb/>
  has confirmed that Brother M was a family friend and his own godfather (witness<lb/>
  Kenneth’s middle name). But he only knew him as Mr. Thurston, an American<lb/>
  painter living in London and specializing in lacquer work for upscale department<lb/>
  stores. No one hitherto had been able to identify him.<lb/>
</p>
<p>
  There are two further books authored simply by M and bearing The Brothers’ emblem.<lb/>
  The first was <hi>The Dayspring of Youth</hi> (1933), advertised by the publisher as<lb/>
  “By One of the Brothers.”20 The reviewer in <hi>Psychic Science</hi> speculated<lb/>
  that M “seems to be identical with Michael Juste, author of <hi>White Brother</hi>.”21<lb/>
  It was a good guess, but missed the mark.<lb/>
</p>
<p>
  A second book by M, <hi>The Lord God of Truth Within</hi>, was compiled by Hurwitz<lb/>
  and published in 1941 by the press of the esoteric entrepreneur Manly Palmer<lb/>
  Hall.22 It is subtitled <hi>A Posthumous Sequel to The Dayspring of Youth</hi>, and includes<lb/>
  anecdotes about sylphs and gnomes who are M’s personal friends.<lb/>
</p>
<p>
  M mentions <hi>Comte de Gabalis</hi> in both books. In <hi>Dayspring</hi> he prefaces a long<lb/>
  quotation with the words: “In a book previously mentioned by us, <hi>The Comte<lb/>
  de Gabalis</hi>, we have written this passage about prayer . . .” (p. 326). In <hi>The Lord<lb/>
  God of Truth Within</hi>, M writes: “we have spoken about [Merlin] in a former book<lb/>
  [footnote] <hi>Comte de Gabalis</hi>.” (p. 159) The three books form a coherent, if idiosyncratic,<lb/>
  body of doctrine.<lb/>
</p>
<p>
  Yet the 1922 edition loudly claimed to be the work of Lotus Dudley. My<lb/>
  first unpleasant suspicion was that she had appropriated Thurston’s work and<lb/>
  republished it under her own name(s). He could have been referring to this when<lb/>
  he wrote, in the Preface to <hi>The Dayspring of Youth</hi>, “as certain people in the past<lb/>
  have assumed authorship of some of my writings, all publications of the Brothers<lb/>
  will be issued in future under their seal and copyrighted” (p. 7). But this does<lb/>
  not accord with what is known of Dudley’s character. The references to <hi>Comte de<lb/>
  Gabalis</hi> in Thurston’s later books, carefully read, do not claim authorship: they<lb/>
  merely say that his words have appeared in it.<lb/>

<p>By a chance that could only have happened in the era of the Internet, I came<lb/>
across a joint application by Thurston and Dudley for a U.S. patent:<note n="23"/><lb/>
Patent application filed April 15, 1913. Serial no. 761,151. Book cover. Charles W.<lb/>
Thurston and Sarah Emery Dudley, United States Citizens residing at London. Patent<lb/>
issued by the United States Patent Office, July 14, 1914, no. 1,103,102.<lb/>
The application is for a book cover incorporating a slot on the inside into<lb/>
which a card can be inserted. The invention is trivial, but the technical drawing<lb/>
accompanying it (figure 4) shows the unmistakable emblem of The Brothers, just<lb/>
as it appears on the front paste-down of the 1913 edition of <hi>Comte de Gabalis</hi>.<lb/>
And there are the signatures of Charles W. Thurston and Sarah Emery<lb/>
Dudley. Simultaneously with the first edition, they had planted this clue to The<lb/>
Brothers’ identity where no one would think of looking for it. It also revealed<lb/>
Thurston’s first name, making it possible to track him down.<note n="24"/> In 2021 I acquired sixteen letters written in the 1920s and 1930s to Hurwitz from Brunton,<lb/>
Thurston, and Thurston’s wife, which supplied further biographical information<lb/>
on all of them.<note n="25"/></p>
<p>Charles Willis Thurston (1872–1937) was born near Boston into an inventor’s<lb/>
family. As a boy he <hi>“gathered mushrooms in Emerson’s front yard”</hi><note n="26"/> and frequented the local Native Americans. He left a faint trail in the Boston art scene.<note n="27"/><lb/>
By 1908 he was among the host of American artists exhibiting in Paris. Thus<lb/>
he was almost certainly the unnamed illustrator of our edition. I do not know<lb/>
whether there were any other Brothers, nor who was Thurston’s own master. His<lb/>
teachings partly resemble those of Thomas Lake Harris (1823–1906), founder of<lb/>
the Brotherhood of the New Life, who consorted with fairies and claimed to be<lb/>
married to a queen in their realm.</p>
<p>A tentative conclusion emerges from this: that Sarah or Lotus Dudley met<lb/>
Thurston in London after her husband’s death. He instructed her in psychic and<lb/>
esoteric matters, and they collaborated on the <hi>Comte de Gabalis</hi>. While the occult<lb/>
material was Thurston’s, by page-count it is in small proportion to the excerpts<lb/>
from classical works, quotations, summaries, supplements, and comparisons that<lb/>
fill out the 377 pages, not to mention the translation itself. Dudley, with her<lb/>
Bryn Mawr education and the British Museum at hand, was easily capable of<lb/>
such work. She probably financed the 1913 London edition and the New York<lb/>
edition of the following year. In 1922, with the earlier editions impossible to find,</p>

  <head>THREE ENDINGS: FITZGERALD, HEMINGWAY, FAULKNER</head>
  <byline>by James L. W. West III</byline>
  <p>The original endings of three important American novels, recovered from surviving manuscripts and typescripts, have been restored in scholarly edi-<lb/>itions. Each restoration involves two marks of punctuation. The novels are F.<lb/>Scott Fitzgerald’s <hi>This Side of Paradise</hi> (1920), Ernest Hemingway’s <hi>The Sun Also Rises</hi> (1926), and William Faulkner’s <hi>The Wild Palms</hi> (1939), which Faulkner<lb/>wanted to call <hi>If I Forget Thee, Jerusalem</hi>. The punctuation marks are a period<lb/>and a one-em dash for <hi>This Side of Paradise</hi>, a question-mark and a period for <hi>The Sun Also Rises</hi>, and a two-em dash and an exclamation point for <hi>If I Forget Thee, Jerusalem</hi>. An examination of the three endings, as first published and as later<lb/>restored, will demonstrate how marks of punctuation can affect the interpretation<lb/>of literary works. The editions to which the original endings have been restored<lb/>are all “intentionalist” editions. Each of these editions attempts to capture the<lb/>intentions of the author for the text at the time it was submitted, as a fair-copy<lb/>typescript, to its publisher.</p>
  <head>This Side of Paradise</head>
  <p>Fitzgerald began composing his first novel in the fall of 1917. He was living with<lb/>his friend John Biggs, Jr., at Princeton University, marking time until his army<lb/>officer’s commission was approved. He had decided not to continue as a student.<lb/>When the United States declared war on Germany in April 1917, he answered<lb/>the call to colors, enlisting (along with most of the rest of his class) in the armed<lb/>forces. In late July he took the test for a commission in the army. In September he<lb/>returned to the university and took up residence in a dormitory room with Biggs.<lb/>During his final few weeks on campus, Fitzgerald attended lectures in English<lb/>and history and helped with various chores on the <hi>Nassau Literary Magazine</hi>, of<lb/>which Biggs was the editor.</p>
  <p>Fitzgerald’s first instinct was to compose his novel entirely in verse, but he<lb/>quickly abandoned that notion and decided instead to employ a blend of prose,<lb/>poetry, and drama dialogue. His novel was to be a bildungsroman; its working<lb/>title was <hi>The Romantic Egotist</hi>. Fitzgerald meant to trace the passage from<lb/>adolescence to young manhood of his hero, a young aesthete named Stephen<lb/>Palms, who was the first-person narrator. Fitzgerald produced three chapters at<lb/>Princeton. His commission came through in late October, and he reported to<lb/>training camp at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in November. There he resumed<lb/>work on his manuscript. Three years later he recalled the process:</p>
</div>
<pb n="332"/>
<div>
  <p>Every Saturday at one o’clock when the week’s work was over I hurried to the Officers’ Club, and there, in a corner of a roomful of smoke, conversation and rattling newspapers, I wrote a 120,000-word novel on the consecutive week-ends of three months.<lb/>
  There was no revising; there was no time for it. As I finished each chapter I sent it to a typist in Princeton.<sup>1</sup><lb/>
  By February 1918 Fitzgerald had in hand a finished typescript of <hi rend="italic">The Romantic Egotist</hi>.<sup>2</sup><lb/>
  In March he submitted it to Charles Scribner’s Sons. There the novel caught the attention of a young editor named Maxwell Perkins, who recognized the author’s inventiveness and talent. Perkins’ enthusiasm, however, was not enough to carry the day. The other editors at the firm were skeptical about Fitzgerald’s novel; they considered it to be garrulous and immature, poorly structured and overburdened with detail. The rejection letter to Fitzgerald, dated 19 August 1918, put special emphasis on the ending of <hi rend="italic">The Romantic Egotist</hi>.<lb/>
  The letter reads in part: “<hi>[T]he story does not seem to us to work up to a conclusion;—neither the hero’s career nor his character are shown to be brought to any stage which justifies an ending.</hi>” And the letter continues: “<hi>It seems to us in short that the story does not culminate in anything as it must to justify the reader’s interest as he follows it; and that it might be made to do so quite consistently with the characters and with its earlier stages.</hi>”<sup>3</sup> Fitzgerald, now stationed at Camp Sheridan, Alabama, was troubled by this letter. “How could I intrigue the hero into a ‘philosophy of life,’” he later wrote, “when my own ideas were in much the state of Alice’s after the hatter’s tea-party?”<sup>4</sup><lb/>
  The armistice that ended the war was signed on 11 November 1918. Fitzgerald, who did not “make it over” to Europe, was discharged in February 1919. After an unsuccessful five-month stint as a copy-writer at the Barron Collier advertising agency in New York City, he quit his job and went home to St. Paul, Minnesota. There, in a third-floor room in his parents’ house, he set about rewriting his novel.<lb/>
  He took the best parts of <hi rend="italic">The Romantic Egotist</hi> and added freshly composed material; he also incorporated the typescripts of a short story, a one-act play, and several poems into the narrative—most of this material originally written at Princeton. At Perkins’ suggestion he dropped the breathless first-person narration of <hi rend="italic">The Romantic Egotist</hi> and shifted to a more mature third-person voice. He changed the protagonist’s name from Stephen Palms to Amory Blaine and altered the title to <hi rend="italic">This Side of Paradise</hi>, a phrase taken from the penultimate line of Rupert Brooke’s poem <hi rend="italic">Tiare Tahiti</hi>.<sup>5</sup> The result was a fast-moving narrative, loosely unified, and crowded with characters and incidents.<lb/>

dents. Fitzgerald was sure that this novel, now nearly complete in manuscript,<lb/>
had caught the mood of his post-war generation.<lb/>
Still there was the problem of the ending. <hi>This Side of Paradise</hi> was a coming-of-age story: how was Fitzgerald to bring the novel to a satisfactory conclusion<lb/>
when his hero’s life was only getting under way? Under pressure he improvised a<lb/>
solution. In the last chapter of the novel, he sent Amory on a long walk from New<lb/>
York City to Princeton. Along the way Amory contemplates his current situation:<lb/>
he is penniless and unemployed but unwilling to pursue a conventional course in<lb/>
life. Almost his only achievement, he believes, is a hard-won self-knowledge. He<lb/>
arrives in Princeton long after midnight and contemplates the towers and spires<lb/>
of the university. “Here was a new generation, shouting the old cries, learning the old creeds, through a reverie of long days and nights,” Amory muses,<lb/>
“a new generation dedicated more than the last to the fear of poverty and the<lb/>
worship of success; grown up to find all gods dead, all wars fought, all faiths in<lb/>
man shaken….”6 Amory stretches out his arms to the “crystalline, radiant sky”:<lb/>
“I know myself,” he cried, “but that is all—”<lb/>
The dash, in Fitzgerald’s hand at the end of the manuscript, addresses the criticism in the rejection letter. The dash captures the unfinished nature of the novel<lb/>
and makes it clear that everything in Amory’s life so far has been preliminary<lb/>
(see figure 1).<lb/>

  <figDesc>Facsimile of the manuscript’s final lines showing the emended dash after “I know myself,”</figDesc>
</figure><lb/>
Somewhere between manuscript and first print, the dash became a period. No<lb/>
evidence survives to reveal who made the change. The manuscript, made up of<lb/>
heavily revised holograph and typescript sheets, is preserved among Fitzgerald’s<lb/>
papers in the Department of Special Collections at Princeton.7 The document,<lb/>
messy and difficult to follow, is not a fair copy. A typescript made from this manuscript<lb/>
served as setting copy, but that typescript does not survive, nor do galleys or page proofs. The change from dash to period might therefore have been made<lb/>
anywhere along the line of textual transmission: by Fitzgerald’s typist (Fitzgerald<lb/>
could not type), by a Scribner copy-editor, or by Perkins. Fitzgerald himself might<lb/>
have made the change, either on the setting copy or in proof, or he might have<lb/>
accepted the alteration after it was urged upon him by Perkins, though there is no<lb/>
letter from the editor to Fitzgerald in which this change is suggested.8 The first<lb/>
edition of the novel, published on 26 March 1920, ends with a period (see figure<lb/>
2).<lb/>

monograph derived from the dissertation.10<lb/>
All editions of <hi>This Side of Paradise</hi>, however, continued to end with the period until 1995.<lb/>
In that year I published a full dress edition of the novel with Cambridge University Press as the third volume in <hi>The Cambridge Edition of the Works of F. Scott Fitzgerald</hi>.<lb/>
The text of this edition ends with a dash.<lb/>
The strongest evidence for the dash is the manuscript leaf, which is inscribed in Fitzgeralds hand.<lb/>
The period, by contrast, could have been introduced by anyone involved in the making of the book.<lb/>
For the Cambridge edition, I chose the dash.<lb/>
The final punctuation mark has an effect on how the novel is read and interpreted.<lb/>
With the period, the novel comes to an abrupt halt. (“I know myself,” he cried, “but that is all.”)<lb/>
Self-knowledge has been achieved.<lb/>
Amorys education is finished; his young manhood is over; he is ready to face whatever life brings.<lb/>
With the dash the novel is open-ended and the conclusion more hesitant. (“I<lb/>

<pb n="335"/>
know myself,” he cried, but that is all—”) Amory knows himself, or believes that<lb/>
he does, but that is all he is confident of knowing. He is still fundamentally the<lb/>
same person—idle, romantic, inquisitive, skeptical, unwilling to conform. Perhaps<lb/>
there is a place in society for him, but this is far from certain. Only the first<lb/>
part of Amory’s life has been completed. The dash dovetails with the title—<hi>This Side of Paradise</hi>.<lb/>
The reader has followed Amory’s journey to the beginnings of<lb/>
adulthood; what will come next we do not know.</p>
<p>The 1995 Cambridge text, ending with the dash, was published with the approval of the F. Scott Fitzgerald Literary Trust.<lb/>
This text was adopted by Scribner as its standard text and was first reprinted as a paperback by that publisher in 1996.<lb/>
The text with the dash has appeared in all Scribner editions from that date to the present.</p>
<p><hi>The Sun Also Rises</hi></p>
<p>Ernest Hemingway began work on his first novel in mid-July 1925, shortly after<lb/>
attending, for the third time, the annual bullfighting fiesta in the Spanish town of<lb/>
Pamplona. He worked steadily on the novel through July and August and finished<lb/>
an autograph first draft on 21 September 1925. His working title was <hi>Fiesta: A Novel</hi>.<lb/>
Hemingway (who, unlike Fitzgerald, could type) prepared a typescript<lb/>
from his manuscript. This typescript does not survive, but it must have existed.<lb/>
The differences between the holograph and the setting-copy typescript, which is<lb/>
extant, are so great that at least one revised typescript (and possibly more than one)<lb/>
must have intervened. Hemingway used a professional typing service for preparation<lb/>
of the setting copy. He made a very few emendations in his own hand on the<lb/>
finished sheets. The typescript, a fair copy bearing the title <hi>The Sun Also Rises</hi>, was<lb/>
put into the transatlantic mail to Maxwell Perkins at Scribner on 24 April 1926.<lb/>
This is the document that served as setting copy for the first edition; it survives<lb/>
today in the Papers of Ernest Hemingway at the Albert and Shirley Small Special<lb/>
Collections Library, University of Virginia. (The manuscript is preserved in the<lb/>
Ernest Hemingway Collection, John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum.)<lb/>
The compositors at the Scribner Press added handwritten galley “takes” to<lb/>
the setting copy—markings that indicate where each galley begins and ends—<lb/>
but this typescript was not otherwise marked before the type was assembled. All<lb/>
changes between the setting copy and the first edition must therefore have taken<lb/>
place in proof. Neither galleys nor page proofs, however, are known to survive.</p>

Robert W. Trogdon (Cambridge and New York: Cambridge University Press, 2015): 64-66.<lb/>
Hemingway was living in Paris during the proofing of the novel.</p>
<p>12. This manuscript has been published in facsimile: Ernest Hemingway, <hi>The Sun Also Rises: A Facsimile Edition</hi>, ed. Matthew J. Bruccoli. Archive of Literary Documents II.<lb/>
(Detroit: Omnigraphics, 1990).</p>
<pb n="336"/>
<p>The protagonist and first-person narrator is Jake Barnes, a journalist who has<lb/>
been wounded during the war. The wound has left him incapable of sex. He is<lb/>
in love with Brett Ashley, a decadent British aristocrat who seems to return his<lb/>
feelings, but they are unable to consummate their love.</p>
<p>At the very end of the novel, Jake and Brett are together in a taxi-cab. His arm is around her, and she is resting her head on his shoulder.<lb/>
“Oh, Jake,” she says, “we could have had such a damned good time together.” Jake’s answer in the manuscript is ironic: “Yes,” he says. “It’s nice as hell to think so.” The sentence ends with a period. At the bottom of this same manuscript page, the final leaf of the document, Hemingway has written an alternate version of the line: “Isn’t it nice to think so”—with no terminal punctuation. In the setting-copy typescript, prepared by the typing service, the final line is worded differently but still ends with a period, though the period is typed outside the quotation marks. (“Isn’t it pretty to think so”.)13<lb/>
The final line of the first edition, published by Scribner on 22 October 1926, ends on page 259 with a question-mark. (“Isn’t it pretty to think so?”) (See figures 3, 4, and 5).<lb/>
</p>
<p>No evidence survives to indicate who changed the period to a question-mark. Hemingway received galley proofs from Perkins on 11 August 1926 and returned them, with corrections, on 27 August.14<lb/>
As I have mentioned, these galleys do not survive, nor do page proofs. The Sun Also Rises was bowdlerized in proof. Three instances of “bulls have no balls” in Book Two, chapter 16, were altered to “bulls have no horns” (first edition, pp. 181-82). In the letters between Hemingway and Perkins, however, there is no mention of the final punctuation mark.15<lb/>
The Sun Also Rises was published on 22 October 1926.<lb/>
</p>
<p>It seems probable that someone at Scribner, working on a form of proof, introduced the question-mark. Grammatically the sentence is a rhetorical question and does not require a question-mark. Still the mark was added, perhaps as part of a house style being imposed on the text. This interpretation is supported by twelve other rhetorical questions in the novel, all of them occurring in passages of dialogue, and all ending with periods in Hemingway’s manuscript and setting-copy typescript. All twelve, like the final line of the novel, end with question-marks in the first edition.<lb/>
</p>
<p>Some examples will be helpful. In Book One, chapter 3, Jake and Brett are drinking at a café with friends. Brett becomes tipsy. “You’re wonderfully sober,” says Jake to Brett. She answers: “Yes. Aren’t I. And when one’s with the crowd I’m with, one can drink in such safety, too.” In both the manuscript and the setting copy there is a period after “Aren’t I.” In the first edition, on page 22,<lb/>
</p>
<note n="13" place="foot">Commas and periods are consistently typed outside the quotation marks in the typescript, suggesting that the typist at the typing service was British, or that the typists who worked<lb/>
there were accustomed to using British styling. See figure 4. Some of the typescripts of short<lb/>
stories that Fitzgerald wrote in Paris in the 1920s also have British spelling and accidentals.<lb/>
Perhaps he and Hemingway, who were friends during those years, used the same typing service.</note>

<p>there is a question-mark: “Aren’t I?” <lb/>
Another example occurs near the end of the novel, in Book Two, chapter 17. <lb/>
Here Robert Cohn, who has had a brief affair with Brett, asks Jake to forgive him. <lb/>
“So long, Jake,” says Cohn. “You’ll shake hands, won’t you?” <lb/>
In the manuscript Jake answers: “Sure. Why not.” <lb/>
In the setting copy the punctuation is the same (though the period after “not” is typed outside the quotation marks). <lb/>
On page 202 of the first edition Jake says: “Sure. Why not?” <lb/>
These two examples are typical of the other rhetorical questions to which question-marks have been affixed between the setting copy and the first edition. <lb/>
One’s sense is that Hemingway, for these readings, wanted the characters to speak in a flat tone, without animation. <lb/>
</p>
<p>The matter is of some importance. <lb/>
As one reads dialogue in a text, one hears the rhythms and intonations of the spoken words by paying attention to the pointing, the accidentals. <lb/>
The voice of the character who is speaking rises and falls according to the punctuation. <lb/>
With the period at the end of the novel, Jake delivers his statement in a resigned tone. <lb/>
(“Isn’t it pretty to think so.”) <lb/>
This is consistent with his character and with the view he has come to take toward life. <lb/>
The question-mark, however, changes the way one hears the sentence. <lb/>
(“Isn’t it pretty to think so?”) <lb/>
Jake’s voice rises at the end, making his statement sound flippant. <lb/>
This is out of character for him. <lb/>
He is bitter but is careful not to let his bitterness show. <lb/>
The final line, spoken without emotion, is in keeping with his behavior elsewhere in the novel. <lb/>
</p>
<p>Which punctuation mark should an editor choose for an edition of <hi>The Sun Also Rises</hi>? <lb/>
Here, as with <hi>This Side of Paradise</hi>, the editor must take a chance. <lb/>
How one hears the final line counts in the decision, as does one’s reading of Jake’s character. <lb/>
Documentary evidence, however, is a more reliable basis for editorial choice. <lb/>
The decision here seems straightforward. <lb/>
The period is present, in Hemingway’s hand, in the final line of the manuscript. <lb/>
The period is also present in the fair copy that Hemingway submitted to Scribner. <lb/>
For twelve other rhetorical questions the same thing happened: periods in manuscript and fair copy were replaced by question-marks in the first edition. <lb/>
The periods should be restored to the text. <lb/>
</p>
<p>Every edition of <hi>The Sun Also Rises</hi> published between 1926 and 2020 has question-marks following the rhetorical questions. <lb/>
All of these editions end with: “Isn’t it pretty to think so?” <lb/>
In 2018 the <hi>Library of America</hi> persuaded Scribner and the Hemingway estate to allow inclusion of <hi>The Sun Also Rises</hi>, which was nearing the end of its copyright protection, in a volume of early writings by Hemingway. <lb/>
The texts were prepared by Robert W. Trogdon, who consulted the surviving manuscripts, typescripts, and proofs for the writings in the volume. <lb/>
In the Trogdon text of <hi>The Sun Also Rises</hi>, the periods at the ends of the rhetorical questions are restored, as are the three instances of “bulls have no balls.” <lb/>
The final line of this edition reads: “Isn’t it pretty to think so.”<sup>16</sup> <lb/>
</p>
<p>The Sun Also Rises entered the public domain on 1 January 2022. <lb/>
Shortly thereafter, the <hi>Library of America</hi> published a paperback edition of the Trogdon<sup>16</sup>. <lb/>

This Side of Paradise and for The Sun Also Rises. As we shall see, it has happened<lb/>

<head>If I Forget Thee, Jerusalem</head>
<p>William Faulkner’s eleventh novel, published on 19 January 1939, has a compli-<lb/>
cated textual history. Faulkner wrote the novel under the title If I Forget Thee, Je-<lb/>
rusalem.18 Random House, his publisher, changed the title to The Wild Palms.</p>
<p>The novel consists of two interwoven stories, in alternating chapters. The primary nar-<lb/>
rative, entitled “The Wild Palms,” is tragic; the secondary narrative, “Old Man,”<lb/>
is comic.</p>
<p>“The Wild Palms” is set in 1937. It tells the story of a woman and a man,<lb/>
Charlotte Rittenmeyer and Harry Wilbourne, who resolve to free themselves<lb/>
from the burdens and constraints of society. Charlotte, a wife and mother, leaves<lb/>
her husband and two children; Harry, an unmarried medical student, abandons<lb/>
his studies and follows Charlotte in pursuit of what she conceives to be freedom.<lb/>
Their first few months together go well, but their idyll cannot endure. Charlotte<lb/>
becomes pregnant, and Harry (at her urging) performs an abortion. He botches<lb/>
the operation; Charlotte dies of hemorrhaging; Harry is sentenced to fifty years in<lb/>
prison. He refuses to commit suicide and decides to live out his years in captivity.<lb/>
Harry resolves to keep Charlotte alive in memory. The final line of “The Wild<lb/>
Palms,” in italicized interior monologue, gives his decision:<lb/>
<hi>“Between grief and nothing I will take grief.”</hi></p>
<p>The secondary story, “Old Man,” is a comic fable. The characters have no<lb/>
names: the protagonist is called “the tall convict,” and the woman is simply “the<lb/>
woman” or “she.” “Old Man” is set during the severe flooding of the Mississippi<lb/>
River in 1927. The tall convict has been temporarily released from prison in or-<lb/>
der to rescue people stranded by the flood. He takes a skiff and paddle and sets<lb/>
out on the river. He finds a pregnant woman clinging to a tree and helps her into<lb/>
the boat. For the remainder of “Old Man,” he and she are tossed about on the<lb/>
powerful river, coming to rest briefly on a small island where, with his assistance,<lb/>
she gives birth. The tall convict performs heroically during his period of freedom.<lb/>
He saves the woman and brings her and the baby to dry land. Throughout the<lb/>
narrative, however, he seems terrified of the woman and of what she represents.<lb/>
His only desire is to return to captivity. He fears the disorder and messiness of<lb/>
life and prefers the regularity of imprisonment; he has no desire to complicate<lb/>
his existence with women, and certainly not with sex or childbirth. In Faulkner’s<lb/>
manuscript and in the setting-copy typescript, which he typed, “Old Man” ends</p>

with the convict back in prison (see figures 6 and 7).<lb/>
Another ten years have been added to his sentence.<lb/>
He seems content, even pleased, with his fate.<lb/>
When asked by another inmate whether he will miss the company of women, his reply (the last line of the novel) is quite different from Harry’s last line:<lb/>
“Women, shit,” the tall convict said.<lb/>
</p>

<p>
Faulkner began composing <hi>The Wild Palms</hi> and <hi>Old Man</hi> as two separate stories but soon<lb/>
realized that the narratives were related to each other, not by plot and character but by theme and image.<lb/>
Both stories are about freedom versus imprisonment, the disorder of life versus the security of incarceration.<lb/>
Faulkner now began writing the novel in alternating stints, bringing <hi>The Wild Palms</hi> to a point of high intensity, then shifting to the comedy of <hi>Old Man</hi>, then returning to the drama of <hi>The Wild Palms</hi>, and onward until the end of<lb/>

<pb n="341"/>the novel. The manuscript, composed between September 1937 and June 1938,<lb/>
survives among Faulkner’s papers at the Small Special Collections Library.<lb/>
The pagination of the document confirms that Faulkner wrote the two stories in<lb/>
alternating chapters, composing a chapter of one and then a chapter of the other.<lb/>
He did not write “The Wild Palms” in its entirety, then write “Old Man,” and<lb/>
then shuffle the chapters. This structural experimentation was characteristic of<lb/>
Faulkner’s work from the late 1920s until the early 1940s, a period that saw pub-<lb/>
lication of <hi>The Sound and the Fury</hi> (1929), <hi>As I Lay Dying</hi> (1930), <hi>Absalom, Absalom!</hi> (1936), <hi>The Hamlet</hi> (1940), and <hi>Go Down, Moses</hi> (1942)—all of which take liberties<lb/>
with conventional narrative structure.<lb/>
Faulkner’s publisher, however, seems not to have understood what he was<lb/>
doing. Saxe Commins, Faulkner’s editor at Random House, changed the title of<lb/>
the novel from <hi>If I Forget Thee, Jerusalem</hi>, an inclusive title, to <hi>The Wild Palms</hi>,<lb/>
the title of the primary story. The change in title, made over Faulkner’s objec-<lb/>
tions, caused confusion for many years after publication. Scholars and critics did<lb/>
not recognize <hi>The Wild Palms</hi> as a novel. The history of subsequent editions did<lb/>
not help matters. In 1948 both “The Wild Palms” and “Old Man” were issued<lb/>
separately, in individual paperback volumes.19 In a 1954 paperback the two nar-<lb/>
ratives were published together but one after the other, with the full text of<lb/>
“The Wild Palms” appearing first, followed by “Old Man” in its entirety.20<lb/>
The novel was also bowdlerized. Faulkner objected to this sanitizing but was<lb/>
overruled.21 The setting-copy typescript, like the manuscript, is among Faulkner’s<lb/>
papers at the Small Special Collections Library.22 On the typescript Faulkner’s<lb/>
editor has marked out the word “shit.” He has preserved Faulkner’s comma and<lb/>
has substituted four ellipsis points for the profane word. Proofs for the book do<lb/>
not survive, but further changes in the final line must have occurred there. On<lb/>
page 339 of the first edition, the final page of “Old Man” and of the novel, the<lb/>
comma and the ellipsis points have been replaced by an open two-em dash and<lb/>
an exclamation point (see figure 8). The final line now reads:<lb/>
“Women —— !” the tall convict said.<lb/>
19. The Wild Palms (New York: New American Library, 1948); The Old Man (New York: New American Library, 1948). For these and later editions, the word “The” was added to the title of “Old Man.”<lb/>
20. The Wild Palms and The Old Man (New York: New American Library, 1954).<lb/>
21. Faulkner had little leverage with his publisher in 1939. Random House was the fifth imprint to publish his work and was carrying him as a succès d’estime. His first book with Random House, Absalom, Absalom!, had not sold well; If I Forget Thee, Jerusalem, with another biblical title, was not likely to do better—hence, presumably, the change in title. In 1939 Faulkner was best known as the author of Sanctuary (1931), a scandalous novel about a young woman who is raped with a corn cob. It is not surprising that the publisher bowdlerized The Wild Palms. The sanitizing, however, was incomplete: the words “pricks” and “cunts” appear on p. 52 of the first edition, and “Shit!” appears on p. 101. Later, after he had won the Nobel Prize in 1949, Faulkner swung more weight at Random House, and the heavy editing of his texts ceased.<lb/>
22. Both the manuscript and the setting-copy typescript of the novel have been published in facsimile in <hi>William Faulkner Manuscripts</hi>, vol. 14, parts 1 and 2, ed. Thomas L. McHaney (New York and London: Garland Publishing, Inc., 1986).<lb/>

<p>
The open dash (i.e., preceded and followed by half-spaces) was presumably<lb/>
meant to stand for the word “shit.” Punctuation is often used in printed texts as<lb/>
a substitute for profanity, but the two-em dash here, with the exclamation point,<lb/>
does not suggest a profane word. The line instead conveys mild exasperation, or<lb/>
perhaps longing.

<p>
Further change occurred in subsequent typesettings. In the <hi>Viking Portable Faulkner</hi> (1946),<lb/>
the half-spaces have been removed.
</p>
<p>“Women——!” the tall convict said.</p>
<p>
The French translator, confused, rendered the line this way in 1952:<lb/>
— Ah ! Les femmes ! » dit le grand forçat.<ref target="#fn23">23</ref>
</p>
<p>
In the New American Library edition of 1954, the long dash becomes a closed one-em dash, with the exclamation point retained:<lb/>
“Women—!” the tall convict said.
</p>
<p>
The Vintage paperback of 1962 is a slight improvement, with three hyphens and the letter “t” plus the exclamation point. It reads:<lb/>
“Women---t!” the tall convict said.
</p>
<p>
These textual discoveries were noted first by Thomas L. McHaney in his dis-<lb/>
sertation in 1968.<ref target="#fn24">24</ref> Twenty-two years later, McHaney and Noel Polk, with the<lb/>
permission of Faulkner’s literary estate, collaborated on a corrected text of the<lb/>
novel that was published by the Library of America. Here the title of Faulkner’s<lb/>
work is given as <hi>If I Forget Thee, Jerusalem [The Wild Palms]</hi>.<ref target="#fn25">25</ref> On the last page of<lb/>
this edition the final line has been restored. (“Women, shit,” the tall convict said.)<lb/>
Random House adopted this text, and indeed all of the corrected texts produced<lb/>

<p>by Polk for the Library of America, in its subsequent editions of Faulkner’s nov-<lb/>
els. Today, all copies published of <hi>If I Forget Thee, Jerusalem</hi>, which is still under<lb/>
copyright protection, end with the restored line. One hopes that the corrections<lb/>
will be carried forward in editions issued after the novel enters the public domain<lb/>
in 2035.</p>
<p>All editors hope to find significant variants in important works of literature. Edi-<lb/>
tors want to discover variants that will alter meaning, or at least cause teach-<lb/>
ers and critics to rethink their ideas about interpretation. This is probably a<lb/>
legacy of the New Criticism, with its emphasis on close reading. The New Critics<lb/>
taught that each word carries meaning, as does each punctuation mark, and that<lb/>
the interpretation of a literary work can turn on a single sentence. Perhaps the<lb/>
New Critics were right. Some sentences in fiction bring immediately to mind the<lb/>
works in which they appear. (“Mr. Holmes, they were the footprints of a gigantic<lb/>
hound!”) Some capture a central image. (“The red sun was pasted in the sky like<lb/>
a wafer.”) Some sentences prepare the work for its conclusion. (“Marlow ceased,<lb/>
and sat apart, indistinct and silent, in the pose of a meditating Buddha.”) Some<lb/>
sentences tie together all that has come before. (“Reader, I married him.”) Other<lb/>
sentences, appearing at the very end of a work, encapsulate its meaning. (“He<lb/>
loved Big Brother.”)</p>
<p>The discovery of pivotal variants is rare. Many excellent scholarly editions present<lb/>
texts that have been emended throughout, but the emendations are not especially<lb/>
significant. Documentary or “versionist” editions usually offer texts that are<lb/>
identical to, or not very different from, earlier texts. Facsimile editions typically<lb/>
list emendations at the foot of the page or in an apparatus. These editions can do<lb/>
many good things: they can provide narratives of composition and revision, trace<lb/>
the textual history of the work, and provide useful historical annotations. Time<lb/>
schemes are sometimes straightened out; the author’s accidentals are reinstated;<lb/>
misspellings and other demonstrable errors are corrected. These are valuable<lb/>
services, but they do not provide a definitive response, if there is one, to the notion<lb/>
that scholarly editing is essentially clerical work. All editors have heard this sort of<lb/>
thing. Why should an editor undertake the considerable labor of a full-dress edition<lb/>
if the interpretation of the work is to remain unchanged? Important variants might<lb/>
indeed turn up in the collations, but an editor usually does not know this when<lb/>
beginning a project. The editor must proceed on faith.</p>
<p>In the case of these three final sentences, however, we do have variants of<lb/>
consequence. Each of these readings falls at the very end of its novel, and each<lb/>
involves punctuation. These are not minor works; they are important novels,<lb/>
taught in classrooms and interpreted by critics. How these changes came about—<lb/>
from dash to period, period to question-mark, profane word to long dash—these<lb/>
stories can be included in lectures and discussed with students, most of whom<lb/>
probably think that a literary work springs immaculate from its creator’s brow.</p>
<p>With a dash at the end of <hi>This Side of Paradise</hi>, the journey of its hero is<lb/>
just beginning. With a period at the end of <hi>The Sun Also Rises</hi>, the narrator<lb/>
takes a bleak but realistic view of his future. And with the word “shit” at the end of<lb/>
<hi>If I Forget Thee, Jerusalem</hi>, the tall convict’s rejection of women, and of life,<lb/>
is made clear.</p>
