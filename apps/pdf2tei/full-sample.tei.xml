                <div type="section">
                    <head type="sub"><hi rend="smallcaps">DURING</hi> A FORTY&#x002D;YEAR PERIOD,
                        FROM <date>1966</date> THROUGH <date>2006</date>,<lb />I published a series
                        of essays covering every aspect of de&#x002D;<lb />scriptive bibliography.
                        Taken together, these essays form<lb />a comprehensive treatise on the
                        subject. Although this con&#x002D;<lb />solidated work significantly revises <name
                            type="pname">Fredson Bowers's</name>
<hi rend="italic">Principles of
                        Biblio&#x002D;<lb />graphical Description</hi> (<date>1949</date>) and
                        stands on its own, I regard it not simply as<lb />a replacement for the <hi
                            rend="italic">Principles</hi> but as a companion piece to that book.<lb />After
                        all, a classic can never be entirely superseded, and the <hi rend="italic">
                        Principles</hi><lb />will always be worth reading for many specific passages
                        and for the at&#x002D;<lb />titude it displays: every detail is a reflection
                        of the view that descriptive<lb />bibliography is a form of historical
                        scholarship. No one can come away<lb />from the book without understanding
                        that descriptive bibliography is not<lb />just a guide to the identification
                        of first editions (though it serves that<lb />purpose) but is rather a
                        history of the production and publication of the<lb />books taken up and
                        thus a contribution to the broader annals of printing<lb />and publishing.</head>
                    <p>Nevertheless, any work from as long ago as <date>1949</date> is likely to
                        require<lb />some adjustments, and my essays provide a rethinking and
                        redefinition of<lb />some basic concepts, particularly <hi rend="italic">ideal
                        copy, issue, state</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">format.</hi> I have<lb />also
                        proposed a simpler and more logical system for noting inserted leaves<lb />in
                        collation formulas and have offered more detailed suggestions for de&#x002D;<lb />scribing
                        paper, type, non&#x002D;letterpress material, and publishers' bindings.<lb />Two
                        matters barely commented on by Bowers are given extensive discus&#x002D;<lb />sion
                        in two of my essays: the incorporation of the results of bibliographical<lb />analysis
                        (that is, analysis of typesetting and presswork) into a descriptive<lb />bibliography,
                        and the considerations involved in the overall organization<lb />of a
                        bibliography (along with the numbering of its entries and the record&#x002D;<lb />ing
                        of copies examined). I have tried throughout to express, more fully<lb />than
                        he did, the rationale lying behind the inclusion of every element in<lb />a
                        description and the manner of presenting such features. (My detailed<lb />criticisms
                        of certain proposals, both by him and by others, are meant to<lb />illustrate
                        these rationales in practice.)</p>
                    <pb n="2" />
                    <p>Another important difference between <name type="pname">Bowers's</name> and
                        my treatments<lb />is that he segregates his discussions of
                        fifteenth&#x002D;, eighteenth&#x002D;, and<lb />nineteenth&#x002D;/
                        twentieth&#x002D;century books into three separate (and relatively<lb />short)
                        sections, whereas my organization (according to the elements in a<lb />description)
                        reflects the view that basic principles and procedures apply to<lb />all
                        periods, regardless of the changing book&#x002D;production details that have<lb />to
                        be reported. His emphasis on sixteenth&#x002D; and
                        seventeenth&#x002D;century books<lb />emerged from his own experience at the
                        time (he later became thoroughly<lb />acquainted with eighteenth&#x002D; and
                        nineteenth&#x002D;century books), but it leaves<lb />the <hi rend="italic">
                        Principles</hi> somewhat unbalanced. A prominent feature of his work is<lb />the
                        fifty&#x002D;eight&#x002D;page treatment of the formulary notation for
                        recording a<lb />book's structure, which is impressive in the quantity and
                        range of situ&#x002D;<lb />ations that it cites. This full account, however,
                        has caused many people<lb />to think of the collation formula as complex and
                        difficult, and my own<lb />discussion of it emphasizes how very simple it
                        is. (Some books do have a<lb />complex structure, and analyzing it may be
                        difficult; but once that result<lb />has been achieved, constructing the
                        formula to represent it is straight&#x002D;<lb />forward.) Despite the
                        differences between <name type="pname">Bowers's</name> and my guides to the<lb />subject,
                        I hope that mine is like his in showing how descriptive bibliogra&#x002D;<lb />phy
                        is an essential pursuit of scholarship in the humanities.</p>
                    <p>My essays do not call for revision, in the sense that I still believe in<lb />the
                        approach and suggestions expressed in each one. But a considerable<lb />amount
                        of work has been done in this field since most of the essays were<lb />written,
                        and a knowledge of that work would usefully supplement the essays.<lb />Accordingly,
                        I am gathering here some notes on recent activity&#x2014;"recent"<lb />referring,
                        for each topic, to anything published in the years since my essay<lb />on
                        that topic first appeared. These notes are not meant to be comprehensive<lb />surveys
                        but only accounts of the publications that I consider most worth dis&#x002D;<lb />cussing
                        or mentioning. Sometimes I have to disagree with points that have<lb />been
                        made, and at other times I am glad to welcome ideas that are valuable<lb />additions
                        to what I wrote. (Further items through <date>2002</date> can be found in
                        the<lb /><date>2002</date> revision of my <hi rend="italic">Introduction to

                        paperback and on the Rare Book School website.)</p>
                    <p>My notes below are grouped under fourteen headings. First come<lb />five
                        dealing with general matters: introduction to the field and its history<lb />(pp.
                        3&#x2013;11); its relation to library cataloguing (pp. 11&#x2013;14); the
                        concept<lb />of <hi rend="italic">ideal copy</hi> (pp. 15&#x2013;21); the
                        meanings of <hi rend="italic">edition, impression, issue</hi>, and<lb /><hi
                            rend="italic">state</hi> (pp. 21&#x2013;25); and tolerances in reporting
                        details and the necessary<lb />equipment for doing so (pp. 25&#x2013;27).
                        The remaining nine cover more<lb />specific subjects: quasi&#x002D;facsimile
                        transcription of title pages and other text<lb />(pp. 27&#x2013;29);
                        collations of gatherings, pages, non&#x002D;letterpress insertions,<lb />and
                        contents (pp. 29&#x2013;34); formal (pp. 35&#x2013;37); paper (pp.
                        37&#x2013;50; typog&#x002D;<lb />raphy and layout (pp. 50&#x2013;58);
                        typesetting and presswork (pp. 58&#x2013;64); <pb n="3" />
                        non&#x002D;letterpress material (pp. 64&#x2013;69); publishers' bindings,
                        endpapers,<lb />and jackets (pp. 69&#x2013;89: color, pp. 71&#x2013;74;
                        patterns, pp. 75&#x2013;88; jackets,<lb />pp. 88&#x2013;89); and overall
                        arrangement, including the list of examined cop&#x002D;<lb />ies (pp.
                        89&#x2013;93). Although the designation of format often precedes the<lb />collation
                        of gatherings, this order otherwise approximates the sequence<lb />conventionally
                        followed in a description.</p>

                    <p>My general introduction to descriptive bibliography, entitled "A Des&#x002D;<lb />cription
                        of Descriptive Bibliography," was delivered as an Engelhard<lb />Lecture on
                        the Book at the Library of Congress on 13 September <date>1991</date>. It<lb />was
                        published in <date>1992</date> both as a pamphlet in the Viewpoints Series
                        of the<lb />Center for the Book in the Library of Congress and as an article
                        in <hi rend="italic">Studies<lb />in Bibliography</hi> (45: 1&#x2013;30);
                        and it was republished in <date>1998</date> in my <hi rend="italic">
                        Literature<lb />and Artifacts</hi> (pp. 127&#x2013;156). Four years before
                        my lecture, <name type="pname">David L. Vander<lb />Meulen</name> had
                        delivered an impressive Engelhard Lecture, <hi rend="italic">Where Angels
                        Fear<lb />to Tread: Descriptive Bibliography and Alexander Pope</hi>, which,
                        like mine, pro&#x002D;<lb />vides a rationale for the activity of describing
                        books, showing its role as<lb />history and biography, and thus its place in
                        humanistic scholarship. (In<lb /><date>2014</date> I pointed out the classic
                        status of his lecture in an introduction to a<lb />new edition of it.) Since
                        the time of these two lectures, nothing compa&#x002D;<lb />rable has been
                        published, and very few general accounts of any kind have<lb />appeared. The
                        most important is by <name type="pname">Vander Meulen</name> himself,
                        "Thoughts<lb />on the Future of Bibliographical Analysis" (<hi rend="italic">Papers

                        17&#x2013;33); although its emphasis is on analytical<lb />bibliography,
                        analysis and description are inextricable, since the former<lb />must
                        underlie the latter, and Vander Meulen's humanistic approach pro&#x002D;<lb />vides
                        the best kind of grounding. (See also my <hi rend="italic">Bibliographical

                        unsatisfactory. That a descrip&#x002D;<lb />tive bibliography tells the
                        story of a literary career and provides a partial<lb />history of publishing
                        in the period it covers has been widely understood<lb />since <name
                            type="pname">Michael Sadleir's</name> bibliography of Trollope in <date>
                        1928</date>. This observa&#x002D;<lb />tion cannot be made too often,
                        however, and <name type="pname">Suarez</name> effectively conveys<lb />an
                        enthusiasm for descriptive bibliographies and shows how they can be<lb />a
                        "highly addictive" genre for reading. It is regrettable, therefore, that<lb />he
                        begins with slighting comments on collation formulas as "weird" and<lb />uncongenial
                        to humanists who may have trouble with mathematics; and<lb />he says he will
                        not discuss such formulas in his essay. As a result, he leaves<lb />out what
                        is the heart of every description, the detailed report of a book's<lb />physical
                        structure. Although he recognizes how format relates to a book's<lb />"expressive
                        form," he misses the opportunity to draw out the textual and<lb />production
                        implications of collations of gatherings, especially when read<lb />in
                        conjunction with lists of contents and associated pagination. (See
                        be&#x002D;<lb />low under "Collation.") Furthermore, <name type="pname">
                        Suarez's</name> title, with its preposition<lb />"from," is troubling in its
                        suggestion that descriptive bibliographies are not<lb />themselves book
                        history but rather are a source for it. This idea permeates<lb />the essay
                        in repeated expressions such as "what descriptive bibliography<lb />can do
                        for book historians" (p. 201). When he speaks of "bibliographical<lb />information
                        turned into book&#x002D;historical knowledge" (p. 204), he is depict&#x002D;<lb />ing
                        descriptive bibliographies as repositories of facts ("information") that<lb />can
                        become "knowledge" in the narratives that book historians write. Yet<lb />this
                        view is at odds with his emphasis on how one can read bibliographies<lb />as
                        literary and publishing histories. His piece fails to make clear that
                        de&#x002D;<lb />scriptive bibliographies, like all other historical
                        writings, are not mere as&#x002D;<lb />semblages of data but are the shaped
                        products of informed judgment.</p>
                    <p>Several manuals of bibliographical and textual study that include<lb />short
                        treatments of descriptive bibliography have done somewhat bet&#x002D;<lb />ter
                        in explaining the field, but none is entirely satisfying. For example,<lb /><name

                        signature collation, pagination register,<lb />and list of contents; and the
                        discussion of format in the previous chapter<lb />(pp. 119&#x2013;132) is
                        not always clear and includes diagrams that are some&#x002D;<lb />times
                        useless (figure 18) or misleading (figures 24 and 27). <name type="pname">Mark

                    <p>Since the time of my <date>1977</date> essay there has been a great deal of

                        "rare<lb />books," and in <date>1986</date> the Association of College and
                        Research Librar&#x002D;<lb />ies (ACRL) began publishing a journal called <hi

                        on matters taken up in my essay, and three articles can be singled out as<lb />particularly
                        relevant.</p>
                    <p>The first, by <name type="pname">Laura Stalker</name> and <name type="pname">Jackie
                        M. Dooley</name>, is "Descriptive<lb />Cataloging and Rare Books" (7 [<date>
                        1992</date>], 7&#x2013;22), a careful historical ac&#x002D;<lb />count of
                        the thinking involved in the various revisions of the cataloguing<lb />rules
                        that had occurred in the preceding fifteen years. (It also, in footnote<lb />11,
                        credits my essay with the change made in the title of the rules for<lb />special&#x002D;collections
                        cataloguers from "Bibliographic Description" to "De&#x002D;<lb />scriptive
                        Cataloging.") The second article is <name type="pname">Michael Winship's</name>
                        "'What<lb />the Bibliographer Says to the Cataloger'" (7 [<date>1992</date>],
                        98&#x2013;108)&#x2014;part of<lb />a special issue on "Descriptive
                        Cataloging of 19th&#x002D;Century Imprints for<lb />Special Collections,"
                        ed. <name type="pname">Stephen J. Zietz</name>. Winship sensibly points out
                        the<lb />overlappings among traditional branches of bibliography and notes
                        that<lb />library cataloguers' work similarly bridges these divisions; and
                        he prop&#x002D;<lb />erly recognizes that the amount of detail in a
                        catalogue entry is not as<lb />important a consideration as the quality of
                        judgment involved in deciding<lb />what details are the most significant for
                        a given class of material. His aim,<lb />like mine, is "to raise issues that
                        may help to improve the catalog as a tool<lb />for research"; and he
                        believes, as I do, that "our work, both as catalogers<lb />and as
                        bibliographers, would be better if we were to talk to each other<lb />more."
                        The third article I wish to note here is <name type="pname">James P.
                        Ascher's</name> "Pro&#x002D;<lb />gressing toward Bibliography; or: Organic
                        Growth in the Bibliographic<lb />Record" (10 [<date>2009</date>],
                        95&#x2013;110). As his title makes clear, Ascher proposes a<lb />process of
                        "progressive description" (made feasible by the computer), in<lb />which
                        records are continually enhanced as more information turns up, or<lb />certain
                        physical features begin to attract greater interest, or the need for<lb />particular
                        digital links becomes clearer. Implementation of this promising<lb />idea
                        would allow "bibliographical awareness in cataloging" not to be fro&#x002D;<lb />zen
                        at the time of the initial record but to grow along with scholarship.</p>

                        collaboration of the Rare Books and Manuscripts Section of ACRL)<lb />as <hi
                            rend="italic">Descriptive Cataloging of Rare Books</hi> (<date>1991</date>),
                        and a third edition appeared<lb />in <date>2007</date> under the title <hi
                            rend="italic">Descriptive Cataloging of Rare Materials (Books)</hi>
                        &#x2014;one<lb />of a series of manuals for different classes of "rare
                        materials." Although<lb />the <date>2007</date> manual poses somewhat fewer
                        problems (from the point of view <pb n="13" /> of the descriptive
                        bibliographer) than those I identified in my analysis of<lb /><hi
                            rend="italic">AACR</hi>, the same kind of confusion is still present.</p>
                    <p>For example, in the chapter on "Physical Description Area" (pp. 101&#x2013;<lb />118),
                        the first rule for recording "Extent" suggests that the emphasis will be<lb />on
                        "physical description" by focusing on the length of the physical book<lb />rather
                        than that of the verbal work: the rule is to "account for every leaf<lb />&#x2026;
                        including leaves of text, leaves of plates, and blank leaves"; and the<lb />leaves
                        are to be reported by giving "the last numbered page or leaf of<lb />each
                        numbered sequence" in the same style of numbering as that used in<lb />the
                        book itself, with a bracketed arabic total for unnumbered pages, as in<lb />"iii,
                        [1], 88, [2] p." One immediately wonders why this degree of specific&#x002D;<lb />ity
                        is needed if the aim is simply to show "extent"&#x2014;especially since the<lb />system
                        does not fully concentrate on the practice of the book, as shown<lb />not
                        only in this simple example (is p. 1 numbered?) but also in several<lb />other
                        rules, such as this one: "If it is not practical to record all the
                        se&#x002D;<lb />quences (e.g., if they are exceedingly numerous)," then one
                        may "Record<lb />the total number of pages or leaves followed by 'in various
                        pagings' or 'in<lb />various foliations.'" The treatment of blank leaves
                        raises a fundamental<lb />problem: "include in the count blank leaves at the
                        beginning of the first<lb />gathering or at the end of the final gathering
                        when they are present in<lb />a copy in hand or known to be present in other
                        copies." Aside from the<lb />practical question of how often a cataloguer
                        can be expected to undertake<lb />the bibliographical research involved in
                        learning about "other copies,"<lb />there is a basic theoretical question:
                        should not a catalogue entry always<lb />refer to the "copy in hand"? In the
                        section on "Size and format," preci&#x002D;<lb />sion in physical
                        description is again not the focus. One example: "when<lb />the height of
                        the publication differs by 3 centimeters or more from the<lb />height of the
                        binding, specify both." And the brief paragraph on "biblio&#x002D;<lb />graphical
                        format" says to record it for hand&#x002D;press books "whenever the<lb />format
                        can be determined" (and speaks incorrectly of "quarto and octavo<lb />sheets").
                        There is no reason to extend this discussion: enough has been<lb />said to
                        show that the standard approach to "descriptive" cataloguing in<lb />libraries
                        remains internally inconsistent and, for the details selected for<lb />reporting,
                        at odds with the expectations of descriptive bibliography.</p>
                    <p>Shortly after my <date>1977</date> piece appeared, I received a letter from a <name
                            type="pname">Texas</name><lb />librarian complaining that I had not
                        given cataloguers sufficient credit for<lb />dealing with the physical book.
                        But one of her own statements illustrates<lb />the problem I was concerned
                        with: "a monograph cataloger catalogs from<lb />a single copy of a book, but
                        the card in the catalog stands for any num&#x002D;<lb />ber of copies which
                        may be on the shelf." This kind of wavering between<lb />the physical object
                        and the verbal work is what I was criticizing, not the<lb />fact that
                        cataloguers focus on fewer physical details than bibliographers <pb n="14" />
                        do. But it does underlie the considerable debate that has occurred in the<lb />library&#x002D;cataloguing
                        world over whether the emphasis should be on the<lb />work or the
                        "item"&#x2014;a debate that seems unnecessary to bibliographers,<lb />for
                        whom the subject of an entry must obviously be a physical item,<lb />since
                        only through physical items can verbal works and their variants be<lb />apprehended.
                        After the <name type="place">Texas</name> librarian's imprecision, it is a
                        pleasure to<lb />note <name type="pname">Paul Needham's</name> careful
                        distinctions among <hi rend="italic">work, edition</hi>, and <hi
                            rend="italic">copy</hi> in<lb />"Copy Description in Incunable
                        Catalogues," <hi rend="italic">Papers of the Bibliographi&#x002D;<lb />cal
                        Society of America</hi>, 95 (<date>2001</date>), 173&#x2013;239 (especially
                        "General Remarks,"<lb />pp. 203&#x2013;238).</p>
                    <p>This is the place to mention a recent extensive study of "fingerprint&#x002D;<lb />ing,"
                        since in footnote 86 I described and criticized that practice&#x2014;which,<lb />like
                        institutional library cataloguing, involves the concise reporting of a<lb />few
                        selected features of an examined copy. The idea is that a record of<lb />the
                        letters (in words of the text) that appear in specified positions can<lb />serve
                        as a first step in distinguishing one edition from another. But obvi&#x002D;<lb />ously
                        such fingerprints are not very precise indicators, for they cannot<lb />identify
                        impressions, line&#x002D;for&#x002D;line resettings, or resettings of any
                        pages<lb />(or indeed any lines) not sampled. Only a full bibliographical
                        analysis of<lb />multiple copies could result in a shorthand notation that
                        might reliably<lb />distinguish editions (and reveal impressions) in cases
                        where the title&#x002D;page<lb />details are insufficient. Nevertheless, the
                        idea has had a long history, and<lb /><name type="pname">Neil Harris</name>
                        has now provided a thorough historical account and assess&#x002D;<lb />ment

                        cata&#x002D;<lb />loguers, that will be heartily applauded by

                        105&#x2013;112), which holds that "the description of bookcloth grains<lb />ideally
                        ought to become a standard and integral part of catalogue rec&#x002D;<lb />ords"
                        (p. 106) and makes suggestions accordingly (see further below, under<lb />"Patterns"

                    <p>"The Concept of <hi rend="italic">Ideal Copy,"</hi> was published in <hi
                            rend="italic">Studies in Bibliography</hi>,<lb />33 (<date>1980</date>),
                        18&#x2013;53, and was reprinted, in a translation by <name type="pname">Katia
                        Lysy</name>, in<lb /><hi rend="italic">Filologia dei testi a stampa</hi>,
                        ed. <name type="pname">Pasquale Stoppelli</name> (<date>1987</date>), pp.
                        73&#x2013;105. As<lb />I complained there, the phrase "ideal copy" is
                        unfortunate, and I can<lb />only reiterate, even more emphatically, that it
                        should never have been<lb />invented. My essay does not appear to have
                        affected, to any significant<lb />extent, the way the term has been used
                        since <date>1980</date>; and countless bibli&#x002D;<lb />ographies and
                        bibliographical discussions have continued to spread con&#x002D;<lb />fusion
                        by assuming that the concept has something to do with textual<lb />correctness
                        and that any given impression or issue can have only one ideal<lb />copy.
                        The basic point underlying <name type="pname">Fredson Bowers's</name>
                        discussion was simply<lb />that a descriptive bibliography (as opposed to a
                        catalogue of a collection)<lb />should not include in its basic descriptions
                        any features of books that<lb />result from their post&#x002D;publication
                        lives. To put the matter the other way<lb />round, the descriptive
                        bibliographer does record in a basic description<lb />all the forms that
                        were published (as defined in the next paragraph). The<lb />variant forms of
                        an impression (including its stop&#x002D;press alterations) are its<lb />"ideal
                        copies"&#x2014;though they should not be called that. If we were to say<lb />that
                        a description focuses on "copies as published," not on a single "ideal<lb />copy,"
                        most of the problems would go away.</p>
                    <p>Defining what "as published" means is straightforward for books pub&#x002D;<lb />lished
                        in edition&#x002D;bindings (that is, most books from the early nineteenth<lb />century
                        onward, first in boards with labels, meant to be temporary, and<lb />then in
                        cloth): it simply refers to whatever forms the finished product<lb />(printed
                        sheets and insertions plus binding) took&#x2014;even when certain leaves<lb />were
                        expected to be removed (as in <name type="pname">Frances Ann Kemble's</name>
<hi
                            rend="italic">Records of Later</hi><lb /><hi rend="italic">Life</hi> [<date>
                        1882</date>], where the second leaf is headed "Slips for Librarian to paste<lb />on
                        Catalogue Cards"). But for books not published in edition&#x002D;bindings<lb />(including
                        most books before the nineteenth century), the descriptive bib&#x002D;<lb />liographer's
                        focus must be, as I stated in <date>1980</date>, on the structure
                        "specifi&#x002D;<lb />cally called for by the evidence of the sheets." In
                        the former case (books<lb />published in edition&#x002D;bindings), intention
                        plays no role, since the finished<lb />product may not have fully conformed
                        with what the printer or publisher<lb />intended; in the latter (books not
                        published in edition&#x002D;bindings), the ob&#x002D;<lb />ject to be
                        described has to be the sheets (and insertions) in their intended<lb />structure,
                        rather than in whatever arrangements resulted from the work<lb />of the
                        various binders employed by the printers, publishers, or booksellers<lb />(not
                        always different persons) or by the owners of specific copies.</p>
                    <p>The role of intention in these matters can perhaps be clarified by<lb />considering
                        a passage in <name type="pname">David McKitterick's</name>
<hi rend="italic">Print,
                        Manuscript, and the</hi>
<pb n="16" />
<hi rend="italic">Search for Order, <date>
                        1450&#x2013;1830</date></hi> (<date>2003</date>). One of his concerns is to
                        show how the<lb />printing process leads to variability in the printed
                        results, and he there&#x002D;<lb />fore questions the bibliographer's focus
                        on something as seemingly fixed<lb />as an "ideal copy" (pp.
                        136&#x2013;138). Although he speaks of my definition as<lb />"careful," he
                        says that it "cannot embrace one of the fundamental points<lb />about early
                        printed books: that they can remain physically uncompleted<lb />after they
                        have left the printer's or publisher's control." But my definition<lb />does
                        embrace this fact because it refers simply to the forms that "were<lb />released
                        to the public by their producers," however variant or "uncom&#x002D;<lb />pleted"
                        those forms were. Printers, he says, expected and accepted varia&#x002D;<lb />tions
                        among copies, and he thus finds the idea of printers' intentions to be<lb />"unrealistic"
                        (unless defined as "heterogeneous compromises"). Printers,<lb />however,
                        clearly did have intentions: to carry out the publishers' inten&#x002D;<lb />tions
                        (a point discussed further below), if indeed the printers and
                        publish&#x002D;<lb />ers were not the same people. Those intentions were
                        evidenced by clues in<lb />the printed sheets (both as to the expectation of
                        a particular structure and<lb />as to the acceptance of textual variants).
                        Printers and publishers obviously<lb />recognized that they could not
                        control what would happen to those sheets<lb />in the hands of other people;
                        but it does not follow that bibliographers are<lb />being unrealistic when
                        (for the period before publishers' bindings) they<lb />follow the printed
                        marks of intended structure as a way of distinguishing<lb />forms as meant
                        to be published (including, of course, stop&#x002D;press variants)<lb />from
                        forms as modified later. Making this distinction does not deny the<lb />variability
                        among copies or the continuity of the whole process (from<lb />printer to
                        reader).</p>
                    <p>Internal evidence for an intended structure generally takes the form<lb />of
                        signatures, supplemented by lists of contents (including illustrations)<lb />and
                        indications of insertion points on separately printed material. In most<lb />cases
                        what the bibliographer describes differs from the bundles offered<lb />by
                        printers (to publishers, booksellers, binders, or the public) only in the<lb />placement
                        of cancels (whether printed on the text sheets or separately<lb />from them)
                        and plates printed by intaglio processes (or, occasionally, sepa&#x002D;<lb />rately
                        printed letterpress charts or tables). Sometimes, however, there is<lb />another
                        source of evidence: printed instructions to binders. They call for<lb />some
                        comment that I did not provide in <date>1980</date>.</p>
                    <p>The main situations in which such instructions occurred have been<lb />surveyed,
                        with most interesting examples, by <name type="pname">B. J. McMullin</name>
                        in "Print&#x002D;<lb />ers' Instructions to Binders" (<hi rend="italic">Papers
                        of the Bibliographical Society of <name type="place">America</name>,</hi><lb />104
                        [<date>2010</date>], 77&#x2013;104). Besides giving the locations of plates
                        and cancels<lb />(or any other matter to be inserted), these instructions
                        were used when<lb />the sequence of signatures was unclear or complex and
                        when the com&#x002D;<lb />ponents of a volume were distinct units without an
                        obvious order. (In a<lb />supplementary note the same year, on pp.
                        353&#x2013;359, <name type="pname">McMullin</name> gives an <pb n="17" />
                        eighteenth&#x002D;century German example of binding instructions placed
                        along<lb />the edge of a cancellans.) The subject of "ideal copy" naturally
                        comes<lb />up in <name type="pname">McMullin's</name> discussion, and he
                        concludes (pp. 103&#x2013;104) that each<lb />bibliographer must decide
                        whether to describe "the printer's ideal copy"<lb />or "the publisher's
                        ideal copy." This conclusion, however, by separating<lb />the printer's and
                        the publisher's intentions, is at odds with the generally<lb />accepted (and
                        I think correct) view that the entities to be described are<lb />either (a)
                        copies as printed, bound, and published (if in edition&#x002D;bindings)<lb />or
                        (b) copies as intended by the printer and publisher to be formed from<lb />the
                        published materials (if not in edition&#x002D;bindings).</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, his statement is misleading in suggesting that the pos&#x002D;<lb />tulated
                        decision for bibliographers has a wider area of application than<lb />it
                        actually has. If, along with <name type="pname">McMullin</name>, one were to
                        define the printer's<lb />ideal copy as "the collection of leaves that the
                        printer intended to supply<lb />the publisher with (and thence the binder),"
                        there are only two ways this<lb />assemblage of leaves (that is, sheets)
                        would differ from the materials for<lb />the "publisher's ideal copy": (1)
                        in its inclusion of binders' instructions<lb />printed either on an integral
                        leaf that carries no other text (except possibly<lb />a binding label) or on
                        a separate piece of paper; and (2) in its inclusion of<lb />any leaves to be
                        canceled, along with their replacements. (Incidentally, the<lb />last phrase
                        of <name type="pname">McMullin's</name> definition should properly read "to
                        supply the<lb />binders with, sometimes by way of publishers, booksellers,
                        or individual<lb />owners"&#x2014;in order to make clear that more than one
                        binder would have<lb />been involved, and to accommodate the variety of
                        possible sequences,<lb />given the overlapping of the
                        printing/publishing/bookselling functions.)<lb />When binders' instructions
                        are printed on a leaf containing other text<lb />(such as a title page, a
                        table of contents, an errata list, and so forth),<lb />that leaf clearly is
                        part of the copy intended by the printer and publisher<lb />(or
                        printer&#x002D;publisher). But when copies survive with either of the kinds
                        of<lb />leaves mentioned just above (numbered 1 and 2), the bibliographer
                        would<lb />be justified in not including them in a basic description
                        (reporting them<lb />instead in appended notes).</p>
                    <p>In summary it must be said that <name type="pname">McMullin's</name>
                        definition of "printer's<lb />ideal copy" makes the printer's intention more
                        restricted than it clearly<lb />was. Printers (as their instructions to
                        binders show) were looking ahead,<lb />just as much as the
                        publishers/booksellers, to the form that readers were<lb />to receive. In
                        his Foxcroft Lecture of <date>2012</date> (<hi rend="italic">What Readers
                        Should Ignore on<lb />the Printed Page: Communication within the Book Trade</hi>,
                        published in <date>2014</date>),<lb /><name type="pname">McMullin</name> at
                        first recognizes this point: "the ultimate aim of both par&#x002D;<lb />ties
                        [printers and binders]," he says, was "to ensure that the purchaser/<lb />reader
                        obtained what the bibliographer would call an 'ideal' copy" (p. 5).<lb />But
                        near the end, when he asks whether printed instructions to binders<lb />"form
                        part of the ideal copy," he again says that "from the printer's point <pb
                            n="18" /> of view they do, from the bookseller's or reader's they don't"
                        (p. 19). It is<lb />not helpful to use <hi rend="italic">ideal copy</hi> in
                        two ways, especially since the kind of "ideal<lb />copy" that bibliographers
                        are concerned with is the same for printers,<lb />binders, publishers,
                        booksellers, and readers. Binders' instructions thus<lb />pose no challenge
                        to the standard procedure for dealing with books that<lb />were not
                        published in edition&#x002D;bindings.</p>
                    <p>One must remember that, in the period before edition&#x002D;bindings, books<lb />could
                        appear in a kind of publisher's binding, for booksellers can be as&#x002D;<lb />sumed
                        to have offered books in a variety of forms in addition to batches of<lb />sheets&#x2014;that
                        is, in full bindings or in gatherings, sewn or not, and with or<lb />without
                        some form of attached wrappers or boards. This much has long<lb />been
                        recognized in a general way; but the first person to give the mat&#x002D;<lb />ter
                        systematic attention and to search extensively for surviving evidence<lb />
                        is <name type="pname">Nicholas Pickwoad</name>, who publicized his research
                        in a lecture, "Unfin&#x002D;<lb />ished Business," delivered several times
                        in <date>2012&#x2013;15</date>. He has located some<lb />130 examples of
                        what he calls "incomplete" or "unfinished" bindings,<lb />dating from <date>
                        1485</date> though the eighteenth century. These are book blocks<lb />that
                        are sewn in a permanent fashion and sometimes have boards at&#x002D;<lb />tached
                        to them but have not been finished with any covering material<lb />(though
                        they are ready for that operation). Pickwoad distinguishes them<lb />from
                        the "temporary" bindings that were already well known&#x2014;book<lb />blocks
                        with intact deckle edges, inexpensive sewing structures, and simple<lb />wrappers
                        (or cheap boards) meant only to protect the sheets until they<lb />could be
                        given permanent structures and conventional covers. (See Jona&#x002D;<lb />
                        than <name type="pname">E. Hill</name>, "From Provisional to Permanent:
                        Books in Boards, <date>1790&#x2013;<lb />1840</date>," <hi rend="italic">The
                        Library</hi>, 6th ser., 21 [<date>1999</date>], 247&#x2013;273.) Pickwoad
                        suggests the<lb />possibility that these two categories of "binding" may
                        have constituted<lb />standard practice for the initial offerings of books
                        in the hand&#x002D;press pe&#x002D;<lb />riod. <name type="pname">Aaron T.
                        Pratt</name> has also suggested that books of all genres with short<lb />texts
                        (especially quartos with fewer than about 96 pages) were generally<lb />sold
                        in stab&#x002D;stitched form in shops (see "Stab&#x002D;Stitching and the
                        Status of<lb />Early English Playbooks as Literature," <hi rend="italic">The
                        Library</hi>, 7th ser., 16 [<date>2015</date>],<lb />304&#x2013;328).</p>
                    <p>Examples of unfinished or temporary bindings are understandably<lb />difficult
                        to locate, since most were not left in their original state. (Some of<lb />the
                        structural results of the binding process are discussed by Pickwoad in<lb />"Binders'
                        Gatherings," <hi rend="italic">The Library</hi>, 7th ser., 15 [<date>2014</date>],
                        63&#x2013;78.) But when<lb />they can be identified, the makeup of their
                        sheets can be regarded as one<lb />of the forms of ideal copy for the books
                        concerned. However, given their<lb />scarcity (aside from the
                        late&#x002D;eighteenth&#x002D; and early&#x002D;nineteenth&#x002D;century<lb />boards&#x002D;and&#x002D;label
                        instances)&#x2014;as well as the possibility that their makeup<lb />may not
                        differ very often from what the bibliographer would have defined <pb n="19" />
                        as ideal copy in any case&#x2014;the insights resulting from <name
                            type="pname">Pickwoad's</name> and<lb /><name type="pname">Pratt's</name>
                        important research may not affect the collation and contents para&#x002D;<lb />graphs
                        in most bibliographical descriptions (though they may sometimes<lb />cause a
                        paragraph on binding to be added).</p>
                    <p>Understanding these points is all the background one needs in order<lb />to
                        see how pointless most of the discussions of <hi rend="italic">ideal copy</hi>
                        are. But the three<lb />most extensive post&#x002D;<date>1980</date>
                        treatments should perhaps be mentioned. First<lb />is <name type="pname">Rolf
                        E. Du Rietz's</name> "Buyer's Emissions and Ideal Copies" (<hi rend="italic">
                        Text</hi> [Upp&#x002D;<lb />sala], 5.1 [<date>1994</date>], 2&#x2013;38),
                        which focuses on books from the period before<lb />edition&#x002D;binding
                        became standard. In the language of his classification<lb />scheme, "buyer's
                        emissions" are primarily the bound copies whose con&#x002D;<lb />tents were
                        arranged by binders for individual owners. Because "original<lb />emissions"
                        (the forms released by publishers) rarely survive (or can be<lb />identified)
                        from this period, bibliographers must use "buyer's emissions"<lb />as
                        sources for ideal&#x002D;copy descriptions. <name type="pname">Du Rietz</name>
                        apparently believes that<lb />this fact undercuts my idea that <hi
                            rend="italic">ideal copy</hi> does not encompass decisions<lb />made by
                        individual owners or binders. But the precise forms of "buyer's<lb />emissions"
                        are not what bibliographers would describe (except in notes<lb />on examined
                        copies); rather, they would use the evidence available in<lb />those copies
                        in order to determine the order of contents that was intended<lb />by the
                        publisher&#x2014;a pre&#x002D;publication event. (Indeed, even if some
                        "origi&#x002D;<lb />nal emissions" survived, only those in temporary or
                        unfinished bindings<lb />would constitute varieties of ideal copies, and the
                        bibliographer's proce&#x002D;<lb />dure would otherwise remain the same.) <name
                            type="pname">Du Rietz</name> is correct, when try&#x002D;<lb />ing to
                        understand my definition of <hi rend="italic">ideal copy</hi>, to suggest
                        that my phrase<lb />"evidence of the sheets" may involve, among other
                        things, understanding<lb />(in his words) the "generally accepted
                        contemporary conventions"; but<lb />even so his discussion finally blurs the
                        crucial distinction between the<lb />forms of extant copies and the forms to
                        be described in bibliographers'<lb />basic entries. Perhaps the most useful
                        part of his article is his detailed<lb />consideration of the binding up of
                        serials and of works published in parts<lb />or fascicles&#x2014;though he
                        does not make clear that these situations (where<lb />the publisher has two
                        intentions, one or both of which are often fully<lb />carried out by the
                        publisher) are very different from the one that is his<lb />primary concern.</p>
                    <p>The second extended treatment of <hi rend="italic">ideal copy</hi> occurs in <name

                        sixteenth&#x002D;century printer of music. In the 400&#x2013;page<lb />introductory
                        section (which discusses <name type="pname">Petrucci's</name> life and the

                        It begins with the "bibliographical concept," which "exists <pb n="20" /> to

                            rend="italic">ideal copy</hi> is not primarily bibliographical but
                        rather refers<lb />to all the aspects of text and design that the printer
                        felt were essential "to<lb />make people like his books." In a later
                        chapter, "Bibliographical Concepts<lb />and Terminology," the definition of <hi
                            rend="italic">ideal copy</hi> embodies this point: "an<lb />ideal copy
                        represents a book as issued by the printer and publisher, once<lb />they
                        were satisfied that the details of appearance and content were as they<lb />wished
                        to see them" (p. 450). (Their satisfaction, of course, does not mean<lb />that
                        they had noticed everything they would have liked to notice; to bring<lb />about
                        such an ideal copy, at least as far as the text is concerned, would<lb />require
                        a critical edition.) One clue to the printer/publisher's intention is<lb />
                        any in&#x002D;house corrections (stop&#x002D;press, handwritten, or
                        stamped), and thus<lb />those corrections become, for <name type="pname">
                        Boorman</name>, part of <hi rend="italic">ideal copy</hi> (even though,<lb />as
                        he later notes [pp. 448, 449], the direction of some kinds of changes<lb />is
                        not always clear). He recognizes that he is using the term "in a slightly<lb />idiosyncratic
                        manner." What his usage amounts to is an expansion of<lb />the concept to
                        encompass a corrected text in addition to (for books not<lb />in
                        edition&#x002D;bindings) an intended structure. The practical consequence is<lb />simply
                        that a record of in&#x002D;house corrections appears earlier in each
                        de&#x002D;<lb />scription (preceding the listing of contents) than is
                        conventional. But the<lb />basic description does what any description of an
                        ideal copy must do (for<lb />books not in edition&#x002D;bindings): it sets
                        forth the structure that complete<lb />copies should consist of, drawing on
                        the evidence of the surviving cop&#x002D;<lb />ies, all of which may be
                        incomplete or aberrant; and Boorman carefully<lb />supplements it with
                        detailed accounts of the individual copies. Despite<lb />the problem with
                        his concept of <hi rend="italic">ideal copy</hi>, therefore, the
                        descriptions<lb />themselves are admirable.</p>
                    <p>The third discussion is in <name type="pname">Joseph A. Dane's</name>

                        called "'Ideal Copy' vs. 'Ideal Texts': The Application of Biblio&#x002D;<lb />graphical
                        Description to Facsimiles" (pp. 77&#x2013;94). (Dane has commented<lb />on <hi
                            rend="italic">ideal copy</hi> elsewhere, in this book and others, but
                        this chapter is his most<lb />thorough examination of it.) Although his
                        discussion includes a number of<lb />questionable pronouncements, he does
                        show some of the inconsistencies<lb />in <name type="pname">Bowers's</name>
                        treatment of <hi rend="italic">ideal copy</hi> and in comments by <name
                            type="pname">Charlton Hinman</name><lb />and <name type="pname">Michael
                        Warren</name> about their <name type="pname">Shakespeare</name> facsimiles
                        (which bring to&#x002D;<lb />gether pages from different copies). He is
                        properly critical of <name type="pname">Hinman's</name><lb />notion that his
                        facsimile of the First Folio presents "what the printers of<lb />the
                        original edition would themselves have considered an ideal copy" and<lb />of <name
                            type="pname">Warren's</name> belief that his <hi rend="italic">King Lear</hi>
                        shows the text "as the printer might <pb n="21" /> have conceived it
                        ideally." But Dane's criticism could have gone farther:<lb />a "corrected"
                        forme is not necessarily more correct at the points of altera&#x002D;<lb />tion,
                        and in any case a forme (corrected or not) is likely to contain unno&#x002D;<lb />ticed
                        errors that a printer would not "ideally" intend. The concept of <hi
                            rend="italic">ideal<lb />copy</hi> (in either <name type="pname">
                        Bowers's</name> or my formulation) has nothing to do with textual<lb />correctness.
                        Dane recognizes this fact here (as he did not in a passage<lb />of his <date>
                        2003</date> book, <hi rend="italic">The Myth of Print Culture</hi>, where
                        "missing quires" and<lb />"printing errors" are equally to be "filtered out"
                        in describing an ideal<lb />copy [p. 187]). But a greater use of this
                        recognition would have made his<lb />discussion more acute (and considerably
                        more concise). That composite<lb />facsimiles can be regarded as critical
                        editions is an obvious point scarcely<lb />worth extensive comment, though
                        the fact that the editors may think they<lb />have produced ideal copies is
                        of some interest (if irrelevant to the users).<lb />Despite Dane's criticism
                        of some of the ways in which the term <hi rend="italic">ideal copy</hi><lb />has
                        been employed, one leaves his discussion feeling that the usefulness<lb />of
                        the concept has not been clarified.</p>
                    <p>But the concept itself&#x2014;when understood as a way of defining which<lb />features
                        of extant books are to be excluded from descriptions because they<lb />result
                        from the independent actions of individual owners or the vicissi&#x002D;<lb />tudes
                        of time&#x2014;is fundamental to the work of bibliographers.</p>

                    <p>My discussion of the basic classificatory terms in descriptive

                        17&#x2013;66.<lb />I concentrated on <hi rend="italic">issue</hi> and <hi
                            rend="italic">state</hi> because they have been frequently misun&#x002D;<lb />derstood
                        and less consistently employed than <hi rend="italic">edition</hi> and <hi
                            rend="italic">impression</hi>, which<lb />did not seem to require
                        further definition beyond what was generally<lb />recognized. As explained
                        in the first few pages, <hi rend="italic">edition</hi> refers to all copies<lb />resulting
                        primarily (if not always entirely) from a single job of typographi&#x002D;<lb />cal
                        composition; and <hi rend="italic">impression</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">
                        printing</hi>) denotes all copies of an edition<lb />printed in one
                        continuous (even if multi&#x002D;day) operation. (It might be a<lb />good
                        idea for bibliographers to use "exemplars" instead of "copies," since<lb />the
                        latter implies lack of variation.) But no such clear&#x002D;cut distinction
                        be&#x002D;<lb />tween <hi rend="italic">issue</hi> and <hi rend="italic">
                        state</hi> had been (or has been even yet) regularly accepted by<lb />bibliographers,
                        though the two refer to equally discrete situations, which<lb />can be
                        simply stated: an <hi rend="italic">issue</hi> is a group of copies of an
                        impression that<lb />give evidence of forming a consciously planned
                        publishing unit, whereas<lb /><hi rend="italic">state</hi> refers to the
                        kind of correction that does not call attention to itself<lb />as a
                        marketing effort and that can only categorize an individual part of a<lb />book
                        (such as a page or a binding), not a book as a whole (since any given<lb />book
                        may contain mixed states).</p>

                    <p>This formulation was meant as a clarification of the essential

                            type="pname">Bowers's</name> complex definitions,<lb />and it has
                        received some degree of acceptance. The Library of Congress<lb />and the
                        Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL) adopted<lb />my
                        approach for their rare&#x002D;book cataloguing manual (see above, under<lb />"Relation
                        to Library Cataloguing"), in which the headnote to the glossary<lb />says
                        that the definitions of <hi rend="italic">issue</hi> and <hi rend="italic">
                        state</hi> use my wording. The ACRL also<lb />commended my definitions in
                        its <hi rend="italic">Printing and Publishing Evidence: Thesauri<lb />for
                        Use in Rare Book and Special Collections Cataloguing</hi> (<date>1986</date>).
                        Other parts of<lb />the book world, however, still do not employ these
                        definitions consistently.<lb />The introductions to bibliographies continue
                        to display a multiplicity of<lb />variant definitions, and it is common to
                        find <hi rend="italic">state</hi> used to refer to whole<lb />copies of
                        books. Of course, almost any definition, if carefully worded, can<lb />be
                        usable, but confusion is bound to arise when statements from bibliog&#x002D;<lb />raphies
                        are cited without the prefatory definitions.</p>
                    <p>The same kinds of variation in usage also occur in bibliographical<lb />
                        essays. <name type="pname">Rolf E. Du Rietz</name>, for example, in "Buyer's
                        Emissions and Ideal<lb />Copies" (<hi rend="italic">Text</hi> [Uppsala], 5.1
                        [<date>1994</date>], 2&#x2013;38), argues that <hi rend="italic">state</hi>
                        must some&#x002D;<lb />times apply to an entire book, as when a plate or
                        leaf is inserted or deleted<lb />"without any kind of substitution or
                        correction being directly involved"<lb />(p. 10). But the presence or
                        absence of a plate or leaf may affect only<lb />one point in a book, just as
                        much as a stop&#x002D;press alteration or a cancel<lb />does; and when, on
                        occasion, it affects the whole book, as an inserted<lb />dedication might,
                        it would produce an issue. The kind of situation <name type="pname">Du<lb />
                        Rietz</name> postulates provides no reason for blurring the sharp line

                        asserts that "'issue' always means<lb />re&#x002D;setting of a substantial
                        section of text" and that "the terms <hi rend="italic">state, im&#x002D;<lb />pression,

                        rising scale of quantity<lb />of change, but also express an increasingly
                        deliberate involvement of the<lb />printer" (p. 51). However useful these
                        definitions may be for her discus&#x002D;<lb />sion, they are not
                        appropriate for general use.</p>
                    <p>Another nonstandard use of <hi rend="italic">issue</hi> occurs as part of <name
                            type="pname">Stanley Boorman's</name><lb />rethinking of the terms of
                        classification in his <hi rend="italic">Ottaviano Petrucci</hi> (<date>2006</date>
                        ),<lb />pp. 446&#x2013;449. He states, "A single issue comprises all the
                        copies of a book<lb />that were put on sale under the same arrangements." By
                        saying "a book"<lb />(meaning a work) rather than "an edition," he is able
                        to make <hi rend="italic">edition</hi><lb />subordinate to <hi rend="italic">
                        issue</hi> in some situations, as when later resettings with the<lb />same
                        date "were intended to be sold under the same arrangements as the<lb />earlier."
                        Those editions "were, therefore, part of the same issue." The fact<lb />that
                        printing history and publishing history do not necessarily coincide <pb
                            n="23" /> has often been remarked on, and it is at the heart of the
                        problem here. To<lb />make <hi rend="italic">issue</hi> (a publishing term)
                        sometimes subordinate to <hi rend="italic">edition</hi> (a printing<lb />term)
                        and sometimes not can only produce confusion. In this instance,<lb />for
                        example, "arrangements" is not a term that reflects physical evidence:<lb />there
                        is no way to tell from the books themselves whether or not the later<lb />editions
                        were "put on sale under the same arrangements." Bibliographical<lb />classification,
                        by definition, emerges from the evidence within the physi&#x002D;<lb />cal
                        object being classified, and resetting of type must be taken as the most<lb />fundamental
                        level. If one has external evidence for linking two editions<lb />as a
                        publishing effort, one can make a statement to that effect; but <hi
                            rend="italic">issue</hi><lb />must be reserved for one kind of physical
                        change within an edition. (How<lb />extensive a portion of text needs to be
                        reset in order to call the result a<lb />different edition is, as <name
                            type="pname">Boorman</name> recognizes, a separate question, and one<lb />about
                        which opinions may vary; but he unfortunately chooses to call an<lb />individual
                        reset sheet "a second impression of that part of the book.") As<lb />for <hi
                            rend="italic">state</hi>, <name type="pname">Boorman</name> understands
                        that "the concept of a single 'state' for a<lb />whole book is meaningless,"
                        and he admirably explains the reason.</p>

                        Central Review</hi>, 5.1 [Spring <date>1988</date>],<lb />8&#x2013;16), he
                        takes up four "troublesome" kinds of situations, all of which can<lb />in
                        fact be easily handled under my definitions. His first class of examples<lb />involves
                        publishers' casings (bindings) and wrappers: copies of a single<lb />impression
                        put on sale simultaneously in cloth and wrappers, or published<lb />with
                        different series designations or publishers' names on the casings,<lb />or
                        released with either British or American prices on the wrappers, or<lb />made
                        available with different styles (not simply colors) of binding, such<lb />as
                        cloth, half&#x002D;calf, or full leather. The fact that there are no changes
                        to<lb />the sheets in any of these instances should not give one pause (as
                        it does<lb /><name type="pname">Myerson</name>) because all the differences
                        clearly identify copies that belong to<lb />separate marketing units. <name
                            type="pname">Myerson's</name> second class of examples deals with<lb />dust&#x002D;jackets.
                        He cites instances where only a jacket or a box shows that<lb />the copies
                        so housed are part of a series; but such indications are no dif&#x002D;<lb />ferent
                        from those on casings. In connection with a paste&#x002D;over cancel of a<lb />publisher's
                        name on a jacket, <name type="pname">Myerson</name> says, "The label on the
                        jacket spine<lb />represents as clear a decision to <hi rend="italic">issue</hi>
                        the book by another publisher as<lb />would be changing the stamping on the
                        casing or cancelling the title page,<lb />but do we really want to call this
                        an issue of the book?" Why not? His<lb />third category concerns
                        special&#x002D;paper copies, and he is correct to point<lb />out that
                        sometimes such copies constitute an impression, not an issue.<lb />But the
                        fact that at other times they can be issues (as when the trimming<lb />of
                        some copies creates two leaf sizes) is not altered. His final category is <pb
                            n="24" /> signed copies. When a certain number of copies are signed by
                        the author<lb />and marketed as such, it is hard to see how they could be
                        regarded as<lb />anything other than an issue (in contrast to the copies
                        that are signed for<lb />particular bookstores or publication parties).</p>
                    <p><name type="pname">Myerson</name> feels that his examples show how some
                        publication practices<lb />"put a strain on any definition of <hi
                            rend="italic">issue</hi>." Every classification scheme natu&#x002D;<lb />rally
                        has to deal with borderline cases, but they do not "strain" it; rather,<lb />the
                        classification facilitates a course of thinking that makes the particular<lb />situation
                        stand out clearly. <name type="pname">Myerson</name> prefers <name
                            type="pname">Bowers's</name> approach because,<lb />"by restricting <hi
                            rend="italic">issue</hi> to the sheets of a book," he "requires other
                        evidences<lb />of marketing decisions &#x2026;to be verbally described
                        rather than definition&#x002D;<lb />ally categorized." Yet <name
                            type="pname">Myerson</name> recognizes that my system also "allows
                        &#x2026;<lb />descriptive or explanatory notes." Indeed, I have always
                        maintained (and<lb />not only in this essay) that bibliographers should
                        never hesitate to add<lb />discursive explanations in order to make a
                        situation clear, which after all<lb />is the goal. In the end it hardly
                        matters whether one labels a book "first<lb />impression, second issue" or
                        "first impression, binding B," for example,<lb />as long as the significance
                        of either one is explained. Since <name type="pname">Myerson</name>
                        un&#x002D;<lb />derstands that "casings and dust jackets must be considered
                        as part of<lb />the marketing process," it is odd that he favors an approach
                        "restricting<lb /><hi rend="italic">issue</hi> to the sheets of a book"
                        simply because it "requires" an attached ac&#x002D;<lb />count of the other
                        parts of a book that provide evidence about marketing.<lb />(Four years
                        earlier he had held a different view, allowing casings to deter&#x002D;<lb />mine
                        issues, in a review in <hi rend="italic">Papers of the Bibliographical
                        Society of America</hi>, 78<lb />[<date>1984</date>], 48.) He is thus
                        sacrificing the coherence of the concept of <hi rend="italic">issue</hi> to<lb />a
                        presumed advantage in presentation; but any label may at times benefit<lb />from
                        an explanation, and the label itself should encompass the whole<lb />range
                        of relevant possibilities. (<name type="pname">Matthew J. Bruccoli</name>,
                        in his "Editorial"<lb />for the <hi rend="italic">Dictionary of Literary

                        285&#x2013;286,<lb />also fails to think through the concept when he asserts
                        that <hi rend="italic">issue</hi> cannot<lb />relate to bindings because
                        "bindings have no connection with text" and<lb />claims that the
                        "description of a book and its dust jacket are independent<lb />of each
                        other.")</p>

                        argued that <hi rend="italic">issue</hi>, which in the <hi rend="italic">
                        Principles</hi> seems to be largely re&#x002D;<lb />stricted to reissue,
                        should be expanded to include distinct "planned units"<lb />that were
                        published simultaneously, such as copies with different booksell&#x002D;<lb />ers'
                        imprints or copies printed on different qualities of paper (sometimes<lb />labeled
                        with printed paper&#x002D;quality marks on the first pages of gatherings).<lb />(He
                        also referred in passing to <hi rend="italic">states</hi> being formed by
                        "corrections.") This<lb />recognition of simultaneous issues coincides with
                        a point I had made in<lb />my <date>1975</date> essay (though I explicitly
                        enlarged the concept to cover publish&#x002D; <pb n="25" /> ers' bindings as
                        well). That so thoughtful a bibliographer as <name type="pname">McMullin</name><lb />came
                        independently to the same conclusions confirms the suitability of<lb />the
                        definitions I have proposed and continue to advocate. Some years<lb />later <name
                            type="pname">McMullin</name> reinforced his view when he studied the
                        phenomenon of<lb />books in colonial series being converted (or converted
                        back) to domestic<lb />issues: he advocated a fuller description of the
                        paper, leaf dimensions, and<lb />bindings of such books as an aid to
                        identification when there are no ver&#x002D;<lb />bal changes
                        ("Domestic&#x2014;Colonial&#x2014;Domestic," <hi rend="italic">Biblionews

                    <p>The implications of my definitions for the arrangement (and thus the<lb />entry
                        numbering) of a bibliography, as well as for the uses of the impor&#x002D;<lb />tant
                        concept of <hi rend="italic">subedition</hi> (and its relation to
                        geography), all of which are<lb />taken up in section IV of the <date>1975</date>
                        essay, were further discussed in <date>1984</date><lb />in my essay on
                        "Arrangement" (see below). In that later discussion, I also<lb />explained
                        why I think the concept of <hi rend="italic">subedition</hi> is preferable
                        to that of <hi rend="italic">plat&#x002D;<lb />ing</hi> (proposed by <name
                            type="pname">James L. W. West III</name>) as a classification between <hi
                            rend="italic">edition</hi><lb />and <hi rend="italic">impression.</hi>
                        And the brief treatment of <hi rend="italic">ideal copy</hi> in <date>1975</date>,
                        which serves<lb />its purpose in that context (but which does not explore
                        the problems pres&#x002D;<lb />ent in <name type="pname">Bowers's</name>
                        handling of the concept), was greatly expanded five years<lb />later in my
                        essay on that subject (see above). In the end, despite various<lb />complications
                        that may arise in certain instances, it is important to keep in<lb />mind
                        the essential simplicity and distinctness of the concepts underlying<lb />the
                        four basic terms of classification.</p>

                        42&#x2013;56), I attempted to provide a rationale for<lb />thinking about
                        the degree of accuracy and the quantity of detail appro&#x002D;<lb />priate
                        for descriptive bibliographies. These two basic matters required<lb />discussion
                        because not many bibliographers had given them systematic<lb />thought, and
                        bibliographers still need to be reminded of their importance.<lb />The
                        number of details covered in a given bibliography can obviously be<lb />seen
                        by examining the bibliography, whether or not the bibliographer<lb />has
                        thought coherently about the relative proportions of detail devoted to<lb />each
                        described feature. (The question of "degressive" bibliography&#x2014;that<lb />is,
                        the practice of reducing the quantity of detail for certain categories of<lb />material&#x2014;which
                        is mentioned in note 1, is discussed more fully in my<lb /><date>1984</date>
                        essay "The Arrangement of Descriptive Bibliographies" [see "Ar&#x002D;<lb />rangement"
                        below].) In contrast, the degree of accuracy in measurements<lb />cannot be
                        known unless it is indicated in an introduction. Including some<lb />statement
                        like "measurements are made to the nearest sixteenth of an <pb n="26" />
                        inch" is an obvious (and undemanding) requirement. Yet in the decades<lb />since
                        I wrote this piece, very few bibliographers have regarded such a<lb />statement
                        as a necessity. Among those few are <name type="pname">David L. Vander
                        Meulen</name>,<lb />in his bibliography of Pope's <hi rend="italic">Dunciad</hi>

                        (<date>2012</date>). But in most bibliographies, one<lb />still looks in
                        vain for an indication of tolerances.</p>
                    <p>A topic that naturally came up in my essay was what system of mea&#x002D;<lb />surement
                        to use, and I stated that the bibliographer who employs the<lb />metric
                        system would be "clearly on the side of the future." In the nearly<lb />half&#x002D;century
                        that has elapsed since then, the United States government<lb />seems to have
                        lost whatever interest it once had in joining most of the rest<lb />of the
                        world in officially adopting the metric system for general purposes.<lb />(The
                        story has been told in <name type="pname">John Bemelmans Marciano's</name>
<date>
                        2014</date> book, <hi rend="italic">What</hi>&#x002D;<lb /><hi rend="italic">ever
                        Happened to the Metric System?: How <name type="place">America</name> Kept
                        Its Feet.</hi>) So one reason<lb />for bibliographers to use it has
                        apparently vanished (though a candidate<lb />for the <date>2016</date>
                        American presidential election brought the matter up). In<lb />any case,
                        there is no question about the metric system's greater logic, and<lb />most
                        people, I believe, find it more convenient to work with. If one wishes,<lb />or
                        needs, to go beyond the nearest millimeter, it is easy for the eye to
                        de&#x002D;<lb />tect quarters or thirds of millimeters. My suggestion in
                        this essay of using<lb />thirds of millimeters for measuring type faces was
                        endorsed by <name type="pname">Vander</name><lb /><name type="pname">Meulen</name>
                        in his <hi rend="italic">Dunciad</hi> bibliography (<date>1981</date>
                        dissertation). A simple solution<lb />to the quandary of what system to use
                        would be for bibliographers to<lb />report figures in both systems (to
                        accommodate users all over the world),<lb />placing one figure in
                        parentheses following the other one. If one works<lb />in the metric system,
                        one can simply divide the number of millimeters by<lb />25.4 (or the number
                        of centimeters by 2.54) to obtain the figure in inches;<lb />or if one works
                        in inches, one can multiply by 25.4 (for millimeters) or 2.54 (for
                        centimeters).</p>
                    <p>Perhaps this is the place to say that bibliographical description does<lb />not
                        require the use of elaborate equipment<lb />mainly just a ruler, a
                        mag&#x002D;<lb />nifying glass, and a micrometer), as <name type="pname">Vander

                        to such aids. My approach was<lb />distinctly low&#x002D;tech, but with
                        tools that not enough bibliographers have learned to<lb />use well: a clear
                        plastic ruler; a magnifying glass, with which I got a free dictionary; <pb
                            n="27" /> later, a wallet&#x002D;size Fresnel lens [flat magnifier],
                        which has served me as well as the<lb />glass; a loupe with a printed scale
                        for measuring type size; a small flashlight; and a<lb />micrometer for
                        recording paper thickness.</p>
                    <p>One might also mention outside calipers, for measuring paper thick&#x002D;<lb />ness
                        or bulk at the center, and the Arthur Seibert Emoskop, for greater<lb />magnification.

                    <p>In my <date>1968</date> essay I briefly discussed title&#x002D;page
                        transcription, type mea&#x002D;<lb />surement and identification, and color
                        specification to illustrate the idea<lb />of levels, and I referred to the
                        description of paper and of publishers'<lb />cloth. Two of these topics
                        (type and color) I had previously treated at<lb />greater length in separate
                        essays, and the others I took up in later essays,<lb />all of which are
                        cited below. A system of alternative levels, within which<lb />one can
                        select an appropriate degree of accuracy and quantity of detail,<lb />is
                        important for helping one to maintain equable proportions throughout<lb />all
                        the parts of a description&#x2014;which in turn reflects an understanding of<lb />a
                        description as a piece of historical writing.</p>

                        title&#x002D;page transcriptions are not superseded by photographic
                        repro&#x002D;<lb />ductions and indeed why quasi&#x002D;facsimile
                        transcription is a form of quoting<lb />that is appropriate for dealing with
                        other parts of books besides title pages,<lb />whether or not they also
                        happen to be reproduced. Quasi&#x002D;facsimile tran&#x002D;<lb />scription
                        differs only slightly in any case from ordinary quoting (primarily<lb />by
                        noting line&#x002D;ends), and it can helpfully be employed, for example, in<lb />quoting
                        copyright notices, printers' imprints, and section&#x002D; or
                        head&#x002D;titles <pb n="28" /> in the paragraph that lists the contents of
                        the book being described. It<lb />not only gives more information than
                        ordinary quoting about the physical<lb />presentation of the text but also
                        can promote the discovery of variants by<lb />providing more text for
                        comparison. <name type="pname">Bowers's</name> treatment of the contents<lb />paragraph&#x2014;which

                        general view that different levels of detail are appropriate on
                        differ&#x002D;<lb />ent occasions (see "Tolerances" above). Nevertheless, my <date>
                        1985</date> comments<lb />show why quasi&#x002D;facsimile quoting is
                        strongly to be preferred.</p>
                    <p>The point about the complementary relationship between transcrip&#x002D;<lb />tions
                        and photographs applies of course to any form of reproduction, and<lb />therefore
                        it can now be extended to digital images (regardless of their<lb />quality
                        or the fact that they can easily be magnified). My <date>1985</date> piece
                        al&#x002D;<lb />luded briefly to the limitations of all reproductions, and
                        four years later<lb />I published a detailed examination of this matter in
                        "Reproductions and<lb />Scholarship" (<hi rend="italic">Studies in
                        Bibliography</hi>, 52 [<date>1989</date>], 25&#x2013;54).</p>

                        and <name type="place">New Zealand</name> Bulletin</hi>, 23:<lb />78&#x2013;106),
                        made a useful suggestion (pp. 85&#x2013;86) regarding the printing<lb />of
                        quasi&#x002D;facsimile transcriptions of title pages: that they not be set
                        with<lb />justified right margins, so that no line&#x002D;end hyphens would
                        intrude into<lb />the transcription. Indeed, one could extend it
                        further&#x2014;to any quota&#x002D;<lb />tion, whether in
                        quasi&#x002D;facsimile or not. (To say this is to raise the whole<lb />question
                        of line&#x002D;end hyphens, for the point applies to the bibliographer's<lb />own
                        prose as well as quotations from the books being described. In many<lb />scholarly
                        editions, there is a list of those line&#x002D;end hyphens in the edited<lb />text
                        that should be retained in quotations; but it is not realistic to expect<lb />that
                        this practice might ever be extended to all books, though it would<lb />be
                        logical to do so.)</p>
                    <p>One other refinement in quasi&#x002D;facsimile transcriptions should be
                        re&#x002D;<lb />ported here, since my reference to it in my <date>1985</date>
                        essay could well be over&#x002D;<lb />looked (at the end of note 26): <name

                        dissertation), of citing the type&#x002D;face measure&#x002D;<lb />ments of
                        the type faces used on each title page. Measuring to the nearest<lb />third
                        of a millimeter, he reports full height (with ascenders and descend&#x002D;<lb />ers),
                        capital height, and x&#x002D;height, placing whichever measurements apply<lb />to
                        a given line in brackets at the end of the line. When more than one<lb />apply,
                        they are given in the above order, without further labeling; and<lb />when
                        the same measurements apply to more than one consecutive line,<lb />the
                        report comes at the end of those lines. This approach can obviously<lb />be
                        extended to any other instances of quasi&#x002D;facsimile transcription that<lb />involve
                        typographic layout not covered in the paragraph on typography<lb />(where

                    </head>
                    <p>In the second part of my <date>1985</date> essay on transcription and
                        collation (see<lb />above), I pointed out the importance of a record of
                        gatherings (whether<lb />signed or not) for books of all periods, since the
                        physical structure of a<lb />book is the most fundamental aspect of its
                        description. I have frequently<lb />used the term "signature collation" only
                        because it is a conventional one,<lb />even though what the collation
                        formula deals with is gatherings, not sig&#x002D;<lb />natures, as I said in
                        note 63. (A true signature collation would be a com&#x002D;<lb />plete
                        register of signing&#x2014;a fuller one than the kind that has typically<lb />followed
                        the formula in the past.) The synecdochic use of "signature" to<lb />mean
                        "gathering" is common among printers but is not (and should not<lb />be)
                        among bibliographers, despite their tolerance of this phrase. Clearly<lb />a
                        book without printed signatures still has a structure, and a formula<lb />representing
                        its structure can still be constructed by assigning consecutive<lb />numbers
                        to the gatherings. Sometimes, indeed, there are printed signa&#x002D;<lb />tures
                        that are not related to the actual gatherings; and if there are no<lb />other
                        printed signatures that do relate to them, the formula would again<lb />have
                        to be made from assigned numbers. (There are also instances where<lb />more
                        than one set of printed signatures are present, and if one of them<lb />corresponds
                        to the actual gatherings, it would of course be used.) A note<lb />should
                        then be appended referring to the irrelevant printed signatures<lb />(irrelevant
                        for this purpose). These points probably go without saying<lb />(and I did
                        not mention them in <date>1985</date>), but they may be worth noting
                        ex&#x002D;<lb />plicitly since some attention has recently been given to the
                        phenomenon<lb />of unused signatures by <name type="pname">B.J. McMullin</name>,
                        in "Gatherings and Signatures in<lb />Conflict" (<hi rend="italic">Script
                        &amp; Print</hi>, 39 [<date>2015</date>], 241&#x2013;247)&#x2014;though <name
                            type="pname">McMullin</name> is not<lb />here concerned with the
                        collation formula. (For the bibliographical uses<lb />of these signatures,
                        see under "Typesetting and Presswork" below.)</p>
                    <p>Also in the <date>1985</date> essay I made a suggestion to correct the only
                        seri&#x002D;<lb />ous flaw in <name type="pname">Bowers's</name> thorough
                        treatment of the collation formulary: his<lb />handling of insertions, where
                        he complicated matters unnecessarily by<lb />attempting to report the
                        signing of insertions along with their placement.<lb />My suggestion was
                        simply to assign the number "1" to any inserted leaf<lb />and to number
                        consecutively the inserted multiple leaves at any given<lb />point (using
                        the conventional comma to indicate disjunct leaves and pe&#x002D;<lb />riod
                        for conjugate leaves). (The signing of inserted leaves would then be<lb />noted
                        as part of the regular statement of signing.) This approach has been<lb />well
                        received, as is indicated, for example, by <name type="pname">B. J.
                        McMullin's</name> approval <pb n="30" /> in the <hi rend="italic">Bibliographical
                        Society of <name type="place">Australia</name> and <name type="place">New
                        Zealand</name> Bulletin</hi>, 15 (<date>1991</date>),<lb />58. As a way of
                        testing the system, he asked how one would note "an in&#x002D;<lb />sertion
                        consisting of an odd number of leaves where the one disjunct leaf<lb />is
                        found in the middle." My answer, eight years later in the same journal<lb />(p.
                        108), was "1.5, 2.4, 3."</p>
                    <p>Another matter relating to insertions: in note 52, I stated that an<lb />insertion
                        of letterpress text between gatherings should be treated as an<lb />independent
                        element and not be associated with the preceding or fol&#x002D;<lb />lowing
                        gathering; but I added (based on <name type="pname">Bowers</name>), "except
                        when the link<lb />is definitely established, as with the same signature." I
                        think it would be<lb />better to say that a signature is normally the only
                        acceptable link, since<lb />other links would be likely to involve excessive
                        reliance on intellectual<lb />content, and the formula is not primarily
                        concerned with content but with<lb />structure. This is not to say that
                        content and structure are unrelated, for<lb />often one does learn something
                        about the content from the structure (see<lb />below); and the content may
                        be a help in deciding what belongs in the<lb />formula (see the next
                        paragraph) and may even sometimes be the only<lb />way (in books not
                        published in bindings) of determining the correct order<lb />of the
                        gatherings. But the job of the collation formula is to record the<lb />structure
                        of the "sheets," which are usually defined for this purpose as<lb />the
                        folded letterpress gatherings plus any insertions (normally letterpress)<lb />that
                        contain part of the continuous text. Thus non&#x002D;letterpress insertions,<lb />which
                        can be structurally identical to letterpress insertions, are not nor&#x002D;<lb />mally
                        included in the collation formula but instead are recorded in a<lb />separate
                        line (see "Non&#x002D;Letterpress Material" below). By separating the<lb />letterpress
                        sheets from engraved (or lithographed) insertions, the bibliog&#x002D;<lb />rapher
                        is further clarifying a book's structure.</p>
                    <p>Although distinguishing letterpress from non&#x002D;letterpress is normally<lb />clear&#x002D;cut,
                        there are situations that call for the bibliographer's judgment<lb />in
                        deciding which insertions belong in the basic formula. Because I did<lb />not
                        comment on this matter in <date>1985</date>, and because <name type="pname">
                        Bowers's</name> discussion of<lb />it (<hi rend="italic">Principles</hi>,
                        pp. 287&#x2013;289) is unclear, I shall say a word about it here. To<lb />begin
                        with, there can be insertions that contain both letterpress and non&#x002D;<lb />letterpress,
                        and in these cases one could take the nature of the letterpress<lb />into
                        account. If it is a caption for, or commentary on, the
                        non&#x002D;letterpress<lb />part, one could treat the insertion like any
                        other non&#x002D;letterpress insertion<lb />and list it separately from the
                        formula. But if the insertion includes some<lb />letterpress text that
                        connects with the adjacent text on the integral leaves,<lb />it could
                        appropriately be treated as an element in the formula. (It would<lb />be no
                        different from an integral leaf that contains both letterpress and an<lb />engraving,
                        in instances where a sheet of letterpress was subsequently run<lb />through
                        a rolling press.) Similarly, in the case of a wholly letterpress
                        inser&#x002D;<lb />tion that was clearly a separate production (and possibly
                        of a different for&#x002D; <pb n="31" /> mat), such as a chart or a table,
                        one might well decide that its inclusion in<lb />the formula would not be in
                        line with the function of the formula, despite<lb />the fact that it is
                        letterpress. The presence of pagination on any insertion<lb />is not enough
                        to settle the matter, even though the resulting pagination<lb />record would
                        sometimes show a gap that is in fact filled by information<lb />in the
                        collation line for insertions. This approach seems sensible, but a<lb />fixed
                        rule would probably be less satisfactory in some instances than reli&#x002D;<lb />ance
                        on the bibliographer's judgment. What is finally most important is<lb />that
                        the bibliographer make absolutely clear, in an appended comment,<lb />what
                        the situation is.</p>
                    <p>The question whether there can ever be odd superscript numbers in<lb />a
                        collation formula continues to come up, even though it is hard to see<lb />how
                        the answer can be anything but an unequivocal "no" (see footnote 38<lb />in
                        my essay). If the function of the formula is to show book structure (as<lb />it
                        unquestionably is), then an odd superscript does not serve the purpose<lb />because
                        it does not show the placement of the disjunct leaf. Yet even so<lb />careful
                        a bibliographer as <name type="pname">J. D. Fleeman</name> sometimes uses
                        odd superscripts<lb />in his great <name type="pname">
                            <hi rend="italic">Samuel Johnson</hi>
                        </name> (<date>
                        2000</date>). The best case for odd superscripts in<lb />certain situations
                        has been made by <name type="pname">B. J. McMullin</name> in "The
                        Description<lb />of Volumes Gathered in Nines" (<hi rend="italic">Script
                        &amp; Print</hi>, 37 [<date>2013</date>], 32&#x2013;39). The<lb />situation
                        arises mainly when an eighteenmo forme is imposed for gather&#x002D;<lb />ing
                        in nines rather than sixes&#x2014;an arrangement that does occur in rare<lb />instances,
                        especially in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.<lb /><name
                            type="pname">McMullin</name> argues that an insertion planned as a
                        regular part of a volume<lb />should be treated differently from leaves
                        inserted occasionally to rectify<lb />a problem (which he calls "genuine"
                        insertions); he also believes, since<lb />the inserted fifth leaf is often
                        signed with a "5", that it would be unwise<lb />to treat the leaf following
                        it as the regular fifth leaf in the gathering sim&#x002D;<lb />ply because
                        it is conjugate with the fourth leaf. His recommendation,<lb />therefore,
                        leads to a formula on this model: "A&#x002D;F<hi rend="sup">9</hi> ($5
                        inserted after $4)."<lb />I do not, however, find this argument persuasive.
                        The fact that the fifth<lb />leaf of every gathering is a singleton (and was
                        planned to be so) does not<lb />make the structural situation any different
                        from the one that exists for all<lb />insertions; and it would seem to be
                        productive of confusion to say that a<lb />planned insertion after $4 should
                        be called $5 (with the following leaf $6),<lb />whereas an unplanned one
                        should be called $4+1 (with the following leaf<lb />$5). I believe the best
                        approach for an eighteenmo in nines is to say "A&#x002D;F<hi rend="sup">8</hi><lb />($4+1)."
                        (The actual signing would of course be recorded separately.) In<lb />this
                        way the clarity and uniformity of the formulary does not have to be<lb />diluted,
                        without any compensating advantages.</p>
                    <p>An interesting problem for the construction of a formula arises in
                        con&#x002D;<lb />nection with Renaissance music partbooks, all of which for
                        a given title<lb />were sold together as a unit, though each had its own
                        title page and may <pb n="32" /> or may not have had a separate alphabet of
                        signatures. <name type="pname">Stanley Boorman</name><lb />thoroughly
                        investigated this matter in "Bibliographical Aspects of Ital&#x002D;<lb />ian
                        Printed Music of the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries" (<hi rend="italic">
                        Studies<lb />in Bibliography</hi>, 56 [<date>2003&#x2013;04</date>],
                        195&#x2013;242). His sensible solution is to use<lb />a bracketed letter and
                        colon preceding the sequence of signatures for<lb />each part, thus
                        producing a single formula for the whole series of parts<lb />but allowing
                        the individual parts to be easily identified. A formula might<lb />begin
                        "[C:] A&#x002D;D<hi rend="sup">4</hi>; [T:] E&#x002D; H<hi rend="sup">4</hi>
                        &#x2026;" (with "C" and "T" referring to "canto"<lb />and "tenor"). When the
                        parts are signed with separate alphabets, the<lb />order of parts would
                        remain the same (for it was a conventional order):<lb />"[C:] A&#x002D;D<hi
                            rend="sup">4</hi>; [T:] A&#x002D;D<hi rend="sup">4</hi> &#x2026;" (the
                        bracketed letters allowing one to distin&#x002D;<lb />guish the identically
                        signed gatherings without the use of prefixed index<lb />figures, which
                        would not be unambiguous since the order of the parts is<lb />not
                        self&#x002D;evident). <name type="pname">Boorman's</name> article gives 92
                        examples of his system in use,<lb /> and he employed it in his bibliography
                        of <name type="pname">Ottaviano Petrucci</name> (<date>2006</date>). His<lb />work
                        illustrates how the standard formulary can be imaginatively adapted<lb />to
                        different situations.</p>
                    <p>Another example is <name type="pname">Anthony S. Drennan's</name> suggestion
                        for handling<lb />volvelles (woodcut diagrams with attached circular paper
                        disks that the<lb />reader can rotate), in "The Bibliographical Description
                        of Astronomical<lb />Volvelles and Other Moveable Diagrams" (<hi
                            rend="italic">The Library</hi>, 7th ser., 13 [<date>2012</date>],<lb />316&#x2013;339).
                        The movable parts of a volvelle were printed on a separate<lb />leaf from
                        the base diagram and were meant to be cut out and attached<lb />to the page
                        where the base diagram was located. Uncut leaves printed<lb />with volvelle
                        parts rarely survive, and generally they have no obvious lo&#x002D;<lb />cation
                        in a collation formula; but <name type="pname">Drennan</name> feels that the
                        formula should<lb />somehow note the fact that such leaves were once present
                        (even though<lb />they were not intended to be part of the structure of the
                        book after it was<lb />bound). One might see an analogy between an uncut
                        volvelle leaf and a<lb />cancellans, since both were meant to be removed and
                        relocated; the im&#x002D;<lb />portant difference, of course, is that the
                        cancellans replaced another leaf,<lb />whereas the cut&#x002D;out volvelle
                        parts were attached to another leaf. <name type="pname">Dren&#x002D;<lb />
                        nan</name> understands that it would be unwise to try to account for the
                        added<lb />pieces in the formula, and he properly recommends listing the
                        completed<lb />volvelles separately. (For this purpose he has created an
                        elaborate set of<lb />symbols for constructing a "collation formula" for
                        each volvelle, showing<lb />its completed structure, and he appends
                        additional commentary in words;<lb />some bibliographers may choose to avoid
                        the formula and place the whole<lb />account in words.) The question is how
                        to indicate in the letterpress col&#x002D;<lb />lation formula that one or
                        more uncut volvelle leaves originally accom&#x002D;<lb />panied the unbound
                        sheets. <name type="pname">Drennan</name> chooses the Greek letter lambda,<lb />which
                        he places at the end of the collation, along with an indication of the <pb
                            n="33" /> number of leaves involved or, when the number is unknown, a
                        superscript<lb />zero. (The choice of lambda is unfortunate, since <name
                            type="pname">Allan Stevenson</name> used<lb />it to signify a
                        letterpress leaf that was meant to be inserted to accompany<lb />an engraved
                        plate.) In cases where leaves with uncut volvelle parts were<lb />printed as
                        part of the main block of letterpress sheets, the use of lambda<lb />(or
                        some symbol) to explain certain cancellations may be helpful, as in "B<hi
                            rend="sup">4</hi><lb />(&#x2212; B4 &#x003D; &#x03BB;1)." But simply
                        attaching "&#x03BB;1" or "&#x03BB;<hi rend="sup">0</hi>" to the end of a
                        formula<lb />may not serve much purpose, since the record of completed
                        volvelles (and<lb />their locations) makes clear that the book is one that
                        incorporates cut&#x002D;out<lb />pieces. Still, it takes up little space and
                        is worth considering.</p>
                    <p>A less successful way of dealing with volvelles is <name type="pname">Mark
                        Bland's</name> proposal<lb />(in <hi rend="italic">A Guide to Early Printed
                        Books and Manuscripts</hi>, <date>2010</date>) to use the Greek<lb />letter
                        rho to indicate paper that is attached to a printed page and thus<lb />to
                        create such an impossible expression as "P4<hi rend="sup">r</hi> +
                        &#x03C1;1" (p. 64). He also<lb />misuses chi to refer to inserted
                        engravings, even though the practice of<lb />treating engraved and
                        letterpress material separately is by now well estab&#x002D;<lb />lished
                        (see above). A similarly unwise suggestion (again involving attach&#x002D;<lb />ments)
                        is <name type="pname">Patrick Spedding's</name> idea that a full&#x002D;page
                        paste&#x002D;over cancel might<lb />be recorded in the formula with
                        reference only to one side of the leaf, as<lb />in "(A1<hi rend="sup">v</hi>
                        + &#x03C7;1<hi rend="sup">v</hi>)", as if a leaf can be split between its
                        recto and verso sides.<lb />But the size of a paste&#x002D;over cancel is
                        irrelevant: any patches (regardless<lb />of their size) affixed to leaves
                        (or meant to be) should not be included in<lb />the collation formula but
                        rather noted in a separate explanation. (See<lb /><name type="pname">

                        includes the signature "J" and<lb />then recommends interrupting the formula
                        to indicate the presence of "J"<lb />("B&#x002D;I<hi rend="sup">8</hi> J<hi
                            rend="sup">8</hi> K&#x002D;L<hi rend="sup">8</hi>"), since the normal
                        practice in formulas is to assume the ab&#x002D;<lb />sence of "J","U" (or
                        "V"), and "W". This practice is obviously necessary<lb />and already well

                        are of little significance,<lb />but his preference for a colon rather than
                        a period to signify conjugacy<lb />seems an unnecessary departure from
                        standard practice.</p>
                    <p>Although the word "collation" is generally used by descriptive bib&#x002D;<lb />liographers
                        to refer to a report of the structure of the gatherings, there<lb />are
                        other kinds of collation (in the general sense of a verification of the<lb />order
                        and completeness of a series of items) that enter into a description.<lb />For
                        example, it is conventional, following the formulaic record of the<lb />gatherings,
                        to state the number of leaves represented by the formula and<lb />then to
                        provide a record (a collation) of pagination, showing unambigu&#x002D;<lb />ously
                        which pages have page numbers and what style of number is used<lb />(as in
                        "pp. [i&#x2013;iv] v [vi], [1] 2&#x2013;4 [<hi rend="italic">2</hi>]
                        5&#x2013;11 [12]," where the bracketed<lb />italicized "2" indicates how
                        many unnumbered pages whose pagination<lb />cannot be inferred are present
                        at this point). For books that have inserted<lb />non&#x002D;letterpress
                        material, a separate collation of those insertions comes<lb />next (perhaps
                        in its own "Collation" paragraph). The next paragraph in<lb />most
                        descriptions is one headed "Contents," which indicates (preferably<lb />in
                        quasi&#x002D;facsimile quotation: see above) the intellectual content
                        printed on<lb />every page (or group of pages), using signature notation
                        and/or pagina&#x002D;<lb />tion for reference. Because of the frequent
                        irregularity of pagination in<lb />pre&#x002D;nineteenth&#x002D;century
                        books, one should follow <name type="pname">Bowers's</name> advice to use<lb />signature
                        notation instead of pagination for this period. An added benefit<lb />(pointed
                        out by <name type="pname">Bowers</name>) is that studying the relationship
                        between produc&#x002D;<lb />tion and content is thereby facilitated. (A good
                        recent example of such<lb />a study is <name type="pname">John Barnard's</name>
                        "<name type="pname">Dryden's</name>
<hi rend="italic">Virgil</hi> (<date>1697</date>):

                        Bibliographical Society of <name type="place">America</name></hi>, 109 [<date>
                        2015</date>], 131&#x2013;139.)<lb />As a result of this advantage offered by
                        signature references, I would<lb />recommend using them for books of all
                        periods, perhaps accompanied<lb />by page numbers. Thus the "Collation" and
                        "Contents" paragraphs are<lb />complementary, the first collating physical
                        makeup and the second col&#x002D;<lb />lating intellectual content; when
                        used together they help to indicate how<lb />manufacturing and meaning
                        interact.</p>
                    <p>Because I commented briefly in my <date>1985</date> essay on the relation of
                        the<lb />gathering&#x002D;collation formula to format (since both relate to
                        structure, and<lb />a format designation often precedes the formula), I
                        should mention that<lb />later (in <date>2000</date>) I discussed the
                        concept of format at length (see "Format"<lb />below). The most important
                        post&#x002D;<date>1985</date> discussion of the collation for&#x002D;<lb />mula
                        itself is in the appendix to <name type="pname">Paul Needham's Hanes</name>

                        1988</date>), pp. 24&#x2013;33. Although he does not propose
                        alterations&#x002D;<lb />to the presently accepted style of the collation
                        formula, his account of<lb />its history and the principles behind it will
                        enrich any bibliographer's<lb />understanding.</p>

                    <p>"The Concept of Format" was published in <hi rend="italic">Studies in
                        Bibliography</hi>, 53<lb />(<date>2000</date>), 67&#x2013;115. In it I
                        offered a new definition of <hi rend="italic">format</hi> based on the<lb />number
                        of page&#x002D;units selected to fill each side of a piece of paper or<lb />parchment
                        of a given size; this formulation makes the concept applicable<lb />to
                        manuscripts as well as printed matter of all kinds and periods. A few<lb />years
                        after my essay appeared, <name type="pname">B. J. McMullin</name> provided
                        what he called<lb />"an extended, if somewhat discursive, footnote" to it:
                        "Some Notes on<lb />Paper and Format," <hi rend="italic">Bibliographical
                        Society of <name type="place">Australia</name> and <name type="place">New
                        Zealand</name><lb />Bulletin</hi>, 28.4 (<date>2004</date>), 92&#x2013;104.
                        He summarizes my arguments and gives<lb />several illustrative examples, and
                        I appreciate his careful consideration<lb />of the points I made. I
                        especially like his observation that, in cases where<lb />the format is
                        uncertain and requires explication, "we should not agonise<lb />over
                        ascribing a particular notation to the volume." His discussion does<lb />not
                        require any modification in my essay, but readers will benefit from<lb />following
                        his line of thinking about specific books.</p>
                    <p>I do wish, however, to comment on his final paragraph. Since there<lb />are
                        cases where the designation of format varies according to the
                        bibliog&#x002D;<lb />rapher's way of approaching it (as when
                        double&#x002D;size paper is cut before<lb />printing), he asks, "If format
                        is an intrinsic characteristic should it ever<lb />be subject to variant
                        designations, dependent on how it is defined?" He<lb />raises here a basic
                        philosophical point, which relates to all description. If<lb />we grant that
                        objects do have intrinsic qualities (as opposed to what we<lb />project onto
                        them), those qualities can only be apprehended and reported<lb />as filtered
                        through our individual perceptions and judgments. Every part<lb />of a
                        bibliographical description necessarily involves analysis and
                        interpre&#x002D;<lb />tation, and the format statement is no exception. Nor
                        is there reason to<lb />believe that, by devising a comprehensive concept of
                        format, we might be<lb />"trying to force discrepant items into a uniform
                        mould." The fact that we<lb />may not be able (or at least so far have not
                        been able) to determine with<lb />certainty the format of many
                        nineteenth&#x002D; and twentieth&#x002D;century books<lb />does not mean
                        that the concept has failed. Indeed, a single concept is<lb />necessary to
                        make clear how situations differ.</p>

                        constructed with such marks along edges,<lb />usually one or both of the

                        corners, and often with the maker's name as<lb />well. <name type="pname">
                        McMullin</name> provides diagrams showing the positions of these marks<lb />in

                        one can determine the format of books printed on such<lb />paper. (A further
                        diagram, showing edgemarks along the shorter sides of<lb />the mould, is

                        111&#x2013;113.) That the dates in these watermarks must be used with<lb />caution
                        was made clear in an earlier article by <name type="pname">Hilton Kelliher</name>
                        ("Early<lb />Dated Watermarks in English Paper: A Cautionary Note," in <hi

                        Spector [<date>1987</date>], pp. 61&#x2013;68): some papermakers<lb />did
                        not change the "<date>1794</date>" watermark in later years, and it could
                        happen<lb />that a mark would be postdated.</p>
                    <p><name type="pname">McMullin</name> also discusses another development of the
                        same period: the<lb />growing use of machine&#x002D;made paper. Although he
                        indicates some ways<lb />of distinguishing machine&#x002D;made from handmade
                        paper, along with the<lb />possibility in some instances of identifying
                        format by examining the pat&#x002D;<lb />tern of original edges in uncut
                        copies, he notes that the cutting of paper<lb />in edition&#x002D;binding
                        eliminates that possibility for most books beginning in<lb />the <date>1820</date>s.
                        One clue that remains, however, is the seam marks (that is, the<lb />imprint
                        left in the paper by the seams joining the ends of the wire&#x002D;mesh<lb />conveyor
                        belt that replaced the hand&#x002D;held mould); and <name type="pname">Catherine
                        M. Ro&#x002D;<lb />driguez</name> has explained how the pattern of
                        occurrences of these seam marks<lb />can sometimes enable one to learn the

                    <p>A few years later, <name type="pname">McMullin</name> pursued this point in
                        an impressive article<lb />that should be read by every bibliographer

                        2008</date>], 62&#x2013;88). He<lb />gives a clear description of the
                        process of producing paper by machine<lb />and the resulting characteristics
                        of the paper (not only seam marks and<lb />evidence of wire&#x002D;belt
                        repairs but also a thinning along the original edges<lb />as a result of
                        slippage of the pulp under the deckle straps). Seam marks<lb />may be either
                        vertical or horizontal in the leaves of books, or approxi&#x002D;<lb />mately
                        so&#x2014;but sometimes at angles that cause them not to run through <pb

                        usually needed to make a<lb />conclusive determination (except when a seam
                        mark spans two or three<lb />gatherings). One must remember, in dealing with
                        seam marks, that they<lb />may be present in some, but not all, copies of a
                        gathering and thus that<lb />their pattern of occurrence will vary among the
                        copies of an edition.<lb />(<name type="pname">McMullin</name> also
                        discusses a few other analytical uses of seam marks: see<lb />below, under

                    <p>Another difficulty related to format in books from the later eigh&#x002D;<lb />teenth
                        and the early nineteenth century is posed by the increasing use<lb />of
                        eighteenmo (see above, under "Collation"), which raises the question<lb />of
                        how to tell whether a book gathered in sixes is duodecimo or eigh&#x002D;<lb />
                        teenmo. <name type="pname">Pamela E. Pryde</name> has answered it by

                        and two for eighteenmo in sixes,<lb />established by drawing information
                        from eight printers' manuals (plus<lb />Gaskell); and she adds two more for

                        outstanding example.) Most previous bibliographi&#x002D;<lb />cal work on
                        paper (including mine) had emphasized watermarks and the<lb />chainline
                        spaces close to them and had either stated or implied that all<lb />the
                        other chain spaces were equal to each other. But <name type="pname">Vander
                        Meulen</name><lb />points out that the spaces between chains in handmade
                        paper vary within<lb />a given mould (and from one mould to another) and
                        that the sequence<lb />of the distances between chainlines can identify the
                        sheets produced in<lb />a single mould. Although for various reasons a given
                        space may not be<lb />consistent in all those sheets, the variation is
                        slight and the overall pattern<lb />is not affected.</p>
                    <p>In describing books printed on handmade paper, therefore, it is not<lb />sufficient
                        simply to say, for example, "chainlines 23 mm. apart." Instead,<lb />the
                        whole sequence across a sheet ought to be recorded, and <name type="pname">
                        Vander<lb />Meulen</name> has supplied a system that bibliographers should
                        adopt. He uses<lb />vertical lines to separate chain&#x002D;space
                        measurements (extending the prac&#x002D;<lb />tice <name type="pname">
                        Stevenson</name> follows near watermarks), with three further conventions:<lb />parentheses
                        indicate an estimated or incomplete measurement (at a gut&#x002D;<lb />ter
                        or when a sheet was cut between chainlines); ellipsis dots signify an<lb />incomplete
                        sequence (for a partial sheet); and the percentage sign stands<lb />for a
                        deckle edge (in parentheses when the deckle is inferred). A record<lb />(with
                        measurements to the nearest half&#x002D;millimeter, taken at the middle of<lb />the
                        sheet) might look like this:</p>
                    <p> (9) | 19 | 29.5 | 27.5 | 31 | (29) | 29.5 | 30 | 28.5 | 20 | (13) </p>
                    <p>(One desirable modification suggested by <name type="pname">John A. Lane</name>
                        is to use a verti&#x002D;<lb />cal wavy line instead of the percentage sign:
                        see "<name type="pname">Arthur Nicholls</name> and<lb />His Greek Type for
                        the King's Printing House," <hi rend="italic">The Library</hi>, 6th ser., 13<lb />
                        [<date>1991</date>], 297&#x2013;322 [p. 318].) When there is a watermark,
                        its position in<lb />the sequence should be shown, using <name type="pname">
                        Stevenson's</name> system (explained in<lb />my essay); and the sequence
                        should reflect the sheet as viewed from the<lb />mould side with the
                        watermark right side up (the standard orientation for<lb />bibliographical
                        use: see below for <name type="pname">Needham's</name> use of it). Obviously
                        one <pb n="39" /> could also view the paper from the felt side, but it
                        usually seems easier<lb />to work with the side showing the obverse of the
                        image. When a water&#x002D;<lb />mark is not present, the orientation is not
                        significant, since the sequence<lb />serves its purpose whether read forward
                        or backward. The great value of<lb />giving all the chain&#x002D;space
                        measurements is that all handmade papers can<lb />thereby be identified,
                        even when they have no watermarks or when only<lb />an unwatermarked
                        part&#x002D;sheet is present (as in some half&#x002D;sheet gather&#x002D;<lb />ings).
                        In the first of the two sample descriptions near the end of my es&#x002D;<lb />say,
                        the identification of the watermark and countermark should include<lb />only
                        the height and width measurements and should be followed (after a<lb />semicolon)
                        by the chain&#x002D;space sequence, incorporating a notation of the<lb />water
                        mark position.</p>
                    <p>The most extensive use, thus far, of <name type="pname">Vander Meulen's</name>
                        observations<lb />has been made by <name type="pname">David L. Gants</name>
                        and <name type="pname">R. Carter Hailey</name>. Although their<lb />methods
                        of collecting data differ (Gants's is high&#x002D;tech and Hailey's
                        low&#x002D;<lb />tech), they both make chain&#x002D;space sequences the
                        center of their paper<lb />descriptions&#x2014;accompanied by indications of
                        wireline density (see below)<lb />and measurements of watermarks, with
                        digital photographs (Gants) or<lb />freehand drawings (Hailey) of the
                        watermarks. Both follow <name type="pname">Vander Meu&#x002D;<lb />len's</name>
                        plan of using vertical lines to separate chain&#x002D;space measurements,<lb />but
                        each makes some modifications. Gants, when explaining his approach<lb />to
                        building a database, says that he records the sequence for every sheet<lb />(not
                        a representative one for any sheet from the same mould) and that he<lb />takes
                        his measurements from either side of the watermark (not the center<lb />of
                        the sheet), as a location accessible in a variety of formats. See
                        "Identi&#x002D;<lb />fying and Tracking Paper Stocks in Early Modern <name

                        Catalogue of Watermarks and Type Ornaments Used<lb />by <name type="pname">William
                        Stansby</name> [<date>1614&#x2013;1618</date>]" (<date>2005</date>), he does
                        not report the sequence<lb />for each sheet individually, and he gives two
                        chain&#x002D;space sequences per<lb />mould, from the "top" and "bottom" of
                        the sheet (that is, near the two<lb />longer edges, when the watermark is
                        viewed in upright position). He also<lb />uses different symbols from <name
                            type="pname">Vander Meulen's</name>: parentheses for chainlines<lb />that
                        intersect watermarks, braces for deckle edges, double slashes for gaps<lb />in
                        measurement, and square brackets for trimmed edges. Hailey makes<lb />fewer
                        alterations to <name type="pname">Vander Meulen's</name> form of report, the
                        chief one being<lb />to print in bold&#x002D;face italics the figures for
                        the space(s) where a watermark<lb />is located; and each of his
                        chain&#x002D;space measurements is an average of the<lb />measurements from
                        several sheets, the result being a "composite chain&#x002D;<lb />space
                        model." (In using this approach, one must be careful not to obscure<lb />differences
                        between paper stocks.) His method is set forth in detail on<lb />pp.

                        is covered in my essay. Their inclusion in a<lb />bibliographical
                        description, however, is not necessarily required. The one<lb />most likely
                        to qualify is a measurement of wireline density&#x2014;expressed (as<lb /><name

                        not be of further help, though it can sometimes be useful<lb />in making

                        thorough description is of course not limited to details necessary for<lb />identification,
                        and the inclusion of wireline density obviously adds to the<lb />completeness
                        of the description. Another identifying characteristic is the<lb />precise
                        location of any tranchefiles (a tranchefile is an extra chain that<lb />sometimes
                        occurs, at one or both ends of the mould, between the last<lb />regular
                        chain and the frame of the mould); but since these lines would<lb />be part
                        of the records of chain&#x002D;space sequences (and recognized by the<lb />smaller
                        intervals they usually create), they do not normally need separate<lb />
                        attention.</p>
                    <p>Still another feature of laid paper is the "shadow" centered on many<lb />chainlines,
                        caused by the supporting wooden ribs under the chains (ex&#x002D;<lb />cept
                        for most tranchefiles). Sometimes, apparently when chains are not<lb />directly
                        aligned over the ribs (as they normally are), there is an effect of<lb />double
                        chainlines, one of which in each pair is less distinct than the other.<lb /><name
                            type="pname">Vander Meulen</name> does not include these secondary
                        chainlines in his chain&#x002D;<lb />space sequences, nor does he report the
                        location of shadows in relation to<lb />the secondary chainlines. Although
                        the presence of these features should<lb />perhaps be mentioned in general
                        terms in a bibliographical description,<lb />they do not usually call for
                        detailed reporting. A further article of <name type="pname">Vander<lb />

                        further specification of the dimensions of either one. <name type="pname">
                        Needham</name><lb />feels that precise leaf measurements of handmade paper
                        are not useful<lb />even for an example with surviving deckle edges, given
                        the variations that<lb />would exist between measurements taken at different
                        points and the dif&#x002D;<lb />ficulty of estimating how much is
                        inaccessible in the fold. As long as the<lb />approximate nature of such
                        measurements is clear, however, there is no<lb />harm in providing them as
                        evidence for the extrapolation to the named<lb />size. The "a" and "b" lines
                        in the description refer to the twin moulds of<lb />the particular paper
                        stock; and "mR" and "mL" give the location of the<lb />watermark as being in
                        the right or left half of each mould, with the at&#x002D;<lb />tached number
                        indicating which chain&#x002D;space it is in (here, the fourth from<lb />the
                        nearest short edge). For "right" and "left" to be meaningful, of course,<lb />the
                        paper must be consistently viewed from the same side and with the<lb />watermark
                        image upright. <name type="pname">Needham</name> recommends looking at the
                        mould<lb />side; and if in certain instances the felt side seems more
                        appropriate, the<lb />designation "(f.s.)" can be added. When a watermark
                        design has no obvi&#x002D;<lb />ous top or bottom, the position of some
                        arbitrary feature can sometimes<lb />be used and noted (though totally
                        symmetrical abstract designs defeat the<lb />system altogether).</p>
                    <p>The remainder of each "a" and "b" line gives, at each end in paren&#x002D;<lb />theses,
                        the distance from the deckle edge to the tranchefile; then, moving<lb />in
                        from each end, the number between the vertical rules is the measure&#x002D;<lb />ment
                        from the tranchefile to the nearest regular chain; and finally, in<lb />the
                        center, is the number of chainlines with the average distance be&#x002D;<lb />tween
                        them. (One possible ambiguity&#x2014;whether or not the stated
                        num&#x002D;ber of chains includes the two apparently represented by the
                        second and <pb n="42" /> third vertical lines&#x2014;could be avoided if
                        reference were made to "chain<lb />spaces" and not to "chains.") <name
                            type="pname">Needham</name> acknowledges that this statement<lb />of
                        chainline numbers is "a very crude 'measurement,'" but he believes it<lb />is
                        usually sufficient for paper&#x002D;stock identification when used in
                        conjunc&#x002D;<lb />tion with the other details. He recognizes, however,
                        that noting the size<lb />of every chainline interval, as suggested by <name
                            type="pname">Vander Meulen</name> (see above),<lb />may sometimes be
                        needed, especially in connection with unwatermarked<lb />paper. The tabular
                        form of <name type="pname">Needham's</name> presentation is obviously not
                        es&#x002D;<lb />sential: his notation can be made to fit within the general
                        scheme I sug&#x002D;<lb />gested at the end of my essay.</p>
                    <p>One notices that <name type="pname">Needham's</name> description does not
                        include an indi&#x002D;<lb />cation (using <name type="pname">Stevenson's</name>
                        system or any other) of the exact position of<lb />a watermark in relation
                        to the adjacent chainlines. The reason is that<lb /><name type="pname">
                        Needham</name> feels the information conveyed by such measurements is<lb />"so
                        inferior to that supplied by actual&#x002D;size reproductions" that he
                        can&#x002D;<lb />not regard them as "a fundamental element of paperstock
                        description"<lb />(p. 34)&#x2014;though he notes that they can indeed be
                        helpful, as <name type="pname">Vander<lb />Meulen</name> has shown. In any
                        case, reproductions cannot always be sup&#x002D;<lb />plied; and, even when
                        they are, some bibliographers will feel that they<lb />should be
                        supplemented by measurements. But it is true, of course, that<lb />reproductions
                        will always provide details not covered by verbal accounts.<lb /><name

                        some analytical techniques applicable to those<lb />papers. In addition to
                        outlining clues regarding format (see "Format"<lb />above), he shows (in the <date>
                        2008</date> paper) how seam marks in machine&#x002D;made<lb />paper can be
                        used for dating (paper with seam marks is probably between<lb /><date>1810</date>
                        and <date>1850</date>) and for identifying cancels and other irregularities
                        in the <pb n="43" /> makeup of a gathering (signaled by any breaking of a
                        seam&#x002D;mark pat&#x002D;<lb />tern). An unanswered historical question
                        that hampers some analysis is<lb />whether the printer gathered and collated
                        sheets before sending them to<lb />the binder or whether, in the era of
                        publishers' bindings, the binder took<lb />on this job; if the latter,
                        random combinations of part&#x002D;sheets in finished<lb />books might be
                        more likely, thus rendering more doubtful the determina&#x002D;<lb />tion of
                        the particular imposition used. The point most relevant to writing<lb />a
                        bibliographical description is his suggestion of two alternative plans for<lb />recording
                        seam marks (pp. 78&#x2013;79):</p>
                    <p>seam marks horizontal: B1 2 7 8 F3 4 5 6 H3 4 5 6 M1 2 7 8</p>
                    <p>seam marks vertical: C5 8 G6 7 K6 7 N5 8 R1 4 U2 3 Z2 3</p>
                    <p>seam marks horizontal: $1 2 7 8 BM, $3 4 5 6 FH</p>
                    <p>seam marks vertical: $1 4 R, $2 3 UZ, $5 8 CN, $6 7 GK</p>
                    <p>As he points out, however, the pattern will not necessarily be the same in<lb />every
                        copy of the edition; and if one therefore inserts library sigla (or copy<lb />numbers)
                        in parentheses to identify individual copies, he feels that the first<lb />system
                        would probably be clearer&#x2014;though I believe that the preferable<lb />one
                        might vary in different situations, since each has a different focus.<lb />In
                        any case, they are both usable; and, though other schemes could be<lb />devised
                        (especially to give more information about the exact positioning<lb />of the
                        seam marks), there would seem to be no reason in most instances<lb />to do
                        so.</p>
                    <p>I do, however, think there is reason to question the point <name type="pname">
                        McMullin</name><lb />makes next: that "one might well allow the record to
                        stand unqualified<lb />[with copy sigla], to be understood as indicating
                        that a seam mark of a<lb />particular orientation is to be found in the
                        specified gathering in at least<lb />one copy from within the edition." One
                        could, of course, adopt an ab&#x002D;<lb />breviated form of paper
                        description and omit the locations of seam marks<lb />entirely (saying
                        simply "machine&#x002D;made paper with seam marks"); but if<lb />one is
                        going to specify a sample location, the copy (or copies) used to<lb />obtain
                        that information should be specified. The situation is analogous to<lb />the
                        recording of locations of other features that vary from copy to copy.<lb />In
                        the case of handmade paper, for example, all the sheets of a book may<lb />have
                        the same watermark and countermark, but those marks may not<lb />appear on
                        the same leaves in every copy, depending on how the paper<lb />was turned
                        before printing and how the printing and handling of half&#x002D;<lb />sheet
                        gatherings were carried out; furthermore, the small variations in the<lb />papers
                        coming from twin moulds (variation in watermark placement and<lb />in
                        chainline and tranchefile spacing) may not be identically distributed in<lb />every
                        copy. In all such cases, therefore, one ought to cite not only signa&#x002D;<lb />ture
                        locations but also the specific copies used&#x2014;and normally to do so in <pb
                            n="44" /> the basic description, rather than including the information
                        in the list of<lb />copies examined (see "Arrangement" below), since what is
                        being recorded<lb />is a feature of the edition as published, not a
                        post&#x002D;publication alteration.<lb />A justifiable exception to this

                        in the book. Besides identifying these papers, he gives a concise <pb n="45" />
                        description of each one, citing primarily the characteristics that the Press<lb />would

                        elements: weight (per ream of 480 sheets), texture (laid or wove),<lb />dimensions,
                        substance (grams per square meter), thickness (caliper mea&#x002D;<lb />surements
                        in thousandths of an inch), color, and watermark. Here is an<lb />example:
                        "28&#x2013;pound hand&#x002D;made antique laid, 16&#x00BC; &#x00D7;

                        the significance of the thickness figures<lb />he gives is not clear (a

                        designed to<lb />produce machine&#x002D;readable records, each of which has
                        potentially a hun&#x002D;<lb />dred fields, sometimes involving intricate
                        coding. As an example, <name type="pname">Bidwell</name><lb />notes that a
                        watermark consisting of a crown over CLK in script would<lb />be reported as
                        "R3/1&#x2014;{b:(i:X"CLK")}"&#x2014;and this is far from being one<lb />of
                        the more complex possibilities. Although a large database constructed<lb />in
                        this way could indeed be searched productively, the effort involved in <pb

                        their purposes are adequately served by readily understood<lb />verbal
                        watermark descriptions (including, as <name type="pname">Stevenson</name>

                    <p>The next year after my essay, <name type="pname">Philip Gaskell</name> (whose
                        important earlier<lb />studies of paper are mentioned there) published <hi

                        1972</date>, <date>1974</date>), which discusses the history and analysis of
                        paper in<lb />two chapters. The one on paper in the hand&#x002D;press period
                        (pp. 57&#x2013;77) has<lb />a page on description (pp. 76&#x2013;77), and
                        that on the machine&#x002D;press period<lb />(pp. 214&#x2013;230) has two
                        pages (pp. 226&#x2013;228). The former chapter includes<lb />the point,
                        which cannot be stated too often, that handmade paper varies<lb />from sheet
                        to sheet and that any edition may have been printed on two or<lb />more
                        paper stocks, which may not be consistently represented in a given<lb />copy
                        (emphasizing once again the necessity for examining a large number<lb />of
                        copies). But the main contribution to paper description that <name
                            type="pname">Gaskell</name><lb />makes in this book has to do with
                        machine&#x002D;made paper. He enumerates<lb />five simple tests for
                        distinguishing the characteristics of different stocks:<lb />(1) assess the
                        feel (surface texture) and color in a good light; (2) identify,<lb />with a
                        raking light, the belt side and notice the wove pattern; (3) measure<lb />the
                        pattern (in wires per centimeter) and, if it is oblong or
                        diamond&#x002D;shaped<lb />(rather than square), notice whether its longer
                        dimension is parallel to<lb />the grain (which is also the machine
                        direction); (4) measure the thickness<lb />with a micrometer; and (5)
                        establish the relative densities of papers in two<lb />books by weighing
                        them (though it should be added that there are often<lb />too many variables
                        here to make this test of much use). He then lists seven<lb />additional
                        tests that, because they involve damaging the paper (by fold&#x002D;<lb />ing
                        or applying chemicals), would not normally be of use to descriptive<lb />bibliographers.
                        Tables of standard paper sizes are given for the hand&#x002D;press<lb />period
                        (pp. 73&#x2013;75; provided in my essay as well) and the

                        "Describing<lb />Nineteenth&#x002D;Century Papers" (<hi rend="italic">Script
                        &amp; Print</hi>, 40 [<date>2016</date>], 5&#x2013;28), though<lb />its
                        emphasis is on writing papers rather than printing papers (it should<lb />certainly
                        be consulted by those dealing with handwritten letters and<lb />journals).
                        Of the points relevant to bibliographers of printed books, two<lb />are
                        worth repeating here, even though they are obvious to anyone who<lb />understands
                        that paper made with the Fourdrinier machine has a wove<lb />pattern,
                        imparted by the moving woven&#x002D;wire belt on which the pulp is<lb />placed,
                        and that any chainlines or watermarks result from the action of a<lb />dandy
                        roll pressing into the other side of the pulp. Knowing this process,<lb />one
                        can tell whether paper with a laid pattern is machine&#x002D;made by noting<lb />whether
                        it has a wove pattern as well as a laid pattern&#x2014;the former of<lb />course
                        indented into<lb />one side of the paper, and the latter indented into<lb />the
                        other. (The indentations from the wove belt were deeper and closer<lb />together
                        than those resulting from hand&#x002D;held moulds, but this point, <pb
                            n="48" /> being comparative, is difficult to make use of.) Second,
                        machine&#x002D;made<lb />watermarked paper (even without laid lines) can
                        naturally be detected<lb />by the presence of the watermark indentations on
                        the opposite side from<lb />the wove&#x002D;pattern indentations; but one
                        can also note that the indenta&#x002D;<lb />tions of the lines of the
                        watermark design (and lettering, if any) are inter&#x002D;<lb />sected by
                        the indentations of the wove pattern from the belt&#x2014;whereas<lb />in
                        handmade wove paper the watermark, being on top of the wire mesh,<lb />covers
                        the mesh pattern at the points of contact. (One must recognize<lb />that
                        these facts about paper made with the Fourdrinier machine do not<lb />apply
                        to so&#x002D;called mechanical mould&#x002D;made paper, in which a rotating<lb />cylinder
                        mould deposits each sheet on a moving woolen felt, and in which<lb />all
                        patterns and watermarks are therefore indented from the same side;<lb />another
                        difference between such paper and Fourdrinier paper is that its<lb />fibers
                        are distributed randomly in the sheet rather than solely in the belt<lb />direction.)
                        Employing contemporary paper&#x002D;trade sources, Elmore says<lb />that
                        "laid" and "wove" were the standard nineteenth&#x002D;century terms for<lb />printing
                        papers. As for dimensions, he gives tables of writing&#x002D;paper sizes<lb />(and
                        size names), but he does not add anything to <name type="pname">Gaskell's</name>
                        table of ma&#x002D;<lb />chine&#x002D;made paper sizes. Although he suggests
                        that bibliographers might<lb />use some of the trade terms for other
                        characteristics (such as finish, bulk,<lb />and opacity), he also indicates
                        that they were somewhat impressionistic,<lb />reflecting the judgment of
                        professionals who handled paper every day,<lb />and that they should
                        therefore be used with caution&#x2014;or, I would add,<lb />probably not be
                        used at all (or only as ordinary adjectives, not as techni&#x002D;<lb />cal
                        terms).</p>

                        history and<lb />analysis of paper, several may be mentioned as particularly
                        useful for<lb />descriptive bibliographers (and see the references in
                        "Format" above).<lb />Published collections of watermark reproductions have

                        any indication of the location of a<lb />watermark should specify which half
                        of the sheet it is in; that any citation<lb />of a given leaf as a source of
                        evidence should indicate the particular copy<lb />of the book used; and that
                        specifications of thickness of handmade paper<lb />should note that the
                        figure is an average. These additions will make the<lb />treatment of paper

                        41&#x2013;55. My sug&#x002D;<lb />gestions for classifying or naming a type
                        design (on various levels of speci&#x002D;<lb />ficity) and for measuring
                        type faces (not type bodies) were followed by<lb />an example of how one
                        might report features of layout such as the size<lb />of the
                        type&#x002D;page and the typography of running titles and headings. The<lb />idea
                        of measuring faces rather than bodies has been advocated even in<lb />a

                        with which we have lived so long, that of making the type size the<lb />size
                        of body. Type should truly be graded by its optical size rather than<lb />by

                    <p>In supplementing my essay half a century later, I wish to call attention<lb />first

                        only be&#x002D;<lb />cause Carter is always worth reading but also because
                        he takes <name type="pname">Bowers</name><lb />as a starting point. His aim
                        is to show how, given present knowledge of<lb />typographic history, one can
                        respond to <name type="pname">Bowers's</name> doubts about how far a<lb />bibliographer
                        can go in identifying a type face. At the outset, he says that<lb />a face
                        is "sufficiently identified" by the name of the punch&#x002D;cutter (that<lb />is,
                        the design), the body size, and the "style" as described by standard<lb />adjectives.
                        The second chapter opens with this passage (which includes a<lb />comment on
                        measuring faces that could be extended to later periods):</p>
                    <p>Why should it be so difficult to do what Professor Professor <name
                            type="pname">Bowers</name> thought would be de&#x002D;<lb />sirable, if
                        it were possible: to particularize the type used in a book? If you measure<lb />it,
                        and find that 20 lines set in it take up, say, 85 mm., you restrict it to a
                        class of a<lb />particular body&#x2014;a property of a type&#x002D;founder's
                        mould. It remains to describe the<lb />face, which might be cast on a
                        variety of bodies. I had rather name typefaces for<lb />size by the
                        conventional body that would best fit them, Pica, Long Primer, Minion,<lb />and
                        such, than by numbers, qualifying these terms if necessary by adding "large"<lb />or
                        "small". Some time in the early part or the middle of the sixteenth century
                        these<lb />names acquired fixed meanings. Until it becomes appropriate to
                        use them it is safest<lb />to measure the face of a fount, which you can do
                        if you have a powerful magnifying&#x002D;<lb />glass and a fine scale and
                        measure from the top of b to the bottom of p or the extent<lb />of an Italic <hi
                            rend="italic">f</hi>. This, called the gauge of the face, cannot vary.
                        (p. 23)</p>
                    <p>Carter proceeds to discuss the value of naming the designer&#x002D;cutter
                        (which<lb />sums up "all manner of information as to place and time,
                        circumstances<lb />and relationships"), and he notes the inadequacy of the
                        usual terms of<lb />classification. "It is evident," he says (and
                        bibliographers should take<lb />note), "that in considering the face of a
                        fount of type we are in a world of<lb />art, styles, difficulty of saying
                        what styles, inherited forms, human hands"<lb />(p. 24). But although he
                        concludes that this "humble art" is not "suscep&#x002D;<lb />tible of
                        scientific treatment," he clearly believes that rigorous historical<lb />description
                        is possible.</p>
                    <p>The next book that should be mentioned, because of its prominence,<lb />is <name
                            type="pname">Philip Gaskell's</name>
<hi rend="italic">A New Introduction
                        to Bibliography</hi> (<date>1972</date>, <date>1974</date>), though<lb />unfortunately
                        its section called "Type Sizes; and Description" (pp. 12&#x002D;<lb />16)
                        makes recommendations that raise some questions. To begin with,<lb />Gaskell
                        says that a twenty&#x002D;line measurement (from the top of an ascender<lb />in
                        one line to the same point in the twenty&#x002D;first line below) gives one<lb />(after
                        division by twenty) the "apparent body&#x002D;size," though he adds, "It<lb />is
                        important to make sure that the lines measured are set solid." He says<lb />that
                        if the vertical gap between the bottom of a descender in one line<lb />and
                        the top of an ascender in the next line is half a millimeter or less, <pb
                            n="52" /> the lines are "probably" set solid; but if the space is
                        greater, the lines are<lb />"either leaded or printed from a fount cast on
                        an oversize body." How,<lb />then, has the body size been made "apparent"?
                        This is precisely the dif&#x002D;<lb />ficulty that caused me to recommend
                        not referring to the body size but<lb />focusing instead on what is actually
                        visible, and I continue to believe that<lb />my suggestion is sound (giving
                        the vertical size and the x&#x002D;height of the<lb />face combined with a
                        multiple&#x002D;line measurement). The specific number<lb />of lines to be
                        measured is a less important matter, and Gaskell's choice of<lb />twenty is
                        traditional; but he should at least have indicated that a twenty&#x2014;<lb />line
                        measurement is not the only responsible possibility, since the greater<lb />convenience
                        of ten (which I pointed out) was recognized as long ago<lb />as McKerrow's
                        time (p. 306 of his <date>1927</date>
<hi rend="italic">Introduction</hi>),
                        and later by <name type="pname">Allan<lb />Stevenson</name> in his <date>
                        1961</date> volume of the Hunt catalogue (p. clxxxii). Another<lb />problem
                        with Gaskell's discussion is the form of report he stipulates. Af&#x002D;<lb />ter
                        the vertical dimension of the face is measured, he says, "the
                        x&#x002D;height<lb />and the capital height are measured in millimetres and
                        the result is pre&#x2014;<lb />sented in the form: '[face height X 20] X
                        [x&#x002D;height] : [capital height]'";<lb />his example is "Body 82. Face
                        80 X 1.7 : 2.5." Although this system is<lb />"adapted" from one
                        "introduced" by H. D. L. Vervliet in <hi rend="italic">The Type
                        Speci&#x002D;<lb />men of the Vatican Press <date>1628</date></hi> (<date>
                        1967</date>), it is not in any sense an established<lb />standard. He should
                        have made clear that he is simply recommending this<lb />form but that other
                        plans are plausible; it is regrettable that his prescrip&#x2014;<lb />tive
                        assertion ("the result is presented in the form &#x2026;") will mislead the<lb />very
                        people that such an introduction is meant to instruct.</p>
                    <p>Gaskell's treatment does, however, make two points that usefully sup&#x002D;<lb />plement
                        my discussion. First, he notes how measurements are complicated<lb />by
                        paper shrinkage and ink seepage. His guideline is that shrinkage (as the<lb />dampened
                        paper dried after printing) reduced the type&#x002D;face dimensions<lb />"by
                        about 1 per cent, and occasionally by as much as 2&#x00BD; percent." One<lb />must
                        certainly keep this point in mind; all one can do is to take multiple<lb />measurements
                        in different copies and caution the reader about the prob&#x002D;<lb />lem
                        in an introduction. As for the ink spread that occurs when the type<lb />sinks
                        into the paper, one must be sure to measure (using magnification)<lb />only
                        the indented impression, not the total ink smear. This point was ef&#x002D;<lb />fectively
                        made in <date>1988</date> by Adrian Weiss in explaining why photographic<lb />reproductions
                        are not useful for making type measurements ("Reproduc&#x002D;<lb />tions of
                        Early Dramatic Texts as a Source of Bibliographical Evidence,"<lb /><hi
                            rend="italic">Text</hi>, 4: 237&#x2013;268). (Cf. <name type="pname">Joseph
                        A. Dane's</name> discussion of reproductions and<lb />shrinkage in relation
                        to type measurement in <hi rend="italic">The Myth of Print Culture</hi><lb />
                        [<date>2003</date>], pp. 75&#x2013;82.) The other helpful point in Gaskell's
                        discussion is that<lb />the height of a capital should be given as well as
                        the total height (ascender<lb />to descender) and the x&#x002D;height. <name
                            type="pname">David L. Vander Meulen</name>, in his <hi rend="italic">
                        Dunciad</hi>
<pb n="53" /> bibliography (<date>1981</date> dissertation),
                        explains the value of all three measure&#x002D;<lb />ments for revealing the
                        proportions of a design, and he suggests simply<lb />giving the three
                        figures (measured to the nearest third of a millimeter)<lb />with virgules
                        separating them (e.g., "face 4.0/2.7/1.7").</p>
                    <p>There are two other matters that I wish to add to what I wrote in<lb /><date>
                        1966</date>. First, the indication of the number of lines on a typical page
                        is<lb />meaningful only for books of prose or long narrative poems. For
                        books<lb />of short poems, where few (if any) pages have text extending down
                        to the point where the last line would occur&#x2014;and where even those
                        pages may<lb />have stanza breaks of more than a single line
                        space&#x2014;the bibliographer<lb />will have to depart from the formulaic
                        statement I suggested and explain<lb />precisely what the situation is
                        (indicating, for example, the amount of<lb />space between stanzas, altering
                        the multi&#x002D;line measurement to something<lb />smaller than ten lines
                        if all the stanzas in the book are shorter than that,<lb />and noting
                        whether each poem begins on a new page).</p>
                    <p>The second matter is that there may be times, especially in the hand&#x002D;<lb />press
                        period, when it would not be objectionable to give the type&#x002D;body<lb />size
                        as well as the type&#x002D;face size. When the multi&#x002D;line measurement
                        comes<lb />close to what it would be at a specific time for a particular
                        standard type<lb />(pica, long primer, etc.) if set solid (always allowing
                        for paper shrinkage),<lb />one may be justified in concluding that this type
                        was the one used. Gaskell<lb />provides a table (p. 15) giving the names of
                        the nine most common body sizes in the hand&#x002D;press period and the
                        twenty&#x002D;line measurements of each<lb />at varying times. (Carter gives
                        a similar list of twelve sizes on p. 127; and<lb /><name type="pname">J. D.
                        Fleeman</name> gives a list of thirteen sizes, important for not being based<lb />on
                        multi&#x002D;line measurements but rather on such combinations as "ly", in<lb />
                        his <name type="pname">Samuel Johnson</name> bibliography [<date>2000</date>],
                        p. xxxvii.) A much more com&#x002D;<lb />prehensive table was published by <name
                            type="pname">John Richardson</name>, Jr., in "Correlated<lb />Type Sizes

                        251&#x2013;272). This fourteen&#x002D;page table re&#x002D;<lb />cords
                        twenty&#x002D;line measurements in millimeters, inches, and points (pica,<lb />fournier,
                        and didot), along with the type names in seven countries. Al&#x002D;<lb />though
                        he is careful to measure the type impressions under magnification<lb />and
                        recognizes the problem of paper shrinkage, one may still feel that<lb />some
                        of his measurements are unrealistically precise.</p>
                    <p>Indeed, this table has been severely criticized by <name type="pname">James
                        Mosley</name> (in<lb />"Type Bodies Compared," <hi rend="italic">Journal of
                        the Printing Historical Society</hi>, n.s., 23<lb />[<date>2015</date>],
                        49&#x2013;58) for "indiscriminately" bringing together measurements<lb />from
                        "sources that are unevenly reliable" (p. 56); he regards it as a "useful<lb />reminder
                        of the problems involved"&#x2014;problems that to some extent affect<lb />the
                        other published tables as well. Mosley's main point is that size names<lb />varied
                        in the sizes they signified in different geographical locations and <pb
                            n="54" /> at different times. He provides a pioneering table (pp.

                    <p>For classifying type faces into broad categories, my suggestion of the<lb />DIN

                        since <date>1975</date>), as presented by <name type="pname">James Mosley</name>
                        in <date>1960</date>, remains appropriate<lb />in my view&#x2014;especially
                        the terms "Renaissance," "Baroque," and "Neo&#x002D; <pb n="55" /> Classic,"
                        which also appear in Gaskell's adaptation of the DIN plan in<lb />his <hi
                            rend="italic">New Introduction</hi> (p. 16). Robert Bringhurst, known
                        for his thoughtful<lb />discussion of typographic matters, has provided one
                        of the best statements<lb />of the reasons to use such historically allusive
                        terms. In his often reprinted<lb /><hi rend="italic">The Elements of
                        Typographic Style</hi> (<date>1992</date>), after mentioning research on
                        "sci&#x002D;<lb />entific descriptions," he says:</p>
                    <p>But letterforms are not only objects of science. They also belong to the
                        realm of<lb />art, and they participate in its history. They have changed
                        over time just as music,<lb />painting and architecture have changed, and
                        the same historical terms&#x2014;Renais&#x002D;<lb />sance, Baroque,
                        Neoclassical, Romantic, and so on&#x2014;are useful in each of these<lb />fields.
                        &#x2026; Typography never occurs in isolation. Good typography demands not<lb />only
                        a knowledge of type itself, but an understanding of the relationship between<lb />letterforms
                        and the other things that humans make and do. (p. 111)</p>
                    <p>He then presents a historical classification using these headings: Re&#x002D;<lb />naissance,
                        Mannerist, Baroque, Rococo, Neoclassical, Romantic, Real&#x002D;<lb />ist,
                        Geometrical modernism, Lyrical modernism, and Postmodern<lb />(pp.

                        After a brief<lb />summary of four systems (Vox, Association Typographique
                        Internation&#x002D;<lb />ale, British Standards Institution [BSI], and DIN),
                        he offers "An Attempt<lb />to Formulate a Rational System" (pp.
                        45&#x2013;119); although it is useful for<lb />its numerous examples of
                        designs and its historical discussion of each, the<lb />system itself uses
                        the traditional "old style," "transitional," and "modern,"<lb />which are
                        widely thought to be inadequate. Bringhurst himself offered a<lb />"scientific"
                        approach in "On the Classification of Letterforms" (<hi rend="italic">Serif</hi>,
                        1<lb />[Fall <date>1994</date>], 30&#x2013;39); it amounts to an extensive
                        analogy with biological<lb />classification (using such terms as <hi

                    <p>Near the end of my essay, I mentioned the possibility of identifying the<lb />individual

                        1999</date>; <date>2000</date>), 1&#x2013;57, I discussed<lb />how some of
                        the results of bibliographical analysis might be incorporated<lb />into a
                        descriptive bibliography. Analysis, of course, underlies all aspects<lb />of
                        a description, but I was dealing here only with the kinds of analysis<lb />that
                        would be reported in a paragraph on typesetting and presswork. I<lb />have
                        nothing to add to my proposals there, but I do wish to emphasize<lb />again
                        the importance of including this kind of information in a descrip&#x002D;<lb />tive
                        bibliography, as demonstrated long ago in <name type="pname">David L. Vander

                        appear in paragraphs other than the one on typeset&#x002D;<lb />ting and
                        presswork: the analysis of format is generally reported in the col&#x002D;<lb />lation

                        imprints, based on the analysis of type&#x002D;case contents or
                        print&#x002D;<lb />ers' ornaments, could well be mentioned in connection
                        with title&#x002D;page<lb />transcription; and the distinguishing of
                        impressions, which may require<lb />a number of analytical techniques,

                        Lectures (mentioned as unpublished in note 3 of that<lb />essay). The second
                        chapter, "Analysis of Manufacturing Clues" (pp. 31&#x2013;<lb />60, with
                        notes on pp. 97&#x2013;108), does not deal with the formal presenta&#x002D;<lb />tion
                        of bibliographical evidence but in other respects covers much the<lb />same
                        ground as the <date>1999</date> essay, summarizing the uses of each

                        their handling of all techniques is exemplary. In connection with
                        run&#x002D;<lb />ning titles, it is worth noting that Needham's chapter
                        "Parallel Printing<lb />and Running Titles" (pp. 155&#x2013;165), written
                        with <name type="pname">David L. Vander Meu&#x002D;<lb />len</name>, sets
                        out the running&#x002D;title evidence in three tables with grid lines: the<lb />first
                        lists the different settings of the running titles and shows (with vertical<lb />columns
                        for each sheet) where each one appears; the second is organized<lb />by
                        forme and indicates which setting is on each page of each forme; and<lb />the
                        third, arranged by sheet, shows (with vertical columns for each setting)<lb />all
                        the settings that appear in each sheet. These tables illustrate one way<lb />in
                        which the more compressed presentation I suggested can be modified<lb />to
                        produce still greater clarity in some instances. A fourth work, though<lb />it
                        does not as readily serve the function of an introduction, offers a

                    <p>It was only in connection with localization of compositorial practices<lb />that
                        I mentioned the placement of printed signatures. But the role of<lb />signature
                        positions in distinguishing editions, an old (and continuingly<lb />useful)
                        technique that has also been a part of some "fingerprinting" sys&#x002D;<lb />tems
                        for shorthand identification of editions (see "Relation to Library<lb />Cataloguing"
                        above), is discussed in my <hi rend="italic">Bibliographical Analysis</hi>,
                        p. 103.<lb />Also in that book I commented (pp. 58&#x2013;59) on the
                        situation (not un&#x002D;<lb />common in nineteenth&#x002D;century books
                        printed from plates, especially<lb />American ones) where printed signatures
                        do not correspond to the actual<lb />gatherings. Analysis of such signatures
                        can sometimes reveal structural<lb />decisions made during the production of
                        a book. For example, Melville's<lb /><hi rend="italic">Clarel</hi> (as I
                        pointed out in the Northwestern&#x002D;Newberry Edition [<date>1991</date>],<lb />pp.
                        678&#x2013;679) was published in two volumes gathered in eights, but its<lb />occasional
                        printed signatures do not match that structure. An analysis<lb />of the
                        occurrence of those signatures suggests that the original plan was<lb />for
                        a one&#x002D;volume publication gathered in twelves (and that signatures for<lb />the
                        earlier plan were incompletely removed). <name type="pname">B. J. McMullin</name>
                        has recently<lb />analyzed a number of examples of conflicting signatures,
                        in "Gather&#x002D;<lb />ings and Signatures in Conflict" (<hi rend="italic">Script
                        &amp; Print</hi>, 39 [<date>2015</date>], 241&#x2013;247). He<lb />groups
                        them into two categories: those where the discrepancy between<lb />signatures
                        and gatherings was unintended, resulting from an unforeseen<lb />event or
                        decision at a time when it would have been inconvenient to make<lb />alterations;
                        and those where two or more sets of signatures are present,<lb />resulting
                        from a plan to accommodate different impositions. Both situa&#x002D;<lb />tions
                        normally imply printing from plates, since the removal or insertion<lb />of
                        signatures after plating would be especially time&#x002D;consuming. (See

                        his lecture as a whole is a convenient summary of one class of
                        biblio&#x002D;<lb />graphical evidence that should be analyzed and recorded
                        by descriptive<lb />bibliographers (as should discrepancies in catchwords,

                    <p>A technique not mentioned in my <date>1999</date> essay is the use of
                        variations in<lb />leading (the spacing between lines of type) to identify
                        different printings of<lb />the same edition; for an explanation, see <name

                        my <date>2009</date> book) does touch on the means for<lb />distinguishing
                        whether type or plates were used to print particular pages<lb />or books,
                        but it does not raise the question of distinguishing Monotype<lb />from
                        Linotype. I wish to pass along here a detail communicated to me<lb />by <name

                        of <hi rend="italic">Studies in Bib&#x002D;<lb />liography</hi> (in the days
                        when that journal was printed from Linotype) that<lb />occasionally an
                        individual Linotype matrix might not be seated properly<lb />before the slug
                        was poured. Thus a slug might contain a type&#x002D;high space<lb />that
                        would print (as happened in <hi rend="italic">Studies in Bibliography</hi>,
                        35 [<date>1982</date>], 275);<lb />and what one might ordinarily think would
                        be a sign of printing from<lb />separate types cannot be assumed to be so.
                        This situation is analogous to<lb />that in which a shifting type is caught
                        in one of its misaligned positions<lb />when a stereotype plate was made.
                        Comparison of multiple copies will<lb />of course show no further shifting
                        in either the stereotype or Linotype<lb />instances.</p>
                    <p>We are now surely beyond the point where the logical validity and<lb />scholarly

                        essay was put forward by <name type="pname">Joseph A. Dane</name> in <hi
                            rend="italic">Blind Impres&#x002D;<lb />sions: Methods and Mythologies
                        in Book History</hi> (<date>2013</date>), in a chapter called<lb />"Bibliographers
                        of the Mind" (pp. 58&#x2013;72). Although he does not cite<lb />my comments,
                        he makes some of the same points, especially noting the<lb />problems
                        entailed by <name type="pname">McKenzie's</name> elevation of printers'
                        records over the<lb />books themselves as primary evidence&#x2014;and as
                        unfailingly accurate docu&#x002D;<lb />ments at that. Even if what Dane says
                        is not new, the central five pages<lb />of his chapter (pp. 63&#x2013;68)
                        are worth reading for his striking way of stat&#x002D;<lb />ing the defects
                        of <name type="pname">McKenzie's</name> piece. For example, he rightly says
                        that if<lb />primary evidence is limited to external evidence (printers'
                        records), then<lb /><name type="pname">McKenzie's</name> "criticisms of
                        analytical bibliography are little better than<lb />tautologies" (p. 68).</p>
                    <p>Given this sound evaluation, it seems contradictory that <name type="pname">
                        Dane</name> calls<lb /><name type="pname">McKenzie's</name> piece "the
                        article that should have sounded the death knell on<lb />compositorial
                        study" (p. 60). The attempt to define individual composi&#x002D;<lb />tors'
                        habits is only one kind of analysis, and <name type="pname">Dane's</name>
                        focus wavers between<lb />analytical bibliography in general and compositor
                        study in particular. He<lb />seems to have an irrational dislike for the
                        latter, saying "I have never be&#x002D;<lb />lieved in the virtues of
                        compositorial analysis" (p. 59) and "The habits of<lb />a compositor
                        &#x2026; are not interesting to me" (p. 70). He adds, irrelevantly,<lb />"I
                        cannot think of a single case where a significant Shakespeare word or<lb />phrase
                        is better documented because we have determined compositorial<lb />stints."
                        This statement, even if true, is irrelevant because (1) there is al&#x002D;<lb />ways
                        the possibility that such analysis might be productive in the hands of<lb />future
                        scholars, and (2) the value of an analytical technique does not turn<lb />on
                        its usefulness for establishing texts. Whatever can be learned about<lb />the
                        production of a book is a contribution to history, whether or not it<lb />helps
                        editors.</p>
                    <p>A far more consequential criticism of compositor study (at least when<lb />dependent
                        on variant spellings) has been offered by <name type="pname">Pervez Rizvi</name>
                        in "The<lb />Use of Spellings for Compositor Attribution in the First Folio" <hi
                            rend="italic">(Papers of<lb />the Bibliographical Society of <name
                                type="place">America</name></hi>, 110 [<date>2016</date>],
                        1&#x2013;53). After an amazingly<lb />thorough and fascinating analysis
                        (based on many more spellings than<lb />have conventionally been used), <name
                            type="pname">Rizvi</name> concludes that compositors' spell&#x002D;<lb />ings
                        were so variable as to "support or rebut almost any attribution" and <pb
                            n="64" /> thus to "call into question the point of doing this work at
                        all" (p. 43). The<lb />idea that individual compositors might have had no
                        fixed spelling prefer&#x002D;<lb />ences (and might have been influenced in
                        their choices by a great many<lb />factors, or simply the whim of the
                        moment) should not be surprising, for it<lb />accords with human nature. But
                        human beings have varying dispositions,<lb />and some compositors may
                        actually have had firm spelling habits; investi&#x002D;<lb />gating other
                        editions in the way <name type="pname">Rizvi</name> has examined the First
                        Folio would<lb />not necessarily prove inconclusive in every case. After
                        all, even within the<lb />Folio, the division of <hi rend="italic">Macbeth</hi>
                        between two compositors, first proposed in<lb /><date>1920</date>, "remains
                        unchallenged and still appears very convincing," accord&#x002D;<lb />ing to <name
                            type="pname">Rizvi</name> (p. 18). This degree of success may be rare,
                        but it is possible.<lb />Whether or not the tabulation of spellings (and
                        abbreviations, punctua&#x002D;<lb />tion, and spacing) results in a
                        convincing determination of compositorial<lb />divisions, it gives one
                        information, for the pervasive variation that defies<lb />interpretation is
                        itself a fact about the typesetting of a particular edition<lb />(and about
                        the historical development of written language). <name type="pname">Rizvi</name>
                        has<lb />provided bibliographers with a more comprehensive set of cautions
                        for<lb />pursuing this kind of work than they have had before. (The sensible
                        re&#x002D;<lb />quirements suggested by Mark Bland in <hi rend="italic">A
                        Guide to Early Printed Books and<lb />Manuscripts</hi> [<date>2010</date>],
                        pp. 139&#x2013;140, are commendable, but they should now<lb />be
                        supplemented by an awareness of <name type="pname">Rizvi's</name>
                        observations.)</p>
                    <p>Compositor analysis of all kinds has long been recognized as some&#x002D;<lb />what
                        more speculative than presswork analysis (though the latter is not<lb />without
                        its problems); but ruling out any potentially helpful approach is<lb />unwise.
                        A great deal of historical research in all fields leads to results that<lb />are
                        less than certain, but that is no reason to abandon it, when conducted<lb />responsibly
                        with awareness of the pitfalls. Books are full of traces of their<lb />own
                        production, and (as I have said many times) scholars must persist in<lb />making
                        every effort to tap this great body of evidence. The point has been<lb />especially
                        well argued by <name type="pname">David L. Vander Meulen</name> in "Thoughts
                        on the<lb />Future of Bibliographical Analysis" <hi rend="italic">(Papers of

                        17&#x2013;34); he concludes that it is "important to proceed<lb />with an
                        understanding of the role of the physical in human activity and<lb />the
                        role of physical evidence in revealing the past and understanding the<lb />present."
                        This is ultimately the reason that we must follow the clues we<lb />find in

<hi rend="italic">Blake and the Idea
                        of the Book</hi> (<date>1993</date>). Although his book<lb />deals with only
                        one process, relief etching, its first 150 pages describe that<lb />process
                        with a well&#x002D;illustrated account that is perhaps the most thorough<lb />exposition
                        of a graphic process ever written. The broader significance of<lb />the book
                        for bibliographers, however, is its thoughtful discussion of vari&#x002D;<lb />ants
                        among copies printed from the same plate. In the case of Blake's il&#x002D;<lb />lustrated
                        books, prints were produced in batches at discrete periods; each<lb />batch
                        has certain stylistic features (especially in coloring) that distinguish<lb />it,
                        and each subsumes various lesser variations. Although Viscomi calls<lb />these
                        batches "editions" (since "impressions" in graphic&#x002D;art terminology<lb />refers
                        to each "copy"), they clearly are analogous to what bibliographers<lb />of
                        printed books call "impressions" or "printings." The example of Blake<lb />is
                        of course unique in some ways, but Viscomi's approach to it provides a<lb />model
                        for thinking about variants in non&#x002D;letterpress material in general.<lb />As
                        I noted in my <date>1982</date> essay, bibliographers often need to relate a
                        given<lb />illustration (and different states of it that may appear in
                        different copies<lb />of an edition) to its history as an independent entity
                        (offered for sale on<lb />its own); and reading Viscomi can help a
                        bibliographer to approach this<lb />problem. (He also deals with the

                        Gaskell's</name> "Print&#x002D;<lb />ing House and Engraving Shop: A
                        Mysterious Collaboration" <hi rend="italic">(The Book<lb />Collector</hi>,
                        53 [<date>2004</date>], 213&#x2013;251). He begins by pointing out, quite
                        rightly,<lb />that bibliography has been verbal&#x002D;text&#x002D;oriented
                        and that "a bibliography<lb />of images" is needed, one that deals not only
                        with inserted illustrations<lb />but also those (even when produced on
                        different presses) that appear on<lb />the same pages as verbal text. His
                        approach thus moves a step beyond my<lb />essay, which was largely concerned
                        with inserted plates. After an account<lb />of the history and process of
                        copperplate printing (drawing on the early<lb />rolling&#x002D;press
                        manuals), Gaskell makes a number of observations based on<lb />an
                        examination of some seventeenth&#x002D;century books with engravings. He<lb />notes,
                        for example, that plates were usually printed on the mould side of<lb />the
                        paper, with chainlines parallel to the shorter sides of the image. The <pb
                            n="66" /> paper was usually different from that used for the letterpress
                        because the<lb />plates were normally printed by a different printer at a
                        different location,<lb />and often two or more images (sometimes intended
                        for different books)<lb />were printed on the same sheet; the plates for a
                        given book appear on<lb />mixed paper stocks somewhat more often than the
                        letterpress text does.</p>
                    <p>Descriptive bibliographers will be particularly interested in knowing<lb />(whether
                        or not the intended placement of plates was specified in print)<lb />that
                        printers occasionally put the plates in their proper positions before<lb />sending
                        the folded and gathered sheets to the binder (who, in first&#x002D;class<lb />work,
                        may have removed them before beating the sheets and then re&#x002D;<lb />placed
                        them). Sometimes engravings were printed on the same sheets as<lb />letterpress
                        text, and in those instances the letterpress was printed first,<lb />with
                        spaces left for the engravings, before the sheets were sent to the<lb />rolling&#x002D;press
                        printer (with faulty register a not uncommon result). It is<lb />worth
                        remembering, as Gaskell notes, that engravings would have been<lb />added to
                        the letterpress in a single press run for the whole edition and<lb />are
                        thus less likely to display variations than inserted plates, which could<lb />have
                        been printed before or after the letterpress and possibly in distinct<lb />batches.
                        Gaskell concludes with advice for descriptive bibliographers: that<lb />they
                        should record "the spatial relationship of graphics and verbal text,<lb />the
                        internal reference systems in use, [and] the placing and folding of the<lb />plates"
                        (p. 233), all of which help to reveal author' and publishers' inten<lb />tions.
                        Although Gaskell focuses on engravings, he includes a discussion<lb />of
                        woodcuts (pp. 232&#x2013;233) and believes that his approach is applicable<lb />to
                        lithography. His article should be required reading for all descriptive<lb />bibliographers
                        who deal with illustrated books.</p>
                    <p>A good analysis of an instance of adding an engraving to letterpress<lb />is
                        offered by <name type="pname">Randall McLeod</name> ("Orlando F. Booke") in
                        "IMAGIC: <hi rend="italic">a long<lb />discourse" (Studies in the Literary
                        Imagination</hi>, 32.1 [Spring <date>1999</date>], 190&#x2013;215).<lb />See
                        also Karen Bowen, "Illustrating Books with Engravings: Plantin's<lb />Working
                        Practices Revealed" <hi rend="italic">(Print Quarterly</hi>, 20 [<date>2003</date>],
                        3&#x2013;34). The pres&#x002D;<lb />ence of engravings on integral
                        letterpress leaves poses no problem for the<lb />letterpress collation
                        formula, since those leaves can simply be regarded<lb />as letterpress
                        leaves. But sometimes inserted leaves contain both letter&#x002D;<lb />press
                        and non&#x002D;letterpress, and the question of whether to report them in<lb />the
                        letterpress collation or the non&#x002D;letterpress collation was not taken
                        up<lb />in my <date>1982</date> essay. Therefore I will add here a generally
                        applicable rule<lb />of thumb: when the letterpress part consists of words
                        that connect with<lb />the verbal text on the adjacent pages, the insertion
                        belongs in the let&#x002D;<lb />terpress formula; but when the letterpress
                        part is directly related to the<lb />non&#x002D;letterpress image (as with a
                        caption) rather than to the surrounding<lb />verbal text, the insertion
                        belongs in the non&#x002D;letterpress formula. It should <pb n="67" /> also
                        be noted that sometimes a wholly letterpress insertion calls for the<lb />same
                        treatment as a non&#x002D;letterpress one&#x2014;when, for example, it
                        contains<lb />only a chart or a table, without verbal text connecting it to
                        the adjacent<lb />pages. (See also my comments, under "Collation" above,
                        regarding the<lb />role of textual content in structural formulas.)</p>

                        Davison</name> (<date>1992</date>),<lb />pp. 130&#x2013;141. Her survey of
                        cartobibliographical approaches to early<lb />maps shows that the emphasis
                        has often been on the production of indi&#x002D;<lb />vidual plates (and
                        their states) rather than on the published combinations<lb />of images
                        printed from the plates; but she recognizes that cartobibliog&#x002D;<lb />raphy
                        must combine these approaches, and she makes particularly clear<lb />the
                        difficulties of accounting for atlas editions made up of widely varying<lb />combinations
                        of states of plates. These difficulties have caused some car&#x002D;<lb />tobibliographers
                        to reject the term "edition"; but she believes that "the<lb />word
                        'edition', if sensibly applied, is still useful." She does not, however,<lb />formulate
                        her own definition of this or other terms, though she adds,<lb />"The
                        balance [in current usage] seems to be coming down in favour of<lb />defining
                        the word 'plate' as the equivalent of a book 'edition'" (p. 138).<lb />But
                        such a definition applies only to plates as independent entities, not<lb />to
                        the collections that form "books" (such as atlases). The random nature <pb
                            n="68" /> of the contents of many (or perhaps most)
                        pre&#x002D;nineteenth&#x002D;century atlases<lb />causes her to say that
                        "often only the title and text are the identifiers of<lb />some new stage in
                        their [the plates'] history"&#x2014;but that in itself points<lb />to a
                        distinct publishing effort that can define an edition of a book as a<lb />whole,
                        regardless of how many variants exist within it. As I pointed out<lb />in <date>
                        1982</date>, a basic complication of dealing with all non&#x002D;letterpress
                        contribu&#x002D;<lb />tions to books, not just maps, is that they often have
                        separate histories<lb />outside the books; but that complication does not
                        prevent the application<lb />of standard bibliographical classification both
                        to the printed plates and<lb />to the books. Bibliographers who wish to gain
                        additional background for<lb />thinking about these questions may find
                        Tyacke's essay useful.</p>
                    <p>An excellent example of a descriptive bibliography concerned with<lb />books
                        consisting entirely of engravings is <name type="pname">David Hunter's</name>
<hi
                            rend="italic">Opera and Song<lb />Books Published in <name type="place">
                        England</name>, <date>1703&#x2013;1726</date></hi> (<date>1997</date>). His
                        approach is notable for<lb />his recognition that "the standard techniques
                        of bibliographical descrip&#x002D;<lb />tion and the concepts of analytical
                        bibliography &#x2026; are applicable to<lb />non&#x002D;letterpress
                        material" (p. xxiv). They "have all been tested," he says (in<lb />his
                        thorough discussion of "Bibliographical Description" in his introduc&#x002D;<lb />tion,
                        pp. xxiv&#x002D;xxxvi), "and have been found to apply"&#x2014;with only a
                        few<lb />adjustments needed. One of them is that for these books an
                        impression<lb />(in the bibliographer's sense of the copies printed at one
                        time) is often<lb />distinguished by whether one or both sides of each leaf
                        were printed, or<lb />else by the use of modified "passe&#x002D;partout"
                        title pages (in which the plate<lb />has a blank space to be filled in,
                        usually with text from an extra small<lb />plate). These books represent the
                        earliest extensive use of passe&#x002D;partout<lb />title pages, which are
                        the most distinctive feature that Hunter had to<lb />deal with. To
                        accommodate them, he created two new symbols for use<lb />in
                        title&#x002D;page transcriptions to mark the beginnings and ends of the
                        blank<lb />spaces. Other small modifications arise from the fact that these
                        books are<lb />made up primarily of disjunct leaves printed one at a time,
                        and often on<lb />only one side. Bibliographers dealing with the same kind
                        of books will be<lb />helped by examining Hunter's thoughtful practice,
                        whether or not they<lb />decide to follow it in every respect.</p>
                    <p>An article expressing the same conclusion as Hunter's&#x2014;that "the<lb />standard
                        methods of descriptive bibliography" can be used in dealing<lb />with
                        engraved matter&#x2014;is <name type="pname">Ronald K. Smeltzer's</name>

                        The difference here is that Smeltzer focuses on verbal&#x002D;text books<lb />printed
                        entirely from intaglio plates, with each plate being made up of<lb />multiple
                        text&#x002D;pages arranged for folding into gatherings (and even bearing<lb />signatures).
                        Obviously the structure of such books can be represented by<lb />the usual
                        style of formula that is regularly employed for letterpress books.<lb /><name
                            type="pname">Smeltzer's</name> only innovation arises from the fact that
                        the book he chooses <pb n="69" /> to describe has three inserted letterpress
                        leaves of verbal text, and he<lb />proposes noting them within the formula
                        in bold&#x002D;face type, to distinguish<lb />them from the
                        intaglio&#x002D;printed leaves. This suggestion seems appropri&#x002D;<lb />ate
                        in such an instance, for nothing would be gained (and indeed some<lb />clarity
                        lost) by creating a second formula for the few letterpress leaves<lb />of
                        verbal text. Thus there can be occasions on which it is not
                        objection&#x002D;<lb />able to report the products of two different printing
                        processes in a single<lb />formula, as long as the two are clearly
                        distinguished. The nature of the<lb />content of the inserted leaves is
                        likely to play a role, as I suggested above<lb />in connection with leaves

                    <p>When descriptive bibliographies are conceived as records of books as<lb />published,
                        and thus as contributions to publishing history, the only bind&#x002D;<lb />ings
                        that are relevant to the basic descriptions are those commissioned by<lb />publishers
                        as the outward form in which their books were to be offered <pb n="70" /> to
                        the public. In practice, therefore, most descriptive bibliographies of<lb />authors,
                        printers, publishers, and subjects (as opposed to catalogues of<lb />specific
                        collections) provide binding descriptions only for books published<lb />in
                        edition&#x002D;bindings, which became common in the <date>1820</date>s.
                        Before that<lb />time, however, booksellers (or others fulfilling the
                        publishing function)<lb />did apparently often place portions of some
                        editions on sale in a form of<lb />temporary or unfinished binding; and when
                        such bindings can be identi&#x002D;<lb />fied (as with the
                        boards&#x002D;and&#x002D;label style of the late eighteenth and early<lb />nineteenth
                        centuries), they would properly be included in basic descrip&#x002D;<lb />tions.

                        below). Such accounts, when they exist, are usually<lb />very brief; the
                        place where more detailed descriptions of custom bindings<lb />occur is in
                        catalogues of collections, where the focus is on the particular<lb />copies

                    <p>In the strictest sense, publishers' "bindings" are not bindings but rather<lb />casings,
                        since the cloth&#x002D;covered boards and spine constitute a case that<lb />is
                        manufactured separately and into which the sheets are fastened. But<lb />the
                        term "publisher's binding" (or "edition&#x002D;binding") is widely used and <pb
                            n="71" /> understood, and there is no need to insist on replacing it
                        with "casing" or<lb />"case." The description of publishers' bindings
                        requires a means for citing<lb />colors and cloth grains; describing
                        endpapers also entails noting colors<lb />and sometimes (in the case of
                        marbled papers) the various patterns that<lb />marblers have traditionally
                        used; and accounting for jackets obviously in&#x002D;<lb />cludes the
                        identification of colors. I took these matters up in three essays,<lb />on
                        color (<date>1967</date>), patterns (<date>1970</date>), and jackets (<date>

                        <p><name type="pname">Abbott</name> also explained some of the mistakes made
                            in those bibliog&#x002D;<lb />raphies in the use of the charts, the most
                            basic one being a failure to<lb />understand that each chip represents
                            the center of the color&#x002D;name block<lb />designated by the
                            accompanying number and abbreviated name. Thus<lb />bibliographers who
                            say their matches are inexact do not recognize that<lb />their choice of
                            the closest match in each case does in fact provide an<lb />exact match
                            to the area surrounding the centroid chip. I made this point<lb />in <date>
                            1967</date>, but it cannot be stated too often, considering how
                            frequently<lb />bibliographers have misunderstood it. (Although <name
                                type="pname">Abbott</name> objects to the<lb />phrase "centroid
                            number"&#x2014;and the citation of a specific number in the<lb />form
                            "Centroid 191"&#x2014;as indicative of this confusion, I think the usage<lb />can
                            be condoned as a shorthand version of "the number associated with<lb />a
                            chip in the <hi rend="italic">ISCC&#x002D;NBS Centroid Color Charts</hi>
                            .") <name type="pname">Abbott</name> further notes that<lb />bibliographers
                            have sometimes misinterpreted the abbreviations assigned<lb />to the
                            color&#x002D;name blocks and expanded them improperly&#x2014;not
                            realizing,<lb />for instance, that lower&#x002D;case letters indicate
                            the "&#x002D;ish" form of a color<lb />name (so that "yG," yellowish
                            green, is a different color from "YG," yel&#x002D;<lb />low green). As <name
                                type="pname">Abbott</name> observes, many bibliographers have
                            seemingly used<lb />the charts without consulting the related
                            ISCC&#x002D;NBS dictionary, where <pb n="72" /> the system used in the
                            color&#x002D;name abbreviations is explained. His article<lb />provides
                            some useful cautions for bibliographers wishing to employ the<lb /><hi

                        <p>One of the requirements I formulated for an appropriate color&#x002D;<lb />matching
                            system was that there should be "strong assurance of continued<lb />availability
                            in the future." Because the <hi rend="italic">Centroid Color Charts</hi>
                            were published<lb />by the National Bureau of Standards (NBS), I
                            believed that they met this<lb />requirement. Unfortunately, however, in <date>
                            1983</date> the NBS discontinued their<lb />sale, pending the results of
                            a test of the stability of the color chips by the<lb />color consultant <name

                            Materials</hi><lb />and in the March <date>1984</date> price list, they
                            did not appear in the October<lb /><date>1984</date> price list and have
                            not been available from the NBS since then. On<lb />6 April <date>1984</date>
                            I wrote a long letter to <name type="pname">Richard W. Seward</name> of
                            the Standard<lb />Reference Materials section, explaining why the charts
                            were essential for<lb />bibliographical work and (recognizing that
                            bibliographers formed a small<lb />constituency) making the obvious
                            point that a color standard was needed<lb />in many areas of endeavor.
                            It seemed to me, I said, that a "national<lb />bureau of standards"
                            could be expected to provide a standard for color<lb />designations. I
                            received no reply, and three months later (on 9 July <date>1984</date>)<lb />I
                            telephoned <name type="pname">Stanley D. Rasberry</name>, chief of the
                            Office of Standard Refer&#x002D;<lb />ence Materials, with whom I had a
                            cordial but unencouraging conversa&#x002D;<lb />tion. He confirmed that
                            distribution of the charts had stopped, and he<lb />said that the only
                            hope for any resumed production (since the NBS did<lb />not have its own
                            color laboratory) was the receipt of private funding.</p>
                        <p>There the matter has rested, except that over the years several persons<lb />associated
                            with the development of the charts have privately sold copies<lb />from
                            the small stock that remained (after the distribution of many
                            cop&#x002D;<lb />ies by the NBS), out of an original edition of 20,000.
                            The most recent<lb />of those persons has been <name type="pname">Nick

                        <p>The significant color&#x002D;chip shifts discovered in <date>1984</date>&#x2014;that
                            is, the<lb />twenty&#x002D;seven that shifted from one color&#x002D;name
                            block to another&#x2014;are as<lb />follows: the chip for block 24
                            shifted to block 235; 56 to 59; 59 to 62; 75<lb />to 78; 108 to 110; 118
                            to 125; 126 to 138; 129 to 131; 139 to 141; 147 to<lb />166; 194 to 197;
                            195 to 199; 196 to 200; 197 to 201; 198 to 202; 200 to 204;<lb />206 to
                            210; 208 to 212; 213 to 202; 215 to 229; 218 to 223; 220 to 225;<lb />221
                            to 226; 225 to 243; 239 to 259; 247 to 250; and 257 to 260. Persons<lb />who
                            consult descriptive bibliographies that cite centroid numbers (and<lb />the
                            corresponding color names) should be aware that these
                            twenty&#x002D;seven<lb />numbers may not be accurate (depending on the
                            date of the bibliogra&#x002D;<lb />pher's work). But given the
                            approximate nature of such citations in the<lb />first place, along with
                            the fact that the only major chip shifts are to closely<lb />related
                            color blocks, the shifting is not likely to render any previously<lb />written
                            description seriously defective. The copies of the charts that are<lb />used
                            in connection with reading these bibliographies may not of course<lb />precisely
                            match those that were used by the bibliographers, but this situ&#x002D;<lb />ation
                            is not a serious problem. In <date>2003</date>, <name type="pname">Hale</name>
                            expressed the belief, based<lb />on his long experience, that the chips
                            had probably changed very little<lb />since <date>1984</date> and thus
                            were still usable.</p>
                        <p>Whether new descriptions, however, should be based on the <hi
                                rend="italic">Centroid<lb />Charts</hi> is a question that one might
                            at first think ought to be answered in<lb />the negative. After all,
                            they are not readily available, and at least twenty&#x002D;<lb />seven
                            of the samples in them are not accurate. But it may be that there is<lb />no
                            satisfactory alternative from a practical point of view. The two main<lb />contenders
                            are the charts produced by the Munsell Color Company and<lb />by
                            Pantone, Inc. Munsell has tradition behind it, since the Munsell system<lb />is
                            the fundamental one of the twentieth century (see my discussion of it in<lb />
                            the <date>1967</date> essay) and is in fact the system on which the
                            centroid sampling of<lb />the color solid is based. And the <hi
                                rend="italic">Munsell Book of Color</hi> is published in two<lb />editions,
                            one with glossy and the other with matte samples (over <date>1600</date>
                            of<lb />them). The fact that matte samples are available and that the
                            samples are<lb />removable makes the <hi rend="italic">Munsell Book</hi>
                            especially appropriate for bibliographi&#x002D;<lb />cal use (and it is
                            indeed widely employed for scientific as well as industrial<lb />purposes).
                            It is unwieldy, however, and at present each edition costs about<lb />$1000.
                            It is not suitable for bibliographers to carry easily with them,<lb />and
                            most will not wish to spend the money on a copy. Libraries could<lb />of
                            course be encouraged to purchase copies for their
                            special&#x002D;collections<lb />reading rooms, but inevitably
                            bibliographers will still find many places<lb />without a copy.</p>
                        <p>Pantone is more commercially oriented than Munsell, but bibliogra&#x002D;<lb />phers
                            will be interested in the fact that the Pantone system is frequently<lb />used
                            in the graphic&#x002D;design and printing industries. There is a wide
                            variety<lb />of Pantone Matching System Color Guides for different
                            purposes; most <pb n="74" /> take the form of fans (some with over 1700
                            colors), provide either coated<lb />or uncoated samples, identify each
                            one with a Pantone number and name,<lb />and cost in the
                            $100&#x2013;$500 range. A loose&#x002D;leaf book is also available, as<lb />well
                            as apps for mobile devices. And there are several websites (such as<lb />www.pantone&#x002D;colours.com)
                            that offer comprehensive showings of Pan&#x002D;<lb />tone colors, each
                            labeled only with a Pantone number; but matching to<lb />a computer
                            screen is not recommended, since colors can vary from one<lb />screen to
                            another. (Pantone is a subsidiary of X&#x002D;Rite, which offers
                            spec&#x002D;<lb />trophotometers, but besides their costliness they go
                            beyond the specificity<lb />required for bibliography.) A compact and
                            convenient book does exist,<lb />called <hi rend="italic">The Pantone
                            Book of Color</hi> (<date>1990</date>), by <name type="pname">Leatrice
                            Eiseman</name> and <name type="pname">Lawrence Herbert</name>, who
                            provide an informative introduction. It displays 1024 col&#x002D;<lb />ors
                            labeled with Pantone numbers and with names; the Pantone names,<lb />however,
                            are often fanciful&#x2014;such as "dusty jade green" or "moonlite<lb />mauve"
                            or "apricot wash"&#x2014;and are not appropriate for bibliographical<lb />
                            citation.</p>
                        <p>The matter of naming is vitally important, since a description must<lb />enable
                            one to visualize a color without recourse to a chart (though a chip<lb />number
                            is there for times when greater precision is needed). The merit<lb />of
                            the ISCC&#x002D;NBS naming system (used in the <hi rend="italic">Centroid
                            Charts</hi>) is that only<lb />commonly understood adjectives are used.
                            The ISCC&#x002D;NBS dictionary<lb />(discussed in my essay) enables one
                            to convert Munsell notations as well<lb />as centroid numbers to the
                            standard color names; but the use of Pantone<lb />numbers (though it
                            would allow easy access to an approximation of the<lb />colors on the
                            internet) would not accommodate the use of those names.<lb />Taking all
                            these considerations into account, bibliographers would be<lb />well
                            advised to follow one of two courses. (1) Continue to use the <hi
                                rend="italic">Centroid<lb />Charts</hi>, since 89.2% of the chips
                            are probably still accurate (in that any<lb />shifting has not moved
                            them out of their color&#x002D;name blocks) and since the<lb />other
                            10.8% can be assumed to have shifted to such closely related
                            color&#x002D;<lb />name blocks as not to invalidate a description (which
                            in any case refers to<lb />a segment of the color solid, not a single
                            point). (2) Use the <hi rend="italic">Munsell Book<lb />of Color</hi>
                            when convenient to do so, supplementing it at other times with<lb />the <hi
                                rend="italic">Centroid Charts;</hi> combining the two in a single
                            bibliography poses no<lb />problem as long as all the names are
                            expressed in the ISCC&#x002D;NBS standard<lb />forms. Besides the
                            ISCC&#x002D;NBS dictionary, another source for the equiva&#x002D;<lb />lences
                            is a website provided by the Texas Precancel Club, which lists the<lb />centroid
                            numbers and names along with the equivalent Munsell nota&#x002D;<lb />tions
                            and small color samples: search the internet for "NBS/ISCC Color<lb />System
                            &#x002D; Tx4.us", or use "tx4.us/nbs&#x002D;iscc.htm". An example of a
                            bibliog&#x002D;<lb />raphy that uses the centroid system and also
                            supplies the corresponding<lb />Munsell notation in each instance (as

                            wealth of information that is beginning to make possible a more detailed<lb />understanding
                            of the history of publishers' bindings and a more exact<lb />determination

                            containing actual&#x002D;size color<lb />photographs of 125 grain
                            patterns (plus six variants)&#x2014;far more than have<lb />been
                            published in previous sets of photographs for bibliographical use.<lb /><name
                                type="pname">Krupp</name> thinks of her book as a "'field guide' for
                            identifying and dating<lb />nineteenth&#x002D;century bookcloth."</p>
                        <p>Each photograph is labeled with a reference code and a descriptive<lb />name.
                            The basic names are the ones previously used by <name type="pname">

                                type="pname">Gaskell</name>, <name type="pname">Ball</name>, and me,
                            though some of the modifying adjectives are new,<lb />and "moir&#x00E9;"
                            is taken as a family name, not a modifier. (<name type="pname">Krupp</name>
                            claims that<lb />I use "a different approach"&#x2014;different from
                            supplying names&#x2014;by as&#x002D;<lb />signing "letter and number
                            codes"; but I emphasized in my essay, as I do<lb />again now, the
                            importance of a standard terminology consisting of com&#x002D;<lb />monly
                            understood words.) The codes consist of three&#x002D;letter
                            abbreviations<lb />of the grain families, with attached numbers
                            reflecting the arbitrary order<lb />of the photographs within each
                            family. Thus "Ban8: Fine dotted ribbon"<lb />is the eighth photograph in
                            the section devoted to the "Bands" family, and<lb />"Wav3: Diagonal
                            wave" is the third in the "Waves" section. The twelve<lb />families are
                            Bands; Beads; Diapers and Diamonds; Hexagonal; Leather<lb />Textures;
                            Moir&#x00E9;; Nets and Meshes; Ribs; Ripples; Sand, Pebble, Bubble;<lb />Waves;
                            and Weaves and Checkerboards&#x2014;supplemented with a "Miscel&#x002D;<lb />laneous"
                            section and one called "Winterbottom," which shows sixteen <pb n="76" />
                            grains from the Winterbottom Book Cloth Company's swatchbooks that<lb />have
                            appeared in reference works and thatrepresent versions of patterns<lb />used
                            in the late nineteenth or early twentieth centuries. This "Catalogue"<lb />is
                            accompanied by a "Table of Nineteenth&#x002D;Century Bookcloth Grains,"<lb />which
                            for each grain states thenumber of examples thus far entered in the<lb />database
                            and their date range (extremely useful information) and then, for<lb />any
                            grain illustrated in one of seven previously published sets of
                            photo&#x002D;<lb />graphs (Carter, Sadleir, <hi rend="italic">BAL</hi>,
                            Tanselle, Gaskell, Ball, and Winterbottom),<lb />gives the corresponding
                            notations. There is also a separate set of color<lb />photographs called
                            "Catalogue of Nineteenth&#x002D;Century Ribbon&#x002D;Embossed<lb />Bookcloth,"
                            consisting of 122 examples (plus six variants) of abstract, flo&#x002D;<lb />ral,
                            and geometric patterns that are "larger than 6 mm. per repeat."</p>
                        <p>The result is a reference work that surpasses in various respects
                            any&#x002D;<lb />thing available before&#x2014;though any of the earlier
                            reference works can<lb />still be used, preferably with <name
                                type="pname">Krupp</name> numbers also cited (and her "Ta&#x002D;<lb />ble"
                            makes it relatively easy to give such correspondences). But
                            inevi&#x002D;<lb />tably questions may be raised. Although <name
                                type="pname">Krupp</name> has not tried to create<lb />a logically
                            comprehensive system of classification (simply listing families<lb />of
                            patterns in alphabetical order), one may still question the inclusion<lb />of
                            a "Miscellaneous" section. And the "Winterbottom" section results<lb />from
                            her belief that merging <name type="pname">Winterbottom's</name> late
                            nineteenth&#x002D;and early<lb />twentieth&#x002D;century versions of
                            patterns into the sections displaying earlier<lb />versions would be
                            misleading. But its presence shows that the "Catalogue<lb />of
                            Nineteenth&#x002D;Century Bookcloth Grains"is not meant to<lb />be
                            limited to the <date>1823&#x2013;50</date> period (the dates in the
                            title of the book), even though the<lb />bulk of the examples in the
                            "Catalogue" (and "Database") are from be&#x002D;<lb />fore <date>1869</date>,
                            reflecting thework thus far done with the holdings of the Li&#x002D;<lb />brary
                            Company. The insertion of the Winterbottom examples in their<lb />proper
                            places, however, would not mislead anyone since their dates (like<lb />the
                            dates of all the other examples) are included in the "Table"&#x2014;and<lb />perhaps
                            all the dates should be given in the captions to the photographs<lb />as
                            well. Taking this step would make clearer the way in which <name
                                type="pname">Krupp's</name><lb />"Catalogue" can gradually be
                            expanded in the future.</p>
                        <p>The same thoughts are raised by <name type="pname">Krupp's</name>
                            segregation of ribbon&#x002D;<lb />embossed patterns into a separate
                            catalogue, using a different style of<lb />codes for patterns (and for
                            variants) and providing no names. She rec&#x002D;<lb />ognizes that
                            "another option would be to give each pattern a name (or a<lb />code)
                            and integrate them fully into one large table&#x2026;. There is
                            certainly<lb />much more work to be done in that area than the amount of
                            attention I<lb />have given them here" (p. 16). It is worth noting that
                            when she generalizes<lb />about the number of patterns, she does include
                            ribbon&#x002D;embossed exam&#x002D;<lb />ples in the totals. (One could
                            argue, as I did in note 16 of my 1970 essay, <pb n="77" /> that
                            ribbon&#x002D;embossed patterns might more feasibly be described
                            individu&#x002D;<lb />ally for each book; yet ribbon&#x002D;embossed
                            patterns, being a characteristic of<lb />cloths prior to their use on
                            individual books,can logically be distinguished<lb />from the frames and
                            lettering stamped into the cloth for those books. I will<lb />add here
                            that the basic cloth weave can be a distinguishing feature even<lb />for
                            embossed cloth and should not be overlooked when examining the<lb />embossed
                            pattern.) Incorporating the "Miscellaneous," "Winterbottom,"<lb />and
                            ribbon&#x002D;embossed examples into the main body of the "Catalogue"<lb />would
                            be a first step toward making <name type="pname">Krupp's</name> system
                            (however arbitrary) a<lb />more welcoming and appropriate framework for
                            future expansion.</p>
                        <p>The most important discussion of <name type="pname">Krupp's</name> work
                            is <name type="pname">B. J. McMullin's</name><lb />"Patterned Book
                            Cloth: A Review Essay," in <hi rend="italic">Script &amp; Print</hi>, 32
                            (2008),<lb />163&#x2013;175. After a historical sketch of the
                            development of bibliographical<lb />thinking on the subject (containing
                            some trenchant observations), <name type="pname">McMul&#x002D;</name><lb /><name
                                type="pname">lin</name> brings up the basic problem raised by the
                            proliferation of examples<lb />shown by <name type="pname">Krupp</name>:
                            should the set of photographs be indefinitely expanded<lb />as
                            additional grains and variants are noted that do not precisely match<lb />any
                            of those already illustrated? The fact that some patterns are provided<lb />with
                            an additional photograph or two labeled "var1" or "var2" implies<lb />that
                            such expansion is expected. It is not clear, however, why additional<lb />photographs
                            would necessarily be preferable to added words for this pur&#x002D;<lb />pose.
                            As <name type="pname">McMullin</name> notes, the situation is epitomized
                            in the "diaper" cat&#x002D;<lb />egory, where the illustrations are for
                            ultra&#x002D;fine diaper (defined as 20&#x2013;22<lb />units
                            percentimeter), fine (10&#x2013;15/cm.), medium (8&#x2013;9/cm.), coarse
                            and<lb />smooth (4/cm. each), and (anomalously)"5.5 diaper." The
                            precedent set<lb />here would require more photographs for diapers that
                            fall between 15 and<lb />20 units per centimeter, or between 4 and 8
                            (except for 5.5). But a series<lb />of illustrations accomplishes
                            nothing more than is achieved by simply using<lb />the word "diaper"
                            followed by the measurement. A photograph of diaper<lb />would still be
                            needed, but additional photographs serve no purpose (and<lb />indeed can
                            be a complication, since the closest match at one time might<lb />no
                            longer be the closest match after the insertion of morephotographs).<lb />The
                            "Beads," "Nets," and "Ribs" categories offer exactly the same
                            situ&#x002D;<lb />ation, but in all categories the adjectives of degree
                            ("coarse," "fine," etc.)<lb />do not cover all the possibilities.</p>
                        <p>Such omissions occur, of course, because the photographs represent<lb />the
                            books thus far examined for the "Database"; but a comprehensive<lb />"field
                            guide" to a class of artifacts cannot be constructed in that way<lb />because,
                            even at the price of continued revisions, it will always be
                            unsat&#x002D;<lb />isfying in certain situations. The "Database" itself
                            is a great accomplish&#x002D;<lb />ment; and as it
                            grows&#x2014;incorporating, one hopes, records from many<lb />collections
                            other than the Library Company's&#x2014;it will become even more <pb
                                n="78" /> comprehensive as a record from which historical accounts
                            of publishers'<lb />bindings can be drawn. And it is appropriate that a
                            field guide should be<lb />a by&#x002D;product of such a database. But
                            the relation between the two needs<lb />to be further thought through.
                            In one respect the field guide is bound<lb />to grow as the database
                            does, because a field guide should illustrate all<lb />distinct
                            patterns, however rarely used some of them are. But in another<lb />respect
                            it should not grow, for if it attempts to register variations of
                            dis&#x002D;<lb />tinctpatterns it will become more bewildering than
                            helpful. Deciding<lb />which patterns are "distinct" may to some extent
                            be debatable, but it is<lb />not nearly as intractable a problem as
                            defining variations within them,<lb />since the latter are nearly
                            infinite in number. A classification scheme, by<lb />definition, should
                            deal with diversity not by reproducing it but by pro&#x002D;<lb />viding
                            a path through it. Contrasting the classification of bookcloth with<lb />that
                            of color helps to illustrate the problem. As I pointed out in my 1970<lb />essay,
                            color is anatural phenomenon with definite limits and a continuum<lb />within
                            those limits; one can thus scientifically sample that continuum at<lb />spatial
                            intervals. Cloth patterns do not offer this opportunity, for it is<lb />not
                            possible to determine "centroids" within their variations. One can of<lb />course
                            subdivide patterns according to measurements of their repeated<lb />units,
                            as <name type="pname">Krupp</name> has done in a few instances (though
                            her measurements are<lb />not based on regular intervals); but, given
                            the essential difference between<lb />patterns and color, the result
                            would not provide a necessary visual aid,<lb />as centroid colors do.</p>
                        <p>Since the large number of photographs in <name type="pname">Krupp's</name>
                            "Catalogue" is not<lb />entirely an advantage, bibliographers may well
                            find it preferable to limit<lb />themselves primarily to her examples
                            inwhich the name of the grain<lb />has no adjective or measurement
                            attached and then to add whatever<lb />modifiers seem necessary on a
                            given occasion&#x2014;as in "coarse (8/cm.) Rib<lb />(cf. <name
                                type="pname">Krupp</name> Rib3)." The fact that <name type="pname">
                            Krupp's</name> photographs are actual size al&#x002D;<lb />lows one to
                            know(through direct measurement of unit&#x002D;repeats in cases<lb />where
                            a measurement is not stated) the norm fromwhich "coarse" and<lb />"fine"
                            variants depart. (The use of "cf." in my example seems desirable,<lb />though
                            it differs slightly from my 1970 suggestion. Even when the specific<lb />variant
                            is pictured in <name type="pname">Krupp</name>. it might be better to
                            cite only the <name type="pname">Krupp</name><lb />photograph of the
                            basic pattern, both for uniformity and to allow for<lb />possible future
                            revisions in <name type="pname">Krupp's</name> "Catalogue.")
                            Bibliographers could<lb />also do their matching against the photographs
                            I have published or those<lb />provided by <name type="pname">Gaskell</name>
                            (see below), since the smaller number of examples in<lb />those sets (36
                            and 29 respectively) do after all include the great majority<lb />of
                            patterns found on nineteenth&#x002D;century books and since the basic
                            names<lb />given in them are the same as those used by <name
                                type="pname">Krupp</name>.</p>
                        <p>This last point is not crucial, however, because <name type="pname">
                            Krupp's</name> "Table" al&#x002D;<lb />lows one, when consulting (or
                            writing) a bibliography employing any of <pb n="79" /> seven sets of
                            photographs other than hers, to find a picture of the cited<lb />grain
                            in the "Catalogue"&#x2014;and to find it online. Indeed, it is the
                            presence<lb />online of the "Catalogue" (along with the associated
                            "Database") that<lb />makes <name type="pname">Krupp</name> seem the
                            most convenient reference for bibliographers to<lb />cite, despite its
                            limitations. One hopes that the "Table" will be added to<lb />the online
                            resources, since without it one still has to turn to the printed<lb />book
                            (or article) to make conversions between <name type="pname">Krupp's</name>
                            code and earlier<lb />ones and to learn the date range of each grain;
                            and the measurement of<lb />repeated units in every grain should be
                            stated, since the pictures on the<lb />website are no longer actual
                            size.Presumably the online version will be<lb />continuously revised to
                            incorporate new grains (as the database grows)<lb />and perhaps to
                            rectify some of the flaws in the printed versions. Most<lb />bibliographers
                            and users of bibliographies are likely to have a portable<lb />electronic
                            device at hand as they examine books, or will not find it incon&#x002D;<lb />venient
                            to make sure that they do.</p>
                        <p>Bibliographers should be aware of two other very large databases of<lb />bindings
                            that allow for searching by a particular cloth grain; although<lb />they
                            give one access to many images of bindings, neither is as appropriate<lb />as
                            the Library Company's for bibliographers to use as a basic reference<lb />in
                            identifying the cloth on a book in hand. One is "Publishers' Bindings<lb />
                            Online <date>1815&#x2013;1930</date>: The Art of Books" (on the website
                            of theUniversity<lb />of Alabama Library and the University of
                            Wisconsin&#x2014;Madison Library,<lb />the partners in this project). It
                            does provide (under "Research Tools") a<lb />"Gallery of
                            Book&#x002D;Cloth Grain Patterns" showing fifteen basic grains
                            la&#x002D;<lb />beled with standard names; each image can be enlarged
                            and offers a link<lb />for searching the database for examples of books
                            bound in that cloth. The<lb />notes on each book include the color and
                            grain of the binding but do not<lb />come close to providing the amount
                            of technical detail about binding and<lb />endpaper structure that the
                            Library Company database does. Its emphasis<lb />is not primarily on
                            bibliographical research (there are artistic, historical,<lb />and
                            literary "galleries," each with essays and teaching tools), but it does<lb />offer
                            a "gallery" of bindings by decade, accompanied by commentary.<lb />The
                            other database is the British Library's "Database of Bookbindings"<lb />(on
                            the Library's website, under "Catalogues," then "Bookbindings"),<lb />which
                            has excellent technical notes, including the identification of cloth<lb />grains
                            bystandard names. But since it covers the whole history of book&#x002D;<lb />binding
                            as represented in the Library's collections, it contains a relatively<lb />small
                            selection of publishers' cloth bindings, and it provides only a verbal<lb />(not
                            a pictorial) guide to cloth&#x002D;grain names for purposes of
                            searching.</p>
                        <p>In addition to <name type="pname">Krupp</name>. there are three other
                            significant post&#x002D;1970 treat&#x002D;<lb />ments of cloth grains.
                            Two years after my essay, <name type="pname">Philip Gaskell's</name>
<hi
                                rend="italic">A New</hi><lb /><hi rend="italic">Introduction to
                            Bibliography</hi> (1972, 1974) appeared, containing a section on<lb />"Publisher's
                            Cloth in Britain and America" (pp. 238&#x2013;247). Besides giving <pb
                                n="80" /> a compact history of the development of cloth bindings
                            (and summarizing<lb />the ISCC&#x002D;NBS color system), <name
                                type="pname">Gaskell</name> provides a classification of grains<lb />and
                            a set of photographs. He follows ingeneral my system of classifi&#x002D;<lb />cation
                            and the naming of individual grains, though he leaves out one<lb />("weave"),
                            adds four ("beaded&#x002D;line," "crocodile," "crackle," and "frond"),<lb />and
                            moves two to a different family ("bubble" becomes one of the
                            "sand&#x002D;<lb />texture" grains, and "cord" becomes
                            "ribbed&#x002D;morocco" under "leather&#x002D;<lb />texture"). As for
                            associated codes, <name type="pname">Gaskell</name> simply assigns each
                            photograph<lb />a number according to its place in the sequence of
                            illustrations in his book<lb />as a whole (beginning with "Fig. 84").
                            Thus his codes (unlike mine) do not<lb />reflect a classification
                            scheme; butthat fact is of little significance since<lb />the order of
                            the photographs (unlike <name type="pname">Krupp's</name> arbitrary
                            order) does follow<lb />his classification and brings related families
                            together.</p>
                        <p>Sensibly he provides only a single photograph for each basic
                            pattern&#x2014;<lb />that is, only for grains whose names do not have
                            adjectives of degree at&#x002D;<lb />tached to them. He understands that
                            grains "notably <hi rend="italic">fine</hi> or <hi rend="italic">coarse</hi>,"
                            for<lb />example, can be specified in words, without the presence of
                            photographs<lb />(even though, as in all systems, the norm represented
                            by each photograph<lb />hasnot been precisely determined). My 1970 set
                            of photographs does<lb />include a few fine, coarse, diagonal, and
                            moir&#x00E9; examples for illustrative<lb />purposes but without
                            suggesting that such photographs are necessary: I<lb />made clear that
                            adjectives should be attached (as needed by the level of<lb />precision
                            required) even when there is no matching photograph&#x2014;and<lb />that,
                            when still greater precision is desirable, a bibliographer may have<lb />to
                            supply one or more additional photographs. The only thing I would<lb />now
                            add&#x2014;whether one is using my system or <name type="pname">Gaskell</name>'s
                            or <name type="pname">Krupp's</name>&#x2014;is<lb />that the greater
                            precision sometimes needed to distinguish, for example,<lb />separate
                            bindings&#x002D;up (or secondary bindings) can often best be achieved<lb />by
                            providing a measurement. On the subject of measurement, I should<lb />perhaps
                            say that when a published photograph is intended only for gen&#x002D;<lb />eral
                            matching of a type of design (as opposed to serving as a record of<lb />the
                            binding of a specific book), one does not need to know whether the<lb />photograph
                            is actual size or not; but a measurement scale attached to<lb />a
                            photograph (as in <name type="pname">Krupp's</name> basic catalogue but
                            not her catalogue of<lb />ribbon&#x002D;embossed patterns) is
                            nevertheless helpful in determining when a<lb />match has been made.</p>
                        <p>Thirteen years after <name type="pname">Gaskell</name>'s book, <name
                                type="pname">Douglas Ball</name> published <hi rend="italic">
                            Victorian</hi><lb /><hi rend="italic">Publishers' Bindings</hi> (1985),
                            a thoughtful and well&#x002D;documented study that<lb />includes a
                            chapter entitled "The Decoration and Graining of Cloth and<lb />ItsBibliographical
                            Importance" (pp. 24&#x2013;31). In that chapter, Ball points<lb />out
                            the potential (but not always conclusive) role of precise grain
                            identifi&#x002D;<lb />cations in the process of distinguishing and
                            dating separate bindings&#x002D;up; <pb n="81" /> and he assesses
                            previous bibliographers' presentations of photographs and<lb />names of
                            grains. But the most useful parts of his book for descriptive<lb />bibliographers
                            are two of the appendixes. The first, "Identification of<lb />Cloth
                            Grains" (pp. 123&#x2013;129), besides pursuing in more detail the
                            limita&#x002D;<lb />tions of some ofthe previously published photographs
                            and the variations<lb />in assigned names, offers descriptive comments
                            on the basic families of<lb />patterns. One of the emphases
                            throughout&#x2014;and properly so&#x2014;is on the<lb />importance of
                            measuring the frequency of repeated elements in designs<lb />in order to
                            give precision to any modifying adjectives and the norms<lb />they
                            relate to. He suggests approximate norms for rib grain (11 repeats<lb />per
                            centimeter), ripple (25+/cm.), dot&#x002D;and&#x002D;line (perhaps
                            2.5&#x2013;3.5/cm.),<lb />checkerboard (perhaps 4/cm.), diaper (6/cm.),
                            and bead (5.5/cm.). Then<lb />he offers a particularly helpful
                            discussion of the morocco family (pp. 126&#x2013;<lb />128), dividing
                            those with "linearly directional" ribs into ribbed morocco<lb />(with
                            basically continuous ribs and converging channels, 8&#x2013;9/cm.), cord<lb />(with
                            ribs separated by cross&#x002D;creases, 8&#x2013;9/cm.), and parallel
                            cord (with<lb />channels that generally do not converge). These
                            measurements may be of<lb />use to bibliographers in deciding when to
                            add such adjectives as "fine";<lb />but those adjectives can merely be
                            suggestive, and precision can come<lb />only with appended measurements.
                            The second appendix, "Further Data<lb />on Grains" (pp. 130&#x2013;142),
                            consists of two parts, the first being a table of<lb />"Dates and
                            Frequency of Use" (pp. 132&#x2013;136), which assembles informa&#x002D;<lb />tion
                            drawn from some 2600 entries in the first volume of Sadleir's <hi
                                rend="italic">XIX<lb />Century Fiction</hi>. The data given here,
                            when combined with those in Krupp's<lb />"Table," form essential context
                            for discussions of dating. The other part<lb />of the appendix, "Some
                            Additional Grains" (pp. 137&#x2013;141), describes and<lb />illustrates
                            seven grains not dealt with in previous sources&#x2014;but now
                            incor&#x002D;<lb />porated into Krupp's guide. (Bibliographers will also
                            wish to know of the<lb />remarkable amount of detail in another
                            appendix, "Nineteenth&#x002D;Century<lb />Edition Binders' Signatures,"

                            Manchester, a promi&#x002D;<lb />nent supplier of bookcloth after <date>
                            1853</date> and the dominant one from <date>1891</date><lb />to 1980.
                            There are two chapters of particular interest for bibliographers,<lb />"Description
                            of Bookcloth Qualities: (pp. 86&#x2013;107) and "Identification of<lb />Designs
                            (Grains)" (pp. 108&#x2013;123), the first supplemented with
                            thirty&#x002D;six<lb />tipped&#x002D;in cloth swatches and the second
                            with thirty, dating from after<lb /><date>1891</date>. The first group
                            is instructive in allowing one to feel some of the <pb n="82" /> grades
                            that were being offered at that time; but knowing that a great<lb />variety
                            was available (some fifty qualities are described) cannot be put<lb />to
                            direct use by bibliographers, who deal with cloth attached to covers.<lb />The
                            second group, showing patterns ("designs"), turns out not to be more<lb />useful
                            for identification than good photographs. In any case, the late date<lb />of
                            all the samples means that this book cannot offer an appropriate
                            gen&#x002D;<lb />eral standard for bibliographers&#x2014;along with the
                            fact that only arbitrary<lb />letter codes are used (though they were
                            employed, with some variation,<lb />in the <hi rend="italic">Bibliography
                            of American Literature</hi>). What the book does accomplish<lb />is to
                            make clear to bibliographers how inexact all their descriptions are<lb />when
                            compared to what was necessary in the cloth trade: in 1948, for<lb />example,
                            Winterbottom's advertised "41 Qualities, 71 Designs and 688<lb />Colours,
                            equal to almost 50,000 different Effects." (Despite this profu&#x002D;<lb />sion,
                            twentieth&#x002D;century books in general use rather plain cloth and do<lb />not
                            display the variety of patterns found on nineteenth&#x002D;century
                            books.)<lb />The authors recognize that bibliographical description does
                            not normally<lb />require the same precision as that employed by a cloth
                            supplier,but they<lb />add that using cloth as evidence for dating may
                            well require something<lb />closer to it.</p>
                        <p>In my 1998 review of this book (<hi rend="italic">Printing History</hi>,
                            19.1: 39; reprinted<lb />in my <hi rend="italic">Portraits and Reviews</hi>
                            [2015], pp. 345&#x2013;347), I cited an example of<lb />the kind of
                            information it supplies that is especially valuable for bibliog&#x002D;<lb />raphers:
                            sometimes it was more economical to cut the cloth in a "two&#x002D;<lb />way"
                            fashion rather than "one&#x002D;way," with the result that the cloth
                            pattern<lb />might run vertically on some copies of an edition and
                            horizontally on<lb />others (and thus the two directions may not signify
                            separate bindings&#x002D;<lb />up). A footnote to the
                            Tomlinson&#x002D;Masters bookappeared in 2002 in the<lb />form of an

                            1980s), plus Winterbottom's 1958 code book. The authors make the<lb />point

                            to go beyond those conventions, but they state (what is clearly true)<lb />that
                            book history in general would benefit from research in such archives<lb />as
                            exist, for the purpose of discovering the manufacturer, date, and trade<lb />specifications

                            a full verbal description, with as much modifying detail as necessary<lb />and
                            with a Krupp reference (including "cf."), could appear in MARC<lb />field
                            563, and the unmodified form (with the possible local addition of a<lb />Krupp
                            code) in field 655.</p>
                        <p>Besides describing cloth grains, the bibliographer must also record the<lb />designs
                            (abstract and pictorial), frames, and lettering that are stamped<lb />(in
                            blind or gold) into the cloth for individual editions. My suggestions in<lb />1970
                            are probably sufficient for most occasions; but a proposal for greater<lb />detail
                            has been offered by <name type="pname">Gene G. Freeman</name> in
                            "Descriptive Standards for<lb />Publisher's Bindings: Preliminary Notes"
                            (<hi rend="italic">Trade Bindings Research Newslet&#x002D;<lb />ter</hi>,
                            5 [June 1992], 3&#x2013;10). Freeman recommends dividing each cover into<lb />twenty&#x002D;four
                            "cells" (six rows of four) and each spine into twelve (six rows<lb />of
                            two) and then estimating the percentage of the area in each cell filled<lb />withdecoration
                            or lettering. An example is "1ABCD&#x2014;Author's name,<lb />centered,
                            1A and 1D &#x003C; 10&#x0025;." But surely, if "centered" is not enough,<lb />it
                            would be far more accurate simply to measure the distance fromeach<lb />end
                            of the name to the edge of the cover. He also thinks that a diagram<lb />showing
                            the "estimated fillfactor" of each cell "should be included in a<lb />descriptive
                            bibliography" because the "distribution of decoration over<lb />the
                            book's surface" can help to attribute unsigned bindings to particular<lb />designers.
                            Few people, I imagine, will agree with this point, and I see no<lb />reason
                            for bibliographers to adopt either of his recommendations. The<lb />same

                            13&#x2013;15); but the proposal (assigning a five&#x002D;letter code<lb />to
                            each book, the first two letters abbreviating the color and the last
                            three<lb />the type of design) is only intended as a means for
                            collectors to locate<lb />their books&#x2014;though presumably such a
                            code, if searchable in a library's <pb n="84" /> database, could have
                            some usefulness. <name type="pname">Charles S. Kamen</name>, in the next<lb />two

                            the work of nineteen designers are listed (but not illustrated)<lb />in

                        <p>When describing the ornamental designs stamped on grained cloth<lb />for
                            individual editions, bibliographers should be aware of a small number<lb />of
                            bindings, used for only about a decade after 1835, in which the cover<lb />and
                            spine designs were embossed on the cloth before it was fastened<lb />to
                            the boards and spine strip rather than (as was usual) being stamped on <pb
                                n="85" /> the cloth after it was attached. (Embossed designs rise in
                            relief from the<lb />surface, whereas stamped designs are pressed below
                            the surface.) Because<lb />the embossed designs were placed on the cloth
                            in advance, the positioning<lb />of the cover and spine elements
                            obviously determined the size of book&#x002D;<lb />block that could be
                            accommodated; sometimes when the match was not<lb />exact, the designs
                            are off&#x002D;center on the finished book. These bindings are<lb />discussed,
                            and thirteen designs illustrated, by <name type="pname">Andrea Krupp</name>
                            and <name type="pname">Jennifer<lb />Woods Rosner</name> in
                            "Pre&#x002D;Ornamented Bookcloth on Nineteenth&#x002D;Century<lb />Cloth
                            Case Bindings" (<hi rend="italic">Papers of the Bibliographical Society
                            of America</hi>, 94<lb />[2000], 176&#x2013;196). When one encounters a
                            binding of this kind, one should<lb />compare it with the <name
                                type="pname">Krupp&#x002D;Rosner</name> illustrations; and if it is
                            different, one<lb />should report it, in order to increase the inventory
                            of the relatively small<lb />number of such designs. (Occasionally an
                            embossed designwas applied<lb />to the cloth on an assembled binding
                            case, but those instances can be<lb />identified by the factthat the
                            intaglio plate flattens the cloth grain and<lb />thus leaves an edge
                            mark.)</p>
                        <p>My 1970 essay also covered the patterns of marbled papers, used both<lb />for
                            covering binding boards and for endpapers. Because every piece of<lb />hand&#x002D;marbled
                            paper is unique, any matching that a bibliographer does<lb />can only be
                            approximate (no matter how large the sample), and the twelve<lb />illustrations
                            I provided, divided into two classes and given their tradi&#x002D;<lb />tional
                            names, are perhaps sufficient (along with my suggestions for
                            addi&#x002D;<lb />tional verbal modifiers). But if one wishes to make
                            comparisons against a<lb />larger selection, one should turn to <name
                                type="pname">Richard J. Wolfe's</name> great book, <hi rend="italic">
                            Marbled<lb />Paper: Its History, Techniques, and Patterns</hi> (1990),
                            which contains (following<lb />p. 186) one hundred ninety&#x002D;two
                            excellent color illustrations, each assigned<lb />a number and (in a
                            supplementary list) a name (the same traditional name<lb />I had used,
                            with many alternatives and with useful historical notes). In&#x002D;<lb />stead
                            of attempting a classification of patterns, <name type="pname">Wolfe</name>
                            arranges the samples<lb />according to "their development and
                            manufacture in various geographi&#x002D;<lb />cal locations," and thus
                            types of patterns are not kept together. But the<lb />advantage is that
                            the bibliographer who uses these samples in conjunc&#x002D;<lb />tion
                            with <name type="pname">Wolfe's</name> discussion of them (in "The
                            Evolution of Marbled Pat&#x002D;<lb />terns," pp. 179&#x2013;192) has a
                            basis in some instances for the approximate<lb />dating of papers.
                            Although that possibility is obviously most useful in<lb />connection
                            with pre&#x002D;1820 books (before the period of publishers'
                            bind&#x002D;<lb />ings), nineteenth&#x002D;century publishers did often
                            make editions available si&#x002D;<lb />multaneously in cloth and in
                            "half&#x002D;calf" with marbled covers, which can<lb />be difficult to
                            identify. In any case, the wide availability of the Wolfe book<lb />(along
                            with its unquestionable authority) makes it an appropriate refer&#x002D;<lb />ence
                            for bibliographers to cite when describing marbled paper.</p>
                        <p>Other sets of color illustrations of marbled patterns have been
                            pub&#x002D;<lb />lished (usually in conjunction with marbling
                            instructions), but none <pb n="86" /> comes close to <name type="pname">

                            developed by the Belgian&#x002D;Dutch Bookbinding Society.<lb />This
                            system, however, simply enumerates seven types of patterns, in
                            over&#x002D;<lb />lapping categories: (1) pebble or stone; (2) drawn
                            (using a tool), subdivided<lb />into ten patterns, such as curl,
                            feather, and peacock; (3) combed (actually<lb />a type of "drawn"); (4)
                            shadow (or "Spanish"), usually made on pebble<lb />(and when not, they
                            fall into the sixth group); (5) fantasy (either abstract or<lb />pictorial);
                            (6) combination (of two or more patterns); and (7) overmarble<lb />(marbled
                            more than once). The object here is not primarily to provide<lb />a
                            classification scheme (and this is not a satisfactory one) but rather to<lb />establish
                            an international terminology (with equivalents in several lan&#x002D;<lb />guages
                            listed). This project is now fully reported in Elly

                            categories (which go beyond the strictly floral):<lb />(1) seaweeds; (2)
                            maidenhair fern and related designs; (3) sprigs and tiny<lb />bouquets;

                            (12) Renaissance style (scrolled or curling<lb />leaves, sometimes with
                            flowerheads or coiling tendrils); (13) publishers'<lb />initials and

                            explosive de&#x002D;<lb />signs. (The two most commonly used styles

                            categories: "sew&#x002D;<lb />er's marks," which usually appear in the
                            bottom margin of the last page<lb />of the last gathering (or the last
                            page of an inserted publisher's catalogue);<lb />and "production marks,"
                            which usually appear in the lower margin (or<lb />sometimes one of the
                            side margins) of the first page of the second, third,<lb />and/or fourth
                            gatherings. In both cases, they take the form of a letter,<lb />a
                            number, or a squiggle. Their exactfunction is not clear, but Milevski<lb />offers
                            some possibilities: those at the end could identify the person who <pb
                                n="88" /> did the sewing and/or indicate that the job was
                            satisfactorily completed;<lb />those at the beginning could identify the
                            collator and/or signify that all<lb />gatherings were in order and any
                            insertions were in place. More will be<lb />learned about them as more
                            are reported and examined; and bibliogra&#x002D;<lb />phers should note
                            them in their binding descriptions, just as they would<lb />naturally
                            mention that better known kind of evidence of the binding op&#x002D;<lb />eration,
                            the binder's ticket (with specific copies indicated as sources in<lb />both
                            cases). Milevski observes that the pencil marks are "direct evidence<lb />of
                            the human hand in the mass production of books in this era" (p. 47);<lb />as
                            such, they deserve to be recorded for further study.</p>

                        <p>My 2011 book includes a list of almost 2000 examples of pre&#x002D;1901
                            Brit&#x002D;<lb />ish and American publishers' book&#x002D;jackets,
                            boxes (slip&#x002D;cases, boxes with<lb />lids, etc.), and other
                            detachable coverings for books (such as envelopes or<lb />overall
                            wrappings). It is limited to items that have printed text or
                            deco&#x002D;<lb />ration on them, and the bulk of the entries give some
                            indication of the<lb />extent and nature ofthe printed matter. My list
                            was not intended to be<lb />a census but simply to report the examples I
                            had learned about during the<lb />previous four decades. It is extensive
                            enough, however, to give an idea<lb />of the growth in the use of
                            book&#x002D;jackets during the nineteenth century. <pb n="89" /> And it
                            has a practical usefulness for descriptive bibliographers: they can<lb />consult
                            it as an initial indication of which publishers were using jackets at<lb />a
                            given time, and for what kind of books, as a way of gauging whether the<lb />particular
                            books they are describing were likely to have been published<lb />in
                            jackets or boxes. If any of those books themselves happen to be
                            pres&#x002D;<lb />ent in my list, the bibliographer will thenknow where
                            to find a copy in a<lb />jacket or box (when my source was an
                            institutional library) or at least can<lb />be sure that a jacket or box
                            once existed (when my source was a dealer's<lb />catalogue or private
                            collection).</p>
                        <p>Since the publication of my book, a large number of additional ex&#x002D;<lb />amples
                            have been reported tome (and some further ones are listed in the<lb />appendixes
                            to Godburn's book); I hope that they will eventually form a<lb />supplementary
                            list posted on the website of the Bibliographical Society<lb />of the
                            University of Virginia, thus increasing the body of evidence on<lb />which
                            bibliographers can draw. The University of Virginia Library itself<lb />now
                            holds by far the largest collection of pre&#x002D;1901 jackets: in 2014
                            it pur&#x002D;<lb />chased the collection of the dealer Tom Congalton
                            (the largest collection<lb />reported in my book), and two years later
                            it bought the second collection<lb />that Congalton formed, bringing the
                            total of its holdings to well overa<lb />thousand volumes. Every
                            bibliographer who is describing a book from the<lb />1830s onward (or
                            indeed one ofthe annuals or children's books from the<lb />preceding
                            decades) should make an effort to find out whether it originally<lb />appeared
                            in a jacket or box and, if so, to locate such a copy.</p>

                        37<lb />(1984), 1&#x2013;38. The approach outlined there is displayed in

                    <p>The most significant post&#x002D;1984 articles relevant to the subject of
                        ar&#x002D;<lb />rangement are two careful and thorough ones by <name
                            type="pname">Maura Ives</name>. The first is<lb />"Descriptive
                        Bibliography and the Victorian Periodical" (<hi rend="italic">Studies in
                        Bibli&#x002D;<lb />ography</hi>, 49 [1996], 61&#x2013;94). My 1984 essay
                        points out the illogic of giving<lb />full descriptions of an author's books
                        and then simply listing that author's <pb n="90" /> contributions to
                        periodicals, since the latter may have been an equally<lb />important (or
                        even more important) part of the author's career and since,<lb />in any
                        case, periodicals are printed matter exhibiting the same character&#x002D;<lb />istics
                        and problems common to books. Ives discusses these points in detail<lb />and
                        then goes over the few differences she sees between the description of<lb />a
                        periodical and that of a book (such as the periodical's "dual existence":<lb />a
                        self&#x002D;contained individual number that is part of a larger unit). At
                        the<lb />end she provides a sample description (of a single number of a
                        periodical),<lb />which occupies slightly more than four pages of small type
                        and includes<lb />a historical introduction, a title&#x002D;page
                        transcription, listings of contents,<lb />illustrations, and plates (with
                        quasi&#x002D;facsimile transcriptions), descriptions<lb />of paper,
                        typography, and publisher's binding, and a record of copies<lb />examined.
                        All this is handled in exemplary fashion, but it raises a serious<lb />practical
                        question: is it realistic to expect such treatment of every number<lb />of a
                        periodical in which an author appeared, unless the author contrib&#x002D;<lb />uted
                        to periodicals only a few times? However desirable such treatment<lb />would
                        ideally be, it would normally increase bibliographers' work beyond<lb />what
                        most bibliographers would regard as feasible, and it would lengthen<lb />the
                        resultingbibliographies beyond what most publishers would be willing<lb />to
                        consider. From a realistic point of view, an abbreviated form needs to<lb />be
                        found&#x2014;one that recognizes the importance of describing periodicals<lb />but
                        does not require a full description of every relevant issue.</p>

                        authors "believe this<lb />to be a more logical arrangement in a work of

                        the journal and on any possible<lb />untraced or unconfirmed contributions
                        toit. (p. xix)</p>
                    <p>One might object that the only element of physical description here is<lb />"format,"
                        which turns out to be simply the leaf dimensions. Neverthe&#x002D;<lb />less,
                        these bibliographers have shown admirable independence of mind<lb />and have
                        demonstrated one reasonable scheme for handling periodicals:<lb />providing
                        a general account ofa periodical first, followed by abbreviated<lb />entries
                        for the subject's contributions to it. The number of details in the<lb />general
                        account and in the entries could be increased or lessened depend&#x002D;<lb />ing
                        on the situation and the bibliographer's inclination. Thus the opening<lb />account
                        could include notes on typography and paper and a collation for&#x002D;<lb />mula
                        in cases where most numbers of a journal follow the same pattern,<lb />and
                        variations in the cited issues could be briefly noted.</p>
                    <p>Ives does not mention the Jefferies bibliography, but perhaps she had<lb />it
                        in mind when she said that describing a single number of a periodical<lb />is
                        not sufficient. The <name type="pname">Miller&#x002D;Matthews</name> plan,
                        however, does offer a respon&#x002D;<lb />sible, and easily adjustable,
                        approach. In my 1984 essay, I expressed the<lb />hope that
                        full&#x002D;length descriptive bibliographies of individual periodicals<lb />might
                        eventually be published, with the result that bibliographers of au&#x002D;<lb />thors
                        would only need to cite thosedescriptions. But such bibliographies<lb />are
                        not likely to be produced soon, or in quantity, and author bibliogra&#x002D;<lb />phers
                        will have to find realistic solutions. The important thing is for
                        bibli&#x002D;<lb />ographers of authors to recognize in the first place that
                        a problem indeed<lb />exists and that they must think creatively about the
                        best way to deal with<lb />it in each particular situation. (The
                        so&#x002D;called degressive principle, which<lb />is what is involved here,
                        is discussed in the last part of section II of my<lb />essay and more
                        recently&#x2014;but only in connection with enumerative bib&#x002D;<lb />

                    <p>Ives's second article is "The Place of Musical Settings in Author Bib&#x002D;<lb />liographies,

                        commentary on constructingentries for musical settings (pp. 27&#x2013;31)<lb />and
                        its listing of relevant scholarship (pp. 33&#x2013;39). The former calls
                        at&#x002D;<lb />tention to features that could be recorded in addition to
                        the standard<lb />factsof printing and publishing history&#x2014;features
                        such as vocal range,<lb />instrumentation, initial key signatures and tempo
                        notations, and plate<lb />numbers. (She also mentions reviews of
                        performances, but these would<lb />be within scope only if secondary
                        critical writings, such as reviews of the<lb />author's books, were included
                        elsewhere in the bibliography.) The record<lb />of scholarship includes
                        bibliographies that report musical settings, indexes <pb n="92" /> to songs
                        in collections, sources for music&#x002D;publishing history (especially<lb />two

                        and significant library collections. The rest of the article, for the<lb />most
                        part, states the obvious. Ives feels that unless an author bibliography<lb />gives
                        an explanation for the presence of music entries, it will usually be<lb />"impossible
                        for users of these bibliographies to understand why musicis<lb />included"
                        (p. 20). But appearances of poems in sheet music, hymnals, mu&#x002D;<lb />sic
                        collections, and so on are simply instances of the printing or reprinting<lb />of
                        particular poems, and entries for them would be expected in an author<lb />bibliography
                        as part of an author's publication history. Such entries help<lb />to
                        document a work's textual history and its reputation and influence, as<lb />Ives
                        notes, but they do not differ in that respect from all other entries.<lb />Whether
                        musical settings should be recorded in a separate section is dis&#x002D;<lb />cussed
                        in some detail; and although Ives believes that such segregation is<lb />"almost
                        always preferable" (sometimes with subdivisions), she recognizes<lb />that
                        situations must be evaluated individually. If many bibliographers will<lb />not
                        need a large part of the instructions offered here, Ives's discussions<lb />are
                        nevertheless sensible, and some of them provide suggestive reading<lb />for
                        anyone engaged in defining the content and placement of entries for<lb />music
                        in an author bibliography.</p>

                        discussed briefly in my essay (in the fifth paragraph from the end), in<lb />order
                        to emphasize the distinction between the numbering of specific<lb />copies
                        for reference within a description and the numbering of the entries<lb />themselves,
                        which of course does not refer to individual copies. The post&#x002D;<lb />publication

                    <p>One post&#x002D;publication feature that is not often thought about is
                        dis&#x002D;<lb />cussed by <name type="pname">Jeffrey Todd Knight</name> in
                        "Invisible Ink: A Note on Ghost Im&#x002D;<lb />ages in Early Printed
                        Books"(<hi rend="italic">Textual Cultures</hi>, 5.2 [2010], 53&#x2013;62).
                        Knight<lb />is speaking of offsets from adjacent items bound together (not
                        from<lb />the printing process, which would be reported elsewhere in the
                        description); <pb n="93" /> such offsets provide useful evidence for the
                        history of collecting and read&#x002D;<lb />ing (as do many other
                        post&#x002D;publication additions to books). The impor&#x002D;<lb />tance of
                        the "Copies Examined" paragraph cannotbe exaggerated, not<lb />only because
                        it records the sources for the description (enough reason in<lb />itself)
                        but also because it fittingly completes the account by reflecting the<lb />post&#x002D;publication
                        life of those artifacts.</p>

                    <p>These discrepancies seem to show that the process that created them was more
                        complex<lb />than any single mistake.</p>
                    <p>If we take these discrepancies one at a time, the following suggests itself.<lb />Malory
                        probably wrote "And <hi rend="italic">the</hi> meane whyle" rather than "And
                        meane whyle."<lb />In the 67 instances of his use of <hi rend="italic">
                        meanwhyle</hi>, Malory always precedes it with <hi rend="italic">the</hi>,<lb />or,

                        of this disputed case. The next<lb />discrepancy involves whether he wrote
                        "Sir <name type="pname">Carados</name>" or "<name type="pname">King Carados</name>."
                        The<lb />fact that the phrase "the mighty king" follows in both versions
                        argues in favor of<lb /><hi rend="italic">sir</hi>, since it is unlikely
                        that <name type="pname">Malory</name> would feel the need to qualify "King

                        instances Winchester agrees with de Worde fourtimes<lb />and with the Caxton

                    <p>One of the correlations between Winchester and the de Worde involves
                        Ca&#x002D;<lb />rados. In the passage under discussion, de Worde agrees with
                        the Caxton against<lb />Winchester in calling Carados <hi rend="italic">Sir
                        Carados the mighty king</hi>; however, the <name type="pname">de Worde</name><lb />
                        and <name type="pname">Winchester</name> both call this character <hi

                        Sir<lb />Carados</hi> when they refer to him next. If de Worde were

                        itself, it would confirm the conclusions<lb />reached above.<ref

                    <p>The construction of the passage in question as preserved by its two witnesses<lb />contains
                        multiple subordinate clauses, one embedded into another, and this is<lb />very
                        unusual for Malory. Although one could not say that Malory never uses<lb />subordinate
                        clauses, paratactic constructions of simple clauses joined by coor&#x002D;<lb />dinating
                        conjunctions, usually <hi rend="italic">and</hi> or <hi rend="italic">but</hi>,
                        are much more common.<ref target="#CH2-n32">
                            <hi rend="sup">32</hi>
                        </ref> Of course,<lb />this
                        very fact might account for Malory occasionally losing his way when creating<lb />a
                        clause with a complex construction, yet any rational solution that removed a<lb />double
                        subordination would have some inherent plausibility.</p>
                    <p>The alternatives suggested by textual criticism are misreading and internal<lb />contamination,
                        that is reminiscence of words already written or anticipation of<lb />those
                        later on the page. Vinaver's attempt to restore the passage posits
                        misread&#x002D;<lb />ing, and in this respect Vinaver is clearly correct.
                        Internal contamination occurs<lb />when, after looking away from the
                        exemplar, the scribe resumes at the wrong<lb />point and introduces words
                        from elsewhere on the page into his copy. Although<lb />it appears from the
                        above that Vinaver failedto determine the exact misreading,<lb />there is no
                        reason to suspect that the <hi rend="italic">that</hi> (or possibly the <hi
                            rend="italic">which</hi>) could have come<lb />from any other place on
                        the page nearby.<ref target="#CH2-n33">

                        </ref></p>
                    <p>The most likely solution is that the misread word was <hi rend="italic">had</hi>.
                        The exemplar of<lb />the archetype probably read,</p>
                    <p>that Sir Carados the myghty kynge that was made lyke a gyaunte <hi

                    <p>The scribe of the ar&#x002D;<lb />chetype would have misread <hi
                            rend="italic">had</hi> for <hi rend="italic">&#x00FE;at</hi>. The scribe
                        of the archetype would have taken the descender and front loop of the <hi
                            rend="italic">h</hi> for a <hi rend="italic">&#x00FE;</hi>, correctly<lb />read
                        the <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and then,perhaps already having the word <hi
                            rend="italic">that</hi> in mind, mistook the<lb />stroke of the <hi

                        </ref> There is evidence
                        that the exemplar of the Caxton<lb />was irregular and hard to read,<ref
                            target="#CH2-n35">
                            <hi rend="sup">35</hi>
                        </ref> and perhaps the
                        exemplarof the archetype was<lb />as well. The Winchester scribe would then
                        have altered <hi rend="italic">that</hi> to <hi rend="italic">which</hi>,
                        and the<lb />Caxton compositor would have reproduced faithfully from his
                        exemplar, which is<lb />in keeping with the accumulating evidence that the
                        Caxton is the more accurate<lb />witness for this passage.</p>
                    <p>This explanation is no more radical than the one Vinaver proposed. Al&#x002D;<lb />though
                        misreading <hi rend="italic">&#x00FE;</hi> for <hi rend="italic">h</hi> is
                        not a commonly recognized scribal error, neither is<lb />Vinaver's
                        suggestion of misreading <hi rend="italic">t</hi> for <hi rend="italic">e</hi>.
                        Moreover, this emendation is more<lb />plausible because it creates a clause
                        more typical of Malory. The reading thus <note xml:id="CH2-n32" place="foot">

                        levels of past tense are<lb />involved in the narrator relating that a

                    <p>This conjectural emendation also has some support from Malory's source.<lb />The
                        relationship of Malory's writing to its sources can vary from almost literal<lb />translation
                        to very free retelling within the same tale, butin this case, Malory<lb />seems
                        to be working somewhere between these two extremes. The prose <hi
                            rend="italic">Tristan</hi><lb />reads here,</p>

                    <p>Although Malory's version is clearly not anything like a direct translation,
                        he is<lb />describing the same action. Therefore the French <hi

                    <p>One last point to consider before reaching our final conclusions about this<lb />passage
                        is the emendation of "word com to sir Launcelot" to "word come to<lb />sir
                        Galahalt" that <name type="pname">P. J. C. Field</name> introduced in his

                        </ref> Although<lb />Winchester
                        and the Caxton agree on reading <hi rend="italic">Launcelot</hi>, Field is
                        almost certainly<lb />correct to emendas he does. If the reading of <hi
                            rend="italic">Launcelot</hi> were correct, the result<lb />would be a
                        sequence of events conspicuous for being both oddly&#x002D;narrated and<lb />implausible.
                        Launcelotwould reenter the story for the first time since the end of<lb />"The
                        Tale of Sir Gareth" to hear these tidings, apparently apart from Tristram,<lb />and
                        then happen upon Carados and Gawain "by fortune" (333.15) before
                        Cara&#x002D;<lb />dos could bring Gawain to his castle. In a tale of wonder,
                        plausibility can stretch<lb />far, and it istrue that we do not know what
                        distance Carados had to travel with<lb />his captive, but the story gives us
                        no reason to think that rumor is running faster<lb />than the hooves of
                        Carados's horse.</p>
                    <p>In this instance, Malory's sources are no help. The story is related very
                        dif&#x002D;<lb />ferently in the prose <hi rend="italic">Tristan</hi> and in
                        its own source, the prose <hi rend="italic">Lancelot</hi>. In these<lb />versions,
                        the action is narrated directly to the reader rather than through the<lb />intermediary
                        of uninvolved characters hearing the news. Lancelot is present dur&#x002D;<lb />ing
                        the abduction and pursues Carados, but he is not able to free Gawain until<lb />after
                        Carados has taken him to this dungeon.<ref target="#CH2-n38">

                    <p>Malory's story itself, however, shows that Field must be correct. The story<lb />of
                        Gawain's abduction and rescue is told to Tristram and Galahalt at Galahalt's<lb />court
                        before Tristram's departure. The story is framed on one side with the words<lb />quoted

                        the reading that Malory intended will have ex&#x002D;<lb />isted only in
                        Malory's mind until Field put it into print.<ref target="#CH2-n41">

                        perhaps the<lb />scribe of the archetype was confused by seeing Tristram and
                        Galahalt together<lb />immediately after Tristram was said to have taken his

                        made the change to try to restore sense.</p>
                    <p>In any case, if the above arguments are sound then Malory's original<lb />should

                    <p>Here internal contamination can be ruled out, if not as swiftly as in the

                        the words <hi rend="italic">delyverde and</hi> which appear in the line
                        below<lb />in Winchester and two lines below in the Caxton.<ref

                        </ref> Yet if that were so
                        he must<lb />have paused after <hi rend="italic">delyveraunce</hi>, returned
                        to his exemplar and found <hi rend="italic">delyverde</hi> and<lb />resumed
                        his copying but realized his mistake after writing the single word <hi
                            rend="italic">and</hi>.<lb />Then he must have returned to the correct
                        place and continued without either<lb />adapting the wording to tidy up the
                        mistake or even, like his successor of the<lb />Winchester manuscript,
                        deleting the word. Such a situation would be most un&#x002D;<lb />likely in
                        a case of internal contamination.</p>
                    <p>By way of comparison, to illustrate a more probable instance of internal<lb />contamination,
                        consider thissimilarly illogical sentence from "The Tale of Sir<lb />Launcelot:"
                        "Than Sir Launcelot made his complaynte unto the kynge, how he<lb />was
                        betrayed, and how he was brother unto Sir Lyonell, whyche was departed<lb />frome
                        hym he wyste not where" (197.34 &#x2013; 198.1). This reading has been
                        retained<lb />by every edition based upon the Winchester, nor has any editor
                        commented<lb />on what appears to be an example of unintended humor:
                        Launcelot complain&#x002D;<lb />ing that he has recently been betrayed and
                        also complaining that Lyonell is his<lb />brother. A look at the Caxton text
                        illuminates how the Winchester scribe came<lb />most probably to produce
                        this reading. The Caxton reads, "Anone syre launcelot<lb />made his
                        complaynte vnto the kynge how he was bytrayed And how his broder<lb />syre

                        only realizing his mistake as he reached the word "betrayed." The scribe<lb />then
                        altered the rest of the sentence to compensate, an example of what Field<lb />has
                        called invisible mending.<ref target="#CH2-n50">

                    <p>A better solution is that the scribe of the archetype misread a word in his<lb />exemplar
                        without realizing it, and the misread word would almost certainly be<lb /><hi
                            rend="italic">out</hi>. One can see easily how such a misreading could
                        take place. Mistaking the<lb />loop of the <hi rend="italic">o</hi> for an <hi
                            rend="italic">a</hi>, the scribe would naturally interpret the double
                        minims of<lb />the <hi rend="italic">u</hi> as an <hi rend="italic">n</hi>,
                        and finally mistake the stroke of the <hi rend="italic">t</hi> for a <hi
                            rend="italic">d</hi>, the same error, in the<lb />opposite direction, as
                        above. This hypothesis would produce as the reading of the<lb />archetype's
                        exemplar, "I am ryght glad of youre delyveraunce <hi rend="italic">out</hi>
                        of youre doler&#x002D;<lb />ous presonment." This reading is idiomatic,
                        makes very good sense, and is typical<lb />of Malory's style. Malory never
                        uses the word <hi rend="italic">presonment</hi> other than this once, but<lb />he
                        refers to knights' release (or otherwise) from prison fourteen times and
                        always<lb />uses the construction <hi rend="italic">oute of preson</hi>,
                        never, say, merely <hi rend="italic">delyverde of preson</hi><ref

                    <p>The similarity of this misreading on the part of the scribe of the archetype

                        &#x00FE;at</hi> is remarkable. In both cases short functional words,<lb />an
                        auxiliary verb and a preposition, have been mistaken for another word, and<lb />both
                        contain a similar <hi rend="italic">d/t</hi> confusion. Each of the two
                        cases provides supporting<lb />evidence for the validity of the other.</p>

                    <p>The effect of considering these cases together is to affirm both the
                        importance<lb />and the dangers of conjectural emendation in editing
                        Malory's text. Kato's article<lb />provides outstanding examples of how this
                        principle can solve textual mysteries,<lb />and even Vinaver, a textual
                        conservative, recognized its usefulness.</p>
                    <p>Vinaver's intelligence and industry stand as an inspiration to all later
                        Malory<lb />scholars. His grand editions remain monuments of
                        twentieth&#x002D;century scholar&#x002D;<lb />ship and will doubtless
                        continue to be the standard by which new editions of<lb />Malory's work will
                        be measured. And as this article shows, his conclusionsabout<lb />the
                        existence and nature of the archetype from which Winchester and the Caxton<lb />independently
                        derive remain solid.</p>
                    <p>However, in the cases discussed above, Vinaver appears to have been misled.<lb />In
                        the instance from "The Book of Balin," Vinaver's theory of editing prevented<lb />him
                        from considering the implications of the corrected mistake in his copy text:<lb />because
                        the corrected reading was not impossible, he apparently did not give<lb />much
                        thought to the fact that the Caxton contains the same mistake.<ref

                        </ref> On the<lb />otherhand,
                        his emendation to <hi rend="italic">wight</hi> in "The Book of Tristram"
                        section actually<lb />demonstratesa danger of conjectural emendation that

                        the then newly&#x002D;discovered Winchester manuscript<lb />with its promise
                        of solutions to mysteries, Vinaver introduced into the standard<lb />edition

                    <p>Of these two pitfalls, however, the narrowness of Vinaver's theory is the
                        more<lb />harmful because it focusesattention away from the analysis of
                        textual variants,<lb />which is indispensable to textual criticism.
                        Vinaver'scaret brackets alert the<lb />reader to the hand of the editor. In
                        all such cases the scholarly reader must judge<lb />the validity of the
                        emendation, which will lead to progress either as confirma&#x002D;<lb />tion
                        or refutation. Yet the missing word in the story of Balin threated to vanish<lb />from
                        all consideration into the tiny type at the bottom of the page until rescued<lb />by
                        Kato's study, a small loss perhaps, but a distortion of a great author's
                        syntax,<lb />nevertheless. Applying a less narrow theory of editing and
                        possessing a greater<lb />appreciation of the critical importance of both
                        major witnesses, we are in a posi&#x002D;<lb />tion to continue to recover
                        more of Malory's exact words than ever before. Field's<lb />new edition is a
                        great step forward in this endeavor; it improves on Vinaver's text<lb />in a
                        multitude of closely&#x002D;reasoned variants. This paper argues for afew

                    and distribution of the printed book<lb />was very much an inside job, carried
                    out by men with close ties to the Inns of<lb />Court and their associated
                    literary coteries.</p>
                <p>The book that Norton produced is a quarto that collates a<hi rend="sup">2</hi>

                    the title (verso blank) and a<lb />leaf of dedication by <name type="pname">
                    Shirley</name>. Quire A describes the procession before the per&#x002D;<lb />formance,
                    and the decoration of the Banqueting Hall; quires B&#x002D;D, with their<lb />own
                    pagination sequence, contain the text of the masque. Four surviving cop&#x002D;<lb />ies
                    contain an additional singleton leaf of verse headed "A speech to the King<lb />and
                    Queenes Maiesties, when they were pleased to honour the City with their<lb />presence,
                    and gave a gracious command, the former tryumph should attend<lb />them." Its
                    eighteen lines, delivered by a character called "Gen[ius].", allude to<lb />the

                        <p>Table 1 shows, in shades of gray, the distribution in surviving copies of
                            the<lb />completely different settings of each page. The rows of the
                            table correspond to<lb />the copies or reproductions I have examined,
                            grouped by the four title&#x002D;page vari&#x002D;<lb />ants which are
                            separated by the horizontal white bands. The columns represent<lb />the
                            pages of each copy grouped by quire and forme. One can immediately see<lb />what
                            perplexed the earlier bibliographers. Some settings persist throughout
                            the<lb />print history: the outer formes of quires A and C, for
                            instance, and even the<lb />title page (a1r), remain substantially the
                            same with relatively minor variants.<lb />Other pages go through as many
                            as three settings. Most of the new settings do<lb />not line up with
                            changes on the title page. The concept of "edition" as applied<lb />to
                            the whole book, and the normal role of the title page as the primary
                            taxo&#x002D;<lb />nomic organizer, go out the window here. So does any
                            hope of dealing with the<lb />book quirewise, or even formewise. Only a
                            page&#x002D;by&#x002D;page analysis will allow<lb />us to specify the
                            relationships among copies.</p>
                        <p>As it happens, this patchwork of settings (taken in conjunction with the
                            vari&#x002D;<lb />ants they contain) works in our favor when we set out
                            to put all the states, from<lb />major to minor, into chronological
                            order. Let us take the example of quire A<lb />inner forme, where page
                            A2r goes through two partial resettings, A1v gets one<lb />complete
                            resetting, and the other two pages exhibit only stop&#x002D;press
                            corrections.<lb />In table 2, the heavy horizontal line separates the
                            completely different settings<lb />of A1v, while the lighter lines
                            separate partial resettings or more minor altera&#x002D;<lb />tions. The
                            relative positions of the lines between columns show the points of<lb />introduction
                            of new states, either simultaneously with changes on other pages or<lb />independently
                            from them. We have no immediate basis for deciding the order<lb />in
                            which some of these occurred. However, since the forme is the basic unit
                            of<lb />printing, these four pages must all live their lives in the same
                            direction: a prov&#x002D;<lb />able sequence of variants on one page
                            imposes an obligation on the sequences<lb />of the others.</p>
                        <pb n="113" />
                        <p>A4r, in its single setting, shows progressive improvement in spelling and<lb />punctuation.
                            In the first wave of correction, "sharpe sited" becomes "sharpe<lb />sighted"
                            and "Caduseus" becomes "Caduceus". In the next wave, the addition of<lb />commas
                            to a listing of architectural features helps to improve the sense. On
                            A3v,<lb />the correction of "Arber&#x002D;worke" to
                            "Arbor&#x002D;worke", occurring part&#x002D;way through<lb />the second
                            state of A4r, follows the same order. If we accept this sequence of<lb />states
                            for these two pages, the other two (A1v and A2r) must follow suit.
                            There&#x002D;<lb />fore, setting 1 of both A1v and 2r does indeed come
                            first, a fact that we would<lb />otherwise have difficulty proving.
                            Setting 2 of A1v then goes through two waves<lb />of correction that
                            lock partial resettings 2 and 3 of A2r into order. When, some<lb />twenty&#x002D;five
                            years ago, I began to sort through all of the states of <hi
                                rend="italic">ToP</hi>, I was pleas&#x002D;<lb />antly surprised to
                            find most of them clicking into place pretty readily in this same<lb />way.
                            I have recorded the rationales for the order of states in appendix 1,
                            though<lb />I would not encourage the reader to venture into that
                            thicket quite yet.</p>
                        <p>The important thing to note in table 1 (the table of editions of the
                            whole<lb />book) is that there appears to be an orderly progression of
                            settings of the constitu&#x002D;<lb />ent sheets. The various settings
                            of one quire do not mix randomly with settings<lb />of other quires. As
                            the quire&#x002D;breaks always fall at the same points in the text in<lb />all
                            the states, copies could in theory have been assembled from sheets of
                            what&#x002D;<lb />ever combinations of settings were available at the
                            gathering stage. The lack of<lb />random mixing implies discrete stages
                            of production and collation, and provides<lb />one argument against the
                            theory of simultaneous setting that has prevailed until<lb />now. Only
                            the late states of quire D show a more promiscuous behavior; I<lb />will
                            explain this in &#x00A7;8B.</p>
                        <p>The title&#x002D;page variants, though seeming to dance to their own
                            drummer, at<lb />least dance in the same direction as the variants in
                            quires A&#x002D;D. In the earliest<lb />copies of the title (fig. 1[A]),
                            the "O" in "OF" in line 3 is sound. A small accident<lb />soon dents the
                            top of the O, and this damaged type persists through all of the<lb />subsequent
                            states. Reassuringly, the "third impression" title pages are found only<lb />in
                            copies having the latest states of the text, and we can see that the
                            unique copy<lb />of title 3, with its dangling comma after
                            "Grayes&#x002D;Inne", is just an uncorrected<lb />version of title 4.
                            Quire "a", therefore, shows a rational order of variants that also<lb />tracks
                            the evolution of the other quires, even if the title&#x002D;page changes
                            are out of<lb />phase with those of the text pages.</p>
                        <p>Although, after we become familiar with table 1, we discern some
                            comforting<lb />regularities, we are left with the question of why some
                            pages were reset and others<lb />were not. The mystery deepens when we
                            look more closely at the pages which<lb />retain at least 50% of their
                            original settings. <hi rend="italic">TOP</hi> shows the normal pattern
                            of<lb />stop&#x002D;press corrections found in most books of the
                            hand&#x002D;press period. But we also<lb />encounter two phenomena which
                            are unusual: (1) pages on which only the page<lb />number is reset,
                            where no correction was required, and (2) pages on which blocks<lb />of
                            text in a particular type style (usually italic) are reset&#x2014;again
                            with no substan&#x002D;<lb />tive changes to the reading&#x2014;while
                            the other portions remain untouched.</p>
                        <p>The seemingly capricious page&#x002D;number resettings turn out to be a
                            powerful<lb />tool for reconstructing the sequence of events in John

                        <p><hi rend="italic">ToP</hi> contains no running titles. Except for the
                            words "The Epistle" on a2v,<lb />the headlines consist of simple page
                            numbers within parentheses&#x2014;three or four<lb />types plus spacers.
                            Figure 2 shows two states of a page (C1r) in which the headline<lb />has
                            been reset. This is not just a spacing shift&#x2014;all three printing
                            characters are<lb />different types. But the setting below is unchanged,
                            and even the direction lines<lb />are unaltered (both contain the
                            catchword <hi rend="italic">"An&#x005F;"</hi> with a dropped hyphen). On<lb />some
                            other pages, both the numbers and the direction lines show
                            resetting&#x2014;<lb />for example B3r in Houghton STC 22459 as compared
                            with the same page in<lb />Houghton STC 22459a.5. Still others have
                            page&#x002D;number resettings in conjunc&#x002D;<lb />tion with
                            stop&#x002D;press corrections. On A1v, Bodleian Mal. 160(3) has three
                            errors<lb />that are corrected in National Art Library 25.c.79.<ref

                            </ref> The
                            priority seems clear.<lb />However, along with the corrections comes a
                            reset page number: originally well<lb />printed, the "2" in the
                            apparently later state is badly damaged and the left pa&#x002D;<lb />renthesis
                            prints much thinner than the right. The nature of the damage to the<lb />numeral
                            makes it unlikely that we are looking at the same unhappy type, and<lb />the
                            parentheses are also clear substitutions. In the act of improving the
                            text, the<lb />printer seems for no discernible reason to have swapped
                            out a good page number and substituted a bad one.</p>
                        <p>Finally, a new headline always appears in those cases (mentioned in the
                            pre&#x002D;<lb />vious section and discussed more fully in the next)
                            where selected blocks of text<lb />are reset seemingly without need.
                            Headlines are reset even when they are not<lb />adjacent to the reset
                            text. Huntington copies 69434 and 69428, for instance,<lb />show this
                            phenomenon on C2v.</p>
                        <p>Most of these headline replacements also entail a reset direction line,
                            though<lb />the latter can be difficult to detect. Of the two features,
                            I have found the page<lb />numbers to be a clearer first indicator that

                            seldom the same<lb />way twice; their horizontal alignment with the
                            first line of text is variable; and<lb />the numbers and parentheses in
                            Norton's type&#x002D;cases contain a variety of forms<lb />and damaged
                            sorts that make substitution easy to detect.</p>
                        <p>The page&#x002D;number changes in <hi rend="italic">ToP</hi> are so
                            clearly without purpose that they<lb />must have been unintended
                            consequences of other operations. We can explore<lb />their patterns by
                            modifying table 1 to show where the substitutions occur. In table<lb />3,
                            the double horizontal lines indicate page&#x002D;number changes.<ref
                                target="#CH3-n16">
                                <hi rend="sup">16</hi>
                            </ref> These
                            obviously<lb />occur also at the points where whole pages are reset
                            (still shown by changing<lb />shades of gray), but others divide the
                            main settings into smaller groups. A reset<lb />number on one page
                            usually accompanies a similar operation on its forme&#x002D;mates,<lb />and
                            the table shows corresponding fault&#x002D;lines that often break out of
                            individual<lb />formes into whole quires and even to the other sheets.
                            The initial impression of<lb />chaos in table 1 begins to yield to a
                            pattern that is more complex, but also more orderly.</p>
                        <p>The page numbers in <hi rend="italic">ToP</hi> belong to an element
                            common to most books<lb />of the hand&#x002D;press period called the
                            skeleton forme. This consisted of non&#x002D;printing<lb />material such
                            as the furniture that held the pages in a set layout on the press<lb />bed,
                            but it also included the headlines and direction lines. The latter
                            contained <note xml:id="CH3-n16" place="foot">

                            discussed in &#x00A7;6C. In late copies<lb />of quire D, two settings
                            occur interchangeably; therefore it is not possible to diagram a clear<lb />transition

                            re&#x002D;used, with changes to the visible type as needed,<lb />in
                            successive formes as an edition went through the press. When a forme was<lb />finished
                            printing, the units of the skeleton were normally separated from the
                            type&#x002D;<lb />pages and used in another forme, while the stripped
                            pages went back to the type<lb />cases for distribution.<ref

                            edition was finished, the type of the skeletons<lb />would go down the
                            same path.</p>
                        <p>It was entirely possible to do multiple printings of a short book using
                            the same<lb />setting of type. In such a scenario, the
                            type&#x002D;pages, after their first printing, would<lb />be tied up
                            with string, with or without their skeletons, for an arbitrary period,<lb />then
                            reimposed and reprinted. This cycle could repeat itself as many times as<lb />needed.
                            Printers commonly stripped the headlines and direction lines when pages<lb />were
                            finished printing, but if the skeletons happened to remain with their
                            pages, a<lb />reprint could easily escape detection even by a modern
                            bibliographer. Numerous<lb />examples of reprinting from standing type,
                            at least for stretches of a few pages,<lb />are documented from the
                            early seventeenth century and before,<ref target="#CH3-n18">

                            century. The reasons it was<lb />not more widespread in the <date>1630</date>s
                            were both practical and regulatory. Between<lb /><date>1587</date> and <date>
                            1637</date>, an order of the Stationers' Company set a limit of <date>
                            1500</date> copies<lb />on print runs from a single setting.<ref

                            copies were wanted, a scrupulous<lb />printer would have distributed the
                            type and reset a new edition from scratch.<lb />This rule was intended
                            to provide sufficient work for journeyman compositors,<lb />but it also
                            made economic sense. Because hand&#x002D;cast type was expensive, a
                            printer<lb />would keep only limited amounts and would not want large
                            chunks of it tied up<lb />and unusable for other jobs. Nevertheless,
                            printers interpreted the regulation<lb />flexibly, and when faced with a
                            sudden high demand for a particular title they<lb />were understandably
                            tempted to exceed the limit.<ref target="#CH3-n20">

                            page&#x002D;number substitution resulted from<lb />an interruption of
                            work during which the whole forme was removed from the<lb />press. The
                            type&#x002D;pages were set aside for a time and then received at least
                            reset<lb />page numbers, and usually new direction lines as well, in
                            preparation for re&#x002D;<lb />impression. Some pages underwent a
                            complete resetting during the interval, of<lb />course including the
                            skeleton. This is the explanation of the horizontal fractures<lb />in
                            table 3. It is even possible that some pages were stored with their
                            skeletons<lb />intact and went undetectably into later impressions. This
                            could have occurred<lb />with formes D(o) and A(i) at certain points in
                            the printing history; it is tempting<lb />to posit "silent"
                            reimpositions that would bridge the discontinuous fault&#x002D;lines in<lb />table
                            3. We will explore this possibility when we go into the

                            italic embedded in roman text remain unchanged.<lb />Eleven pages in <hi
                                rend="italic">ToP</hi> show this localized resetting of italic at
                            some point in the<lb />printing history, and one of them (D2r) has part
                            of the italic reset yet again. Two<lb />pages (including one that
                            previously had the italic changed) also show an arbi&#x002D;<lb />trary
                            change&#x002D;out of some of the <hi rend="italic">roman</hi> type.</p>
                        <p>Table 4 shows where these resettings occur. (Solid arrows indicate
                            replace&#x002D;<lb />ment of italic type, dashed arrows the replacement
                            of roman.) All of them, except<lb />for the roman replacement on C1r,
                            occur at points in the production cycle where<lb />the numbers in the
                            headlines were also reset&#x2014;in other words, during the pauses<lb />between
                            impressions that we have already identified. Table 5 presents the
                            history<lb />in another way. (It contains codes for production phases
                            and variant states which<lb />I will discuss later.) This table shows
                            all the pages of <hi rend="italic">ToP</hi> that contain
                            concentra&#x002D;<lb />tions of italic. A great deal of that type is
                            used for the songs that cluster toward<lb />the end of the masque.</p>
                        <p>The local resettings do not always draw on the same font. In the earliest
                            states<lb />of <hi rend="italic">ToP</hi>, all the text&#x2014;both
                            roman and italic&#x2014;is set in "english" size (20 lines =<lb />96
                            mm). In the first wave of changes, the italic Song 5 on C4V reappears in
                            pica<lb />size (82 mm). During the same transition, four lines of italic
                            stage direction on<lb />A2v&#x002D;3r switch to a 120 mm great primer.
                            Pages C3v and D3r are a more subtle<lb />case: the reset songs are still
                            in 96 mm italic, but the font is of a different design,<lb />which I
                            will call i&#x002D;2 as opposed to the more prevalent i&#x002D;1. The
                            differences are<lb />hard to describe, but we can compare the two in
                            figure 3. The page on the left<lb />features Norton's regular english
                            italic i&#x002D;1, while that on the right shows the song<lb />reset in
                            i&#x002D;2&#x2014;a less attractive face, smaller on the body and also
                            (in its <hi rend="italic">ToP</hi> out&#x002D;<lb />ing) badly worn. The
                            most diagnostic feature of i&#x002D;2 is the <hi rend="italic">h</hi>,
                            whose legs nearly<lb />close at the bottom, so that the letter resembles
                            a <hi rend="italic">b.</hi> In its i&#x002D;1 cutting, the right<lb />leg
                            only begins to close.</p>
                        <p>None of these partial resettings result in substantive textual changes.
                            Like the<lb />page&#x002D;number resettings, they bear the marks not of
                            perfectionism but rather of <pb n="122" />

                            timing, arbitrary nature,<lb />and recourse to alternative,
                            wrongly&#x002D;sized, and sometimes inferior fonts strongly<lb />suggest
                            that they were a response to a shortage of type, that Norton was
                            juggling<lb />other jobs, and that <hi rend="italic">ToP</hi> had to
                            stand aside&#x2014;even sacrifice some of its stand&#x002D;<lb />ing
                            type&#x2014;to let those jobs "play through". I therefore refer to these
                            incidents<lb />of localized distribution as "raids", which created holes
                            in the composition that<lb />Norton refilled once the more pressing need
                            was past.</p>
                        <p>In &#x00A7;9, I will show that some of the italic distributed in the
                            first raid ended up<lb />in <hi rend="italic">ToP</hi> itself, in the
                            two pages of dedication (leaf a2). As part of the preliminaries,<lb />these
                            pages would have been printed after the main text if Norton was
                            following<lb />the usual practice. Once the dedication was set, on the
                            other hand, it remained<lb />substantially unchanged through the
                            remainder of <hi rend="italic">ToP</hi> s printing history. Norton<lb />was
                            able to muster enough italic to restore the raided pages, though he
                            some&#x002D;<lb />times patched the holes with a mis&#x002D;matched
                            font. The first wave of raids liberated<lb />about 2130 ens of italic,
                            but the preliminary quire of <hi rend="italic">ToP</hi> contains only
                            42% of<lb />that, about 900 ens. Distributing more than twice the amount
                            of needed type<lb />might have been a prudent action to ensure an
                            adequate supply of all the sorts.<lb />If there was another job or jobs
                            that prompted the italic raids, I have not been<lb />able to identify
                            them. The candidates would obviously contain large amounts of<lb />Norton's
                            english italic (96 mm). This was a slightly unusual size for standard
                            text;<lb />the smaller pica served as the workhorse. In his books dated <date>
                            1633&#x2013;34</date>, Norton<lb />used english&#x002D;sized italic
                            mostly for matter subsidiary to the main texts&#x2014;prelim&#x002D;<lb />inaries
                            and indexes. The most extended stretch of it comes in the

<hi
                                rend="italic">Restitution of Decayed Intelligence</hi> (STC 21363),
                            dated<lb /><date>1634</date>. It contains double columns of short lines
                            of italic with a heavy admixture of<lb />roman. Its requirements hardly
                            seem enough to stretch the resources of a print&#x002D;<lb />ing house
                            responsible for nearly thirty known jobs, or parts thereof, during the<lb />two&#x002D;year
                            span with <hi rend="italic">ToP</hi> at its center. It may be safest to
                            hypothesize that Norton<lb />was doing some job work now vanished, maybe
                            longer than a single sheet, greedy<lb />for a larger size of italic than
                            usual, and urgent. The fact that the raids took place<lb />at more than
                            one point in the <hi rend="italic">ToP</hi> production suggests either
                            several ephemeral<lb />jobs, or one larger project which for some reason
                            has not survived.</p>
                        <p>In this section I have focused on localized resettings of italic passages
                            in re&#x002D;<lb />sponse to a need for type, but we need to bear in
                            mind that <hi rend="italic">any</hi> distribution of<lb />type served to
                            make it available for other jobs. We will see instances throughout<lb />the
                            printing history of <hi rend="italic">ToP</hi> in which entire pages or
                            formes were reset, with no<lb />discernible pattern in which pages were
                            chosen. At the end of each printing<lb />phase, Norton had three choices
                            of what to do with each type&#x002D;page: (a) distribute<lb />it, (b)
                            keep the text standing and strip the skeleton, or (c) keep the text
                            stand&#x002D;<lb />ing with the skeleton intact. It is quite possible
                            that many of the resettings were<lb />motivated by a need for more roman
                            type, and that the selection of pages was<lb />driven by which

                            In &#x00A7;9&#x2013;10,<lb />I will demonstrate how recurring types give
                            evidence of the order of printing<lb />the formes; in
                            &#x00A7;11&#x2013;14, I will show how copies were assembled from the
                            stock<lb />of printed sheets on hand. Section 15 presents the entire
                            workflow as a series<lb />of specific actions, and &#x00A7;16 addresses
                            basic issues like edition size and the time<lb />required to print all
                            the copies. The metamorphosis of the printed pages entails<lb />a
                            textual evolution in which deliberate revisions (mostly to the stage
                            directions)<lb />appear amid a chatter of accidentals generated by the
                            resettings. I have reserved<lb />a detailed account of these for the
                            textual introduction to <hi rend="italic">ToP</hi> in the upcoming<lb />Oxford
                            University Press edition of <name type="pname">Shirley's</name> works.</p>
                        <p>My method of organizing the variants is, I hope, as simple as the
                            situa&#x002D;<lb />tion allows, but it still needs a bit of explanation.
                            The comprehensive catalogue<lb />of manifestations of all the pages,
                            from complete resettings down to stop&#x002D;<lb />press variants and
                            even the occasional random shift, will be found as appendix 1. It<lb />is
                            modeled on a biologist's taxonomic key, and as with all such keys the
                            identi&#x002D;<lb />fication marks are the minimum required to
                            distinguish the states; seldom are<lb />all the variants on a page
                            mentioned. During the first stages of organizing this<lb />list, I saw
                            the need for some kind of shorthand to refer to each state of a page.<lb />Ideally
                            the structure of this shorthand should express the hierarchical
                            relation&#x002D;<lb />ships of the states of each page, with the main
                            settings at the top level followed<lb />by impositions at the next and
                            stop&#x002D;press variants at the bottom. However, as<lb />the families
                            of variants continued to ramify&#x2014;sometimes manifesting states that<lb />would
                            not fit neatly into any hierarchy&#x2014;practice sometimes overruled
                            theory,<lb />and the codes ceased to reflect any rigid correspondence
                            with production phases<lb />or the relative importance of the changes
                            they denote. Attempting at this point<lb />to revise the codes to make
                            them more consistent&#x2014;to the extent that that would<lb />even be
                            possible&#x2014;would render precarious their connection with notes
                            taken<lb />over two decades, which embody the current system in a
                            well&#x002D;documented pro&#x002D;<lb />cess of evolution. For
                            specification of the exact relationships between the states,<lb />the
                            reader should refer to appendix 1.</p>

                    <p>A. a1R (TITLE PAGE)</p>
                    <p>The four main states of the title page are shown in figure 1. A quick
                        compari&#x002D;<lb />son reveals that these states are largely in the same
                        setting. Note, for instance, the<lb />damaged "M" in "Majesties", line 9,
                        and the wrong&#x002D;font final "3" in the imprint<lb />date, which is
                        common to all states. It is relatively easy to demonstrate, with a<lb />purely
                        typographic proof, that the order of states shown in figure 1 is also the<lb />order
                        of printing. As mentioned in &#x00A7;1, the "O" in line 3 is sound (as
                        illustrated)<lb />in some copies of state 1, but shows damage in others.
                        Therefore, state 1 must<lb />be the earliest. State 3 (a unique survival at
                        the Folger), with its dangling comma<lb />after "Grayes&#x002D;Inne", must
                        precede state 4. One would assume that the "third<lb />impression" copies
                        came last, and this is borne out by the association of this state<lb />with
                        later states of quires A&#x002D;D, as we shall see. If we play devil's
                        advocate and<lb />posit an order of 1,3,4,2&#x2014;moving the "third
                        impression" forwards&#x2014;we would<lb />not be able to explain why line 11
                        of the title ("February the third, <date>1633</date>.") starts<lb />in one
                        setting in state 1, changes to another for states 3 and 4, then reverts to
                        the<lb />original one in state 2. (The presence of a comma or a period after
                        "third" is the most obvious marker.) So, we can safely accept the order as
                        illustrated.</p>
                    <p>State 1 is further complicated by a deliberate realignment (state 1a2, not<lb />illustrated).
                        Figure 1(A) shows the first word of the title sitting too far left with<lb />respect
                        to the following line. During the printing of state 1, but after the damage<lb />to
                        the "O" in line 3, the alignment was altered by shifting "THE" rightwards so<lb />that
                        the "T" lay closer to the "V" below than to the "I". As a result, the word<lb />came
                        to sit too far right on the page considered as a whole, but with respect to<lb />the
                        following line, it is an improvement. No version of the title ever gets each<lb />line
                        quite centered.</p>
                    <pb n="128" />
                    <p>Table 6 shows the hierarchy of changes that we have just worked out. The<lb />numbering
                        of the states refers to appendix 1. For the title, I have called the four<lb />states
                        1a (with three sub&#x002D;variants), 1b, 1c1, and 1c2. The notation "1"
                        recognizes<lb />that all are in the same basic setting and that the fourth
                        is a stop&#x002D;press variant<lb />of the third. The taxonomic key ignores
                        other adjustments, even the resetting<lb />of line 11, that accompany the
                        revisions signaled by the chosen markers. (A full<lb />account of the

                    <p>The reason for the deletion of "of Grayes Inne" in state 1b, and its
                        restoration in<lb />1c, is unclear. <name type="pname">Shirley</name> was
                        admitted to honorary membership in the Inn on 17Janu&#x002D;<lb />ary <date>
                        1634</date>. This was a common enough practice for individuals who had
                        rendered a<lb />significant service, and it should not have been
                        controversial. Quite probably, <name type="pname">Shirley</name><lb />was
                        led to expect it as part of his compensation for writing the masque. He may
                        have<lb />allowed the words to creep into the printer's copy in advance of
                        the actual bestowal.<lb />When someone called attention to the error, the
                        words were deleted, only to be re&#x002D;<lb />stored (in a new setting, of
                        course) in state 1c, which was evidently printed after the<lb />honor was
                        official. Since there is no evidence that anyone tried to suppress them in<lb />earlier
                        copies, the deletion could represent a minor adjustment for a minor
                        embar&#x002D;<lb />rassment. It could even have happened as a
                        stop&#x002D;press correction. This theory would<lb />have a corollary that
                        the printing of at least state 1a was well underway or completed<lb />by the
                        middle of January, and this would support Greg's assumption that the
                        pub&#x002D;<lb />lisher aimed to have copies ready for sale by the first
                        performance of the masque<lb />on 3 February.<ref target="#CH3-n21">

                    <p>At the head of a2r is a decorative band composed of pairs of acorn
                        orna&#x002D;<lb />ments. The early state has 28 pairs of acorns, the later
                        two have 27. It is nearly<lb />impossible to find individuality in acorn
                        ornaments, but tiny differences show<lb />that the change results from
                        resetting, not a loss of one pair on the end. The<lb />reduction happens
                        simultaneously with a clear resetting of the direction line&#x2014;<lb />signature
                        mark <hi rend="italic">"a2"</hi> and the catchword&#x2014;without a change

                        line in mid&#x002D;run, it appears that<lb />the printing of a2r underwent a
                        pause at this point during which the skeleton<lb />(including the acorns in
                        this case) was replaced. Another arbitrary change oc&#x002D;<lb />curred
                        later, when the equal leading above and below line 5 of the heading (the<lb />single
                        word "THE") was disturbed and that line drew closer to the one below.<lb />The
                        same operation apparently dislodged a space two lines above, following the<lb />words
                        "Equall and", so that copies printed thereafter show a gradual rightward<lb />drift
                        of those two words.</p>
                    <p>C.a2v</p>
                    <p>Like the others in quire "a", this page has only one major setting (see table
                        8).</p>
                    <p>The first change to a2v is the stop&#x002D;press correction of "ond" to
                        "and". (The<lb />error was a simple one for either the typesetter or the
                        previous distributor to<lb />make&#x2014;the "o" box in the typecase lay
                        just above the "a".) All copies of the un&#x002D;<lb />corrected state also
                        have the undamaged "O" on the title page (a1r:1a1a). After<lb />the
                        correction to "and", further copies were printed before the "O" on the title<lb />became
                        damaged (initiating state a1r:1a1b). The addition of the comma after<lb />"Honourers"
                        on a2v occurs at the same point as the re&#x002D;alignment of the first line<lb />of
                        the title page (producing a1r:1a2). The copies with the "Third impression"<lb />title
                        page (starting at a1r:1c) also show a resetting of the closing two lines of
                        the<lb />dedication on a2v, with no difference in reading. This sort of
                        arbitrary change<lb />should remind us of the headline resettings that, as I
                        have argued, signal pauses <pb n="130" />

                    <p>Note that the changes on all three pages tend to occur in lockstep. Quire<lb />"a"
                        is a half&#x002D;sheet, which would most economically be produced by
                        half&#x002D;sheet<lb />imposition run off by work&#x002D;and&#x002D;turn.<ref

                            <hi rend="sup">22</hi>
                        </ref> In this method, all
                        the pages of the quire<lb />are printed at once, and the sheets are flipped
                        end&#x002D;to&#x002D;end and perfected with the<lb />same pages on the back.
                        When cut in half, each sheet yields two copies of the<lb />quire. If this
                        were the case with <hi rend="italic">ToP</hi>, and if one examined the type
                        impression<lb />in many copies, about half will show that a2 recto was
                        printed before the verso,<lb />while the other half will show the opposite
                        sequence. I have attempted this exami&#x002D;<lb />nation on 23 copies of <hi
                            rend="italic">ToP</hi>&#x2014;a difficult process because the outer
                        leaves normally<lb />show most of the soiling and were usually washed and
                        pressed at some point.<lb />Only leaf a2 can be analyzed in this way because
                        the title leaf verso is blank.<lb />But the test did show a mixture of
                        sequences of printing, so we can be confident that<lb />quire "a" was
                        printed by work&#x002D;and&#x002D;turn.</p>
                    <p>Because Norton used half&#x002D;sheet imposition, all three type&#x002D;pages
                        of quire "a"<lb />were accessible to alteration at the same time. So, it is
                        not remarkable to see<lb />changes taking place across all three pages
                        simultaneously. The thing to note<lb />at these transitional points is the
                        mixture of arbitrary revisions with apparently<lb />rational ones. When the
                        number of acorn pairs drops from 28 to 27, the title<lb />page gets a small
                        realignment and the comma is added on a2v. Later, when "of<lb />Grayes&#x002D;Inne"
                        is removed from the title (state a1r:1b), the rule disappears from<lb />under
                        the dedication on a2v and the line spacing changes on a2r; the latter is<lb />an
                        apparently random disturbance that entails the accidental loosening of a
                        line.<lb />The addition of "The third impression" to the title (state 1c)
                        brings with it some <note xml:id="CH3-n22" place="foot">

                        activity strengthen our ear&#x002D;<lb />lier suspicion that the printing of
                        the preliminaries proceeded in several discrete<lb />spurts of work, of
                        which the double&#x002D;rule boundaries I drew in the tables above<lb />mark

                        and that the double&#x002D;rule segments in tables 9&#x2013;10, indicating
                        pauses in<lb />the work, should run straight across both formes. I will
                        refer to these printings,<lb />or discrete periods of work on the formes, as
                        "phases", and table 11 incorporates<lb />them into a comprehensive scheme

                        <p>Table 12 results from mentally removing quire A from every copy of <hi

                            complete resettings; double&#x002D;rule borders show reset headlines<lb />indicating
                            reimpositions of standing type. Again the printing seems to divide into<lb />several
                            phases. The table shows that the formes evolve in the same direction,<lb />which
                            indicates that the printer was executing an orderly flip of the stack
                            after<lb />printing the first forme: the first&#x002D;printed sheets of
                            one forme became the first&#x002D;<lb />printed of the other. This
                            pattern generally holds throughout <hi rend="italic">ToP</hi>, though we
                            will<lb />find some aberrations in the other quires.</p>
                        <p>The table reveals that, as with the preliminary quire, Norton turned out
                            sheet<lb />A in several discrete phases of work. The most common marker
                            of a shift to a<lb />new phase is the resetting of the skeleton, or
                            extensive text, of multiple pages<lb />at the same points in the
                            production history, though quire A does not show this<lb />consistently.
                            As mentioned in the previous section, it is often impossible to say<lb />what
                            motivated Norton to distribute some pages and not others. In the case of<lb />quire
                            A, all but one of the pages (A1v) retain at least half of their original
                            settings<lb />throughout the printing history. A1v was reset after Phase
                            I, and the bottom half<lb />of A2r was reset twice. Work on Phase II of

                            in the quire's evolution&#x2014;began by reimposing all of the
                            outer&#x002D;forme<lb />type&#x002D;pages set for the first phase.

                            outer&#x002D;forme first.) For the perfecting run,<lb />Norton reimposed
                            the inner forme using two pages with minor changes from<lb />Phase I
                            (A3v and A4r, which lay head&#x002D;to&#x002D;head), but the other two
                            pages of the<lb />forme were either completely or partly reset (A1v and
                            A2r respectively).</p>
                        <p>Other phase shifts were more subtle, and the transition from IIb to III
                            was<lb />barely a whisper: only two pages got stripped and a couple of
                            raised quads were<lb />pushed down on a third. The backing forme shows
                            no sign of a corresponding<lb />interruption. This lack of correlation
                            requires some fancy explaining. My feeling<lb />is that the
                            reimpositions on A1r and 2v, though they affect only two pages out of<lb />eight
                            in the quire, were still associated with a work stoppage. The lowering
                            of the<lb />quads on A4v, which happens at the same time, was probably
                            an unintentional<lb />result of removing the type&#x002D;page at the end
                            of Phase IIb and replacing it for<lb />Phase III. Furthermore, on the
                            evidence of the surviving copies of <hi rend="italic">ToP</hi>, the
                            number<lb />of quire&#x002D;A sheets in Phases IIa and IIb combined (11)
                            is approximately equal to the number of sheets of the other text quires
                            in their own undivided Phase II<lb />(quire B, 10; C, 10; D, 11). Copies
                            of the book that contain Phase III<lb />of sheets B&#x002D;D also
                            contain Phase III of sheet A. (One exceptional copy from Phase III
                            (Folger STC 22459.2) has an A&#x002D;sheet from IIb, which indicates a
                            possible slight<lb />overrun of the A sheets that found their way into
                            the following phase. I discuss<lb />the overrun in more detail in
                            &#x00A7;13.) These are the reasons I have designated the<lb />two
                            sub&#x002D;phases within the second impression of quire A.</p>
                        <p>It is likely that Norton's original intent was to print Phase II as a
                            continuous<lb />job, but that something interrupted the machining of the
                            outer forme and the<lb />type was removed from the press. This marked
                            the end of Phase IIa. When he<lb />was able to resume work, he had two
                            options. The simpler was to put the outer <pb n="134" /> forme back on
                            the press, complete the intended second impression of that, then<lb />perfect
                            the sheets from Phases IIa&#x002D;b of the outer forme together.
                            However, a<lb />skeleton resetting on A1v and a page&#x002D;number shift
                            on A3v in the inner forme<lb />suggests that the perfecting of
                            IIa&#x002D;b also proceeded in two phases of work. Norton<lb />perfected
                            all the IIa sheets before doing another printing of both formes to<lb />complete
                            Phase II. Although it required more shifting of formes, this tactic
                            would<lb />prioritize the completion of some number of finished
                            A&#x002D;sheets. This would allow<lb />a more speedy assembly of at
                            least some copies of the whole book.</p>
                        <p>The inner forme of Phase IIb is indistinguishable from that of Phase III
                            except<lb />for a stop&#x002D;press correction which appears
                            part&#x002D;way through the latter phase<lb />(A1v:2b2). On the evidence
                            of table 12, Norton could even have printed the inner<lb />forme of
                            Phase IIb and continued straight on to print the inner forme of Phase<lb />III
                            in the same run, perfecting the sheets of the latter phase with the

                            always printed his outer formes first. So, we have to conclude that
                            Norton began Phase III of quire A with only minor<lb />changes to the
                            outer forme (new skeletons for A1r and A2v) and none at all<lb />to the
                            inner. The boundary line between Phases IIb and III continues invisibly<lb />right
                            across the inner forme. We will later see similar arbitrary patterns in
                            the<lb />production of the other sheets.</p>

                            appears that a disorderly stack&#x002D;turn took place. To understand
                            this concept,<lb />first recall that a normal print run of a forme might
                            produce several hundred<lb />sheets, yielding a thick pile of damp paper
                            with the last&#x002D;printed sheets on top.<lb />To preserve the same
                            order and orientation of sheets going through the press<lb />on the
                            perfecting run, the pile had to be inverted end&#x002D;to&#x002D;end.
                            Since the pile was<lb />too bulky to turn as a unit, the workman had to
                            transfer it in several handfuls,<lb />inverting each one onto the new
                            stack.</p>
                        <p>Suppose instead that the workman carelessly transferred one handful of
                            sheets<lb />straight across without turning it. This would produce a
                            stratum of sheets with<lb />the printing facing the wrong way. We would
                            expect the pressman, when working<lb />down the pile and finding this
                            mistake, to utter a curse, turn the affected sheets<lb />to align with
                            the others, and go on working. But he might also utter a curse and<lb />start
                            picking up the sheets from the opposite end, using a slightly different
                            motion<lb />to place them on the tympan. The pinholes&#x2014;normally
                            positioned slightly<lb />asymmetrically&#x2014;would help prevent
                            mishaps in perfecting, and the pressman<lb />might enjoy the little bit
                            of variety until reaching the underlying layer of correctly<lb />oriented
                            sheets. This seems to be what happened in Phase I of quire B. Let us<lb />use
                            our sample of the nineteen copies of that phase to stand for the entire
                            first<lb />printing of this gathering. The machining of the outer forme
                            (containing B1r)<lb />produced a heap like the one on the left below,
                            with the later states on top.</p>
                        <p>If we now back up these partially garbled sheets with the inner forme
                            containing<lb />B3v&#x002D;4r, which begins with state 1a1 and switches
                            to state 1a2 about half&#x002D;way<lb />through, we get the observed

                            time correctly done&#x2014;yielding the inverse of the first column
                            above.<lb />The reader may verify that this does not yield the observed
                            distribution of states.<lb />We cannot change the boundaries of group B
                            without creating a conflict with the<lb />observed combinations, so that

                            It is tempting to extrapolate from our nineteen&#x002D;copy sample to
                            estimate<lb />the total number that were printed in Phase I. If group B

                            likely to be the cause. If looseness in the line caused the shift, we<lb />would
                            also expect slightly different spacing among the three characters of the<lb />
                            page number, but we do not see this either. It remains an unexplained
                            problem,<lb />but a minor one.</p>
                        <p>In the discussion of quire A, I identified a point within Phase I at
                            which press&#x002D;<lb />work was interrupted, but the other formes of
                            the book from that phase did not<lb />show a similar hiatus.
                            Sub&#x002D;Phases IIa and IIb were in effect separate printings of<lb />quire
                            A, with both formes showing changes. Quire B is a slightly different
                            case.<lb />Again, it appears that a more urgent job interrupted the
                            printing, this time during<lb />Phase III of the outer forme. The delay
                            was long enough that the type&#x002D;pages<lb />were stripped and
                            probably tied up. After the other job played through, printing<lb />of
                            B(o) resumed with a new skeleton, including a new arrangement of acorns
                            on<lb />B1r. (I have not been able to determine whether the direction
                            lines were reset as<lb />well&#x2014;they are closely similar.) These
                            re&#x002D;imposed copies constitute Phase IIIb.<lb />However, both of

                            on B4r. Most of the features are of a transient nature and could be<lb />reversible:
                            for instance, the wayward "V" on B1v could drift, fall out, and be<lb />replaced,
                            so late copies might look like early ones. The loose page number with<lb />its
                            parentheses could have fallen apart near the end of the run, and all
                            three types<lb />could have been reset to produce the unique
                            manifestation in the <name type="name">St. Catharine's</name><lb />copy.
                            The stray metal in variant 5 could have been slightly raised in the

                        <p>On C2v, the action of the masque enters its final phase, which features
                            numerous<lb />songs set in italic. These provide the main source for the
                            italic raids<lb />discussed in &#x00A7;3.</p>
                        <p>The production of the quire went as follows:</p>

                        <p>C outer forme shows a normal pattern of variants whose sequence is all
                            but<lb />certain. The inner forme, however, presents an insoluble
                            problem in the sorting<lb />of the two variants of C1v, which at line 23
                            has either (1a1) "We change<lb />the Seene" or (1a2) "We change the
                            Scene". These are found in the combinations<lb />shown in table 22. (The
                            remaining three pages of C(i) are invariant, so<lb />are not shown.)
                            About half the sheets (the eight copies shown in the last row of<lb />the
                            table) have the latest states of both the outer and inner formes, as we
                            would<lb />expect, but the other ten sort illogically. Unlike the
                            retrograde pattern of quire<lb />B Phase I (&#x00A7;6A), the existence
                            of all these permutations cannot be explained<lb />by any plausible
                            irregularity in turning the stack. Only dropping some portion<lb />of
                            the sheets on the floor and picking them up more or less at random would<lb />cause
                            the first state of the inner forme to be printed on the back of three of
                            the<lb />four variants of the outer forme. "Accidents at the press" is
                            the last resort of the<lb />baffled bibliographer, and I will not waste
                            space here in trying to develop such an<lb />explanation.</p>

                        <p>C. <hi rend="smallcaps">PHASE</hi> III</p>
                        <p>In this phase, pp. C2r and C3v&#x2014;which lie side by side in the
                            forme&#x2014;undergo<lb />the only complete resettings in the history of
                            quire C. Head to head with<lb />these, but later in the phase, C1v and
                            C4r both show page&#x002D;number shifts. These<lb />are probably
                            simultaneous but random drifts, as the types in the page numbers<lb />appear
                            to be the same before and after. However, the five copies which show
                            this<lb />deviation happen to be the same ones which contain quire B
                            from Phase IIIb. I<lb />will discuss this uncomfortable coincidence in
                            &#x00A7;13.</p>
                        <p>Also in this phase, the text of C1v shows further instability around the
                            same<lb />points which changed in Phase II: the italic in lines 1
                            &#x2013;10 and the last four lines<lb />is reset, the fourth line up <hi
                                rend="italic">("A Landschape the Scene.")</hi> going missing in the
                            first of<lb />two steps to a smooth transition between antimasques. When
                            lines 8&#x2013;10 were<lb />changed in the previous phase, the period
                            after "carryed off" in line 9 ended up<lb />below the line (which shows
                            another unstable lockup). In Phase III, it is properly<lb />aligned, and
                            the resetting of the nearby italic may have had some connection<lb />with
                            that repair&#x002D;work.</p>
                        <p>D. <hi rend="smallcaps">PHASE</hi> IV</p>
                        <p>Phase IV, as mentioned above, is found only in "third impression" copies
                            of<lb /><hi rend="italic">ToP</hi>, and, like the final phase of quire
                            A, it introduces important textual revisions<lb />that alter the page
                            breaks within the quire. Edits on C1v and 2r shorten the word<lb />count
                            significantly, causing two&#x002D;line chunks of the text to move
                            backwards until<lb />the original breaks resume at the end of C2v.</p>
                        <p>This phase gives us further examples of text that is reset either larger
                            or<lb />smaller than the prevailing 96 mm "english" size:</p>
                        <p>C1r: At the top of the page, a brace separates the list of three
                            characters from<lb />their stage directions on the right. In the
                            original setting, the directions crowd<lb />right up to the brace. In
                            Phase IV, the direction is reset in 82 mm pica; the line<lb />breaks are
                            the same, but the page gains some needed white space.</p>
                        <p>C2r: The antimasque of the "phantastique Adventurer" has the same layout<lb />as
                            the previous example, with a brace separating the names of the
                            characters<lb />from their stage directions. In this last phase, the
                            directions are rewritten and<lb />lengthened, so the compositor reset
                            them in pica type apparently to maintain<lb />visual balance.</p>

                            one&#x2014;is easier to explain if<lb />we suppose that the outer forme
                            went through two printings with no alteration<lb />during the pause
                            between them. Phase II of D(i) associates mostly with the third<lb />state
                            of the outer forme (D1r:1a3), in which the first three lines of type on

                                during Phase I. The damage occurred during<lb />the replacement of
                                the outer forme in preparation for Phase II. The Phase II<lb />sheets
                                with the damaged type were combined with the Phase I leftovers and<lb />perfected

                        <p>It is more likely for damage to occur at points of transition than during<lb />periods
                            of repetitive work, so I lean toward the second explanation. Either one<lb />requires
                            some special pleading to fit the hybrid copies into a plausible
                            narrative.<lb />There is no doubt, though, that they are closely
                            associated with the skeleton<lb />change in D(i), which marks the end of
                            Phase I of that forme, and the same phase<lb />also produced about equal
                            numbers of quires A&#x002D;C.</p>
                        <p>Before Phase II came the pause during which italic was raided in quires A<lb />and
                            C. Norton raided quire D as well, but only the inner forme. Three of its<lb />constituent
                            pages show the italic in a new setting in Phase II, while the fourth<lb />page&#x2014;consisting
                            almost entirely of italic&#x2014;was entirely reset. D3r, in the outer<lb />forme,
                            could have supplied a good amount of the font but was not touched.</p>
                        <p>For Phase II of quire D, Norton printed the outer forme, as I have
                            argued,<lb />unchanged from its Phase I state except for the damage to
                            D1r (which could also<lb />have happened early in Phase II). Following
                            Phase II, another small italic raid<lb />occurred on both formes,
                            carrying off the songs on D2r and D3r. The former leaf<lb />had already
                            been raided, even more extensively, following Phase I. The second<lb />raid
                            shows a continuing need for the font beyond its earlier use to set the
                            dedication<lb />for <hi rend="italic">ToP;</hi> some other job was
                            interrupting at this point. Concurrently with<lb />these replacements,
                            and quite bafflingly, the roman portion of D3v&#x2014;about two<lb />thirds
                            of the page&#x2014;was reset. I cannot begin to suggest a reason for

                            association. To confirm my hunch about<lb />Okes, I surveyed English
                            books printed in <date>1633&#x2013;34</date>, searching for the odd "k"<lb />and
                            "W" in particular. Unsurprisingly, this did not yield an unequivocal
                            answer.<lb />Early&#x002D;modern printers' typographic stocks were not
                            proprietary, homogeneous,<lb />or static, and there are no woodcut
                            elements in quire D to help finger the collaborator.<lb />I found
                            versions of the stunted "k" in the repertoire of numerous<lb />printers,
                            including at the university towns, and "W" showed great variability in<lb />most
                            samples. Many texts I looked at did not even contain english&#x002D;size
                            type&#x2014;<lb />the smaller pica is much more common&#x2014;and a good
                            proportion were Latin, in<lb />which letters "W" and "k" are rare. My
                            search for definite fingerprints became<lb />an exercise in
                            probabilities, trying to estimate frequencies of the characteristic<lb />sorts
                            in scattered pools of the target font. In the end, though, my survey

                        <p>Okes' setting of quire D occurs in seven of the seventeen surviving
                            copies of<lb />Phase III and in four of the nine copies of Phase IV
                            Possibly Norton and Okes<lb />each printed about equal numbers of sheets
                            to supply the last two phases, or Okes<lb />printed rather fewer. I have
                            not found any variants in Okes' sheets. Although the<lb />typesetting is
                            not error&#x002D;free, one gets the impression of a more assured
                            compositorial<lb />hand than Norton's crew could muster. It is not clear
                            why Norton brought in<lb />a second printer at this late stage to run
                            off a "duplicate" setting of the quire. In<lb />&#x00A7;16, I will show
                            that the time gained by running the same eight pages of text on<lb />two
                            presses was nearly offset by the time taken in setting them anew. The
                            complications<lb />of using a clandestine off&#x002D;site press would
                            further reduce or even negate<lb />the advantage. This consideration,
                            along with the greater professionalism of<lb />Okes' quire D setting,
                            argues against Norton's direct agency in its production.</p>
                        <p>We know that Phases III and IV of sheets A&#x002D;C contain multiple
                            impressions,<lb />so we would expect sheet D to show evidence of this as
                            well during Okes' involvement.<lb />However, as mentioned, Okes' sheets
                            contain no variants that I have<lb />identified. Norton's sheets for
                            Phases III&#x002D;IV are also virtually identical, but D1r<lb />shows
                            some interesting small changes:</p>
                        <p>2a1: l. 10 has "Masqncrs"; signature mark under the "hi" of "white,"</p>
                        <p>2a2: l. 10 has "Masquers"; signature mark under the comma of "white,"</p>
                        <p>2a3: l. 10 has "Masquers"; signature mark under the "w" of "white,"</p>
                        <p>From the spelling correction it appears that states 2a2 and 2a3 follow
                            2a1. The<lb />shifts in the direction line raise the spectre of
                            reimposition. However, the signature<lb />mark&#x2014;anomalously, an
                            italic "D"&#x2014;appears to be the same type in all three states.<lb />(Transient
                            bits of foreign matter appear either as specks within the letter [mostly<lb />in
                            2a2] or falling across one or the other serif.) The page number also
                            appears<lb />invariant in composition and position. It would be tempting
                            to attribute the states<lb />of the direction line to random shifts due
                            to loose lockup, except that there are n <lb />ointermediate states, and
                            the variants tend to sort in a complex but fairly orderly<lb />fashion
                            with sheets of the other quires. Norton's states of sheet D show the
                            following<lb />distribution:</p>

                        <pb n="153" />
                        <p>The table shows that state D1r:2a1 is found only with Phase&#x002D;III
                            copies of the<lb />other quires, while 2a3 associates (with a single
                            exception) with Phase&#x002D;IV copies.<lb />State 2a2 (shaded) is
                            transitional between 2a1 and 2a3, and it occurs in copies<lb />having
                            B(o) from Phase IIIb. Those same copies have unique states of pages in<lb />the
                            inner forme of sheet C. In &#x00A7;11&#x2013;14, I will return to these
                            links among the<lb />three quires. For now, it appears that the D sheets
                            containing Norton's D1r:2a3<lb />could represent a discrete Phase IV,
                            his final one for that quire. The "leakage" of<lb />2a3 into Phase III,
                            represented by the Newberry copy, could have resulted from<lb />Norton's
                            having printed sheet D a bit short in phase III. Thus, a small group of<lb />Phase&#x002D;III
                            copies of the book may have been made up with Phase&#x002D;IV sheets of<lb />quire
                            D. Those hybrids probably went to the warehouse along with the purebred<lb />Phase&#x002D;IV
                            copies.</p>
                        <p>If we accept that Norton printed Phases III and IV of quire D as distinct<lb />impressions,
                            what about Okes? Might he have printed all his sheets for both<lb />phases
                            in one go? If we allow this possibility, we have to explain the fact
                            that, in<lb />the surviving copies, Okes' contribution makes up about an
                            equal proportion in<lb />each phase: respectively 41 and 44%. When,
                            after Phase III, a workman began<lb />collating complete copies, he
                            would probably start picking D&#x002D;sheets from a homogeneous<lb />batch
                            of one or the other man's production, whichever came to hand<lb />first.
                            This process would almost certainly produce different Norton/Okes ratios<lb />in
                            Phases III and IV So, either the D sheets after Phase III already
                            contained<lb />about 40% of Okes' work, or Norton deliberately
                            manipulated the ratio to equal<lb />that in the upcoming Phase IV. Such
                            an intervention supposes obscure motives<lb />and more fastidiousness
                            than I can credit Norton with. The same objection applies<lb />to a
                            hypothesis that both men printed their sheets for Phases III and IV<lb />in
                            a continuous run. The more plausible explanation is that Norton brought
                            in<lb />Okes to print a half&#x002D;share of Phase III sheets, but asked
                            him to keep the eight<lb />pages in type, skeletons intact, against a
                            probable fourth printing. When that<lb />need came about, Okes was able
                            quickly to reimpose the pages without alteration<lb />for the new run.
                            This scenario asks a high degree of precision from Okes, and<lb />requires
                            that he tie up eight pages of type without knowing for certain whether<lb />they
                            would be needed&#x2014;otherwise, why not go ahead and print Phases III
                            and<lb />IV together? I cannot give a detailed and definitive account of
                            Okes' work cycle.<lb />It is intertwined with the mystery of why he got
                            involved at all; if we knew the<lb />answer to one, the other would
                            probably follow. However, I favor the theory<lb />that Norton's and
                            Okes' teams worked in tandem on Phase III of quire D, and<lb />that&#x2014;on
                            the slim evidence of surviving copies&#x2014;each produced an
                            approximately<lb />equal number of sheets, of which Norton's contained
                            states D1r:2a1 and<lb />the much less common 2a2. Once they reached the
                            end of Phase III, the pages<lb />of type from both printers' pairs of
                            formes were tied up and there was a pause,<lb />during which completed
                            copies from Phase III were assembled and dispatched.<lb />After an
                            indeterminate time came Phase IV, for which both printers again machined<lb />approximately
                            equal runs of their respective settings of quire D. Norton's<lb />sheets
                            of these final copies differ from those of Phase III only in the
                            position of<lb />the signature mark on D1r, which moved about three
                            millimeters, probably during<lb />the reimposition process, producing
                            state 2a3 of that page.</p>

                        <p>Norton and Okes seemed to feel that a further impression would be called
                            for<lb />after Phase III, but something prevented them from going on to
                            print a double<lb />run of quire D. The publisher Cooke may have been
                            uncertain about demand.<lb />But Phase IV also ushers in the bulk of the
                            substantive textual variants in <hi rend="italic">ToP </hi><lb />These
                            occur in the description of the procession on A2r and A3r, in the tavern<lb />direction
                            on B3r, and in antimasques on C1v and C2r. None of the variants are<lb />stylistic;
                            they seem rather to document actual changes in the performance. By the<lb />end
                            of Phase III, Norton and Okes may have known that revisions were coming.<lb />Although,
                            in the event, none of these fell in quire D, the printers may not have<lb />known
                            this, and therefore put the type&#x002D;pages for the last quire aside

                        <p>In the preceding sections, we have been exploring <hi rend="italic">ToP</hi>
                            "vertically", as it were<lb />&#x2014;working out the histories of
                            individual pages, studying their chemistry as they<lb />combine into
                            formes and quires, and watching each quire evolve in isolation<lb />from
                            the others. It is now time for a "horizontal" approach as we begin to
                            reconstruct<lb />the progress of printing the whole text, phase by
                            phase. Table 30, a<lb />modified version of appendix 3, shows how these
                            phases align across the quires<lb />of the surviving copies. It shows a
                            fairly orderly stratification: for a given copy<lb />of the book, the
                            phase of any one of quires A&#x002D;C serves as a good predictor of<lb />the
                            phases of the others. The few exceptions to this among the survivors
                            result,<lb />I believe, from the occasional necessity of making up
                            copies with sheets from<lb />neighboring phases. (I will discuss this
                            further in &#x00A7;11&#x2013;14.) But the phases do not<lb />leapfrog
                            one another: II and IV never mix in a copy, nor III and I or IV and I.<lb />If
                            sheets from more than one phase were available simultaneously for
                            gathering<lb />complete copies, there was nothing to stop Norton from
                            mixing them indiscriminately,<lb />because the text&#x002D;breaks across
                            quires never change. Except for the "third<lb />impression" copies he
                            would have no motivation for keeping the products of<lb />one phase
                            segregated from another. Therefore, I think we can safely hold to the<lb />theory
                            of four discrete printings of the book as a whole.</p>
                        <p>The recurrence of types can give us clues about the order of printing the<lb />quires.
                            (Lacking evidence to the contrary, I will assume for the ensuing
                            discussion<lb />that the order of printing in <hi rend="italic">ToP</hi>
                            is the same as the order of composition.) We would<lb />expect Norton to
                            work through quires A&#x002D;D in sequence. But here, as so often, <hi
                                rend="italic">ToP</hi><lb />hands us a surprise. The recurring types
                            in the first phase of printing that I could<lb />confidently identify
                            are distributed as follows:</p>

                        <p>On first glance, the table appears to show nothing out the ordinary.
                            Quire B<lb />inner forme could have been set with type distributed from
                            the outer forme of A;<lb />Norton could even have begun at the title
                            page and proceeded straight through<lb />the book. But we need to take
                            into account what happened to the individual<lb />pages at the end of
                            Phase I. In fact, the outer forme of quire A remained in substantially<lb />the
                            same setting through the printing history of <hi rend="italic">ToP</hi>,
                            whereas quire B<lb />was distributed after Phase I. So, types from A(o)
                            were not available to set B(i)&#x2014;<lb />rather the opposite.
                            Therefore, A(o) was set after B(i) went through the press and<lb />got
                            broken down. Similarly, quire "a" continued to hang onto most of its
                            type<lb />(predominantly 96 mm italic) while D2r was raided for its
                            italic after Phase I. (I<lb />have indicated the point of the raid with
                            a wavy border in table 31, distinguishing<lb />the fate of that page
                            from that of D4r, which was entirely distributed.) The<lb />preliminaries
                            could not have been set until printing was finished on quire D inner<lb />forme.
                            Furthermore, two letters on D2v show that that page could not have<lb />been
                            set until after the distribution of at least part of each forme of quire
                            B; and<lb />a distinctive bracket on C2r shows that C(i) cannot have
                            been set before B(i)<lb />was off the press. So, quires C and D both
                            followed B. In &#x00A7;8A, I showed, on the<lb />evidence of one broken
                            parenthesis in the headline, that quire D was probably<lb />printed
                            after quire C. No other types from C show up elsewhere; it was probably<lb />set
                            while quire B was still being worked off, after which it held onto most
                            of its <pb n="158" /> roman type through the succeeding phases. Italic
                            raids on C after Phase I must<lb />have supplied some other printing job
                            than <hi rend="italic">ToP.</hi> If, then, we may consider entire<lb />quires
                            as production units, it appears that the printing of Phase I followed
                            the<lb />sequence B&#x002D;C&#x002D;D&#x002D;A&#x002D;a. Nothing in the
                            data shows that the preliminary quire "a"<lb />had to come last, as long
                            as it followed D from which it drew some of its type. But<lb />preliminaries
                            were normally printed at the end of the job, and if "a" followed D<lb />directly,
                            there would have had to be a pause for D(i) to be at least partly
                            distributed.<lb />(Remember that in <hi rend="italic">ToP</hi> the inner
                            formes were printed after the outer ones,<lb />and it is only D(i) that
                            provided types for quire "a".)</p>
                        <p>Something caused Norton to place quire A late in the schedule. A probable<lb />reason
                            emerges when we recall that quires B&#x002D;D contain the text of the
                            masque,<lb />while quire A sets the stage, as it were, with a
                            description of the costumes, scenery,<lb />and the public procession
                            that opened the performance. Most of this is written<lb />in the past
                            tense, as if reporting the finished event, while the stage directions<lb />for
                            the masque itself are mostly (though not exclusively) in the
                            conventional<lb />present tense. This division between reportage and
                            direction again raises the<lb />question of whether copies of the book
                            were in fact available on the day of the<lb />first performance&#x2014;a
                            matter which I will explore further in &#x00A7;16. The important<lb />point
                            here is that the details of the procession were more likely to be in
                            flux until<lb />the last minute, whereas a relatively stable text of the
                            masque would have been<lb />needed earlier so the performers could learn
                            their parts. Though both sections<lb />show light revision through the
                            printing history, it would have made sense to<lb />start work on the
                            part least likely to change. Quite possibly, Norton began typesetting<lb />the
                            main text before <name type="pname">Shirley</name> had even finished
                            writing the description of<lb />the procession.</p>
                        <p>If typesetting and printing began with quire B, as the evidence above
                            indicates,<lb />this may explain why this quire alone was mostly
                            distributed after Phase I&#x2014;<lb />seven of its eight pages broken
                            up, as opposed to only one page each in quires A<lb />and D, and none in
                            C. I have already mentioned the often arbitrary pattern of<lb />which
                            pages got distributed and which survived into later impressions.
                            However,<lb />this first quire printed could represent an initial intent
                            to play by the rules and<lb />distribute type after running an

                        <p>After Phase II, only four pages were distributed, plus italic portions of
                            D2r<lb />and D3r; recurring types therefore provide less evidence for
                            the order of printing<lb />in this phase than for Phase I. (The wavy
                            border below D2r in this table shows<lb />that only the italic portion
                            was reset; one of its types turns up on B4v.) Here<lb />again, it
                            appears that quire A was printed after quire D: D1v was distributed at<lb />the
                            end of this phase and two of its types show up on A2r. On the other
                            hand,<lb />quire A held onto most of its type from this phase onward and
                            could not have<lb />supplied it to D or any other quire. It also looks
                            (on the evidence of only two<lb />types, but both are quite distinctive)
                            as if quires D and C were finished print&#x002D;<lb />ing before quire B
                            could be set&#x2014;again, because quire B carries its types largely<lb />unaltered
                            into the next phase, while the donor pages in quires C and D give up<lb />type
                            after Phase II. These observations show that quires C and D were printed<lb />before
                            quires A and B. The fact that Phase II of quire A actually consisted of
                            two<lb />separate printings complicates the picture. In &#x00A7;5, I
                            suggested that, after an inter&#x002D;<lb />ruption in the
                            Phase&#x002D;II printing of A(o), Norton chose to perfect the sheets he<lb />had
                            already printed rather than resuming the planned run of the outer forme
                            and<lb />then perfecting both sub&#x002D;impressions in a single
                            operation. The motive would be<lb />to prioritize the completion of at
                            least part of the planned impression of sheet A<lb />in order to get
                            some complete sets of sheets to the publisher for sale. This
                            strat&#x002D;<lb />egy would make more sense if quire A came later, even
                            last, in the sequence of<lb />quires as printed. However, if quire A
                            came last and if therefore B followed D<lb />directly, the composition
                            of B's outer forme (the first one printed in B) would have<lb />had to
                            wait for the italic from D2r (in the second forme printed in D) to
                            become<lb />available. This would leave the press idle, at least for
                            purposes of machining <hi rend="italic">ToP</hi>.<lb />If, instead, A
                            followed D directly, its outer forme would still be standing from<lb />Phase
                            I and printing could have proceeded on that while D was broken down<lb />and
                            the types incorporated into A(i). So, the slightly more likely sequence
                            for this<lb />second phase of printing was C&#x002D;D&#x002D;A(Phase
                            IIa)&#x002D;B. Probably Phase IIb of quire A<lb />came last, but it
                            cannot have been delayed long because two of the three surviv&#x002D;<lb />ing
                            books that contain it also have Phase II of sheets B&#x002D;D.</p>
                        <p>The textual changes in quire A are minor for Phase II and would have had<lb />no
                            bearing on a decision to leave the production of that quire for later.
                            Possibly it <pb n="160" /> came later in the sequence because that was
                            the order followed in Phase I. Quire<lb />B, on the other hand, came
                            into this phase with only one type&#x002D;page intact; all the<lb />others
                            had to be reset. So, it would have made sense to commence printing with<lb />quires
                            C, D, and A, leaving time for the resetting of B.</p>
                        <p>I have left quire "a" out of the discussion for this phase because it
                            holds onto<lb />most of its original types throughout the production. We
                            would normally expect<lb />it to come late in the series, probably after
                            quires B and/or A(Phase IIa).</p>

                        <p>This phase began with the resetting of four pages, italic raids on two
                            others,<lb />and some localized resettings. Only the inner forme of
                            quire B was distributed<lb />before the next phase. Its donation of a

                            phase,<lb />and most of sheets A&#x002D;C also enter Phase IV unchanged
                            except for localized reset&#x002D;<lb />tings to accommodate revisions
                            and resulting page&#x002D;break changes. The exception<lb />is quire B
                            inner forme, which was entirely reset. As usual, there is no obvious<lb />reason
                            why Norton reset this forme and not others. But table 34 shows that some<lb />of
                            the types from the first page of text (A1r) turn up again in the two
                            last pages&#x2014;<lb />B3V and 4r&#x2014;of the newly set B(i). So,
                            A(o) was already printed and being dis&#x002D;<lb />tributed before B(i)
                            was ready for the press. A single letter "<hi rend="italic">a</hi>"
                            shows that Norton<lb />printed sheet D and distributed some of its type
                            before resetting three lines on<lb />B3r. Therefore&#x2014;if we again
                            take sheets to be the units of production&#x2014;both A<lb />and D
                            preceded B through the press. Quire C contains no distinctive types that <pb
                                n="161" /> allow us to place it in a sequence, and again the few
                            changes to quire "a" are<lb />insufficient to establish links with any
                            other. The sequence, then, was A&#x002D;D&#x002D;B,<lb />with the
                            positions of C and "a" unknown, though as usual we would expect the<lb />preliminaries
                            to come last.</p>
                        <p>Though the evidence of recurring types is very incomplete, it shows that
                            Nor&#x002D;<lb />ton distributed at least portions of quires A and D
                            while other quires remained to<lb />be composed. It looks as if Norton
                            knew that he had reached the end of the pro&#x002D;<lb />gram and there
                            was no point in leaving type standing against further reprints.</p>
                        <p>Some type&#x002D;matter distributed from Phase III found its way into

                            picking up for Phase IV alterations<lb />in quire A. This implies a
                            rather short delay, or none at all, between Phases III<lb />and IV.</p>
                        <p>A different case is the singleton leaf bearing "A speech to the King and<lb />Queenes

                            types with those used in the rest<lb />of the book in any phase. This
                            lack of recurrence is not too surprising, given the<lb />small sample

                            1&#x2013;8, <hi rend="sup">2</hi>i &#x002D;24;<lb />as quires A and B
                            have duplicate pagination, whole headlines could potentially<lb />have
                            been transferred between them without change. The digits themselves
                            provide<lb />scanty evidence for the re&#x002D;use of skeletons: though
                            the workman imposing<lb />the forme might have recycled digits from
                            previous pages,<lb />the types would have<lb />tended to shuffle
                            positions randomly, and it is often difficult to tell whether one<lb />of
                            them is damaged or is just another design variation in Norton's
                            heterogeneous<lb />stock. Pairs of parentheses, on the other hand, occur
                            on every page and could <pb n="162" /> very easily be re&#x002D;used
                            along with the surrounding spacing material that held the<lb />number
                            more or less centered. Being long, thin lines, parentheses are prone to<lb />damage,
                            and particularly in the case of a battered stock like Norton's, they
                            ac&#x002D;<lb />quire an individuality that bibliographers can take
                            advantage of. In my catalogu&#x002D;<lb />ing of those in <hi
                                rend="italic">ToP</hi>, I relied on visibly injured individuals, but
                            made no attempt to<lb />classify the infinite variations among the sound
                            examples that could result from<lb />different cuttings, variations in
                            inking and impression, or even inversions.</p>
                        <p>A. <hi rend="smallcaps">PHASE</hi> I</p>
                        <p>In &#x00A7;9A, I showed that the sheets in Phase I were probably printed
                            in the<lb />order B&#x002D;C&#x002D;D&#x002D;A&#x002D;a. The
                            preliminaries do not participate in the sharing of visible<lb />skeleton
                            formes, and in the following table I have arranged the other formes in<lb />my
                            proposed order of printing. In this and the subsequent tables, the codes
                            fol&#x002D;<lb />lowing the page references stand for pieces of type.
                            The abbreviations L, R, and<lb /># indicate left and right parentheses
                            and the digit(s) they enclose. A code "L#R"<lb />signifies that the
                            headline was transferred unaltered from a page earlier in the<lb />printing.
                            An "x" indicates an individual type that is undoubtedly different from<lb />the
                            one in the previous appearance of the headline; a question mark means
                            that<lb />the type is not distinctive enough to tell whether it is the
                            same or different.<lb />For example, in the table below, the left
                            parenthesis from B1v recurs on C1v; the<lb />page number changes from 2
                            to 10, so neither of the two digits can be the same<lb />types; and the
                            right parenthesis might be the same one from B1v, but I could<lb />not
                            verify this. The same left parenthesis then migrates to D2v, where again
                            the<lb />the following digit of the page number changes from 1 to 2
                            (hence "x"), and the<lb />next zero and right parenthesis could be the
                            same types from C1v but are not<lb />distinctive enough to tell. So, all
                            we can say definitely about these two transfers<lb />is that the left
                            parenthesis is conserved. We cannot say even that the transfer was<lb />direct
                            from one forme to the other; the headline could have been distributed<lb />and
                            the type coincidentally picked off the top of the pile in the case for
                            setting<lb />the new headline. In the first scenario, the action is
                            deliberate and systematic, in<lb />the second it is unconscious and
                            random. There is perhaps a tendency for types<lb />to remain in the same
                            position in the new forme; codes printed in boldface<lb />in the
                            following tables signify pages on which the type material recurs in the
                            same<lb />quarter as in its immediately previous use.</p>

                        <p>The appearance of Phase I is not one of particular regularity. Every
                            identifi&#x002D;<lb />able parenthesis switches at least once between
                            outer and inner formes during<lb />the printing history. A slightly
                            puzzling feature is the rapid re&#x002D;use of certain<lb />types, at
                            the transitions marked by the dashed vertical lines. For instance, the
                            left<lb />parenthesis on C1v (inner forme) recurs immediately in D2v
                            (outer). Since outer<lb />formes of <hi rend="italic">ToP</hi> sheets
                            were always printed before the inner ones, this proximal<lb />re&#x002D;use
                            means that the imposition of D(o) had to wait for the machining and
                            strip&#x002D;<lb />ping of C(i) to receive some of the latter's
                            headline. If presswork were proceeding<lb />smoothly, it would have
                            avoided a bit of delay to take D outer's skeletons from<lb />C(o), or
                            from somewhere else further back in the production. The same sharing<lb />occurs
                            with two types between D(i) and the next following forme, A(o). These<lb />"pinch
                            points" suggest small delays in the workflow after quires C and D,
                            pos&#x002D;<lb />sibly to accommodate other jobs or even some of the
                            composition of <hi rend="italic">ToP</hi> itself.<lb />We can eliminate
                            some of these points if we drop the assumption that the order<lb />of
                            printing is the same as the order of composition and rearrange the
                            quires in<lb />the table above; but no arrangement gets rid of them
                            entirely.</p>
                        <p>The parentheses that start their journey on B4v travel through all four
                            quires<lb />of the main text, remarkably ending up on A4v with the same
                            damaged "8". (My<lb />notation system cannot show that particular
                            coincidence.) Because quires C and<lb />D intervened, this distinctive
                            type could not have travelled with the parentheses,<lb />but was
                            evidently put aside, or back into the case, after B(o) was printed, and<lb />randomly
                            retrieved for use in A(o).</p>

                        <p>Type&#x002D;recurrence analysis (&#x00A7;9B) shows that the order of
                            printing the quires in<lb />this phase was probably
                            C&#x002D;D&#x002D;A(Phase IIa)&#x002D;B&#x002D;A(Phase IIb). Table 37
                            follows this<lb />order. In comparison with Phase I, Phase II seems to
                            have proceeded in a much<lb />more orderly fashion. Recurring characters
                            leapfrog adjacent formes, so that any<lb />one piece of type will appear
                            only in the outer or the inner, and always in the<lb />same quarter of
                            the chase (as shown by the bold typeface in the table). All three<lb />characters
                            of the A2v headline, including the page number, recur on B2v. It is<lb />odd
                            not to find any headline material from quire C participating in a
                            transfer, as<lb />all of its pages were either reimposed or completely
                            reset after it was printed.</p>
                        <p>Quire A was printed in two distinct stretches of work, Phases IIa and
                            IIb.<lb />After the first of these, the skeletons were stripped from
                            five of its eight pages.<lb />Table 37 shows that A(o) in Phase IIa
                            shares much of its headline material with <pb n="164" /> the
                            corresponding pages of B(o). When A(o) went back on the press for Phase
                            IIb,<lb />all of its headline material was new. By the time I realized
                            this, the three copies of<lb />A(IIb) were not easily accessible and I
                            was unwilling to exasperate my colleagues<lb />with yet more requests

                            between<lb />quires A and C, and B and D. Once again the printer either
                            did not have or did<lb />not take the opportunity to transfer the page
                            numbers intact between sheets A<lb />and B. The re&#x002D;use of
                            material between B(i) and C(o) would create a "pinch point"<lb />if
                            Norton followed the order shown, because the imposing of C(o) would have<lb />had
                            to wait until B(i) was off the press, cleaned, and stripped. There are
                            several<lb />ways of reordering the quire sequence to place comfortable
                            intervals between the<lb />re&#x002D;uses shown in the table: repeating
                            Phase II's order of C&#x002D;D&#x002D;A&#x002D;B would be one<lb />of
                            them. But as we lack evidence of recurring types in the text, the most
                            we can<lb />say is that it is slightly more likely that Norton printed
                            the quires out of sequential<lb />order, but we do not know what that
                            order might have been.</p>
                        <p>The five surviving copies from Phase IIIb are characterized by unique
                            page&#x002D;<lb />number settings in the outer forme of quire B. Their
                            typographic material shows<lb />no distinctive forms that occur

                        <p>Okes could conceivably have transferred some headine material between the<lb />two
                            formes of his quire D. Visual inspection shows no evidence of this,
                            partly<lb />because because his type was more uniform and in much better
                            condition than<lb />Norton's and the parentheses are too regular to show
                            useful differences.</p>

                            cur. Norton's printing of quire D carries over its headlines from Phase
                            III, and<lb />quire C has only two new headlines in eight pages, with
                            none of their material<lb />used elsewhere. Okes' headlines remain with
                            their type&#x002D;pages, unchanged from<lb />Phase III.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, the patterns of headline re&#x002D;use during the <hi
                                rend="italic">ToP</hi> printing history<lb />show that Norton's men
                            took only partial advantage of this potentially labor&#x002D;saving<lb />practice.
                            This lack of regularity might be interpreted as evidence of a chaotic<lb />work&#x002D;flow,
                            but in fact, it is not that common to find any book of the period to be<lb />completely
                            regular in this respect, and many show no headline re&#x002D;use at all.
                            The<lb />limited evidence of the practice in <hi rend="italic">ToP</hi>
                            gives the appearance that Norton settled<lb />into a slightly more
                            systematic routine as he worked through the impressions.</p>

                        progress through the several<lb />phases of printing, we will examine how
                        the various states group themselves<lb />together in formes and sheets, and
                        how the finished sheets were gathered into<lb />copies ready for folding and
                        binding. Earlier investigators (notably Unger, <name type="pname">
                        Jack&#x002D;son</name>, and <name type="pname">Greg</name>) were perplexed
                        by the range of permutations of states in copies<lb />of <hi rend="italic">
                        ToP</hi> that they examined. They attempted to explain some of the
                        complexity as<lb />resulting from duplicate settings run off concurrently to
                        satisfy the expected high<lb />demand for the text. While this was true
                        diachronically&#x2014;Norton did, in fact,<lb />set many of the pages more
                        than once through the various phases&#x2014;it is not true<lb />synchronically:
                        different settings were not in production simultaneously except<lb />for
                        Norton's and Okes' quire D. Instead, surviving copies show a degree of
                        ho&#x002D;<lb />mogeneity consistent with separate phases of printing the
                        whole book, each phase<lb />yielding a discrete batch of complete copies
                        that left the establishment before the<lb />products of the next phase could
                        mix with them. The uncommon exemplars that<lb />show mixing between phases
                        can be attributed to slightly unequal supplies of in&#x002D;<lb />dividual
                        sheets at the time of collation, requiring some copies of a given phase to<lb />be
                        completed with products of the previous or following one.<ref

                        <p>Appendix 3 shows that eighteen of the nineteen copies surviving from
                            Phase<lb />I (about 95%) are homogeneous throughout (ignoring
                            stop&#x002D;press corrections).<lb />In other words, they contain the
                            earliest settings or impositions of all the sheets<lb />including the
                            preliminaries. The one exception is Huntington 69434, in which<lb />quire
                            D comes from the next printing. This is an example of the situation just<lb />described
                            in which one quire was evidently printed a bit short in one phase and<lb />had
                            to be completed from the next. There is nothing special about quire D
                            that<lb />might have led to a short printing; recall from our type
                            analysis that it was prob&#x002D;<lb />ably printed third of the five
                            quires in Phase I.</p>
                        <p>If quire D was printed short, it seems that quire "a" was printed long.
                            In<lb />addition to the nineteen complete copies from Phase I, four
                            copies from the<lb />second printing have Phase I preliminaries. This
                            extrapolates to a 21% surplus<lb />of first&#x002D;printing quire
                            "a"&#x2014;an odd amount, being too little to represent an in&#x002D;<lb />tended
                            second impression but too large to have resulted from a trifling
                            accidental<lb />overrun. The discrepancy persists in Phase II, in which
                            each quire survives in<lb />approximately equal numbers, but a residue
                            of preliminaries is pushed over into<lb />Phase III copies. In Phase
                            III, Norton apparently shorted the run of quire "a"<lb />by a number
                            about equal to the initial overrun, so Phase IV copies are finally<lb />homogeneous
                            (if we disregard Okes' contribution)&#x2013;all "third impression" title<lb />pages
                            come with text sheets from the last printing. The phase relationship of<lb />quire
                            "a" with the main text looks like this:</p>

                        <p>Phase II represents a print run that was probably smaller than the first;

                            sub&#x002D;phases of sheet A, the products of which consort with the<lb />other
                            sheets of the book in contrasting ways. Sub&#x002D;phase IIa is found
                            only with<lb />Phase II of sheets B&#x002D;D, and it sometimes occurs
                            with the residue of Phase I prelimi&#x002D;<lb />naries.
                            Sub&#x002D;phase IIb, on the other hand, comes only with Phase II
                            prelimi&#x002D;<lb />naries, and one copy (Folger STC 22459.2) even has

                            they could not intermix. The A sheets may have been a bit

                            contain Norton's quire D and one has Okes'. This<lb />statistically
                            equal representation is consistent with my earlier conclusion that the<lb />two
                            men's sheets were effectively printed "simultaneously", so were about
                            equally<lb />available to use in any copy of Phase III.</p>
                        <p>In &#x00A7;6B, I discussed an imposition of B(o) that I called Phase
                            IIIb. The five<lb />copies containing it show some puzzling patterns in
                            their makeup. In most re&#x002D;<lb />spects they behave like normal
                            copies from Phase III. However, none of them has<lb />quire "a" from the
                            earlier phase, and all five have quire D in Norton's printing.<lb />The
                            first point is not especially surprising, given the rarity of Phase III
                            copies<lb />with quire "a" from Phase II. On the other hand, if Norton's
                            and Okes' printings<lb />of quire D were equally available to make up
                            those five copies, the probability<lb />of their ending up only with
                            Norton's is 1/32, or about 3%; so perhaps this does<lb />call for some
                            explanation. In &#x00A7;6B, I argued that Phases IIIa and IIIb of B(o)
                            were<lb />perfected in one run with the same inner forme. In the
                            resulting stack(s) of sheets,<lb />the two sub&#x002D;phases would
                            probably have remained separate strata. Hanging the<lb />sheets up to
                            dry could have led to some intermixing of the two states, but by the<lb />time
                            Phase III copies were assembled, the two sub&#x002D;phases of sheet B
                            might still<lb />have had enough spatial segregation to create
                            dissimilar patterns of association.<lb />If, for example, the IIIb's
                            ended up in a remote stack and were retrieved late in<lb />the collation
                            process, and if the supply of Okes' quire D had arrived somewhat<lb />before
                            Norton's and was exhausted first, there could be a tendency for Phase
                            IIIb <pb n="169" /> of sheet B to end up with the remainders of Norton's
                            quire D. But we cannot draw<lb />any conclusions about what happened,
                            and with the discovery of more copies the<lb />pattern shown in table 42
                            could easily fall apart and we would have something<lb />different to
                            explain.</p>

                        <p>The five copies containing Phase IIIb of quire B are already unusual in

                            unique states in two other<lb />quires is unsettling. I cannot imagine
                            an event happening during the printing of<lb />one sheet that would
                            manifest itself at about the same point during the printing<lb />of
                            another. The arbitrary realignments in quires C and D are reminiscent of
                            St.<lb />Catharine's College Z59, with its unique page&#x002D;number
                            placement on B4v (&#x00A7;6B);<lb />but here they coincide with the

                            appear during this sub&#x002D;phase improve the readings found in<lb />their

                            of the entire book, with no changes except the reset skeleton of forme

                            four of the nine traceable<lb />copies of Phase IV. Its placement among
                            the sheets would probably have been at<lb />individual binders'
                            discretion. As a sort of dedication, it could logically belong at<lb />the
                            end of the preliminaries after Shirley's original dedication; or, as it
                            referred to<lb />an event later than the first performance documented by
                            the book, it could come<lb />last. The copies I have seen show two in
                            the first location and two in the other<lb />(and Greg reported that his
                            copy had it bound after quire a.) Being a singleton, it<lb />would have
                            been prone to loss, and one does not know whether it was originally<lb />included

                        <p>By this point in the production, Norton eVidently has made an arrangement<lb />with
                            his partner <name type="pname">Nicholas Okes</name> to divide the job of
                            printing quire D. (For the<lb />possibility that <name type="pname">Okes</name>
                            was an unwitting collaborator, see &#x00A7;8B.) Okes composes<lb />his
                            own setting of those eight pages using his own type. Each man then
                            prints<lb />roughly equal numbers of the quire for Phase III. Some of
                            each man's sheets are <pb n="178" /> gathered with Phase II of the
                            preliminary quire, in which "of <name type="pname">Grayes Inne</name>"

                            D, also contains Phase IIb of quire A. From these groupings, it appears

                            alterations thereafter. The only complication is the existence, carried<lb />over

                                type="pname">Okes</name>.<lb />These occur in eight and six

                            and<lb />all of quire A seem to have had five printings each, we need to
                            take Norton's final<lb />claim of three "impressions" with a grain of
                            salt. We cannot know whether Nor&#x002D;<lb />ton actually believed
                            this, whether the various starts and stops in the work cycle<lb />caused
                            him to lose count, or even what he understood as an "impression". In the<lb />
                            period <date>1600&#x2013;40</date>, the word was used on title pages
                            essentially synonymously with<lb />"edition", but only one&#x002D;fifth
                            as often. One finds it most commonly on title pages<lb />of devotional
                            works that went into many settings, like Arthur Dent's <hi rend="italic">Plaine
                            Mans<lb />Path&#x002D;Way to Heaven;</hi> but the title pages of <name
                                type="pname">Shakespeare's</name> second and third folios<lb />also
                            identify them as later "impressions". Norton himself used the term in <date>
                            1624</date><lb />(STC 25090a, in a collaboration with <name type="pname">Augustine
                            Mathewes</name>), <date>1633</date> (23503), <date>1634</date><lb />(twice,

                            were completely new settings. It is likely that, in the case of <hi
                                rend="italic">ToP</hi>, Norton<lb />was basing his count of
                            impressions on the changes of title&#x002D;page wordings which<lb />would
                            have been noticeable to contemporary readers: states 1a1 and 2, which<lb />contained
                            "of <name type="pname">Grayes Inne</name>"; 1b, lacking those words; and

                        <p>Phase IV seems to have followed Phase III rather closely, as some types
                            from<lb />distributed portions of III turn up in IV. These types

                            shows struggles with the letters<lb />u and v. These resulted from
                            orthographic changes taking place in the printing<lb />trade around <date>
                            1630&#x2013;35</date>. Prior to this, the two graphics were variants of
                            the same<lb />letter, which was used to denote the <hi rend="italic">
                            sounds</hi> u and v indiscriminately. The letter<lb />took the
                            v&#x002D;form at the beginning of words and the u&#x002D;form elsewhere.
                            Hence the<lb />words "beauty" and "variety" used the graphics as we do
                            today, while "every"<lb />and "unless" were rendered as "euery" and
                            "vnlesse". Within the space of a few<lb />years, the English printing
                            trade converted nearly universally to the modern us&#x002D;<lb />age,
                            but for some compositors this must have been a period of confusion. Thus

                            always gives an exact<lb />date of performance. These features create a

                        <p>In the absence of relevant archival records we can draw our evidence only<lb />from

                            (which I define as lacking no more than one quire).<lb />This represents
                            an average of 13.75 copies per printing. I performed a survey of<lb />39
                            editions of other individually printed masques catalogued in ESTC. These
                            show<lb />an average survival rate of 10.64 copies per edition (&#x03C3;

                            somewhat higher than average<lb />for a masque. It was also unique in

                            could extrapolate from our reasonably hefty sample to conjecture that
                            the four<lb />printings of <hi rend="italic">ToP</hi> yielded a total of
                            about 1.3 &#x02D9; 4<hi rend="italic">n</hi> copies, where <hi
                                rend="italic">n</hi> is the average<lb />print run for a masque and
                            1.3 is the factor by which the average print run of <hi rend="italic">
                            ToP </hi>appears to exceed that of an average masque. However, these
                            figures rest on shaky<lb />foundations. For several reasons, ESTC often
                            fails to list all known copies of an<lb />edition. This incomplete
                            reporting could magnify the apparent disparity between<lb /><hi
                                rend="italic">ToP</hi>'s numbers and those of other masques which
                            have not attracted as much scru&#x002D;<lb />tiny. Even if the factor
                            1.3 is valid, the higher&#x002D;than&#x002D;average survival of <hi
                                rend="italic">ToP</hi> could be<lb />partly the result of higher
                            retention rates due to the masque's contemporary fame.<lb />And because
                            we have no good evidence for the normal print run of a masque,
                            as&#x002D;<lb />signing a value to <hi rend="italic">n</hi> in the
                            equation above is a very subjective process.</p>
                        <p>The relative sizes of <hi rend="italic">ToP</hi>'s four printings are
                            also hard to fix. If we use quire C<lb />as the most stable marker of
                            which phase a particular copy of <hi rend="italic">ToP</hi> comes from,<lb />the
                            numbers of survivors are 19, 10, 17, and 9 respectively. By the time I
                            was<lb />reaching the 50&#x002D;copy mark, I assumed that the relative
                            distributions had stabi&#x002D;<lb />lized. But I was surprised when,
                            late in my investigations, several more copies of<lb /><hi rend="italic">
                            ToP</hi> emerged and most of them clustered in Phase III. This skewing
                            of the data<lb />scuttled my preliminary conclusion that a large first
                            printing was followed by<lb />three approximately equal but smaller
                            ones.</p>
                        <p>Is the spread in the survival rates of the four printings of <hi

                            setting 10,000 ens per day. Based on this rate, the undistracted
                            composing of<lb /><hi rend="italic">ToP</hi> should have occupied two
                            and a half man&#x002D;days. So, typesetting should not<lb />have been a
                            bottleneck in getting <hi rend="italic">ToP</hi> onto the market.</p>
                        <p>Presswork went slower than composing, for a comparable amount of text. In<lb />the
                            case of the Cambridge Press, McKenzie found that "an output of well over<lb />1000
                            perfected sheets a day from a full&#x002D;press [employing two men] was
                            quite<lb />regularly achieved and sustained for lengthy periods."<ref

<pb n="188" /> a half
                            sheets. If we apply McKenzie's finding to my hypothetical figure of 1200<lb />copies
                            for the first printing of <hi rend="italic">ToP</hi>, a
                            full&#x002D;press dedicated to the one job should<lb />have taken about
                            five and a half days&#x2014;just short of a regular
                            work&#x002D;week&#x2014;to<lb />machine the nine formes of <hi
                                rend="italic">ToP</hi>, not counting the time to change the formes.
                            If<lb /><name type="pname">Norton</name> delegated two men to the press
                            and one man to composing (and distrib&#x002D;<lb />uting, for the first
                            italic raid), he should have been able to complete Phase I with a hard
                            six&#x002D;day week's work plus an extra day or so. Of course, preparing
                            for<lb />the job&#x2014;making design decisions, casting off copy,
                            readying the paper, cutting<lb />frisket sheets, and the
                            like&#x2014;would have taken some additional time. But one can<lb />
                            imagine <name type="pname">Norton</name> receiving copy as late as the
                            day of registry&#x2014;24 January&#x2014;and,<lb />if necessary, having
                            finished books from Phase I available very shortly after the<lb />first
                            performance nine days later.</p>
                        <p>The later printings, since they re&#x002D;used standing type to varying
                            degrees, de&#x002D;<lb />manded much less composition time. <name
                                type="pname">Norton's</name> shop set 24,800 ens for Phase I;<lb />Phase
                            II involved the resetting of about 9680 ens, Phase III (including its
                            sub&#x002D;<lb />phases) 3960, and Phase IV 4110. <name type="pname">Nicholas
                            Okes</name> had to set 6220 ens for his<lb />Phase III quire D; then his
                            Phase IV was either an unaltered reimpression or was<lb />printed as
                            part of Phase III. I have figured his total press time as the same
                            either<lb />way. Using my thoroughly unreliable edition sizes, and the
                            rates of work given<lb />above&#x2014;setting 10,000 ens a day and
                            printing 1000 sheets a day&#x2014;and rounding up to the
                            half&#x002D;day, we arrive at the following approximate figures:</p>
                        <table>
                            <head><hi rend="smallcaps">TABLE</hi> 43. Estimate of minimum production
                                time for all copies</head>
                            <row>
                                <cell>
                                    <figure xml:id="fig-57">
                                        <graphic url="V7480-Meulen-SB60_Final_057.jpg" />
                                    </figure>

                            </row>
                        </table>
                        <p>So, the entire production cycle of <hi rend="italic">ToP</hi> required a
                            little less than one man&#x002D;<lb />week of composing, and somewhat
                            less than three weeks at full&#x002D;press. Of course<lb />these
                            calculations cannot give an actual total. We assume, for instance, that
                            com&#x002D;<lb />posing and presswork often went on
                            simultaneously&#x2014;a sensible apportionment<lb />of labor in <name
                                type="pname">Norton's</name> small shop would be two men printing
                            and one composing.<lb />His partner <name type="pname">Okes</name> could
                            have been working concurrently on his share, so his <pb n="189" /> hours
                            (though only less than two days) should not figure in the total time.
                            And<lb />my estimates of the print runs could be too high. All of these
                            factors would com&#x002D;<lb />press the computed time required to print
                            all the copies. It is worth noting that<lb />the imprint date remains <date>
                            1633</date> in all four impressions. For this publication <name
                                type="pname">Nor&#x002D;<lb />ton</name> was using the legal
                            calendar, in which the year date changed on Lady Day<lb />(25 March). If
                            the fourth printing of the <hi rend="italic">ToP</hi> preliminaries
                            began after this day,<lb />he would have had some motivation for
                            advancing the year date to emphasize<lb />the book's currency. But this
                            would have been a small improvement, and we have<lb />seen that <name
                                type="pname">Norton's</name> attention to detail was fitful at best.
                            Still, we can say with some<lb />confidence that <name type="pname">
                            Norton</name> could not have turned out all four impressions of <hi
                                rend="italic">ToP</hi> in<lb />less than three or four weeks.</p>
                        <p>This is a best&#x002D;case estimate, and I have not factored in some
                            contingencies<lb />that must have dilated the history. For instance,
                            besides the preliminary jobs al&#x002D;<lb />ready mentioned (design,
                            frisket cutting, etc.), I have omitted the time required<lb />to compose
                            the title page, other display lines, and skeletons. Every setting or<lb />resetting
                            implies a distribution; because that job can be put off indefinitely, or<lb />run
                            concurrently with printing, I have ignored it in my calculations. Most
                            impor&#x002D;<lb />tantly, the later italic raids show that <name
                                type="pname">Norton</name> had one or more other jobs in train<lb />along
                            with <hi rend="italic">ToP</hi>, as was normal in printing shops. Since
                            I have not been able to<lb />identify these jobs, I cannot gauge their
                            impact on the <hi rend="italic">ToP</hi> history.</p>
                        <p>The paper evidence, on the other hand, serves to constrain the timeline.
                            I<lb />have assembled watermark information, in more or less detail, for
                            three&#x002D;fifths of<lb />the copies of <hi rend="italic">ToP</hi> as
                            well as (mostly single copies of) fourteen of the twenty&#x002D;seven<lb />
                            publications <name type="pname">Norton</name> put his name to in <date>
                            1633</date> and <date>1634</date>. Among this group, <hi rend="italic">
                            ToP </hi>is almost unique in having one type of mark that I have not
                            found named or<lb />described anywhere. In one version, it is a fat
                            spindle with pointed or slightly<lb />rounded terminations; in the
                            other, one end of the spindle is either a full semi&#x002D;<lb />circle
                            or softly flattened into a broad but still curved base, the other end
                            being<lb />pointed. (Figure 4 gives slightly idealized renderings.) All
                            varieties have a sinuous<lb />line inside, running roughly down the long
                            axis, usually connected to the spindle<lb />at the sharper end and
                            sometimes terminating in a loop inside. Most of the forms<lb />have an
                            additional short line coming out of each end, often with its own
                            termi&#x002D;<lb />nating loop. I have found eight spindle variations in <hi
                                rend="italic">ToP</hi>, and in Phases I&#x002D;III of<lb />quires
                            A&#x002D;D it is the dominant type of mark. Second most common is a
                            hand, usu&#x002D;<lb />ally containing the initials "PD" (four
                            varieties). Another has initials "GM", and<lb />in a sixth variety the
                            initials are lacking or illegible. The hands all have a flower<lb />or a
                            grape cluster at the fingertips. The third type of mark includes six
                            varieties<lb />of pot, two containing the initials RP or RF. One of
                            these may have a handle and<lb />might therefore be called a jug.
                            Finally, there is one example of a broad mark<lb />(over four
                            centimeters) of uncertain form, but apparently bracketed by two short<lb />convex
                            columns. I have called this "posts". In all the copies examined, only
                            one<lb />sheet (quire C of B.L. Ashley <date>1696</date>) seemed to lack
                            a mark. The frequencies of<lb />the marks in quires A&#x002D;D are as
                            follows:<ref target="#CH3-n63">

                        <p>The spindles, I believe, are significant for two reasons. First, their
                            frequency<lb />drops at Phase IV, with hands coming into the majority
                            and pots making a surge.<lb />Although the sample size is small, these
                            shifts could indicate a transition into a<lb />different mixture of
                            paper stocks and hence a rather longer pause after Phase III<lb />than
                            after I or II. Secondly, of the other books printed by <name
                                type="pname">Norton</name> in <date>1633&#x2013;34</date><lb />that
                            I was able to examine, only one contains a spindle: that is the
                            Huntington<lb />copy of the seventh quarto of <hi rend="italic">
                                <name type="pname">Richard II</name>
                            </hi>,
                            dated <date>1634</date>. It has two specific versions<lb />found in <hi
                                rend="italic">ToP</hi>, as well as two <hi rend="italic">ToP</hi>
                            hands, along with two marks which I found in<lb /><hi rend="italic">
                                <name type="pname">Richard II</name>
                            </hi>
                            only. The received wisdom about printers' paper stocks is that they<lb />bought
                            only what they needed for specific jobs, and this makes economic sense.<lb />Indeed,
                            the stock found in <hi rend="italic">ToP</hi> Phases I&#x002D;III is
                            consistent with a single batch of<lb />paper assembled by a vendor from
                            the products of two or more makers. The<lb />odd post or pot could
                            either be odds slipped into the ream by the vendor or<lb />leftovers
                            from a previous lot remaining in <name type="pname">Norton's</name>
                            shop. In practice, the end of<lb />a job never precisely coincides with
                            the end of the paper supply, and <name type="pname">Norton</name> was<lb />a
                            busy man, printing about 250 edition&#x002D;sheets that we know of in <date>
                            1633</date> (though<lb />that number drops to around 150 the next year).
                            A more sensible response to a<lb />continuous need for the
                            middling&#x002D;quality pot&#x002D;sized paper found in virtually all<lb />
                            of <name type="pname">Norton's</name> books of the period would be to
                            periodically estimate the projected<lb />demand for incoming work and
                            top off an in&#x002D;shop supply that all the jobs could<lb />draw upon.
                            Thus, we would expect frequently to find the same marks (by which <pb
                                n="191" /> I mean paper from the same specific moulds) in
                            publications printed around the<lb />same time. This is the sort of
                            evidence we find in <hi rend="italic">ToP</hi> and <hi rend="italic">
                                <name type="pname">Richard II</name>
                            </hi>
                            ,<ref target="#CH3-n64">
                                <hi rend="sup">64</hi>
                            </ref> and I
                            pre&#x002D;<lb />dict that if more copies of the latter are examined,
                            they will contain a proportion<lb />of spindles to hands comparable to
                            that of Phase IV of <hi rend="italic">ToP.</hi> A finding of similar<lb />paper
                            stocks would indicate that the two books were printed in quick
                            succession,<lb /><hi rend="italic">ToP</hi> first, or even with some
                            overlap.</p>
                        <p>The distinctive mixture of marks in the four phases of <hi rend="italic">
                            ToP</hi> tightens their<lb />temporal bond. It reinforces the evidence
                            that <name type="pname">Norton</name> produced the first three<lb />impressions
                            in as short a time as he could. It also shows that there is little
                            chance<lb />that he paused for long between Phases III and IV. Standing
                            paper, like stand&#x002D;<lb />ing type, is vulnerable to appropriation
                            by more urgent projects. The fact that<lb />the paper in Phase IV shows
                            significant overlap with the distinctive paper stock<lb />used in the
                            previous printings is consistent with my finding of broken types from<lb />Phase
                            III recurring in Phase IV (�9D). Both support a conclusion that <name
                                type="pname">Norton</name><lb />did not wait long before embarking
                            on the last impression. I would guess that the<lb />four print runs were
                            all over within two months.</p>

                    <p>I have presented evidence showing that <name type="pname">John Norton</name>
                        printed <hi rend="italic">The Triumph<lb />of Peace</hi> in four
                        impressions, with hiatuses within the second and third of these.<lb />Varying
                        amounts of text&#x2014;but always much less than half of the
                        book&#x2014;were<lb />distributed and reset before each of the later
                        impressions, at least partly to sup&#x002D;<lb />ply other jobs running
                        concurrently. The preliminaries, including the title page,<lb />also went
                        through four impressions, but in different quantities from the text<lb />quires,
                        so that the first two states of the title may each occur with two possible<lb />impressions
                        of the text. Other, smaller disparities in print runs among the text<lb />quires
                        produced occasional copies containing quires from adjacent impressions,<lb />further
                        complicating the problems of identification. However, in general the four<lb />printings
                        of the text come together in a few consistent combinations with little<lb />intermixing.
                        The state of quire C is the clearest indicator of which impression a<lb />copy
                        belongs to, but fully characterizing exemplars of the first three printings
                        still<lb />requires the specification of many variables. About half of the
                        copies of the third<lb />and fourth impressions contain type&#x002D;material
                        from <name type="pname">Norton's</name> partner <name type="pname">Nicholas<lb />
                        Okes</name> and are presumed to have been printed by him.</p>
                    <p>The difficulties that earlier bibliographers had with <hi rend="italic">ToP</hi>
                        arose largely from<lb />their point of view. Like astronomers of the
                        Ptolemaic paradigm, they put the<lb />most familiar element&#x2014;the title
                        page, in this case&#x2014;at the center and saw the<lb />rest of the system
                        behaving with a bewildering complexity. Moving the main part<lb />of the
                        book&#x2014;the text&#x2014;to the center and relegating the title page to
                        its own odd<lb />but explainable orbit eliminates much of the need to invoke
                        mysterious causes.<lb />Even so, the book offers seemingly unlimited
                        surprises&#x2014;even unto the fifty&#x002D;fifth<lb />copy&#x2014;and
                        mysteries whose unravelling I will now leave, as did Greg, to those <note

                        lessons that might point the way to a fresh approach to certain
                        diffi&#x002D;<lb />cult cases. For example, both Greg and <hi rend="italic">
                        STC</hi> treat <name type="pname">Philip Massinger's</name>
<hi rend="italic">The
                        Picture</hi><lb />(<date>1630</date>) as one edition with a confusing array
                        of variants.<ref target="#CH3-n66">
                            <hi rend="sup">66</hi>
                        </ref> A brief comparison
                        of<lb />copies, with attention to the skeletons, reveals a similar situation
                        to that of <hi rend="italic">ToP:</hi><lb />there were at least two
                        impressions, though in this case the copies contain sheets<lb />drawn
                        indiscriminately from both. Perhaps not coincidentally, the printer was<lb />
                        again <name type="pname">John Norton</name>, and one immediately recognizes
                        the characteristic slovenli&#x002D;<lb />ness that he inflicted on his
                        lower&#x002D;end work. Looking at <hi rend="italic">The Picture</hi> in this
                        light<lb />may ease the work of the next editor, but it also at least
                        doubles our estimate of<lb />the play's sales during the author's lifetime.
                        I cannot believe that <hi rend="italic">The Triumph<lb />of Peace</hi> and <hi
                            rend="italic">The Picture</hi> form the tip of a particularly large
                        iceberg, but they<lb />do underline the need to pay close attention to
                        skeletons, especially when the<lb />headlines contain nothing more than page
                        numbers. We are still exploring the<lb />range of ingenious&#x2014;if not
                        devious&#x2014;shifts that early modern printers could use<lb />to make
                        their lives easier.</p>

                        rearranged entries, while a greatly abbreviated 4&#x002D;page version of the<lb />dictionary
                        survives as part of MS AND/25. The index of MS SMP/3 is laid out<lb />in the

                        ruled&#x002D;off<lb />sections. The scribes responsible for the copy did not
                        attempt to reproduce one<lb />another's handwriting; rather, one scribe
                        repeatedly identifies his own dictionary<lb />entries with a trefoil paraph.

                        of ships, sections of which have been labelled alphabetically. The<lb />labels
                        correspond to the brief index of the abbreviated dictionary, suggesting that<lb />the

                        italics). The <hi rend="italic">Parts and Things belonging to a Ship</hi>
                        tradition derives from Crane's<lb />early cluster of similar copies which
                        share textual characteristics common to all<lb />other copies, suggesting
                        that at least some of these were repeatedly recopied<lb />texts. These
                        manuscripts are the Sutherland Collectioncopy, National Maritime<lb />Museum
                        Caird Library MS LEC/9, the Devonshire Collection copy, National<lb />Library

                        16/127. The three<lb />Crane copies (the Sutherland Collection copy, Caird
                        MS LEC/9, and the De<lb />vonshire Collection copy) are textually identical,
                        except that Caird MS LEC/9<lb />lacks the entry 'wast' ('betweene the
                        maine&#x002D;mast and the fore&#x002D;castle'), and the<lb />Devonshire
                        collection copy enters 'harpings' ('the breadth of [the ship] at the<lb />bowe')
                        in a different location. Similarly, SP 16/127 introduces the new entry<lb />'girdling'
                        ('to double plancke [...]aboue the water lyne'), and National Library of<lb /><name

                        these variations, it cannot be assumed<lb />that these copies were directly
                        copied from one another, but it is clear that they<lb />formed, or are
                        related to copies that formed, an early group of witnesses. None<lb />of

                        manuscripts and the <date>1644</date> printed text. The text found<lb />in
                        one of these manuscripts, <name type="pname">BL Harley MS</name> 2301 went
                        on to influence the entire<lb /><hi rend="italic">Nomenclator Navalis</hi>
                        tradition. There are several points at which surviving manu&#x002D;<lb />scripts
                        could feasibly have been copied from one another: <name type="pname">BL
                        Harley MS</name> 6268<lb />copies the manicule locations of BL Sloane MS
                        207, while <name type="pname">Crane's Lambeth Pal&#x002D;<lb />ace</name> MS
                        91 and Lambeth Palace Sion College MS L.40.2/E48 are indistinguish&#x002D;<lb />able,
                        both textually and in their presentation. BL Sloane MS 207 was copied<lb />from
                        the manuscript of the text given to Zouche,since it retains the presentation<lb />copy's
                        dedicatory address. University of Illinois MS 0211 resembles both the BL<lb /><name

                        pairs share an otherwise unique relocation of 'shore'. Despite their variant<lb />producers,
                        owners, and physical properties, the texts contained in the extant<lb />manuscripts
                        are strikingly interlinked, often drawing upon one or more other<lb />copies
                        of the dictionary.</p>
                    <p>Most notably, the reproduction of this text almost always involved the
                        re&#x002D;<lb />location of dictionary entries and often included the
                        addition or omission of<lb />content. Although the popularity of the
                        dictionary testifies to the need for a book<lb />explaining nautical terms
                        to 'gentlemen commanders', its ownership amongst<lb />already experienced
                        naval figures indicates that it also represented the combined<lb />knowledge
                        of the naval and military figures among whom it circulated, including<lb />Mervyn,
                        Carew, Denbigh, and Northumberland. The manuscript circulation of<lb />the
                        text helped to produce a living collection of nautical definitions which
                        re&#x002D;<lb />flected and informed current usage.</p>

                <p>Besides establishing the provenance of one of the University of Virginia's<lb />bibliographic

                    research both in and around books. While archives, bibliographies,<lb />and
                    institutional records—that is, peripheral sources—are recognized tools in<lb />determining
                    the individual pasts of books, the books themselves offer physical<lb />evidence
                    to which bibliographers are uniquely attuned. It follows, then, that this<lb />evidence
                    must be retained and protected, even (and perhaps especially) when<lb />deemed
                    insignificant. As shown here, historical bindings convey clues that might<lb />only
                    become legible in the future and after renewed scrutiny. In this, Owen<lb />

                        English. These were obviously stylistic sources<lb />for "Oxen of the Sun,"
                        which Joyce was writing at the time, using Latin and early<lb />forms of

                        title "Works," which almost certainly denotes a publication in English.
                        Al&#x002D;<lb />though the French title has the benefit of being a
                        two&#x002D;volume edition, this cor&#x002D;<lb />respondence is probably
                        coincidental.<name type="pname">Joyce</name> may well have read the French
                        texts<lb />of <name type="pname">Moli&#x00E8;re's</name> plays as well as
                        English translations. Since <name type="pname">Joyce's</name> other
                        citations on<lb />the inventory are all precise recordings of titles taken
                        from the books themselves,<lb />which generally indicate their language, we

                        to do, that "Works" is an arbitrary or casual designation. Two English<lb />editions
                        of Moli&#x00E8;re with the title <hi rend="italic">The Works</hi> may be
                        suggested, to which these vo&#x002D;<lb />lumes plausibly belonged: Baker

                        both French and English, or <name type="pname">Van Laun's</name>
                        twelve&#x002D;volume edition of<lb /><date>1890</date>, which was only in

                        </ref> The latter is
                        preferable by far, due to its more<lb />recent publication date and also the
                        fact that <name type="pname">Joyce</name> owned a separate French<lb />edition,
                        which the former would render unnecessary. If we are to determine the<lb />exact

                        Four allusions in the novel corroborate Collier as the most likely<lb />source
                        for <lb />Joyce's<lb /> references to Greek history. The first is at the
                        very beginning of<lb /><hi rend="italic">Ulysses,</hi> when <name
                            type="pname">Buck Mulligan</name> says to Stephen: "Ah, Dedalus, the
                        Greeks! I must<lb />teach you. You must read them in the original. <hi
                            rend="italic">Thalatta! Thalatta!</hi> She is our great<lb />sweet
                        mother" (<hi rend="italic">U</hi> 1.79&#x2013;80). Molly repeats this phrase
                        in English at the end of<lb />her soliloquy: "the sea the sea" (<hi
                            rend="italic">U</hi> 18. <date>1598</date>). These allusions are to the
                        shout of<lb /><name type="pname">Cyrus</name> the Younger's army, the Ten
                        Thousand, towards the end of Xenophon's <hi rend="italic">Anabasis,</hi>
                        when they reach the mountains (Xen. <hi rend="italic">An.</hi> 4.7.24). But <name

                        ancient work itself. He could instead have drawn the phrase from Collier,
                        who not only preserves the same Greek transliteration "Thalatta, Thallata"
                        as a subheading to his chapter "The Ten Thousand," but also narrates the
                        historical moment itself:</p>
                    <p>After forcing their way through hosts of barbarians, the vanguard reached the
                        summit<lb />of the ridge Theches (now K&#x00F3;p Tagh), and with
                        tear&#x002D;dimmed eyes saw the waters<lb />of the Euxine heaving against
                        the northern horizon. From rank to rank, in the var&#x002D;<lb />ious
                        dialects of the Grecian tongue, a joyous cry spread: The Sea! the Sea! and<lb />weather&#x002D;worn
                        warriors fell sobbing on their comrades' necks, as they thought of their
                        escape.<ref target="#CH6-n65">

                        accepted and told by Collier: "Pyrrhus then turned away to Argos &#x2026; a

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">JEAN</hi> Badovici, a Romanian by birth, studied
                    architecture in Paris at the &#x00C9;cole<lb />des Beaux Arts and the
                    &#x00C9;cole Sp&#x00E9;ciale d'Architecture, where he earned<lb />his degree in <date>
                    1919</date>. His subsequent architectural practice consisted largely in his
                    participation in the post&#x002D;WWII reconstruction of several towns
                    innortheast<lb /><name type="place">France</name>, and a minor role in his
                    earlier collaboration on his own houses in V&#x00E9;zelay<lb />and
                    Cap&#x002D;Martin with his then&#x002D;lover, the Irish designer Eileen Gray.
                    But it was<lb />as an editor and author, in books and periodicals throughout the <date>
                    1920</date>s and 30s,<lb />that he played a pivotal role in the documentation
                    and dissemination of the international<lb />architectural avant&#x002D;garde.
                    And the informal architectural education<lb />he provided Gray, along with the
                    publication of its most prominent result &#x2013; the<lb />house at
                    Cap&#x002D;Martin known as E.1027 &#x2013; both gave birth to and preserved one<lb />of
                    the era's residential masterpieces.</p>
                <p>Badovici published his first book, <hi rend="italic">Maisons de rapport de
                    Charles Plumet</hi>, for<lb />&#x00C9;ditions Albert Moranc&#x00E9; in early <date>

                    book, Moranc&#x00E9;'s<lb />friendly rival, Albert Levy, recruited Badovici to
                    edit a revival of the<lb />review <hi rend="italic">l'Architecte</hi>, which had
                    ceased publication at the start of the first World War. Badovici signed a
                    contract on May 30th, promising the first monthly issue<lb />for February <date>
                    1924</date>, as well as two books each year similar to the one on Plumet;<lb />suggested
                    subjects included Plumet (again), Sauvage, Perret,S&#x00FC;e et Mare, and<lb />Dervaux.
                    The contract, however, was voided the same day, as Levy balked at<lb />the cost
                    of supporting both Badovici and Christian Zervos &#x2013; Badovici's friend,<lb />roommate,
                    and fellow Moranc&#x00E9; editor &#x2013; as co&#x002D;editors. It is unclear
                    whether this<lb />dual editorship was planned from the start (it is not

                    each issue abandoned the review's earlier survey approach and became<lb />decidedly
                    monographic in nature. This ultimately led to the republishing<lb />of most

                    dated incorrectly, or catalogued misleadingly:<lb />the primary bibliography on
                    Le Corbusier, for instance, could not even state<lb />conclusively the number of

                        (automne/hiver)</hi> volume of that year. To further complicate matters, the
                        numbering<lb />of the fascicules didn't begin until the third year, with
                        number 7; the four<lb />fascicules of <date>1928</date> are incorrectly
                        designated <hi rend="italic">"cinqui&#x00E8;me ann&#x00E9;e,"</hi> repeating
                        that of<lb /><date>1927</date>; and the first three fascicules of <date>1931</date>
                        are numbered 35&#x2013;37, instead of 31&#x2013;33<lb />as they should have
                        been. There are other anomalies. The Spring and Summer<lb />issues of <date>
                        1929</date> were issued together, in a single paper portfolio cover
                        bearingboth<lb />dates; no <hi rend="italic">sommaires</hi> were necessary,
                        as the table of contents at the end of the text<lb />was sufficient, which
                        also meant that these issues were unnumbered, although the<lb />numbering of
                        the following issues took them into account. The same is also true of the
                        Spring and Summer issues of <date>1932</date>. The Autumn<date>1930</date>
                        issue contained the<lb />entire text of the completed volume, again leaving
                        no reason for the <hi rend="italic">sommaires</hi> and<lb />their numbers;
                        the Winter <date>1930</date> issue consisted solely of its 25 plates.</p>
                    <p>The numbering of the individual fascicules was certainly an afterthought by<lb /><name
                            type="pname">Badovici</name>, perhaps in recognition that many of the
                        issues sold were not being collated<lb />into volumes, as intended. And
                        considering that almost half of them were<lb />either unnumbered or
                        misnumbered, it seems prudent to locate an article in,<lb />say, volume II
                        of <date>1929</date>, rather than number 26. In the <date>1976</date> Da
                        Capo reprint of<lb />the review, this is the method taken in compiling a new
                        comprehensive index,<lb />even though the twenty&#x002D;one original volumes
                        have been condensed to five.<ref target="#CH7-n8">

                        makes most sense with the earlier volumes, where the variety of projects<lb />shown

                        certain later volumes, where both fascicules followed the same theme. But in<lb />many
                        cases the numbering of individual issues makes a clearer distinction of how<lb />the

                        of continuing the numbers of the text pages. It may have been intended<lb />to
                        be placed at the front of the combined text pages, although thiswould have<lb />left
                        the four pages of front matter out; in every other volume these were

                        (fig. 3.9). There is a <hi rend="italic">sommaire</hi> with<lb />the <hi

                        to the review appears on the first text page, numbered 33;<lb />and the

                        issue<lb />as well, although they are not present here. This may have been a

                        and other supplies<lb />may have led to some creative packaging: surplus

                        substitute for the contents of the <hi rend="italic">extraits.</hi> Either<lb />new
                        covers were printed to enclose the old contents, or the covers themselves<lb />were

                        December, and would include articles by Badovici and Le Cor&#x002D;<lb />busier.
                        Like the double issue of Spring/Summer <date>1929</date> devoted to Le

                    <p>The special Russian&#x002D;themed issue parallels the earlier Le Corbusier

                        1928</date> issue. In repackaging the <date>1930</date> fascicules to join
                        the growing<lb />collection of <hi rend="italic">extraits</hi>,
                        Moranc&#x00E9; avoided the out&#x002D;of&#x002D;sequence publication that
                        had<lb />occurred in the Corbusier series by publishing two volumes
                        together, withthe<lb /><date>1926</date> and <date>1928</date> material
                        together forming the first volume. Publication was in<lb />early <date>1931</date>,
                        and the two volumes were initially offered only as a set.<ref

                    <p>The individual portfolio covers, possibly designed by Badovici, inaugurate<lb />the

                        Overlapping this, in a<lb />curveless lettering reminiscent of De Stijl, in
                        black and running vertically, is the<lb />title: <hi rend="smallcaps">L'ARCHITECTURE

                        or 2<hi rend="sup">E</hi> S&#x00C9;RIE. The overall effect is that of a

                        the transition from quarterly review to stand&#x002D;alone book (fig. 5.3).</p>
                    <p>In the Summer of <date>1933</date>, another fascicule of the review was
                        dedicated to Rus&#x002D;<lb />sian work, bringing the total to four and a

                        were all renumbered to begin at one (fig. 5.6, plate 7). The cover for this<lb />volume,
                        as mentioned earlier, takes on a new form, with a diagonally placed
                        pho&#x002D;<lb />tograph wrapping around to the rear cover, where the
                        publisher's emblem has<lb />now changed to the bull's&#x002D;eye design, all

                        number in the lower right hand corner. The rear covers<lb />are blank, with
                        no <hi rend="smallcaps">EAM</hi> emblem evident as the publications make the

                        numbering (fig. 8.1, plate 11). Only the initial signature is replaced to<lb />reflect
                        its independence from the review; the new title page now includes <hi

                        The new title page does not<lb />have a subtitle other than the designation <hi

                        included.<lb />The third volume again reproduces two consecutive issues of
                        the review, Autumn<lb />and Winter of <date>1931</date>, although these were
                        not as coherently joined in a double<lb />issue as the first volume (fig.
                        8.5). The new front matter again forgoes a subtitle,<lb />but the volume was
                        later advertised as <hi rend="italic">Walter Gropius et le jeune

                        were reissued at a later<lb />date, with new portfolio covers in the

                        on the re&#x002D;<lb />verse, the impression of the letterpress printing
                        creating a raised ghost of the<lb />original title. The rear covers

                        words, recycled as well (figs. 8.2, 8.4, 8.6, 8.8; plate 12). In a copy held<lb />by
                        the Getty Research Institute Library, blank pages on the inside faces of the<lb />cardboard
                        covers (where ads for otherMoranc&#x00E9; titles are typically found) turn<lb />out

                        the poverty of materials points to publication during the Occupation, with<lb />additional
                        corroboration from ownership signatures: Gordon Bunshaft bought all<lb />four

                            rend="italic">Une cit&#x00E9; industrielle</hi> suggests that its second

                        production. For the latter publication,<lb />the images were reproduced
                        again from the original drawings, often cropped<lb />to include a slightly
                        larger area of the originals than in the first edition. This is<lb />most
                        noticeable in plate 32, an interior perspective of <hi rend="italic">La

                        the second edition; the image shown<lb />by Moranc&#x00E9; (on plate 14) is
                        clearly from the earlier printing. It is possible that<lb />Badovici's

                        cover must have seemed a more appropriate<lb />model for the Garnier cover.

                        was to have twenty pages of text and fifty&#x00E9;six plates, probably drawn

                        of plates. The only other Ferret plate published in the review was of the<lb />Pavillon

                        the Winter <date>1925</date> issue. The twenty pages of text corresponds
