    <note n="17">Hemingway, <title>The Sun Also Rises: The Library of America Corrected Text</title>, ed. Robert W. Trogdon (New York: Library of America, 2022).</note>
    <note n="18">The title is an allusion to Psalms 137: “By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion.” Images and wording from this psalm, which concerns captivity and freedom, appear throughout Faulkner’s novel.</note>
    <note n="19"><title>The Wild Palms</title> (New York: New American Library, 1948); <title>The Old Man</title> (New York: New American Library, 1948). For these and later editions, the word “<quote>The</quote>” was added to the title of “Old Man.”</note>
    <note n="20"><title>The Wild Palms and The Old Man</title> (New York: New American Library, 1954).</note>
    <note n="21">Faulkner had little leverage with his publisher in 1939. Random House was the fifth imprint to publish his work and was carrying him as a <foreign xml:lang="fr">succès d’estime</foreign>. His first book with Random House, <title>Absalom, Absalom!</title>, had not sold well; <title>If I Forget Thee, Jerusalem</title>, with another biblical title, was not likely to do better—hence, presumably, the change in title. In 1939 Faulkner was best known as the author of <title>Sanctuary</title> (1931), a scandalous novel about a young woman who is raped with a corn cob. It is not surprising that the publisher bowdlerized <title>The Wild Palms</title>. The sanitizing, however, was incomplete: the words “pricks” and “cunts” appear on p. 52 of the first edition, and “Shit!” appears on p. 101. Later, after he had won the Nobel Prize in 1949, Faulkner wielded more authority at Random House, and the heavy editing of his texts ceased.</note>
    <note n="22">Both the manuscript and the setting-copy typescript of the novel have been published in facsimile in <title>William Faulkner Manuscripts</title>, vol. 14, parts 1 and 2, ed. Thomas L. McHaney (New York &amp; London: Garland Publishing, 1986).</note>
