Benedict<lb/>\nOne of the greatest contributions to Latin American literary culture in the twentieth century came in the form of Victoria Ocampo’s literary<lb/>\njournal Sur (1931– 92).1 With an unparalleled life span —when compared with<lb/>\nsimilar literary magazines of the time — and an astounding list of international<lb/>\nauthors who lined its pages, Sur is an exemplar of literary excellence. Count<lb/>\nless scholars and critics have discussed the pivotal role of Sur in introducing<lb/>\ninternational writers to Latin American readers and simultaneously putting<lb/>\nLatin American writers on the map for international readers.2 Above all, there<lb/>\nhas been a marked interest in examining Sur’s impressive networks (Willson;<lb/>\nLarkosh; Majstorovic [2013]), its lasting impact on Latin American letters<lb/>\n(King [1981;1986]), and its political stance (Majstorovic [2005]). However, to<lb/>\ndate there has been no consideration of the marketing tactics employed by<lb/>\nOcampo to help sell the books that she produced with her publishing firm of<lb/>\nthe same name, Editorial Sur (1933 – 85).3 While a close examination of all<lb/>\nof these marketing strategies is out of the scope of this paper, I focus on one<lb/>\nparticular method that points to Ocampo’s deep-seated understanding of the<lb/>\nbook industry as well as to her life’s work to popularize both national and in-<lb/>\nternational works of great renown.4<lb/>\nMore specifically, I examine the function<lb/>\nof pre-publication— or teaser—book chapters in the literary journal Sur. In<lb/>\nparticular, I analyze which Editorial Sur books were excerpted in the literary<lb/>\njournal Sur.<lb/>",
