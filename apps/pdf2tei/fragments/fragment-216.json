It forms the headpiece to a letter from Pope to Swift of 18 June 1714.<lb/>\nLord Orrery had left Dublin on 5 July 1737, according to Sherburn, bringing<lb/>\nwith him Pope’s letters to Swift. He wrote to Swift saying Pope had the letters on<lb/>\n23 July 1737.66 But this evidence of the plain engraving suggests that Pope had<lb/>\nalready started printing his letters to Swift before the engraving appeared in its<lb/>\nenhanced form in the <hi>Letters</hi> on 19 May 1737. In a case like this, the engraving<lb/>\naffords valuable bibliographical evidence. Examination on the Traherne collator<lb/>\ndoes not suggest there were two engravings, and such duplication would in any<lb/>\ncase be most unlikely. The whole affair of the publication of the Pope and Swift<lb/>\nletters clearly invites further investigation, as does the rest of Pope’s printing in<lb/>\nquarto and folio in the summer of 1737, but it is difficult to avoid the conclusion<lb/>\nthat Pope had printed some of his letters to Swift before July 1737; perhaps he<lb/>\nhad saved copies of them; perhaps he made them up.<lb/>\n65. David Foxon thinks it was intended with other prose pieces for the 1735 Works (<hi>Pope and the Early Eighteenth-Century Book Trade</hi>, 133), but that now seems unlikely.<lb/>\nThe First Epistle of the First Book of Horace would not have been ready in 1735.<lb/>\n66.
