This article seeks to answer that question and to illuminate an enigmatic episode in Gabalis’ reception history.<lb/>\nVillars’ novel was an instant success. It was soon banned in France, reprinted in Holland and Cologne, and supplied with spurious sequels.<lb/>\nTwo different English translations appeared in 1680, inspiring Alexander Pope in his <hi>Rape of the Lock</hi> (1712), and a third soon afterwards.<lb/>\nPope’s mock epic introduced English readers, as Villars had the French, to the picturesque realm of the elementals: sylphs, salamanders, undines or nymphs, and gnomes.<lb/>\nGabalis, a German count, claims deep knowledge of them and their habits, as well as of Kabbalah, alchemy, and occult mysteries.<lb/>\nHe urges the sceptical narrator to renounce human women and to marry a sylph, adding that the greatest ones of the past were all the result of such inter-species intercourse.<lb/>\n  </p>\n  <p>The 1913 translation is accurate, if ponderous, and omits Villars’ more salacious passages.<lb/>\nThe Brothers are named as publisher and copyright holder, and leave us to draw our own conclusions from their oval emblem (figure 1), which appears insistently: twice on the dust jacket, twice embossed on the cover, and four more times inside the book.<lb/>\n  </p>\n  <div type=\"notes\">\n    <head>Notes</head><lb/>\n    <p><lb/>1.
