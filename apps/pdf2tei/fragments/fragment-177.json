The longer timeline involved in<lb/>\nproducing translations of these foreign works also might have factored into the<lb/>\nmonths-long gap between teaser chapter publication in <hi>Sur</hi> and full-length book<lb/>\npublication with <hi>Editorial Sur</hi>.28<lb/>\n</p>\n<head>Promotional Trends</head>\n<p>Certain trends emerge with these pre-publication texts. In the pages that follow I<lb/>\nexplain why certain <hi>Editorial Sur</hi> works might have been promoted more heavily<lb/>\nthan others and, with the help of extant archival material, reveal additional financial<lb/>\npressures that might account for some of Ocampo’s marketing decisions. In<lb/>\ngeneral terms, the rationale for the use of teaser chapters in <hi>Sur</hi> falls into one of two<lb/>\ncategories: promotion of best sellers, or questions of copyright and authors’ permissions.<lb/>\nEven though these two categories overlap in a number of ways, it will be useful to<lb/>\nconceptualize the use of pre-publication chapters through these two lenses.<lb/>\n</p>\n<p>If a publisher is looking to capitalize on international literary trends, then<lb/>\nproducing translations, especially the first authorized translations, of works that<lb/>\nhave already become commercial successes in other countries is a sound decision.<lb/>\nOcampo’s editorial selections and keen eye for the best literary trends,<lb/>\ntherefore, made her a savvy businesswoman. In fact, <hi>Editorial Sur</hi> made many<lb/>\ninternational best sellers available to Spanish-language readers for the first time.<lb/>\nPerhaps more surprising is the fact that some of her firm’s translations are still<lb/>\nthe only Spanish-language translations available for certain foreign works. Here<lb/>\nI examine two examples of best-selling authors whose work <hi>Editorial Sur</hi> translated,<lb/>\npublished, and excerpted with teaser chapters in the literary journal <hi>Sur</hi>:<lb/>\n<hi>Aldous Huxley</hi> and <hi>Albert Camus</hi>.<lb/>\n</p>\n<p><hi>Editorial Sur</hi> published two of <hi>Aldous Huxley</hi>’s novels—<hi>Contrapunto</hi> and<lb/>\n<hi>Con los esclavos en la noria</hi>—as well as his short pamphlet <hi>¿Cómo lo resuelve usted? El<lb/>\nproblema de la paz constructiva</hi>. In fact, Huxley’s <hi>Contrapunto</hi> is the first work that<lb/>\nOcampo’s firm published, and one of the author’s most successful. A short three<lb/>\nyears later, in 1936, Ocampo acquired the translation and publication rights for<lb/>\nHuxley’s <hi>Eyeless in Gaza</hi>, which was already creating a stir: “That <hi>Eyeless in Gaza</hi><lb/>\nwas awaited with growing interest is attested by its first-year sales in England,<lb/>\nwhich at 26,700 copies […], were more than double those of <hi>Brave New World</hi>.<lb/>\nThe reviews of <hi>Eyeless in Gaza</hi> were the fullest and quite often the most analytical<lb/>\nof any novel Huxley wrote.”29<lb/>\n</p>\n<p>According to the book’s colophon, <hi>Con los esclavos en la noria</hi> was the first and only authorized Spanish translation of <hi>Eyeless in Gaza</hi>, which accentuates its unique importance.<lb/>\n</p>\n<p>Unlike <hi>Contrapunto</hi>, the publication of Huxley’s <hi>Con los esclavos en la noria</hi> with <hi>Editorial Sur</hi> was preceded—and highly anticipated—by two teaser chapters in Ocampo’s literary journal.
