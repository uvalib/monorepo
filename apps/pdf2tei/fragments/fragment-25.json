  "tei": "<p><pb n=\"25\"/>The majestic volume that appeared in 1967 was designed by John <lb/>\nDreyfus (with title-page lettering engraved by Reynolds Stone) and printed <lb/>\nat Cambridge University Press for publication by Cassell. The writing was <lb/>\nequal to the design, with substantial commentaries produced by (in ad-<lb/>\ndition to Carter and Muir) Nicolas Barker, H. A. Feisenberger, Howard <lb/>\nNixon, and S. H. Steinberg. Carter’s hand is evident throughout, though <lb/>\nhe was the sole author of only a few entries. (The entries are unsigned, <lb/>\nbut Muir indicated the authorship in a set of proofs, now at Cambridge <lb/>\nUniversity Library.) Carter wrote the commentaries on Maimonides, <lb/>\nShakespeare, Lewis Carroll, and Churchill and was the co-author (with <lb/>\nMuir) of four others. The Churchill item (his speech of 20 August 1940) <lb/>\nis the last of the 424 entries in the book. It is not surprising that Carter <lb/>\nwrote this entry, given his admiration for Churchill (as shown by his <lb/>\n1941 account of meeting him, mentioned above). In the entry, having cited the <lb/>\nGettysburg Address, he says, “Lincoln and Churchill were far more than <lb/>\na century apart in temperament, but they shared a genius for language.” <lb/>\nHe ends his commentary by noting that Churchill had “an eloquence that <lb/>\nmatched the hour.”<lb/>\n</p>\n<p>The volume can be seen as an elaborate presentation of one of Carter’s <lb/>\n“new paths”—not one taken up in <hi>New Paths</hi> but one that he and Randall <lb/>\nhad promoted at Scribner’s, as reflected in Carter’s 1938 catalogue on <lb/>\n<hi rend=\"italic\">Science and Thought in the Nineteenth Century</hi>. But new paths can evolve into <lb/>\nestablished paths, and <hi>Printing and the Mind of Man</hi> became a signpost for <lb/>\ncollectors, with “<hi rend=\"italic\">PMM</hi>” being cited in dealers’ descriptions, and it thus <lb/>\nturned into the kind of list that Carter always advised collectors not to <lb/>\nfollow. And, like any selection, its choices were subjective, reflecting in <lb/>\nthis case an English-language bias. How comprehensive it is as a record <lb/>\nof the writings that in printed form have affected Western civilization can <lb/>\nbe debated. But it remains a readable and well-informed guide to some of <lb/>\nthe monuments (many of them undebatable) of intellectual history.<lb/>\n</p>\n<p>Aside from <hi>Printing and the Mind of Man</hi>, Carter’s principal publica-<lb/>\ntions of the 1960s came at the beginning and end of the decade. First, <lb/>\nin 1961, was a useful edition (with a graceful and informative preface) of <lb/>\n<hi>Housman’s Selected Prose</hi>, which made more widely available some pas-<lb/>\nsages from Housman’s celebrated prefaces to his Latin editions, as well <lb/>\nas some of his other writings on textual criticism. (One may object to the <lb/>\nway the prefaces were cut and also to two of Carter’s editorial practices: <lb/>\nafter reporting Housman’s concern for accuracy, he says that “minor vari-<lb/>\nations of typographical details [unspecified] have been accommodated <lb/>\nto the style in current use at Cambridge”; and he also inserts six com-<lb/>\nmas without noting precisely where these “temerities” occur.) Then in <lb/>\n1968-70 a series of four “Working Papers” for a revised edition of the <lb/>\n<hi>Enquiry</hi> were published as pamphlets in limited editions to be distributed<lb/>\n</p>",
