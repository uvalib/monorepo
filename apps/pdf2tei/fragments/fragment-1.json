THOMAS TANSELLE</hi></name></byline>\n<p><hi rend=\"dropcap\">J</hi>ohn carter was one of the most prominent and significant figures in the Anglo-American book world in the twentieth century.<lb/>Indeed, he held a unique position, for he distinguished himself as a bookseller, a collector, a scholar, and a writer, equally at home and equally recognized on both sides of the Atlantic.<lb/>He created innovative rare-book catalogues for the Scribner Book Store; formed several notable collections, especially of Catullus and Housman; was a pioneer investigator of the bibliographical problems of nineteenth-century publishers’ bindings; performed (with Graham Pollard) a classic piece of bibliographical detection in uncovering the Wise-Forman forgeries;<lb/>produced a scholarly edition of Sir Thomas Browne’s <hi rend=\"italic\">Urne Buriall</hi> and the <hi rend=\"italic\">Garden of Cyrus</hi>; and wrote (or co-wrote or co-edited) several celebrated works—<hi rend=\"italic\">An Enquiry into the Nature of Certain Nineteenth Century Pamphlets</hi> (1934), <hi rend=\"italic\">Taste and Technique in Book-Collecting</hi> (1948), <hi rend=\"italic\">ABC for Book-Collectors</hi> (1952), and <hi rend=\"italic\">Printing and the Mind of Man</hi> (1967).</p>\n<p>A record of his published writings is obviously a basic guide to his accomplishment.<lb/>But such a record is also desirable for another reason that would not apply to many people: nearly every piece he wrote, no matter how small (including brief reviews and letters to editors), is worth reading for its style and wit.<lb/>I am therefore presenting here a handlist (following in Carter’s tradition of handlist-writing) that will enable readers to find these pieces.<lb/>Carter published so prolifically (some 1500 items are known) in such a wide array of venues that there are bound to be many items I have missed, especially among his letters to editors.<lb/>But what is here is a comprehensive nucleus to which additions can be made.<lb/>As Carter said in his handlist of Stanley Morison, it is “intended to serve as a series of signposts now and as a basis for amplification, correction and addition in the future.”</p>\n<p>As an introduction to the handlist, I shall attempt a brief assessment of Carter’s achievement, which is a by-product of the overview provided by the handlist.<lb/>It is inevitably biographical to some extent; but the emphasis is on Carter’s writings, not his life, because a book-length biography already exists: Donald C.
