THOMAS TANSELLE<lb/>\nJohn carter was one of the most prominent and significant<lb/>\nfigures in the Anglo-American book world in the twentieth<lb/>\ncentury. Indeed, he held a unique position, for he distinguished<lb/>\nhimself as a bookseller, a collector, a scholar, and a writer, equally<lb/>\nat home and equally recognized on both sides of the Atlantic.<lb/>\nHe created innovative rare-book catalogues for the Scribner Book Store;<lb/>\nformed several notable collections, especially of Catullus and Housman;<lb/>\nwas a pioneer investigator of the bibliographical problems of nineteenth-century publishers’ bindings; performed (with Graham Pollard) a classic<lb/>\npiece of bibliographical detection in uncovering the Wise-Forman forgeries; produced a scholarly edition of <hi>Sir Thomas Browne’s Urne Buriall and the Garden of Cyrus</hi>; and wrote (or co-wrote or co-edited) several celebrated<lb/>\nworks—<hi>An Enquiry into the Nature of Certain Nineteenth Century Pamphlets</hi> (1934), <hi>Taste and Technique in Book-Collecting</hi> (1948), <hi>ABC for Book-Collectors</hi> (1952), and <hi>Printing and the Mind of Man</hi> (1967).<lb/>\nA record of his published writings is obviously a basic guide to his accomplishment. But such a record is also desirable for another reason that<lb/>\nwould not apply to many people: nearly every piece he wrote, no matter<lb/>\nhow small (including brief reviews and letters to editors), is worth reading<lb/>\nfor its style and wit. I am therefore presenting here a handlist (following in<lb/>\nCarter’s tradition of handlist-writing) that will enable readers to find these<lb/>\npieces. Carter published so prolifically (some 1500 items are known) in such<lb/>\na wide array of venues that there are bound to be many items I have missed,<lb/>\nespecially among his letters to editors. But what is here is a comprehensive<lb/>\nnucleus to which additions can be made. As Carter said in his handlist of<lb/>\nStanley Morison, it is “intended to serve as a series of signposts now and as<lb/>\na basis for amplification, correction and addition in the future.”<lb/>\nAs an introduction to the handlist, I shall attempt a brief assessment of<lb/>\nCarter’s achievement, which is a by-product of the overview provided by<lb/>\nthe handlist. It is inevitably biographical to some extent; but the emphasis is on Carter’s writings, not his life, because a book-length biography<lb/>\nalready exists: Donald C. Dickinson’s John Carter: The Taste and Technique of<lb/>",
