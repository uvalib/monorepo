  "tei": "<pb n=\"201\"/>\nKnow then thy-self, presume not God to scan;<lb/>\nThe proper Study of mankind is Man.<lb/>\n34<lb/>\nBuried in the surrounding debris in the title-page engraving are contrary maxims,<lb/>\nlargely taken from scholasticism, though not without reference to contemporary<lb/>\ndebates. The reasons for rejection of the tag furthest left, and most important, <hi>a priori</hi>, are made clear by Warburton’s note on those who take the ‘high Priori<lb/>\nroad’ in the Dunciad: ‘those who, instead of reasoning from a visible World to an in-<lb/>\nvisible God, took the other road; and from an invisible God (to whom they had given<lb/>\nattributes agreeable to certain metaphysical principles formed out of their own<lb/>\nimaginations) reasoned downwards to a visible world in theory, of Man’s Creation’.35<lb/>\nThe next phrase is <hi>substantiae immateriales</hi> (immaterial substances), an impor-<lb/>\ntant idea in the first part of Aquinas’s <hi>Summa Theologiae</hi>, the centre of a series of<lb/>\nquestions about men and angels.36 Next comes <hi>locus [est] ubi</hi>, which I suspect,<lb/>\non the basis of the sketchy skulls that lie beneath, is short for <hi>Hic locus est ubi<lb/>\nmors gaudet succerre vitae</hi> (this is the place where death delights in aiding the<lb/>\nliving), the inscription over the University of Padua’s anatomical theatre. Then<lb/>\ncomes <hi>universale a parte rei</hi> (the universal part of the thing), a much despised<lb/>\nposition in the debate about universals, and said by Bayle to be ‘a mere subtlety<lb/>\nof Metaphysics, and . . . generally exploded now by the best Philosophers as a<lb/>\ndispute about words only’; it is also mocked in the <hi>Memoirs of Martinus Scriblerus</hi>.<lb/>\nFinally come <hi>ens rationis</hi> (an abstract logical entity) and <hi>Essentia intelligibil[es]</hi><lb/>\n(intelligible essences), both instances of the abstract knowledge rejected here by<lb/>\nPope and by Bolingbroke in his philosophy.38 The engraving is well proportioned<lb/>\nin relation to its pages, but neither inventor nor engraver is identified, and, in<lb/>\ncomparison with its companions by Kent, it lacks boldness and clarity; the mot-<lb/>\ntos seem to testify to a lack of confidence in the visual symbols’ ability to speak<lb/>\nto the reader. I suspect Pope was the inventor and that he may have had help<lb/>\nfrom Bolingbroke.<lb/>\nAt the end of the ‘Design’, explaining his conception of the poem, Pope<lb/>\nplaced the vignette that had been adapted from the end of the Odyssey to illustrate<lb/>\nSatire II.i with the motto <hi>UNI ÆQVVS VIRTVTI ATQ. EIVS AMICI</hi>. That<lb/>\nsymbol of friendship complemented and highlighted the meaning of the head-<lb/>\npiece that then appeared on the first page of the poem. The early editions of the<lb/>\nepistle, with the title <hi>An Essay on Man. Address’d to a Friend</hi>, had begun <hi>Awake!<lb/>\nmy Lælius</hi>, the name Laelius being used to declare the importance of friendship.<lb/>\n</p>\n<div type=\"footnotes\">\n<note n=\"34\">An Essay on Man, ed.
