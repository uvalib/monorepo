Conjectures about the political signifi-<lb/>cance of the manuscript began to circulate in print and then proliferated on <lb/>the web where the original announcements are still accessible. The discovery <lb/>was sufficiently newsworthy that Prime Minister Theresa May and President <lb/>Donald Trump took time to look at it while Trump was making his UK state <lb/>visit in 2019. Unfortunately, they and their advisors were misinformed. Basic <lb/>assumptions about the date and origins of the manuscript are in error and have <lb/>prompted unfounded claims about its historical importance. I hope to correct <lb/>those errors here and set the record straight by reviewing the bibliographical <lb/>arguments that made that manuscript a media sensation.<lb/>My main concern is with an article by Danielle Allen and Emily Sneff in <lb/>the <hi>Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America</hi> (PBSA). It serves as the definitive <lb/>announcement of the discovery and a means of explaining the authors’ research <lb/>methods. They describe and date the manuscript (see figure 1) in the article and <lb/>suggest a route by which it came to its present location in the West Sussex Record <lb/>Office (WSRO), Chichester, England. In brief this is how they present their find-<lb/>ings: sometime between 1783 and 1790 a clerk made a copy of the <hi>Declaration <lb/>of Independence</hi>, the manuscript that had been engrossed on parchment for the <lb/>Continental Congress in 1776. The clerk had trouble reading the original, com-<lb/>mitted errors of transcription, and even smudged the title, but was ambitious <lb/>enough to write it out on a large sheet of parchment. Measuring 24 by 30½ inches,<lb/>it was intended for display and was probably commissioned by the Pennsylva-<lb/>nia lawyer James Wilson (1742-1798), one of the Founding Fathers who had <lb/>signed the engrossed Declaration. Wilson played a prominent part in drafting <lb/>the Constitution, which he also signed, and relied on this copy to argue for a <lb/>strong national government founded on the will of the people rather than a loose <lb/>confederation of semi-independent states. His concept of nationhood is evident <lb/>in the way the clerk transcribed the fifty-six signatures in the engrossed Decla-<lb/>ration, not grouped by states as in the original but intermingled in a seemingly<lb/>",
