The pressure of conceiving female characters that<lb/>\ndid not seem to be the schematic creations of a female author meant to Charlotte<lb/>\nthat she would need to excise passages which might have betrayed personal de-<lb/>\ntails about the author.”52 The result, according to Marin, is “a more fragmented<lb/>\nnarrative.”53 She identifies these excisions as the “symptoms of a writing disorder<lb/>\nor disease,” which she calls the <hi>‘Jane Eyre’ complex</hi>:<lb/>\n</p>\n<q>The Jane Eyre complex describes the author’s contradictory desire to reveal and<lb/>\nconceal personal, even intimate or offensive, occurrences in her own life. . . . She under-<lb/>\nstood that the interpretation of her first readers (Smith and Williams) was decisive for<lb/>\nthe publication of her work and thus used the process of revision to withdraw or, more<lb/>\naccurately, to censor what seemed to her excessive, exaggerated, or too explicit references<lb/>\nto her personal life, even willing to jeopardize the novel’s narrative coherence by<lb/>\ndoing so.54</q><lb/>\n<p>It is unusual to claim that any author who was deliberately preparing a novel<lb/>\nfor publication would feel the need to censor her own fair copy after writing it<lb/>\nout, and Marin does not provide any parallel instances for the purposes of com-<lb/>\nparison. Instead, she pursues an interpretation that centers on the anxiety of the<lb/>\nwoman author, and turns to fiction for her answers. Material and mind mimic<lb/>\none another: the novel’s apparent fragmentation lacks coherence and serves as<lb/>\na mirror of Brontë’s own psychological “disorder.” The partial-leaf excisions are<lb/>\nevidence of a form of self-censorship and psychological withdrawal. Life, in this<lb/>\ninstance, imitates art; the process of revising the manuscript reenacts conflicts<lb/>\napparent in the narratives of Brontë’s own novels.</p>\n<p>This interpretation is problematic for a number of reasons. First, the claim<lb/>\npursues a reading of the manuscript that subjects Brontë herself to the kind of<lb/>\n“suspicious” and gendering gaze that, according to Marin, Brontë sought to<lb/>\navoid. In doing so, Marin’s analysis reinscribes the flawed, essentialist notion of<lb/>\nthe woman writer as a neurotic (the infamous “madwoman in the attic” analogy<lb/>\nthat feminists both invoked and, in some cases, later fought to dispel55) without</p>\n<div type=\"footnotes\">\n<p>52.

In <hi>The Madwoman in the Attic</hi>, Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar seek to identify the “anxieties out of which this tradition [of women writing] must have grown.” Yet their model itself is diagnostic, comparing woman authorship to the “splitting or distribution of her identity”—a kind of “‘schizophrenia of authorship.’” Charlotte Brontë is singled out as providing “a paradigm of many distinctively female anxieties and abilities.” See Sandra M. Gilbert and Susan Gubar, <hi>The Madwoman in the Attic: The Woman Writer and the Nineteenth-Century Literary Imagination</hi> (New Haven; London: Yale University Press, 1984), xi, xii, 69. More recently, feminists such as Nina Baym and Marta Caminero-Santangelo have drawn attention to the problematic nature of the “madwoman metaphor” and the kind of dichotomous thinking that “identifies women with irrationality in the first place.” See Caminero-Santangelo’s book <hi>The Madwoman Can’t Speak: Or Why Insanity Is Not Subversive</hi> (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1998), 1–2.<lb/>\n</p>\n</div>",
