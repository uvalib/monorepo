This explains the interruption to her red-ink numbering, as well as<lb/>\nits disuse afterward.<lb/>\n</p>\n<p>The substance of the expansion has to do with Eva, “La Première Femme<lb/>\nSavante”—the subject of a school essay, we are told, that was written by Shirley<lb/>\nin her youth and that was subsequently memorized by her teacher, Louis Moore<lb/>\n(Robert Moore’s brother). Louis, as portrayed within the action of novel, recites<lb/>\nthe essay aloud, in its entirety, from memory.<note n=\"128\">The narrator “translates” Louis Moore’s recitation of the essay “on pain of being unintelligible to some readers.” See f. D664.E91.</note><lb/>\nEva is Shirley’s vision of an early<lb/>\nwoman, living at the dawn of time—an alternative, we intuit, to Milton’s Eve, as<lb/>\nmentioned in volume 2. Indeed, the name “Eva” appropriately carries a feminine<lb/>\nending, as if to demarcate the difference—reminding us that Shirley, not Milton,<lb/>\nis the author of this particular narrative.<lb/>\n</p>\n<p>This dialectic is emphasized by the two sections, which cross-inform one<lb/>\nanother. Because the meditation on Eva comes later in the novel, it serves both<lb/>\nas a corrective to the Eve of Paradise Lost and as a more complete re-imagining<lb/>\nof Eve as she might have been. Yet, in the chronology of Shirley’s own life,<lb/>\nShirley writes her essay on Eva before she delivers her diatribe against Milton<lb/>\nto Caroline Helstone. As a result, when we read the novel’s last volume, we<lb/>\nrecall Shirley’s prior criticism, and we realize that Shirley, as a schoolgirl, had<lb/>\nalready supplied a vision of her own to challenge the Miltonic Eve that she later<lb/>\ndisputes as a grown woman. Indeed, it is Shirley who seems most befitting of<lb/>\nthe title “femme savante”— a heroine also worthy of carrying the title of this<lb/>\nparticular novel.<lb/>\n</p>\n<p>Because these two episodes appear within different volumes—and across<lb/>\nthe gap of time when Brontë “laid aside” her work—an intervention was likely<lb/>\nnecessary in order to tighten the parallel between the sections. As with the prior<lb/>\nexamples of “Shirley and Caroline” and also “Further Communications on<lb/>\nBusiness,” the insertion in volume 2 lays the groundwork for a later passage in<lb/>\nvolume 3.<note n=\"129\">At the time the insertion was made to volume 2, the passage it corresponded with would have the short essay in French, probably titled “La Première Femme Savante” and most likely focusing on Eve/Eva, in accord with the subject of the later expansion.</note> Here it is certain, however, that the revision to volume 2 preceded<lb/>\nthat to volume 3, as we know that the addition of the long “Eva” text was intro-<lb/>\nduced extremely late in the process.<lb/>\n</p>\n<head>6. Analysis of Missing and Recycled Leaves</head>\n<p>With each of the prior three examples, changes in foliation and page number-<lb/>\ning correlate to the use of different paper stocks, and so help to establish the<lb/>\nscope and approximate order in which Brontë modified her manuscript. How<lb/>\nthen do we approach the question of the first chapter, “Levitical,” which is not<lb/>\nonly written on London Superfine wove stock but, notably, is also the only part<lb/>\nof volume 1 not written on Cream Laid paper? This is surely significant when<lb/>\nwe recall that London Superfine wove paper stock appears in volume 2 only in<lb/>\n</p>",
