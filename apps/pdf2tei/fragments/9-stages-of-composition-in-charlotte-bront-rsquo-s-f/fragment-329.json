  "tei": "<pb n=\"322\"/>\n<p>By turning our attention to the materials and mechanics of writing processes <lb/>\nas well as the role of women’s labor, we can gain clearer insight into the historical <lb/>\npractices and domestic duties that marked women’s writing. Although material <lb/>\nsurfaces are silent, laid or wove, embossed or watermarked, excised or intact, <lb/>\nthey can speak to activities otherwise undocumented in the historical record. By <lb/>\nlearning how to discern the changes introduced by Brontë amid those made by <lb/>\nthe hands of many others—printers, publishers, collectors, bookbinders, cura-<lb/>\ntors, and conservators—we find the story of a rising woman author who priori-<lb/>\ntized the care of her family over the expectations of her publishers and readers. <lb/>\nHaving lived through a global pandemic, many of us are now more attuned to <lb/>\nthe caregiving duties required of those coping with grave illness. It is helpful, I <lb/>\nthink, to understand Brontë’s break from working on the manuscript as a decision <lb/>\nnecessitated by this more urgent charge.<lb/></p>\n<p>And yet we also see another choice at work at a later stage of composition: a <lb/>\nstrategic process of revision that drew together plot points across the book’s three <lb/>\nvolumes—deliberate changes that, when introduced, drew together the narra-<lb/>\ntive threads of Brontë’s novel. By studying the manuscript slowly, carefully, and <lb/>\nmethodically using the techniques afforded by bibliography, these two distinct <lb/>\nstages emerge from among the manuscript’s complex layers of composition to <lb/>\ntell a more nuanced story of how Charlotte Brontë’s work as a writer intersected <lb/>\nwith her duties as both a daughter and sister. Sometimes slowing down—as <lb/>\nBrontë herself was forced to—allows us to revisit our own critical assumptions <lb/>\nwith fresh eyes and a clearer sense of purpose. Where her work as a writer left <lb/>\nlegible traces, her labor as a caregiver created subtle absences barely detectable, <lb/>\nbut still discernable, in the leaves she left behind.<lb/></p>",
