We know that Brontë’s publishers had asked her to<lb/>\nrevise chapter one in February, as is documented in her correspondence.<note n=\"130\">Brontë’s correspondence, identified as likely being written on February 20, 1849,<lb/>reads as follows: “I sincerely thank you both for the candid expression of your objections—what<lb/>you say with reference to the first chapter shall be duly weighed—At present I feel reluctant to<lb/>withdraw it—because as I formerly said of the Lowood-part of ‘Jane Eyre’—<lb/>it is true— The curates and their ongoings are merely photographed from the life.” Letters, 2:181.</note> But,<lb/>\nto date, scholars have assumed that Brontë refused to edit the opening of her<lb/>\nnovel, based on her responses to W. S. Williams and James Taylor of Smith,<lb/>\nElder.<note n=\"131\">For example, Jacob Korg writes: “Although Smith and Elder asked her to cut the<lb/>first chapter, a satiric description of the curates at dinner, Charlotte Brontë refused, argu-<lb/>ing that the scene was authentic.” See “The Problem of Unity in <hi rend=\"italic\">Shirley</hi>,” <hi rend=\"italic\">Nineteenth-Century<lb/>Fiction</hi> 12, no. 2 (1957): 125–36 (126). doi:10.2307/3044150, accessed August 19, 2020. The<lb/>general view is reflected by Rosengarten and Smith, who do not document or consider any<lb/>of the bibliographical or codicological evidence presented here, and who write as follows:<lb/>“Charlotte would not withdraw the offending chapter, telling James Taylor that she could not<lb/>‘sacrifice truth to the fear of blame’; but she accepted his strictures on ‘the bad taste of the<lb/>opening apostrophe—that I had already condemned in my own mind.’” <hi rend=\"italic\">Shirley</hi>, xix. Further<lb/>on, Rosengarten and Smith write: “most of the alterations are slight” in volume 1. Their<lb/>footnotes and apparatus make no mention of the manuscript evidence that I discuss. In her<lb/>article, Marin maintains this position: “she did not comply with her publishers’ suggestion<lb/>to drop the first chapter because it might have offended religious readers and it might have<lb/>destroyed the aesthetic unity of the composition.” See Marin, “Charlotte Brontë’s Heron<lb/>Scissors,” 24.</note></p>\n<p>The leaves in chapter one do not reflect any apparent change to their inked<lb/>\nnumbering (see table 4) as we have seen in volume 2 in conjunction with changes<lb/>\nin paper stocks. But there is a marked gap where f. 22 should appear that sepa-<lb/>\nrates the wove leaves of chapter one, which concludes on f. 21, from the laid<lb/>\npaper used for chapter two, which begins on f. 23.<note n=\"132\">As I mentioned earlier, the BL conservators inserted a replacement leaf as part of the<lb/>1976 rebind—but the leaf is not clearly marked as such.</note> This omission carries with<lb/>\nit no apparent loss of text, as we learn when collating the manuscript with the<lb/>\nfirst edition—a fact that strongly suggests that Brontë removed f. 22 herself as<lb/>\npart of an editorial process.<note n=\"133\">My opinion here is different from that of Smith and Rosengarten, who note: “there<lb/>is no f. 22, but this seems to be an error: no matter is omitted at this point.” See <hi rend=\"italic\">Shirley</hi>, Clar-<lb/>endon edition, xxiv. While Smith and Rosengarten see this as a numbering error, it is worth<lb/>observing that Brontë was not prone to making mistakes of this kind. Indeed, there are no other<lb/>detectable numbering errors of this sort in the entire manuscript. Also, when drawing this con-<lb/>clusion, Smith and Rosengarten did not take into consideration the difference in paper stocks,<lb/>the differences in leaf numbering made in pencil, or the recycled title page leaf—evidence that<lb/>clearly suggests a revision was made.</note> Furthermore, f. 21 (the last leaf of chapter one) is<lb/>\nwritten on a recycled leaf whose verso bears the title <hi rend=\"italic\">Shirley</hi>—another clue that<lb/>\nthe chapter was revised and recopied only at a later stage, as Brontë did not<lb/>\nentirely decide on the title <hi rend=\"italic\">Shirley</hi> until August 24, 1849—long after she had<lb/>\nfirst sent the manuscript volume 1 to her publisher in February; before that, the<lb/>\nnovel had been tentatively referred to as <hi rend=\"italic\">Hollow’s Mill</hi>, a title that was ultimately<lb/></p>",
