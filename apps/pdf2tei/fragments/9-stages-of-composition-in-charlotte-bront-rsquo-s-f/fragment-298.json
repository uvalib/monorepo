Taylor Collection of Princeton University), was written within what appears to be a nested quire of ten folios.<lb/>Ten leaves of the original MS have writing composed on them (leaves two through eleven); and ten were left blank (leaf one, plus leaves twelve through twenty).<lb/>And the “Henry Hastings” MS (HEW 1.4.14 Harry Elkins Widener Collection) consists of two ten-leaf quires, a 16-leaf quire, and a four-leaf quire; these folia were made from half sheets of the larger letter papers she used.<lb/>The juvenilia were also copied out in quires, albeit smaller ones.<lb/>For a description of this process, see Barbara Heritage, “Charlotte Bronte’s ‘Chinese Fac-similes’: A Comparative Approach to Interpreting the Materials of Authorial Labour and Artistic Process,” in <hi rend=\"italic\">Charlotte Bronte, Embodiment and the Material World</hi>, ed. Justine Pizzo and Eleanor Houghton (Cham, Switzerland: Palgrave Macmillan, 2020), 210–212.</note> Keeping <lb/>\nthis information in mind, it seems significant that almost all of the longer revi-<lb/>\nsions or expansions to <hi rend=\"italic\">Shirley</hi> that required additional paper were copied out in <lb/>\neven numbers of leaves, suggesting the insertion of nested bifolia—the largest be-<lb/>\ning the revision to the first chapter, which was likely copied out onto a new quire <lb/>\nconsisting of 20 leaves, or ten folded half-sheets. Although the leaves are no lon-<lb/>\nger conjugate (i.e., joined over the folds) and the structure cannot be ascertained, <lb/>\nother manuscripts made by Brontë contain partial quires close in size.<note n=\"76\">See the previous note, describing the format of “Emma,” which contains a 20-leaf quire. Another unbound manuscript, “Henry Hastings,” contains a 16-leaf quire.</note><lb/>\nThe chapters as they were first copied out in the manuscript vary in length: one <lb/>\nchapter is as brief as 13 leaves, while another is as long as 39-and-a-half leaves.<lb/>\nAccording to Gaskell, Brontë educated herself about how to prepare a manu-<lb/>\nscript for publication by obtaining a manual on the subject.<note n=\"77\">Gaskell, <hi rend=\"italic\">The Life of Charlotte Brontë</hi>, 231, 526.</note><lb/>\nBrontë would have learned about matters ranging from the kinds of paper and <lb/>\nhandwriting typically preferred by publishers to strategies for gauging the length <lb/>\nand sale potential of a work. It is apparent that, in preparing her fair-copy manu-<lb/>\nscript for submission to a publisher, Brontë followed the general practices of the <lb/>\nday. According to Saunders and Otley’s <hi rend=\"italic\">Advice to Authors</hi>, a resource that Brontë <lb/>\nlikely consulted,<note n=\"78\">See Heritage, “Authors and Bookmakers,” 470–71. Gaskell notes the publisher in her MS: “a small volume, published by Saunders &amp; Otley.”</note> it was “much better . . . to write on separate sheets of paper, <lb/>\ntaking care to number the sheets, or folios” than to write in “pretty copy-books,” <lb/>\nas was “the fashion much cherished by ladies.” Copybooks, the manual notes, <lb/>\n“must be torn to pieces before they are put upon the compositors’ cases.”<note n=\"79\"><hi rend=\"italic\">Advice to Authors</hi> (London: Saunders and Otley, n.d.), 6–7.</note><lb/>\nOne of the writing papers that Brontë used while copying out <hi rend=\"italic\">Shirley</hi> bears <lb/>\nan embossed stationer’s mark reading “London Superfine,” a substrate that was <lb/>\nnoted for being a high-grade paper made entirely from linen rags.<note n=\"80\">From the <hi rend=\"italic\">London Encyclopedia</hi>: “Rags are sold to the paper-makers sorted into four or five different kinds: No. 1, sometimes called London superfine, being all linen, and reserved for the finest paper,” 551. https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_London_Encyclopaedia/J3JMAAAAMAAJ, accessed September 7, 2020.</note><lb/>\nLondon Superfine was not inexpensive. Typically sold in reams of 480 “sheets” (i.e., half-<lb/>\nsheets), superfine writing papers like those Brontë used could have cost anywhere <lb/>\nfrom six to eighteen shillings per ream—a sizable sum for a woman with limited <lb/>\nmeans. In 1841, Charlotte Brontë had earned a meager salary of just £20 a <lb/>\n</p>",
