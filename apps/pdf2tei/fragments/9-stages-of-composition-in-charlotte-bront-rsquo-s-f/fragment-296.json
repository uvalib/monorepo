Because a single gathering of 24 folded <lb/>sheets would not lie flat, stationers would often break the 24-sheet quires into <lb/>smaller units, for instance, into two separate groupings of 12 sheets apiece, or <lb/>24 leaves each. Thus, a complete 24-sheet quire could contain two sub-quires.<lb/>The dimensions of the unused bifolia of London Superfine in the Brontës’ <lb/>writing desks measure 38 cm wide by 23 cm tall when fully open, or approxi-<lb/>mately 15 by 9 inches, resulting in a ratio of 1.65—a measurement that does not <lb/>conform to the standard sizes of full sheets of writing paper sold at the time, whose <lb/>ratios range from 1.23 to 1.29.<note n=\"70\">A publication published in conjunction with the Great Exhibition provides a table<lb/>with the measurements of writing papers, as opposed to printing papers; see p. 945 in vol. 3 of<lb/><hi rend=\"italic\">Reports of the Juries on the Subjects in the Thirty Classes into Which the Exhibition Was Divided</hi><lb/>(London: Spicer Brothers and W Clowes and Sons, 1852). See https://www.google.com/books/edition/<lb/>Reports_by_the_Juries_on_the_Subjects_in/YJdDAAAAcAAJ, accessed August 16, 2021.<lb/></note> These measurements indicate that these bifolia <lb/>were indeed originally created from half-sheets, which, when folded, would have <lb/>constituted quartos when compared to the original full-formed sheet—a fact <lb/>confirmed by examining the Cream Laid paper that Brontë used in the manu-<lb/>script of <hi rend=\"italic\">Shirley</hi>. Its wirelines run vertically (quarto-wise) instead of horizontally, <lb/>as with a true folio, and the chain lines run from the gutters to fore-edges of the <lb/>leaves.<lb/>Volume 3 of the manuscript contains one such 24-leaf quire of 12 folded, <lb/>nested bifolia, where the exact position of the quire’s watermarks indicate that <lb/>the leaves are conjugate. Measurements of each of these partially visible water-<lb/>marks suggest that the entire watermark (i.e., as it would appear on a half-sheet) <lb/>would have measured about 16.2 cm.<note n=\"71\">This measurement is easiest to detect what would have been the centermost bifolium<lb/>(BM ff. 12 –13) of the quire.<lb/></note> A study of the measurements in this <lb/>particular gathering contains notable outliers in the cut of the sheets that clearly <lb/>show the conjugacy of BM f. 3 and f. 22, of BM f. 7 and f. 18, of BM f. 8 and f. 17, <lb/>of BM f.10 and f. 15, and of BM f.11 and f. 14 (see table 1).<lb/>Other partial-quire combinations were possible. Printers working from man-<lb/>uscript copy referred to these smaller units of nested bifolia as ternions, quater-<lb/>nions, quinternions, &amp;c.<note n=\"72\">See entries for “Ternion,” “Quadternion,” and “Quinternion” in Charles Thomas<lb/>Jacobi’s <hi rend=\"italic\">The Printer’s Vocabulary</hi> (London: The Chiswick Press, 1888). https://www.google.com/<lb/>books/edition/The_Printers_Vocabulary/6oYaAAAAMAAJ, accessed August 15, 2021.<lb/></note> Although these units could have resulted from further <lb/>division and use by writers themselves, Emily Brontë’s writing desk contains an <lb/>intact, unused septernion, or partial quire of seven bifolia, as well as an unused <lb/>partial quire of 10 nested bifolia—suggesting that larger gatherings were also <lb/>commonly made up and used.<note n=\"73\">See previous footnote.<lb/></note><lb/></p>",
