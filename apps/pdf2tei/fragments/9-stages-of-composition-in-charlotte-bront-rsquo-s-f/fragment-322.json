For nothing but a strong sense of their reality could have seduced the authoress into such a mistake as admitting them at all.” Lewes, Currer Bell’s ‘Shirley,’ 84.</note><lb/>\nOver time, the figures have become “infamous”<lb/>\nin Brontë criticism, and they continue to be discussed in great detail (viz., Dolin;<lb/>\nPerkin; Thormählen).<note n=\"145\">Tim Dolin, Mistress of the House: Women of Property in the Victorian Novel (Aldershot: Ashgate, 1997); Perkin, Theology and the Victorian Novel; and Marianne Thormählen, The Brontës and Religion (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999).</note><lb/>\nAn influential essay written in the mid-twentieth century<lb/>\nby Jacob Korg branded the chapter as an “irrelevant” element marring the novel’s<lb/>\nunity.<note n=\"146\">Jacob Korg, “The Problem of Unity in Shirley,” Nineteenth-Century Fiction 12, no. 2 (1957): 125–36 (126). doi:10.2307/3044150, accessed August 19, 2020.</note><lb/>\nIn keeping with this Lewesian strain of criticism, Tim Dolin has inter-<lb/>\npreted Shirley’s “arbitrariness” as “reinforc[ing] the sense that it resists a logic of<lb/>\nhistorical influence or even causality.”<note n=\"147\">Tim Dolin, “Fictional Territory and a Woman’s Place: Regional and Sexual Difference in Shirley,” ELH 62, no. 1 (1995): 197–215 (205). http://www.jstor.org/stable/30030266, accessed October 31, 2020.</note><lb/>\nHe argues that the novel “is plagued with<lb/>\nanagnoreses [sic], confessions pleading new beginnings, and reversals of fortune,”<lb/>\nand notes that “Shirley is one of the first English novels to display as structural<lb/>\ndisturbance the disquieting implications of the modern crowd . . . [a] structural<lb/>\ndisturbance that was, and still is, perceived to be its formal imperfection.”<note n=\"148\">Ibid.</note><lb/>\nYet<lb/>\nrecent critics have welcomed these same qualities as a signal innovation in Brontë’s<lb/>\nwriting. Justine Pizzo argues that the comic nature of Shirley’s opening chapter<lb/>\nestablishes the novel’s “episodic structure and seemingly discrete, disunified vi-<lb/>\ngnettes that mark its difference from the rest of Brontë’s oeuvre.”<note n=\"149\">Justine Pizzo, “Gendering the Comic Body: Physical Humour in Shirley,” in Charlotte Brontë, Embodiment and the Material World, ed. Justine Pizzo and Eleanor Houghton (Cham, Switzerland: Palgrave Macmillan, 2020), 50.</note><lb/>\nIf Shirley seems to be episodic in its design, close bibliographical analysis<lb/>\nindicates that this was a calculated effect. Brontë carefully considered the risk<lb/>\nof retaining her first chapter, as she clearly seems to have modified an earlier,<lb/>\nslightly longer version of the chapter (i.e., longer by one leaf) in order to allay at<lb/>\nleast some of her publishers’ concerns, while retaining the characters of Donne,<lb/>\nMalone, and Sweeting for her main purpose. The free-wheeling exploits and<lb/>\nhaughty attitudes of these young, unmarried men starkly contrast with the con-<lb/>\ndition in which the novel’s two unmarried heroines find themselves—a marked<lb/>\ndisparity between the kind of privilege that certain men had (and often abused)<lb/>\nand the limitations imposed on women, who were highly restricted in what they<lb/>\ncould say and do. Although it remains unclear exactly what changes were made<lb/>\nto the first chapter, the ultimate fates and fortunes of these curates—who appear<lb/>\nelsewhere throughout the novel—are disclosed within the novel’s last chapter,<lb/>\n</p>",
