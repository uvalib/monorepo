The<lb/>manuscript seems to reflect the kind of relative diminishment of the impressions of<lb/>the embossed stationers’ crest within each subquire, as observed in the septernion<lb/>found in Emily Brontë’s desk.<note n=\"74\">See note&amp;nbsp;65 above.</note> Tellingly, the first chapter of volume&amp;nbsp;1 of<lb/>Shirley is written on 21 leaves, and the stationers’ crest is clearly visible on the first leaf, and<lb/>only faintly visible of leaves two through four—and not visible at all until an odd<lb/>leaf is introduced (BM&amp;nbsp;f.&amp;nbsp;21) that was recycled from prior use as a title-page. Had<lb/>Brontë separated out the bifolia and/or cut them into single leaves before using<lb/>them, this relative diminishment of the blind-stamped stationers’ crests from leaf<lb/>to leaf would not occur in any sort of regular order; it would be random.<lb/>The drafts of Brontë’s other extant manuscripts that were unfinished and left<lb/>unbound, as well as earlier works, such as the manuscript commonly referred to<lb/></p>",

      "There are minor spacing, line-break, and hyphenation differences (for example, words like 'copy outher novel' instead of 'copy out her novel' and 'butrather' instead of 'but rather') that appear to be formatting artifacts rather than substantive content changes.",
      "Header/footer elements (e.g. page numbers and repeated identifiers) differ slightly, but these are consistent with acceptable extraction formatting differences."
