Smith, who noted in <hi rend=\"italic\">The Brontë Sisters: A Bibliographical Catalogue</hi> (Los&amp;nbsp;Angeles: Heritage Book Shop, 1991) the presence of additional text on p.&amp;nbsp;206 of “some copies” of the first American edition in wrappers, published by Harper &amp; Brothers (HB) in 1849, that was not present in any of the other editions he had seen: “You may meet these two again, reader, one day, or you may not; none but the presumptuous promise for the future: we know not what a day or an hour may bring forth” (Smith, 125).<lb/>Smith did not trace this variant to the MS; but when I did, I found numerous other instances that clearly show that the English proofs initially used to compose the first American edition did not reflect Brontë’s final text for the first London edition, but rather an earlier set of proofs that retained language from the MS and that were later altered or removed as part of subsequent proof-stage revisions.<lb/>For example, on p.&amp;nbsp;203 in the second column of the first HB edition, the text reads: “a rose-tree, transplanted from the Hollow, which bloomed”—language appearing in the MS (BM&amp;nbsp;f.&amp;nbsp;311); the Smith, Elder (SE) edition reads: “a rose-tree, which bloomed” (p.&amp;nbsp;306).<lb/>Page&amp;nbsp;206 of the HB edition reads “stone or brick and ashes,” as with the MS (BM&amp;nbsp;f.&amp;nbsp;322), while the SE edition reads “stone and brick and ashes” (p.&amp;nbsp;316).<lb/>Some instances include early text entirely removed from Smith Elder’s edition of the novel.<lb/>For example, the following text appears on BM&amp;nbsp;f.&amp;nbsp;306 of the MS and in column two on p.&amp;nbsp;202 of the HB edition, but not in the SE edition: “I don’t know whether I have duly disposed of all minor characters; I fear not; but if any friend wishes to know more, a note addressed to Mr.&amp;nbsp;Currer Bell, Hay-lane Cottage, Hay, near Millcote, may be expected to meet with prompt attention. I confess this promise seems given in rather equivocal terms—no matter: the experiment, if approved, might be tried.”<lb/>A full list of variants from the first state of the N gathering of the HB edition will appear in a forthcoming critical edition of <hi rend=\"italic\">Shirley</hi> that I am co-editing with Tim Dolin for Cambridge University Press.<lb/>These variants provide valuable additional insight into the texts of the proofs, which are no longer extant.<lb/>I also located variants at the end of the first printing of the HB edition of <hi rend=\"italic\">Villette</hi> that correlate with the surviving proofs for <hi rend=\"italic\">Villette</hi> located in Sterling Library, University of London.</note>",
