Emily refused professional medical assistance as well as other treatments, such as homeopathy; see Letters, 2:142, 145, 146–147, 150, 152. Charlotte sought medical advice and kept a careful eye on her sister, despite Emily’s dogged reluctance to be helped. Charlotte finally convinced Emily to try homeopathic medicine in early December, and she drew up a detailed account of Emily’s malady; but then Emily refused to take the medicine when it was received, and she died shortly afterward. See Letters, 2:154. In late December, Charlotte was caring for her father and Anne, who became ill with influenza; Letters, 2:159, 165. In January, Charlotte was nursing Anne, which included administering and dressing blisters and giving her cod-liver oil (Letters, 2:166) and also ordering a respirator to help with her breathing (Letters, 2:171). Charlotte herself suffered from “pains” in her chest and back, which she treated with “pitch plasters and bran tea”; see Letters, 2:169.</note> In January, she writes to Williams: “My literary<lb/>\ncharacter is effaced for the time . . . care of Papa and Anne is necessarily my chief<lb/>\npresent object in life to the exclusion of all that could give me interest with my<lb/>\nPublishers or their connexions.”<note n=\"103\">Letters, 2:168.</note> Her choice of the word “effaced” is suggestive<lb/>\nhere: in her correspondence with her publishers during this period, she sought<lb/>\nto separate “Charlotte Brontë” from “Currer Bell,” indicating a pivot from the<lb/>\nlatter (masculine) identity: “Should Anne get better, I think I could rally and<lb/>\nbecome Currer Bell once more.”<note n=\"104\">Letters, 2:168.</note> In February 1849, when Anne showed some<lb/>\nsigns of recovery, Brontë wrote to her publisher about her attempted endeavor to<lb/>\nresume her work on the novel, even as she continued to look after Anne, who had<lb/>\nby that time had been diagnosed with tuberculosis. Even at this point, Charlotte<lb/>\nseems only to have been able to return to the novel sporadically. In February, she<lb/>\nwrites: “I wish it were more than a commencement, for how it will be re-united<lb/>\nafter the long break, or how it can gather force of flow when the current has been<lb/>\nchecked— or rather drawn off so long—I know not.”<note n=\"105\">Letters, 2:181.</note> It was at this point that<lb/>\nshe was likely completing work on the end of volume 2 in a series of interrupted,<lb/>\nbrief intervals, as evidenced by the varying stocks of paper, as described earlier.<lb/>\nAlthough Gaskell writes that Brontë did not begin work on volume 3 until<lb/>\nafter Anne’s death, it seems clear that Brontë did draft and copy out the volume’s<lb/>\nfirst three chapters intermittently during the first half of 1849. Brontë’s mixed use<lb/>\nof paper continues within the first 56 leaves of volume 3—starting with “The<lb/>\nValley of the Shadow of Death”—which were copied out irregularly on Cream<lb/>\nLaid paper, as well as on watermarked laid paper (yet again on leaves without<lb/>\nany apparent alterations to their numbering). The abrupt changes in paper stocks<lb/>\nmay reflect another important fluctuation in Brontë’s life at that time: the er-<lb/>\nratic intervals during which Anne’s health temporarily improved before further<lb/>\ndeclining.<note n=\"106\">See Letters, 2:181, 189, 191, 196.</note> Brontë likely wrote on whatever high-grade writing paper was at<lb/>\nhand as she copied out her work in various spurts. She seems to have regained<lb/>\nher momentum only toward the end of copying out these very difficult chapters,<lb/>\nwhose heroine, narrowly recovering from the brink of death, was loosely mod-</p>",
