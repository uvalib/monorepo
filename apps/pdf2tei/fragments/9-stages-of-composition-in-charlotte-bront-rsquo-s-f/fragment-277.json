The dates are from correspondence <lb/>collected in Margaret Smith’s invaluable edition, <hi rend=\"italic\">The Letters of Charlotte Brontë</hi> (Oxford: <lb/>Clarendon Press, 2000). For more on Taylor’s invitation to Haworth, see <hi rend=\"italic\">Letters</hi>, 2:247. The <lb/>research presented in this essay was made possible by a 2019 research award from the Wil-<lb/>lison Foundation Charitable Trust as well as a 2015 award from the Friends of Princeton <lb/>University Library. I am grateful to Karen Chase, Jerome McGann, and Michael F. Suarez, <lb/>S.J. for supporting those projects. A number of other colleagues greatly aided this work: Ann <lb/>Dinsdale and Sarah Laycock at the Brontë Parsonage Museum provided not only access to <lb/>rare and fragile materials, some of which were on display, but also expert guidance on their <lb/>respective collections. Alexandra Ault, Karen Limper-Herz, Alexander Lock, and Laura <lb/>Walker provided key assistance at the British Library. I am also grateful to Tim Dolin and <lb/>David Vander Meulen, who both provided feedback toward the final stage of publishing this <lb/>article. I am most indebted, however, to Terry Belanger, for reading this essay in its own vari-<lb/>ous stages of composition during what turned out to be an unprecedented global pandemic. <lb/>His bibliographical expertise, learned observations, and helpful suggestions improved this <lb/>work at every turn. Finally, my own bibliographical research would not have been possible <lb/>without his support and the early training that I received at Rare Book School. This work <lb/>is dedicated to him.</note> His firm, Smith, Elder and Co., had been awaiting the completion <lb/>of the book for nearly a year. Readers both in England and abroad were eager <lb/>to read the next work by Currer Bell, whose first published novel, <hi rend=\"italic\">Jane Eyre</hi>, had <lb/>attracted so much notice. Before that, the previously unknown writer had co-<lb/>written and published only an obscure collection of poetry with Acton and Ellis <lb/>Bell that few had read. The public continued to speculate about the identity of <lb/>this new author, who had written with such power and originality.</p>\n<p>Composed in three physically distinct volumes for publication as a three-<lb/>volume novel, the fair-copy manuscript of <hi rend=\"italic\">Shirley</hi> consists of high-grade writing <lb/>paper—a mixture of wove and laid folded half-sheets—copied out in a clear, <lb/>legible hand with a steel-tipped dip pen. Although the first two volumes of the <lb/>manuscript are each made up of about 140 bifolia or approximately 280 leaves, <lb/>the third volume is noticeably longer, composed of about 160 bifolia or 320 <lb/>leaves. Examining these, one finds that the novel’s text has been carefully written </p>",
