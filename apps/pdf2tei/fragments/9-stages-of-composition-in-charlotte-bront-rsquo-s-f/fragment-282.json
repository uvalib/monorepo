Supplies such as writing <lb/>instruments, inks, and paper stocks, along with processes such as ruling, copying, <lb/>excising and inserting, paginating, and binding, can usefully (and sometimes criti-<lb/>cally) inform our understanding of how writing is composed, revised, or otherwise <lb/>altered. Additional information, including how individuals other than authors <lb/>(e.g., printers, publishers, later owners, bookbinders, curators, and conservators) <lb/>have altered manuscripts, is essential for understanding exactly whose “hands”—<lb/>and whose handiwork—we see when we ourselves handle and study these artifacts.<lb/>\nIt may surprise some readers that the Brontës’ literary manuscripts have not <lb/>yet received this kind of close codicological and bibliographical attention, given <lb/>the sisters’ international fame and cultural stature. Scholars have tended to rely <lb/>on biographical explanations for interpreting the Brontës’ manuscripts. Some of <lb/>these assessments have focused on the patriarchal systems and cultural condi-<lb/>tions that challenged and limited the work of nineteenth-century women writers. <lb/>Other accounts have traced the Brontës’ writing practices to imaginative and <lb/>even unconscious, trance-like states.<note n=\"17\">Barbara Heritage, “Reading the Writing Desk: Charlotte Brontë’s Instruments and Authorial Craft,” in “Romantic Women and their Books,” ed.&amp;nbsp;Michelle Levy and Andrew Stauffer, special issue, Studies in Romanticism 60, no.&amp;nbsp;4 (Winter&amp;nbsp;2021): 509–10.</note> Few have attempted a more holistic and <lb/>methodical examination of the documents’ material construction.<lb/>\nIn the case of Shirley, Charlotte Brontë made numerous partial-leaf excisions <lb/>to her fair-copy manuscript in the late spring and summer of&amp;nbsp;1849 as part of late-<lb/>stage revisions to its text before handing over the manuscript to her publisher in <lb/>September of that year. These visible extractions have intrigued and puzzled the <lb/>handful of scholars and editors who have worked closely with the novel’s three <lb/>manuscript volumes. Most of these writers have discussed the excisions in connec-<lb/>",
