  "tei": "<p><pb n=\"287\"/>\n    the manuscript of Shirley has been bound and rebound, its paper stocks can offer<lb/>\n    substantial information about its production and Brontë’s own writing practice.<lb/>\n    <lb/>\n    Charlotte Brontë used four different varieties of high-grade stationery to<lb/>\n    copy out her manuscript. As described in more detail below, the writing paper<lb/>\n    she used was sold in quires or partial quires of nested bifolia. Each bifolium<lb/>\n    consisted of two leaves or four pages. Although the leaves in the manuscript<lb/>\n    are not uniform in height, at 18.3 cm wide they are now all uniform in width,<lb/>\n    suggesting that the manuscript was trimmed for the purposes of binding. These<lb/>\n    bifolia would have measured 38 cm wide or thereabouts when opened, but the<lb/>\n    size would have slightly varied among manufacturers. The four paper stocks<lb/>\n    included in the manuscript are:<lb/>\n    (1) London Superfine, a high-quality wove paper measuring 23.2 cm tall, with a<lb/>\n    blind-embossed stationer’s crest often appearing, when visible, in the upper<lb/>\n    left-hand corners of the rectos of both leaves of the bifolium (though often<lb/>\n    much fainter, if present, on the second leaf) and containing the (embossed)<lb/>\n    lettering “LONDON | SUPERFINE” inside a circle; the crest features an<lb/>\n    embossed crown in its center;<lb/>\n    (2) Cream Laid, another high-quality paper of approximately the same height<lb/>\n    as London Superfine, and exhibiting chain lines and wirelines that appear<lb/>\n    to be real, as opposed to being made with a dandy roll; here, when visible,<lb/>\n    the embossed stationer’s crest features the words “CREAM | LAID” within<lb/>\n    an oblong octagon, positioned as described above;<lb/>\n    (3) Royal Superfine, a smooth-surface (possibly glazed) laid paper that is notice-<lb/>\n    ably shorter, measuring 22.65 cm; when visible, the stationer’s crest contains<lb/>\n    the words “ROYAL | SUPERFINE”, again inside a circle, featuring an<lb/>\n    embossed crown in its center, positioned as described above; and<lb/>\n    (4) A laid paper, likely made by the Whatman firm, with a crown, shield, and<lb/>\n    posthorn with a pendant cursive “W” watermark; its watermark is posi-<lb/>\n    tioned as when appearing in a quarto format (i.e., across the fold and run-<lb/>\n    ning parallel to the top and bottom edges of the bifolium);<note n=\"59\">Stationery was cut down from larger sheets; see below for more details on the original full sheet size.</note> a very small,<lb/>\n    round watermark crest frequently appears in the position where stationers’<lb/>\n    crests usually are embossed (i.e., the upper left-hand corner of the recto of<lb/>\n    the closed bifolium—or the crown side of the sheet), though not<lb/>\n    on second<lb/>\n    leaf of the bifolium (i.e., the “W” side); this paper measures 22.6 cm in<lb/>\n    height.<lb/>\n    The average dimension of a leaf from the manuscript in its present state is about<lb/>\n    18 cm wide by 23 cm tall—or about 7 by 9 inches. Using a dip pen, Brontë<lb/>\n    copied out her novels onto the rectos of these leaves when creating her fair copy<lb/>\n    manuscripts.<lb/>\n    Prior to making her fair copies, Brontë’s drafting process was quite different.<lb/>\n    She tended to use both sides of the leaf while initially composing her<lb/>\n    writing—<lb/>\n    sometimes drafting her manuscripts on smaller (and likely less expensive) pa-<lb/>\n    pers and writing in pencil, as we can see in the portions of the manuscript for<lb/>\n</p>",
