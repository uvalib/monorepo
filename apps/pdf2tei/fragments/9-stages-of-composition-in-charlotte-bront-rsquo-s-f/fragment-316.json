(The original passage in French would likely have run about<lb/>\ntwo pages, and would have been introduced by dialogue.) The newly inserted<lb/>\nleaves, which are numbered in pencil and brown ink, initiate the final “D” se-<lb/>\nquence of the manuscript’s numbering, which was discontinued at A664.B664.<lb/>\nC670.E103. Between the expansion and the discontinuation of the sequence,<lb/>\nthree leaves of the existing manuscript were renumbered (A661.B661.C667.<lb/>\nD673.E100 –A663.B663.C669.D664 [665].E102)— probably simply to clarify<lb/>\nthe positioning of the new leaves within the chapter’s original sequence. Fur-<lb/>\nthermore, Brontë was unable to re-number the succeeding leaves following the<lb/>\nchapter, as she had previously done when introducing the red-ink sequence<lb/></p>",
