Then, invoking her identity as the male author Currer<lb/>\nBell, she writes “Currer Bell, without pretending to be David, feels no awe of the<lb/>\nunwieldly Anakim,” but reassured them that he (Currer Bell) would reasonably<lb/>\naccommodate their concerns: “comprehend me rightly, gentlemen—it would<lb/>\ngrieve him to involve others in blame—any censure that would really injure and<lb/>\nannoy his publishers would wound himself—therefore believe that he will not act<lb/>\nrashly—trust his discretion.”<note n=\"140\">Letters, 2:186.</note> Acknowledging his criticism of the opening apos-<lb/>\ntrophe, she (resuming the voice of “C. Brontë”) wanted to move on: “Enough<lb/>\nsaid of a work in embryo—Permit me to request in conclusion that the M.S.<lb/>\nmay now be returned as soon as convenient.”<note n=\"141\">Ibid.</note> Weighing these communications<lb/>\nalong with the codicological evidence, I believe that Brontë (in this case, operat-<lb/>\ning as Bell) indeed reworked the first chapter in a way that would suit the need<lb/>\nto retain Donne and Malone (who appear elsewhere in the novel) while also ad-<lb/>\ndressing some of the other concerns that Williams and Taylor had raised. Indeed,<lb/>\nthere is a letter written by Brontë to her publishers on September&amp;nbsp;19, 1849 that<lb/>\nbegins “I have made the alteration—but I have made it to please Cornhill—not<lb/>\nthe Public nor the critics.”<note n=\"142\">Letters, 2:256–57.</note> Margaret Smith speculated that the “alteration”<lb/>\npertained to the second paragraph in the first chapter; but the evidence offered<lb/>\nby the manuscript suggests that the revision was much larger than that.<lb/>\nThis revision could also have entailed changes with respect to the novel’s<lb/>\nintroduction and characterization of Michael Hartley, given Brontë’s late-stage<lb/>\nalterations to volume&amp;nbsp;2 of the manuscript and also given Hartley’s role in the<lb/>\nnovel’s denouement in volume&amp;nbsp;3. Indeed, a sizable portion—ff.&amp;nbsp;16 t0&amp;nbsp;20 — of<lb/>\nchapter one pertains to Hartley. Were the material recopied and revised from the<lb/>\ninitial, earlier draft, this extended passage would constitute the single prior allu-<lb/>\nsion to Hartley mentioned at the end of volume&amp;nbsp;3. This hypothesis is supported<lb/>\nby the fact that the first chapter is shorter rather than longer in its revision. It<lb/>\nis also possible though that Brontë withdrew other, more controversial material<lb/>\nfrom chapter one and filled it out with this extended passage about Hartley; in<lb/>\nthat case, the inserted material about Hartley in volume&amp;nbsp;2 would constitute an ex-<lb/>\npansion of what would have been a brief mention about him in that volume. Both<lb/>\nscenarios are possible. In either case, a larger pattern and purpose is clear: Brontë<lb/>\nmade a strategic attempt to unify the novel’s action across its three volumes.<lb/>\nThis new evidence helps to inform our reading of Shirley as a whole. The novel’s<lb/>\nopening chapter has been widely discussed and debated among critics since the<lb/>\nnovel’s initial release in 1849. Titled “Levitical,” the chapter was clearly intended<lb/>\nas a critique on both the privileges exacted by junior assistants to senior clergymen,<lb/>\n</p>",
