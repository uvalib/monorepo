As late as May 8, 1849, Brontë writes: “I can make no promise<lb/>\nas to when another [book] will be ready—neither my time nor my efforts are<lb/>\nmy own. That absorption in my employment to which I gave myself up without<lb/>\nfear of doing wrong when I wrote ‘Jane Eyre’ would now be alike impossible and<lb/>\nblamable; but I do what I can—and have made some little progress: we must<lb/>\nall be patient.”<note n=\"107\">Letters, 2:206.</note> Brontë made her moral obligations very clear to her publisher:<lb/>\nAnne’s well-being came first, then writing. She would not endanger her sister’s<lb/>\nlife for the sake of completing Shirley.<lb/>\nAfter a prolonged and painful illness, Anne finally died on May&amp;nbsp;28 in Scar-<lb/>\nborough, where she and Charlotte had both hoped that she would eventually<lb/>\nrecover. And so Charlotte Brontë parted with the last of her six siblings, who all<lb/>\nperished from the same dreaded disease, the “galloping consumption”—named<lb/>\nso for the swiftness of its spread and the speed with which it killed its victims.<lb/>\nBrontë wrote to W.&amp;nbsp;S. Williams of Smith, Elder: “had a prophet warned me how<lb/>\nI should stand in June 1849—how stripped and bereaved—had he foretold the<lb/>\nautumn—the winter, the spring of sickness and suffering to be gone through—I<lb/>\nshould have thought—this can never be endured. It is over. Branwell—Em-<lb/>\nily—Anne are gone like dreams—gone as Maria and Elizabeth went twenty<lb/>\nyears ago.”<note n=\"108\">Letters, 2:220.</note> Brontë sought work—and the labor of writing, in particular—as<lb/>\na remedy for the intense pain resulting from their loss. On June&amp;nbsp;25, she wrote to<lb/>\nWilliams: “Labour must be the cure, not sympathy—Labour is the only radical<lb/>\ncure for rooted Sorrow— The society of a calm, serenely cheerful companion . . . <lb/>\nsoothes pain like a soft opiate—but I find it does not probe or heal the wound—<lb/>\nsharper more severe means are necessary to make a remedy. Total change might<lb/>\ndo much—where that cannot be obtained—work is the best substitute.”<note n=\"109\">Letters, 2:224.</note><lb/>\nThe deliberateness of Brontë’s approach contradicts those who have characterized<lb/>\nher work at this time as “confused,” uncertain, and clouded by grief.<note n=\"110\">Rosengarten and Smith characterize this period as one of “uncertainty” (Clarendon edition, xxvi), while Deborah Lutz describes it as “confused” (<hi rend=\"italic\">The Brontë Cabinet</hi>, 184). I discuss some of the reasons and trends unpinning these interpretations in “Reading the Writing Desk,” 518–19.</note><lb/>\nAs described earlier, such assessments have inadvertently depicted Brontë as a hapless<lb/>\nwoman—her broken spirit reflected in the fractured leaves of her manuscript. It<lb/>\ncan be shown, however, that she approached her work during this period with a<lb/>\nparticularly strategic focus.<lb/>\nBy July, Brontë had gathered her powers, resuming her work in a steady<lb/>\nstream of London Superfine stock, which runs throughout the rest of volume 3.<lb/>\nIndeed, codicological evidence seems to confirm that, after completing this vol-<lb/>\nume, Brontë then used this same London Superfine paper stock as needed to go<lb/>\nback and carefully revise each volume as she steadily worked to polish her novel<lb/>\nfor publication. And so while the manuscript is indeed marked by death—that<lb/>\n“painful, even raw, reality” described by Rosengarten and Smith—her priori-<lb/>\nties were clear. The interruptions to the manuscript’s completion resulted from<lb/>\nher active efforts to save the lives of her sisters. The corresponding gaps in the<lb/>\n</p>",
