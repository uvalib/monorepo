The reading also conflates Brontë’s identity with her work—a fallacy that <lb/>is traceable to earlier feminist studies, such as Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar’s <lb/>landmark study The Madwoman in the Attic, which employ metaphors of illness <lb/>(in the case of Gilbert and Gubar, “female schizophrenia” and “dis-ease”) in an <lb/>effort to identify the very real, adverse effects of patriarchal structures on nine<lb/>teenth-century women writers.<note n=\"56\">Gilbert and Gubar, Madwoman in the Attic, 69, 71.

In her analysis, Marin mentions 906 folios (see p. 27)—numbers that <lb/>do not reflect either the Clarendon analysis (which she cites just once in her article) or the <lb/>896-leaf count of the British Museum and BL. Her count likely includes some combination of <lb/>endpapers or fly-leaves inserted by bookbinders. In addition, Marin mentions 28 excisions (p. <lb/>27), but her footnote (p. 29) lists just 25 leaves bearing excisions—and this list includes five <lb/>leaves that are entirely intact, per my own direct examination of the manuscript and also the <lb/>study of the Clarendon editors: BM ff. 149 and 150, vol.1; BM ff. 9, 45, and 252, vol. 2. It is <lb/>unclear how Marin identified these intact leaves as bearing excisions.<lb/></note><lb/>\nMarin argues that only two of the 28 exci-<lb/>sions that Brontë made entailed any substitution with another text—evidence <lb/>that leads her to conclude that Brontë was intent on merely eliminating passages <lb/>from the novel.<note n=\"58\">Marin, “Charlotte Brontë’s Heron Scissors,” 27.<lb/></note><lb/>Yet, of the 28 excisions that I have documented, 11 excisions <lb/>entail textual changes, including substantial revisions that required either the <lb/>recopying of leaves or the addition of new leaves that expanded the length of <lb/>the manuscript. And so, by my calculation, 39% of the excisions present in the <lb/>manuscript were made as part of a series of substantial, later-stage revisions or <lb/>expansions to the manuscript—some of which actually increased its size, rather <lb/>than reducing it. Brontë often excised the upper or lower portions of leaves <lb/>owing to changes made to the content in the sections of leaves falling between <lb/>them. These inserted leaves bear new writing that, at a casual glance, seem to be <lb/>part of one continuous draft. When taking additional leaf removals into account <lb/>along with partial-leaf excisions, there are a total of 41 instances of removals that <lb/>entailed expansions. In short, when Brontë removed either full leaves or portions <lb/>of them, it was often with the aim of introducing new or revised content.<lb/>\n<head>3.<lb/>Paper as Evidence</head><lb/>To investigate how a manuscript was composed and edited—and to identify <lb/>any excisions or revisions made to it—requires a very close look at its physical <lb/>structure.
