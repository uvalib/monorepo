The manuscript’s individual leaves are mounted<lb/>\n on paper guards that she never touched, and some of the leaves have been<lb/>\n repaired with paper made more than a century after her death. New leaves<lb/>\n have been bound into the volumes, too, to replace ones that seemed to be miss-<lb/>\n ing—and the manuscript has been foliated in a later hand. The manuscript<lb/>\n is the only witness that remains of Charlotte Brontë’s second novel. No other<lb/>\n drafts survive.<note n=\"12\">Some have speculated that the MS referred to as “John Henry” (RTC01, no. 194,<lb/>\n Princeton University) is an early draft of <hi rend=\"italic\">Shirley</hi>. Historical and textual evidence show, how-<lb/>\n ever, that the MS is almost certainly an early draft of <hi rend=\"italic\">The Professor</hi>. My research on this topic<lb/>\n is forthcoming in an essay that will appear in a new scholarly edition of <hi rend=\"italic\">The Professor</hi>, edited by<lb/>\n Sara L.

A search conducted on October 24, 2020, for all records in WorldCat that<lb/>\n include “manuscript” as part of the material description of holdings yielded 655,631 results<lb/>\n for entries dating from year 1 to 1700, and 13,160,994 results for entries dating from 1701<lb/>\n to 2020. Of the 210,122 manuscripts and archives held by the British Library, 55,062 date<lb/>\n before 1700, while 155,070 date from after 1700. The Morgan Library &amp; Museum owns<lb/>\n 2,262 medieval and Renaissance manuscripts, as compared to 62,452 “literary and histori-<lb/>\n cal” manuscripts.</note> Although many important studies have been conducted on<lb/>\n modern literary manuscripts,<note n=\"14\">Scholarship conducted on Emily Dickinson’s poetry manuscripts is well known, includ-<lb/>\n ing R. W. Franklin’s foundational edition, <hi rend=\"italic\">The Manuscript Books of Emily Dickinson</hi> (Cambridge,<lb/>\n MA: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1981) and Marta L. Werner’s <hi rend=\"italic\">Emily Dick-</hi><lb/>\n<hi rend=\"italic\">inson’s Open Folios: Scenes of Reading, Surfaces of Writing</hi> (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press,<lb/>\n 1995), as well as more recent studies, such as Cristanne Miller’s <hi rend=\"italic\">Emily Dickinson’s Poems as She</hi><lb/>\n Preserved Them (Cambridge, MA: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 2016). Other notable<lb/>\n and influential studies of manuscripts include: Charles Robinson’s study of Mary Shelley’s “Fran-<lb/>\n kenstein notebooks,” which includes highly detailed information, such as beta-radiographs of the<lb/>\n watermarks found in the notebooks; Fredson Bowers’ bibliographical scholarship on the manu-<lb/>\n scripts of Walt Whitman, including <hi rend=\"italic\">Whitman’s Manuscripts: Leaves of Grass</hi> (1860): A Parallel Text<lb/>\n (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, [1955]); William M.

This is, of course, just a small sample of the impor-<lb/>\n tant work that has been done on modern literary manuscripts. In addition, recent approaches,<lb/>\n such as efforts in the so-called genetic editing of manuscripts, have brought increased attention<lb/>\n to the study of modern literary manuscripts in Europe, particularly in France and Germany.</note><lb/>\n most English-language bibliographical scholarship<lb/>\n</p>",
