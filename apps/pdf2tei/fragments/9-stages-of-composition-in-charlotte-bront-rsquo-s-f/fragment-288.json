Parker, 1844).</note><lb/>\n</p>\n<p>\nIn contrast, four (or 57%) of the seven leaves bearing partial-leaf excisions in <lb/>\nBL-bound volume 3 have been repaired. These patches appear to be made with <lb/>\npaper matching the blank, unpaginated, full wove cream-colored leaf (BM f. 22, <lb/>\nvol. 1) inserted into volume 1 during the 1976 rebind, as well as the paper of the <lb/>\nnew guards used to mount the leaves in volumes 1 and 3 as part of the conserva-<lb/>\ntion and rebinding process. The paste used to make these repairs does not exhibit <lb/>\nthe damage evident to the earlier repairs made in volume 2. And, tellingly, the <lb/>\nBM stamp appears neither on these repairs nor in the center of unrepaired leaves <lb/>\n(as it does in the second volume), but rather on the remaining fragmentary por-<lb/>\ntions at the margins of the leaves (e.g., BM ff. 99 and 100, vol. 3). Why is this <lb/>\nso? Either the excised central portions of these leaves were still unrepaired and <lb/>\nmissing when the BM accessioned and stamped the binding nearly thirty years <lb/>\nearlier; or cruder repairs already made in the nineteenth century were replaced <lb/>\nby the BL as part of the 1976 conservation of manuscript volumes 1 and 3. Re-<lb/>\nsidual damage to the paper affecting the original leaf, but not to the wove repair <lb/>\nitself, suggests that the latter could have been the case. No repairs were made to <lb/>\nthe four excisions in volume 1, beyond the two leaves that Brontë mended herself <lb/>\n(BM ff. 126 and 144).<note n=\"41\">With respect to BM f. 126, vol. 1, Brontë added a footnote that was likely included to replace a stanza of poetry that was probably excised. With respect to BM f. 144, it appears as though she removed two lines from within the leaf following the poem and preceding the narrator’s wry comment about the poem not reflecting on the relationship between Caroline and Robert Moore. The fragments were joined by Brontë, but a gap remains unrepaired following “Robin-a-Ree.”</note><lb/>\n</p>\n<head>2  Brontë’s Alterations to the Manuscript<lb/></head>\n<p>\nHaving established the scope of the binders’ and conservators’ interventions, <lb/>\nwe can now turn to Charlotte Brontë’s own work with the volumes. This aspect <lb/>\nof the manuscript requires more interpretation and bibliographical analysis, as <lb/>\nmuch of the evidence pertaining to Brontë’s own alterations has been either <lb/>\ndestroyed or hidden.<lb/>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe current manuscript consists of 896 leaves, including both the leaf added <lb/>\nduring the BL rebind and the replacement leaf added during the nineteenth-cen-<lb/>\ntury binding of the manuscript. Volume 1 contains 284 leaves; volume 2 consists <lb/>\nof 289 leaves; and volume 3 includes 323 leaves. Volume 3 appears to have been <lb/>\noriginally planned on a scale similar with volumes 1 and 2, but, as we shall see, <lb/>\nit was expanded in the late stages of the novel’s composition. In all, Brontë’s fair <lb/>\ncopy would have consisted of 895 leaves.<lb/>\n</p>",
