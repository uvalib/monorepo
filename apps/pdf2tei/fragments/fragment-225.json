The second volume, ‘<hi>The Essay on Man, with ... errata in first edition</hi>’, must be ‘the volume now in the Berg collection [79-432] that contained among other Pope material a copy of the Essay on Man and the manuscript of the First Satire of the Second Book of Horace’, for this copy, annotated in a hand or hands other than Pope’s, has Chauncy ownership inscriptions, and was, as we shall see, with the other Richardson–Chauncy books when Elwin collated it.<lb/>\n478 The <hi>The Dunciad</hi>, first edition, large paper, frontispiece, filled with MS. Notes and corrections from the first Broglio MS. by Mr. Pope himself, uncut | 8vo. Dublin, 1728<lb/>\n₤13 to Thompson. This is the 1728 <hi>The Dunciad</hi>, actually annotated by Jonathan Richardson rather than by ‘Mr. Pope himself’, which is now in the Berg collection of the New York Public Library (Smith, ‘Alexander Pope’, entry PoA 32), and was reproduced in facsimile with commentary by David Vander Meulen in 1991. Vander Meulen notes that this copy and the other two <hi>Dunciad</hi>s listed here all have the manuscript date 1777 on their title pages, which ‘seems to indicate that in that year they were part of a single collection, probably that of Dr. Charles Chauncy ... or his brother and heir Nathaniel. . . . But then parts of the trail become obscure’.<lb/>\nWe can now be confident that all three <hi>Dunciad</hi>s were Richardson–Chauncy books; that the collection was still Charles’s until the end of 1777 (he died on 25 December but his will was not proved until 1778); and that they remained in the family until 1887, when they were sold as Lots 478, 479, and 480. Thompson bought six other lots in the 1887 sale; the six others all went to the library of William Nassau Lees, sold in 1889; this is therefore doubtless the annotated <hi>Dunciad</hi> which was Lot 75 in Nassau Lees’ sale, described by Smith (‘Alexander Pope’, 2) as unlocated. It is, by the way, an odd coincidence that just as Charles Chauncy bought the Richardson manuscripts of Pope in April 1776 and died twenty months later, in December 1777, so Nassau Lees bought them in July 1887 and died twenty months later, in March 1889.<lb/>\n479 The <hi>The Dunciad</hi>. Another copy, large paper, frontispiece, with MS. corrections, copied from Pope’s copy by Jonathan Richardson junr. uncut | 8vo. ib. 1728<lb/>\n₤7 7s. to Colonel (Francis) Grant. This is the 1728 <hi>The Dunciad</hi> now at the Huntington Library, 106517 (Smith, ‘Alexander Pope’, PoA 34), which was bought by B. F. Stevens at Grant’s sale, was in the library of Robert Hoe by 1905, and was bought by Huntington at the Hoe sale in 1912; Vander Meulen remarks of this and the<lb/>\n</p>\n<p>14. The volume was sold at Sotheby’s on 10 February 1971, to Charles Traylen, an English bookdealer acting ultimately for Yale University Library, but its export was, controversially, prevented: see Peter Hopkirk, ‘Dispute over plans to export Pope manuscript [sic]’, The Times, 15 January 1971, 3, and subsequent letters to The Times by Peter Eaton (2 February 1971, 15), Charles Traylen (10 February 1971, 13), and P. J. Korshin (24 March 1971, 15).<lb/>\n15. Vander Meulen, <hi>Pope’s Dunciad of 1728</hi>, 42; the manuscript is Smith, ‘Alexander Pope’, PoA 181.<lb/>\n16.
