Dibdin’s next letter signals a general redirection<lb/>\nby being addressed “To the Public” and emphatically stating “I shall address no<lb/>\nmore letters to T. S. Esq.” (42). Dibdin reports, a little accusingly, that Swift<lb/>\n“very lately told a particular friend of mine that my seven first letters—I use his own<lb/>\nwords—‘are wonderfully well written’” (42). He wants to insist, then, that Swift<lb/>\nhad received and approved the letters, even though he only answered one. On<lb/>\na more extenuating note, though, he also refers to “chance having thrown this<lb/>\ngentleman [Swift] and I such a distance from each other” (42–43)—a probable<lb/>\nreference to Swift having returned to Ireland. The biggest question Dibdin faced<lb/>\nat this juncture was whether he should replace Swift with some other correspon-<lb/>\ndent. The second letter subsequent to the Swift letters, dated from Hull on 4 No-<lb/>\nvember, was initially addressed “To Mr. Boyton” in the Winchester manuscript,<lb/>\nbut the “oyton” was then crossed out to leave “The Mr. B.” which appears in the<lb/>\npublished MT.<lb/>\n12 This was the exceptionally obscure William Boyton, a music<lb/>\nteacher, harpsichordist (one of the best in the country, according to Dibdin), and<lb/>\nminor composer.<lb/>\n13 Dibdin clearly had an excellent relationship with Boyton,<lb/>\nwho is mentioned eight times in the MT. The 4 November letter ends on a rather<lb/>\nambiguous note, and it is not clear whether Dibdin intended to make Boyton a<lb/>\nregular correspondent or not: “As to the musical taste of Bristol, the treatment<lb/>\nat inns, and other indispensible [sic] matters, I shall mention them when I return;<lb/>\nfor I will not give you pain by speaking truth of your neighbours” (49).<lb/>\nImmediately after this, the whole concept of the still largely unwritten book<lb/>\nwas rethought. The next letter, dated 6 November, is addressed to Dibdin:<lb/>\nWhen I had the pleasure of witnessing your performance, I said but the truth when I<lb/>\nassured you it would be no trifling satisfaction to me to promote whatever you should<lb/>\nconsider as your interest. As to your request of addressing your public letters to me, I<lb/>\nembrace with great satisfaction an opportunity of receiving an earlier entertainment from<lb/>\nthem than the rest of your friends. Nobody can be more zealous in your cause. There is,<lb/>\nI confess, one consideration that will make me read them with reluctance—every suc-<lb/>\nceeding letter will be one approach nearer to your departure, which you know I never<lb/>\ncordially liked—though I own you have conquered every scruple but one. Answer me.<lb/>\nWhat will the people of INDIA say of you, when they see in your book that you make<lb/>\na visit to them, your forlorn hope? You see I begin the office of a friend by treating you<lb/>\nwith freedom. My remarks, however, will not be very troublesome to you. Your career<lb/>\nis brilliant, and it were pity to stop it. Adieu. I have read thirteen letters, and be assured<lb/>\nI shall make a perusal of the rest supercede every other consideration of business or<lb/>\npleasure—being<lb/>\nYour sincere friend,<lb/>\nAnd obedient servant. (50)<lb/>\n12. Letter 13.<lb/>\n13. Roger Fiske estimates Boyton’s dates as c. 1750 to c. 1800 in <hi>English Theatre Music in the Eighteenth Century</hi> (London: <hi>Oxford University Press</hi>, 1973), 651. I suspect he was the “Mr.<lb/>\nBOYTON sen.” who was given a benefit concert in Bristol in 1816, however: see “Assembly-<lb/>\nRooms, Prince’s Street,” <hi>Bristol Mirror</hi>, 9 November 1816, 2. Boyton’s son Richard, also a<lb/>\nteacher of music in Bristol, was active by the 1810s and died in 1846.</p>",
