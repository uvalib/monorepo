Their movements for a century and more after Richardson’s<lb/>\ndeath have been summed up — not quite accurately — by Maynard Mack: they<lb/>\n‘made their way, without ever going on public sale, into the collection of Charles<lb/>\nChauncy, and finally, in 1887, to the marketplace’, the last point being minimally<lb/>\nelaborated on in an endnote which reads ‘See the Sotheby sale catalogue, July<lb/>\n1887’.3 Charles Chauncy was a near-contemporary of Richardson the younger’s,<lb/>\na rich English physician and antiquary; the name is also spelt Chauncey, as in the<lb/>\nOxford DNB and several of the sources quoted below.<lb/></p>\n<p>1. <hi>Richardsoniana, or, Occasional Reflections on the Moral Nature of Man</hi> (London: Printed for J.
