In England, Charles Dickens ex<lb/>\npertly used this method for the publication of many of his novels and is perhaps<lb/>\nits best-known practitioner. In America, according to Michael Lund, “the sheer<lb/>\nnumber of significant authors and works first appearing in part from 1850 to<lb/>\n1900 suggest that a central mode of the American literary tradition was the se<lb/>\nrial form, the continuing story.”7<lb/>\nThe serial publication format also was popu<lb/>\nlar in France (feuilleton) and Spain (folletín) during the nineteenth century,8<lb/>\nand examples cropped up in Russia as well with the works of Dostoyevsky and Tol<lb/>\nstoy. Instances of serial publications, such as Edith Wharton’s <hi>The House of Mirth</hi><lb/>\n(Scribner’s Magazine, 1905), James Joyce’s <hi>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</hi><lb/>\n(Egoist, 1914–15), and Ernest Hemingway’s <hi>A Farewell to Arms</hi> (Scribner’s Magazine,<lb/>\n1929) continued to appear in later decades, but in the early part of the twentieth<lb/>\n</p>\n<div type=\"footnotes\">\n<note n=\"5\">While serial publications were most prominent in the nineteenth century, they have much earlier origins: “Serial fiction was not a Victorian invention. As R. M. Wiles has shown, already by the second quarter of the eighteenth century ‘number books, independently issued in weekly or month parts, wrapped in blue paper covers, had become a common commodity in the publishing business’ (<hi>Serial</hi>, 75). By 1750 works thus published in fascicles already totaled several hundred and were occasionally issued in editions of as many as two or three thousand copies. Among them were both original and reprinted works, translated texts as well as those in the vernacular, and, among a wide variety of other genres, a number of examples of prose fiction, including Cervantes, Defoe, and imitations of Richardson such as <hi>Pamela in High Life</hi>.” Graham Law, <hi>Serializing Fiction in the Victorian Press</hi> (London: Palgrave, 2000), 3.</note>\n<note n=\"6\">Catherine Delafield, <hi>Serialization and the Novel in Mid-Victorian Magazines</hi> (New York: Routledge, 2015), 1.</note>\n<note n=\"7\">Michael Lund, <hi>America’s Continuing Story: An Introduction to Serial Fiction, 1850–1900</hi> (Detroit, MI: Wayne State University Press, 1993), 21–22.</note>\n<note n=\"8\">Alexandre Dumas’s <hi>The Count of Monte Cristo</hi> (1844–45) and Gustave Flaubert’s <hi>Madame Bovary</hi> (1856) originally appeared as serial publications in magazines in France.
