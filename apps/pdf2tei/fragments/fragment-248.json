One drawing, <hi>“Gallery 10 G[uineas],”</hi> is crossed through and marked <hi rend=\"bold\">“bought by Mr. Baker”</hi>—presumably the Strawberry Hill Press collector and bibliographer George Baker (1781–1858). It is correct that Bull’s copy, despite its wealth of Carter watercolors and drawings, does not have his view of the Gallery. <lb/>\n</p>\n<p>But as well as this additional material, there are many annotations to the text by Kirgate, for this is his interleaved proof copy of the 1784 text. It preserves a number of cancels that were corrected in the text as issued, and contains numerous notes by him as the orchestrator of extra-illustration, and even a few notes inserted or initiated by Walpole that throw shafts of light on Walpole’s last years at Strawberry Hill. It is very likely that this is the copy that was lot 413 on the eighth day of the sale of Kirgate’s library, where it was described as <hi>“containing many Notes in MS. by T. Kirgate,”</hi> and was bought by George Baker for £16. <lb/>\n</p>\n<p>At Baker’s sale in 1825, it appears among some seventy-six Strawberry Hill Press and related books and ephemera as <hi>“A Description of Strawberry Hill, with several loose pieces interleaved, with M.S. memoranda throughout.”</hi> It was bought by Longman for a far more modest £1.19s., a reflection of the depression in book prices that was to be lamented in <hi>Bibliophobia</hi> (1832). <lb/>\n</p>\n<p>To begin with Walpole’s notes, these are only on the text pages (pre-dating the book’s being bound up interleaved) and are limited but essentially corrections. <lb/>\n<note place=\"foot\">“Book of Visitors,” Percival Merritt Collection, Houghton Library, Harvard University, M.S.
