  "tei": "<pb n=\"250\"/>Walpole had built in about 1790 —he also added to the Directions to the Binder<lb/>\nthe titles of the two plates of offices, engraved after the sheet had been printed<lb/>\noff.25 Other entries illustrating life at the house include Kirgate’s note against<lb/>\nthe description of the building of the Gallery and Round Tower that “Cowie,<lb/>\nthe Gardiner, says he placed Medals and a Copper-plate, with an Inscription,<lb/>\non the Foundation Stone of the above Buildings, which is under the Scullery of<lb/>\nthe Round Kitchen.” Equally evocative is his recording that most of the small<lb/>\nEtruscan and black Staffordshire vases in the Little Library in the Cottage in the<lb/>\nGarden “were broke by an Owl getting down the Chimney into the Room.”<lb/>\nOf particular importance are two short lists, the first at the end of the<lb/>\n<hi>More Additions</hi> appendix on page 96, the other on one of the blank leaves at the back.<lb/>\nThey record late acquisitions for the collection, after the printing of<lb/>\n<hi>More Additions</hi> in 1791. Timothy Wilson has quoted Walpole’s letter to Sir Horace Mann<lb/>\nof 1785, in which he asks him to find some examples of a particular Florentine<lb/>\nceramics manufacture, and then adds “but am I not an old simpleton to be wanting<lb/>\nplaythings still?”26 These lists show the elderly Walpole, still adding to the<lb/>\ncollection to within three years of his death. The first list is:<lb/>\nBrown earthen Miraculous Pitcher—Earthen Bottle, labelled, Claret<lb/>\nA Miniature in enamel of [gap] Lord Bute, by Spencer; bought at Dalton’s Sale, 1791.<lb/>\nSix Portraits, with Pen and ink, of Mr. Walpole, Mr. Chute, Mr. Spence, &c.<lb/>\ndrawn by Rosalba, when those Gentlemen were in Italy, unknown to them, when at some public<lb/>\nPlace; yet very like<lb/>\nDead Christ, by Carrache, small oil painting on Copper, from Sir Laurence<lb/>\nDundas’s Sale, in 1794.<lb/>\nMiniature Portrait of Charles James Stuart, eldest son of the Pretender;<lb/>\nGiven by Mrs. Hunter, In 1794.<lb/>\nThe second has five more items:<lb/>\nA carved Ivory Cup, with a Bacchanalian Procession, in relievo, set in Silver,<lb/>\nwith the Orford Crest on the Cover; from Houghton.<lb/>\nTwo Cocoa Nuts, carved with the Arms of Orford, and mounted with Silver gilt feet;<lb/>\nfrom Ditto, 1793.<lb/>\nTwo silver filigraine Hampers; from Ditto, 1794.<lb/>\nA Portrait of the Rev.
