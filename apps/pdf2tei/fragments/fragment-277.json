They have described with poignance the deep grief that Brontë endured,<lb/>\nand they have speculated about the particular challenges that she likely faced in<lb/>\nresponse to her profound loss—accounts that have impressed subsequent gen-<lb/>\nerations of readers and writers. At the same time, the perceived impact of this<lb/>\nloss has overshadowed other details of importance pertaining to the manuscript:<lb/>\nwhy the excisions were made, when they were made, and how they relate to the<lb/>\noverall material structure of the manuscript in its many stages of composition.<lb/>\nThe present study offers a fresh interpretation of the manuscript and, by<lb/>\nextension, Charlotte Brontë’s own practices as a woman writer. Here I have at-<lb/>\ntempted to provide an intensive analysis of the manuscript’s physical features—<lb/>\nits paper, leaf and page numbering, inks, excisions, and insertions—by drawing<lb/>\non a variety of bibliographical and codicological methods that, taken together,<lb/>\nyield new insight into Brontë’s compositional practices. The evidence result-<lb/>\ning from this analysis calls into question standard critical accounts of how the<lb/>\nmanuscript was composed and edited. My findings include the discovery of late<lb/>\nadditions, significant expansions, and previously undetected revisions that are<lb/>\ndocumented within the very structure of the manuscript. Hidden within plain<lb/>\nsight, these changes bear silent but powerful witness to Brontë’s strategic ap-<lb/>\nproach to crafting her narrative. At the same time, when interpreted alongside<lb/>\nBrontë’s correspondence, these alterations to the manuscript tell a more nuanced<lb/>\nstory of the woman writer at work. Among the strata of the manuscript’s leaves,<lb/>\nwe can trace gaps in writing when Brontë was primarily serving as a caregiver for<lb/>\nher dying siblings. The manuscript was inadvertently shaped by these caregiving<lb/>\nduties, which required Brontë’s emotional and physical attention and which often<lb/>\ntook priority over the labor of writing itself. The manuscript thus makes mate-<lb/>\nrial the kinds of hard, practical challenges that women writers such as Charlotte<lb/>\nBrontë faced in caring for their families while pursuing careers as authors.<lb/>\nModern manuscripts, like all historical artifacts, are subject to alteration and<lb/>\nmodification over time—their handling by compositors and press readers, the<lb/>\nsequences of their leaves (whether unbound or as the result of a later binding<lb/>\nprocess), and even their contents, in the event that new leaves are introduced or<lb/>\nexisting leaves are repaired. In the case of <hi>Shirley</hi>, the manuscript has been sig-<lb/>\nnificantly altered through interventions made by those who have been in contact<lb/>\nwith it over more than a century and a half.<lb/>\nThe manuscript volumes thus present various strata of data— different forms<lb/>\nof handwriting, numbering, and leaf placement—that are the result of various<lb/>\nagencies at work, sometimes with different intentions that are not clearly de-<lb/>\nlineated as such. The surviving manuscript of <hi>Shirley</hi> is not just the product of<lb/>\none individual, but of many—not a solo aria, but rather like a chorus that is, at<lb/>\ntimes, discordant. Just as one must attune one’s ear to identify different voices<lb/>\nand instruments in the study of music, we must train our eyes to read various<lb/>\nhands and the work of their tools.<lb/>\nBrontë composed <hi>Shirley</hi> as a three-volume novel, and its narrative is contin-<lb/>\ngent on its intended format in three parts, its word count, its pacing—and, as we<lb/>\n</p>",
