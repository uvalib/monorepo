Davies.8<lb/>\nCharles Chauncy did not enjoy his purchase for long, for he died on Christ-<lb/>\nmas Day, 1777. His will (PROB 11/1038/53) bequeaths ‘all my Books Mss Book<lb/>\nCases Pictures’ and the like to his brother Nathaniel. When he first drafted the<lb/>\nwill, which is dated 10 March 1776, he added that he desired that his collections<lb/>\n‘may not be seperated or disposed of but kept entire and together’ to be inher-<lb/>\nited in due course by whichever of the three sons of his deceased sister Martha<lb/>\nSnell should be thought most deserving of them (Charles himself was childless,<lb/>\nand neither Nathaniel nor his other brother Philip had sons, so the three Snell<lb/>\nbrothers were his only male nephews).9 However, he subsequently struck this<lb/>\npassage out, and the will as proved on 8 January 1778 makes no restriction as to<lb/>\nthe future of the books or collections. Nathaniel Chauncy kept them together for<lb/>\nhis lifetime, but his collections of books and other objects were dispersed, ‘by his<lb/>\nexpress order’, in a series of sales by auction after his death in 1790.10<lb/>\nHowever, the Pope manuscripts were not among the books sold at this time.<lb/>\nA note in one of them records that it passed from Charles Chauncy to Na-<lb/>\nthaniel, and thence to one of the Snell nephews, another Charles, who married<lb/>\nNathaniel’s daughter Amelia, and changed his name in 1783 to Charles Snell<lb/>\nChauncy.11 Since the whole collection was still together in 1887, it must in fact all<lb/>\nhave passed to Charles Snell Chauncy. By his will (PROB 11/1500/155, fol. 254r),<lb/>\n</p>\n<div type=\"footnotes\">\n<note xml:id=\"fn7\" place=\"foot\">\n7. Pope’s letters to Richardson are now widely dispersed (see references at Smith, ‘<hi>Alexander Pope</hi>’, 13–14). The manuscript of a draft of the ‘Preface’ to the 1717 Works was, in the nineteenth century, preserved in an album of materials relating to Pope which also included one of his letters to Jonathan Richardson the elder (Smith, ‘<hi>Alexander Pope</hi>’, 16–17 and PoA 400), but only very loosely could this have been called Pope’s ‘Dedication to all his Works’. For the ‘transcript’, see ‘Transcript of what Mr. Pope dictated to Mr. Jonathan Richardson Senr. at Twickenham 5th August 1739’, Bodleian MS Eng. lett. d. 59, fos. 80–81, copied by William Gregson in December 1775 (perhaps from the manuscript sold in April 1776): Sherburn, ‘<hi rend=\"italic\">New Anecdotes about Alexander Pope</hi>’, 346–347, correct title supplied by Maynard Mack, <hi>Alexander Pope: A Life</hi> (New York: W. W. Norton, 1985), 823 n 13.<lb/>\n</note>\n<note xml:id=\"fn8\" place=\"foot\">\n8. The British Library copy (from the set pressmarked S. C.
