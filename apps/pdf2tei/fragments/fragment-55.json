Carter-Sparrow-White (A:1952) 23.<lb/>\nIncludes an appendix (pp. 47–54), “Shelley, Swinburne and Housman,” condensed from an article by Carter and John Sparrow in the <hi>Times Literary Supplement</hi> (E2:1968, November).<lb/>\nPublished 11 November 1969. In the “Note on the Text,” Carter points out that Housman’s manuscript has no title other than “Cambridge inaugural.”<lb/>\nThe decision to supply a title, he says, was not his. “But,” he adds, “having deferred to the decision, I discovered in myself a disinclination to defer to anyone else’s preference in such presumption; so, for better or worse, the title here given to the Cambridge inaugural is mine.”<lb/>\nCarter reported two errors in a letter published in the <hi>Times Literary Supplement</hi> on 27 November 1969, p. 1362: at 22.19, “preserved” should be “preserve”; at 23.11, “examples” should be “example”.<lb/>\nCarter first published the lecture, omitting a short paragraph on Shelley and Swinburne, in the <hi>Times Literary Supplement</hi> of 9 May 1968, with an appended “Note” (E2:1968); and he had the TLS text reprinted “for private circulation” (see the preceding entry).<lb/>\nFor Carter’s other editions of Housman, see the references at B:1930.<lb/>\n</p>\n<p>Facsimile subedition: [New Haven: Gary Haller, Jonathan Edwards College, Yale University, May 2001.] Plain wrappers with printed jacket.<lb/>\n</p>\n<p>B:1970<lb/>\nCatalogue of a Collection of Victorian Fiction, Mainly Three-Deckers and Autograph Letters: The Property of a Gentleman.
