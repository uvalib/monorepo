Although from the<lb/>\nearly 1770s onwards his literary ambitions were steadily developing, there is no<lb/>\nevidence prior to 1787 of a serious interest in book production. He had published<lb/>\nlibrettos, a polemical pamphlet, <hi>The Royal Circus Epitomized</hi> (1784), and his own<lb/>\nperiodical, <hi>The Devil</hi>, which ran for 22 issues in 1786 and 1787. But after his<lb/>\n1787–88 tour produced the <hi>Musical Tour of Mr. Dibdin</hi>, a 450-page quarto far<lb/>\nbigger in size and scope than anything he had written before, he began thinking on a different scale, publishing three three-volume novels between 1793 and<lb/>\n1807, a five-volume <hi>Complete History of the English Stage</hi> between 1797 and<lb/>\n1800, two large volumes of <hi>Observations on a Tour Through Almost the Whole of<lb/>\nEngland, and a Considerable Part of Scotland</hi> in 1801 and 1802, and four volumes of<lb/>\n<hi>The Professional Life of Mr. Dibdin</hi> in 1803. The <hi>Musical Tour of Mr. Dibdin</hi> directly anticipates,<lb/>\nin different ways, most of the major publications that followed. Dibdin discovered a taste for autobiographical writing mixed with anecdotes, opinions and polemics; although he has, at most, appeared as a footnote in accounts of Romantic autobiography,<lb/>\nno British writer published more about themselves in the decades between 1780<lb/>\nand 1810.<lb/>\n</p>\n<p>Despite the great importance of the <hi>Musical Tour of Mr. Dibdin</hi> (hereafter MT) in Dibdin’s<lb/>\npolymathic career, it is as flawed as it is fascinating. It did not develop smoothly<lb/>\nand Dibdin had written much of it before deciding on the final shape and content of the volume. Moreover, he was often juggling the historical aspects of his account with a desire to comment on his present circumstances. When Dibdin left London, he had no idea of recording his experiences: “at my first setting out”<lb/>\n“I had not the smallest idea of writing any account of my Tour at all” (43–44).<lb/>\nNot until August did he lay plans for a book, and not until October did he begin<lb/>\nsystematically writing it. Given that the tour itself continued until March 1788,<lb/>\nthis meant that for a long time Dibdin was having to catch up with himself, and he recognized almost immediately the parallels with Laurence Sterne’s 1760s<lb/>\nnovel, <hi>Tristram Shandy</hi> (10). As the project developed, it came to unite the different<lb/>\nworlds of self-publishing, provincial printing, financing by subscription and—belatedly—royal patronage. Scholars have paid some attention to the tour itself, and to <hi>Readings and Music</hi>,<lb/>\nbut there has been no separate analysis of the complex vehicle through which Dibdin preserved a record of these things. The published MT is the more interesting in that, uniquely among Dibdin’s major prose publications, a complete fair copy manuscript of the book has been preserved, held in the Fellows’ Library at Winchester College (MS 61).
