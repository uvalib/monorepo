It also staked a claim for<lb/>\nDudley to The Brother’s production, if only among her collegiate friends.<lb/>\nFrom July 1915 until 1919, Dudley directed a small private school in Green-<lb/>\nwich, Connecticut. It was called the Wabanaki School, after the indigenous tribe<lb/>\nof the region, and was situated next to the estate of Ernest Thompson Seton<lb/>\n(1860-1946). He had been instrumental in founding the Boy Scouts of America<lb/>\nand other movements favoring the free, outdoor education of the young, and had<lb/>\na particular admiration for the Native Americans and their culture.<lb/>\nSo did Dudley. After she retired from the school she became a psychic or<lb/>\nspiritual adviser, notably of the socialite and diarist Mabel Dodge Luhan (1879-<lb/>\n1962), who knew her as “Mrs. Lotus Dudley.”11 In 1919 Mabel was considering<lb/>\nsettling in Taos, New Mexico, and marrying Tony Luhan, an Indian of the Tiwa<lb/>\ntribe. Dudley assured “Mrs. Sterne” (as Mabel then was) that she (Mabel) was<lb/>\ndestined to build a bridge between Indian wisdom and the West. Taos was to<lb/>\nbe a great spiritual center, indeed the “heart of the world.”12 Due to Mabel’s<lb/>\nmagnetism and wealth, the town would soon become a meeting-point of cultural<lb/>\ncelebrities.<lb/>\nDudley’s later career included international conferencing with influential<lb/>\nconnections.13 On one occasion her sense of entitlement went too far, and she<lb/>\nspent two days in detention by the Paris police.14 In 1935 she contributed a long<lb/>\nintroduction to excerpts from the <hi>Ramayana</hi>, published by the London orienta-<lb/>\nlist house of Luzac.15 By 1937 she appears to have become a Muslim.16 She was<lb/>\nevidently a complex woman, whose biography would reward further research.<lb/>\nBut was the <hi>Comte de Gabalis</hi> really her work?<lb/>\nNo such idea was current on the other side of the Atlantic, where the clues<lb/>\nconverged on a character known only as M.
