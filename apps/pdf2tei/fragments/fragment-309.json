E159. The lack of any underlying pencil numbering, combined with the wove paper stock, confirms that this was a later addition, while the presence of brown numbering suggests that the alteration was made before Brontë introduced the red-ink sequence into the MS. The asterisk corresponds to the partial-leaf excision present on f. [A438]. [B438]. C444. E160. © British Library Board, f. 159, Add MS 43478.</figDesc>\n</figure>",
