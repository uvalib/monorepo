The story of how Carter and Pollard uncovered the<lb/>Wise-Forman forgeries has been told often; indeed, it is one of the best-known episodes in bibliographical history, familiar to many people outside the book world (as a result of such treatments as Richard D. Altick’s, in his 1950 book <hi>The Scholar Adventurers</hi>, and Dwight Macdonald’s, in a<lb/>1962 New Yorker article, as well as Carter’s own accounts). Its wide appeal<lb/>is understandable, as the story of two young booksellers who, through<lb/>persistent research, were able to bring down a dominant and respected<lb/>figure (for Thomas J. Wise was a distinguished collector and widely known<lb/>book-world symbol, the author of many bibliographies, and a former<lb/>president of the Bibliographical Society). It also has the elements of a detective story, with parts of a puzzle gradually, but inexorably, falling into<lb/>place. And in the Enquiry, given the panache of Carter’s prose, the story<lb/>was given a presentation that increased its appeal.<lb/>Many of the people who are attracted to the story for all these reasons,<lb/>however, do not recognize its important contribution to bibliographical<lb/>scholarship. Identifying the perpetrators (which the book did not explicitly do) is a different activity from proving that the pamphlets are indeed<lb/>fraudulent. In the absence of explicit documents, the former involves<lb/>circumstantial evidence, such as the fact that the suspected pamphlets<lb/>entered the market from the stock of a single dealer (Herbert E. Gorfin).<lb/>But the latter requires physical evidence from the items themselves. The<lb/>use of such evidence for investigating books of earlier periods was well established by this time, but the bibliographical analysis of nineteenth- and<lb/>twentieth-century books was in its infancy. The attention paid to “points”<lb/>in modern books by collectors, dealers, and the writers of author bibliographies was a form of physical examination, but it was often undisciplined<lb/>and lacking in a concern for uncovering book-production history. Publishers’ bindings, however, were beginning to be seriously studied, under<lb/>the leadership of Sadleir and Carter. And the Enquiry took a major step<lb/>forward in demonstrating ways in which the analysis of paper and type<lb/>could also be applied to post-1800 books.<lb/>It is possible that Carter’s collecting of detective fiction played a role<lb/>in inspiring the analysis of paper reported in the Enquiry. He was certainly<lb/>aware of the detective stories of R. Austin Freeman (discussed in his essay in <hi>New Paths in Book Collecting</hi> as reaching “a new level in scientific<lb/>detection”), and it is not unlikely that he knew “<hi>The Apparition of Burling Court</hi>” (1923; collected in <hi>The Puzzle Lock</hi>, 1925). In that story, the<lb/>detective, Dr. Thorndyke, proves a book to be fraudulent through several<lb/>physical tests, the decisive one being a laboratory examination of the paper, which showed that the paper contained mechanical wood-pulp and<lb/>",
