  "tei": "<pb n=\"142\"/>\n<p>these printed shelving numbers to reconstruct Jefferson’s preferred order of books<lb/>\nwhen other forms of guidance (e.g., Jefferson’s marginal numbering) were lacking.</p>\n<p>Jefferson’s subject chapter on “<hi>Chemistry</hi>” shows how Trist might have occa-<lb/>\nsionally relied on shelving numbers printed in the 1815 catalog when ordering the<lb/>\nentries in his 1823 manuscript copy. In this chapter, the numbered series runs as<lb/>\nfollows: numbers 1–6 are duodecimos, numbers 7–29 are octavos, and number 30<lb/>\nis a quarto. In copying the thirty titles that appear in this chapter from the 1815<lb/>\nprinted catalog, Trist first transcribed the entries for the chapter’s first (and only)<lb/>\nquarto (“30. Neumann’s chemistry, by Lewis”), its first octavo (“7. McQueer’s<lb/>\nchemistry”), and the chapter’s first duodecimo (“1. Dictionnaire de Chimie de<lb/>\nMacquer’s”). In this case, Trist roughly followed the order of the 1783 catalog,<lb/>\nwhich lists these three titles at the head of the chapter, likely due to their general-<lb/>\nizing treatment of the subject. Following these three titles, however—perhaps due<lb/>\nto the ambiguous arrangement of the remaining books in this chapter in the 1783<lb/>\ncatalog and the absence of Jefferson’s ordinal annotations—Trist deferred to the<lb/>\nshelf marks in the 1815 printed catalog to order the entries in his 1823 copy (fig.<lb/>\n6). The sole exception—the appearance of a duodecimo, “6. Jacob’s Chemical pocket<lb/>\ncompanion,” among an uninterrupted sequence of octavos—is likely the result of<lb/>\nTrist returning to the order of the 1783 catalog, which collocates “Jacob’s chemical<lb/>\npocket companion” and “Jacob’s experiments on Urinary and Intestinal Calculi”<lb/>\n(an octavo).</p>\n<figure>\n  <head>FIGURE 6.</head>\n  <figDesc>1823 Trist catalog, page 23, showing entries in Chapter 8, “Chemistry,” arranged according to Jefferson’s shelf mark numbers (here, 21–25, 6, and 26–29).
