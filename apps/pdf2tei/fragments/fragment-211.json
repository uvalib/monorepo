But what is stranger, a Nobleman (if such a Reflection<lb/>\ncan be thought to come from a Nobleman) has dropt an Allusion to this pitiful Untruth,<lb/>\nin his <hi>Epistle to a Doctor of Divinity</hi>: And the following Line,<lb/>\n<hi>Hard as thy Heart, and as thy Birth Obscure,</hi><lb/>\nhas fallen from a like Courtly pen, in the <hi>Verses to the Imitator of Horace</hi>. Mr. Pope’s<lb/>\nFather was of a Gentleman’s Family in Oxfordshire, the Head of which was the Earl of<lb/>\nDowne, whose sole Heiress married the Earl of Lindsey—His Mother was the Daughter<lb/>\nof William Turnor, Esq; of York: she had three Brothers, one of whom was kill’d, another<lb/>\ndied in the Service of King Charles; the eldest following his Fortunes, and becoming a<lb/>\nGeneral Officer in Spain, left her what Estate remain’d after the Sequestrations and Forfeitures of her Family. —Mr. Pope died in 1717, aged 75; She in 1733, aged 93, a very few<lb/>\nWeeks after this Poem was finished. The following Inscription was placed by their Son on<lb/>\ntheir Monument, in the Parish of Twickenham, in Middlesex.<lb/>\n<lb/>\nD. O. M.<lb/>\nAlexandro Pope Viro Innocuo,<lb/>\nProbo, Pio, Qui vixit annos Lxxv, ob. Mdccvii.<lb/>\nEt Edithæ Conjungi Inculpabili, Pientissimæ,<lb/>\nQuæ vixit annos Xciii, ob. Mdccxxxiii.<lb/>\nParentibus Benemerentibus Filius Fecit, et Sibi.<lb/>\n(Works II, 214)<lb/>\n<lb/>\nThe impression given by Pope’s note is reinforced by the engraving. The central<lb/>\nshield is quite a small part of the design. On it the arms of his father’s family are<lb/>\nimpaled with those of his mother’s, as those families are identified in the note<lb/>\nto the poem. The dextra has the arms of the Oxfordshire Pope family to which<lb/>\nthe Earl of Downe belonged. In Guillim’s <hi>A Display of Heraldry</hi> (1724), 183, they<lb/>\nappear under Baronets: ‘Sir William Pope of Wilcot in Oxfordshire, Kt. since an<lb/>\nIrish Earl, viz. Earl of Downe. Parted per Pale [halved vertically], Or and Azure<lb/>\n[gold and blue], on a Chevron between three Griffins Heads erased [torn off ],<lb/>\nfour Fleurs de Lys, all Counterchanged [reversing colours]’. The engraving has<lb/>\nonly three fleurs-de-lis, but Kent probably felt pressed for space.<lb/>\n<!-- Image link to be added during image export workflow --><lb/>\nThe sinister has the arms of the Turnor or Turner family. They are illustrated and described<lb/>\n56. Sir Bernard Burke, The General Armory of England, Scotland, Ireland, and Wales (London,<lb/>\n1884), s.n. agrees about the four fleurs-de-lis and adds a crest of griffins’ heads.<lb/>\n</p>",
