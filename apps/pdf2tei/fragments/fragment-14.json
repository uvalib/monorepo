R. Bowker in New York (the publisher of <hi>Publishers’ Weekly</hi>) and, three months later (on 29 October), by Cambridge University Press in England.<lb/>\n(The Cambridge edition is preferable, with its wonderful typography, its comfortable feel in the hand, and its old-fashioned use of recto running-titles, obviously written by Carter, that summarize the content of each two-page spread—this last a feature of the <hi>Enquiry</hi> also. For typographic excellence, the book was named one of the <hi rend=\"bold\">“Fifty Books of the Year”</hi> by the National Book League.)<lb/>\nIt is, in my opinion, Carter’s best book, and the best book about book collecting ever written.<lb/>\nAlthough it has many devotees, it has nevertheless been overshadowed by several of his other books.<lb/>\nThe reason may be its title, which sounds like a how-to manual.<lb/>\nBut the book is actually a perceptive historical study of book collecting, along with an account of the role of taste and technique (that is, connoisseurship) in making it a serious scholarly pursuit.<lb/>\nHe states in the preface that it is “not a primer or a text-book or a manual for beginners” but rather “a somewhat ruminative treatise”— or, as he later says,<lb/>\n",
