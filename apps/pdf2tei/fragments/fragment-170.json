Broadly speaking, throughout her<lb/>\nliterary journal she strived to maintain a neutral stance that was “outside politi-<lb/>\ncs,” especially in light of the censorship measures that Perón instituted during<lb/>\nhis dictatorship.12 This neutral position could itself be viewed as political, but<lb/>\nthroughout a variety of journal issues Ocampo explicitly reiterated her hostility<lb/>\nto partisan bias. For instance, in the same introduction to the quadruple issue<lb/>\nof <hi>Sur</hi>, Ocampo discusses the monstrous qualities of propaganda: “En este siglo<lb/>\nla Propaganda devora al hombre como un nuevo dios que ni siquiera trata de<lb/>\ndisimular que es un monstruo. Vivimos, dice C. Day Lewis, en un ‘pandemonio<lb/>\nde slogans, de himnos nacionales, de titulares, de altoparlantes, de manifiestos,<lb/>\nde coimas, de chismes desatinados e ideales altamente explosivos.’”13 She con-<lb/>\ntinues her diatribe by stating that <hi>Sur</hi> is against any type of political propaganda<lb/>\nand, instead, simply wishes to provide its readers with examples of outstanding<lb/>\nliterature: “En atmósferas de pandemonio ni poetas, ni artistas verdaderos pu-<lb/>\nden respirar. No ha sido, ni será la atmósfera de nuestra revista. Y por eso este<lb/>\nnúmero especial de <hi>Sur</hi> no es un número de propaganda. . . . Sólo se propone<lb/>\ndar a conocer algunos nuevos valores.”14<lb/>\n</p>\n<p><hi>Editorial Sur</hi> published forty-three books between the years 1936 and 1971<lb/>\nthat have teaser chapters in <hi>Sur</hi> (table 1).15 These pre-publication texts found<lb/>\nthroughout the pages of Ocampo’s literary journal <hi>Sur</hi> were not reserved for<lb/>\none specific genre or type of literature, but rather reflected virtually every genre<lb/>\npublished by <hi>Editorial Sur</hi> during its decades-long run. More specifically, there<lb/>\nwere excerpts of poetry, theater, novels, essays, short stories, and even memoirs<lb/>\nin <hi>Sur</hi> that were later included in full-length books published by <hi>Editorial Sur</hi>.16<lb/>\n</p>\n<div type=\"footnotes\">\n<note n=\"11\">“In 1933, before the frenzy of Argentine publishing, <hi>Sur</hi> published the first translations of Aldous Huxley (<hi>Point Counter Point</hi>), D. H. Lawrence (<hi>Kangaroo</hi>), Virginia Woolf (<hi>A Room of One’s Own</hi> and <hi>Orlando</hi>), and James Joyce (<hi>Exiles</hi>).”</note><lb/>\n<note n=\"12\">John King, “Towards a Reading of the Argentine Literary Magazine <hi>Sur</hi>,” <hi>Latin American Research Review</hi> 16, no. 2 (1981): 64.</note><lb/>\n<note n=\"13\">“In this century, Propaganda devours man like a new God who does not even try to hide the fact that he is a monster. We live, as C. Day Lewis says, in a ‘pandemonium of slogans, national anthems, headlines, loudspeakers, manifestos, bribes, misguided rumors, and highly explosive ideals.” Victoria Ocampo, “Introducción,” <hi>Sur</hi> 153 (1947): 11.</note><lb/>\n<note n=\"14\">“In atmospheres of pandemonio, neither poets nor true artists can breathe. This has not been nor will it be the atmosphere of our journal. And for that reason, this special issue of <hi>Sur</hi> is not an issue of propaganda. . . . It only aims to make a few new (literary) values known.” Ocampo, “Introducción,” 11.</note><lb/>\n<note n=\"15\"><hi>Editorial Sur</hi> published a total of 345 books during this time span, which means that 12.5% of their titles were excerpted as teaser chapters in <hi>Sur</hi>. That said, this percentage might actually be slightly higher given that at least one of the titles with teaser chapters in <hi>Sur</hi> was re-published under a new title: Albert Camus, <hi>Bodas</hi> [1957]; Albert Camus, <hi>El verano / Bodas</hi> [1970].</note><lb/>\n<note n=\"16\">The following is the specific breakdown of each of the genres represented in these teaser chapters: Novel (37%), Essay (26%), Memoir (14%), Short Stories (9%), Poetry (9%), and Theater (5%).</note><lb/>\n</div>\n",
