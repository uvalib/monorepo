<p><hi rend="dropcap">O</hi>ne of the greatest contributions to Latin American literary culture in the twentieth century came in the form of Victoria Ocampo’s literary <lb/>journal Sur (1931– 92).<hi rend="sup">1</hi> With an unparalleled life span —when compared with <lb/>similar literary magazines of the time — and an astounding list of international <lb/>authors who lined its pages, Sur is an exemplar of literary excellence. Count-<lb/>less scholars and critics have discussed the pivotal role of Sur in introducing <lb/>international writers to Latin American readers and simultaneously putting <lb/>Latin American writers on the map for international readers.<hi rend="sup">2</hi> Above all, there <lb/>has been a marked interest in examining Sur’s impressive networks (Willson; <lb/>Larkosh; Majstorovic [2013]), its lasting impact on Latin American letters <lb/>(King [1981;1986]), and its political stance (Majstorovic [2005]). However, to <lb/>date there has been no consideration of the marketing tactics employed by <lb/>Ocampo to help sell the books that she produced with her publishing firm of <lb/>the same name, Editorial Sur (1933 – 85).<hi rend="sup">3</hi> While a close examination of all <lb/>of these marketing strategies is out of the scope of this paper, I focus on one <lb/>particular method that points to Ocampo’s deep-seated understanding of the <lb/>book industry as well as to her life’s work to popularize both national and in-<lb/>ternational works of great renown.<hi rend="sup">4</hi></p>
<p>More specifically, I examine the function <lb/>of pre-publication— or teaser—book chapters in the literary journal Sur. In <lb/>particular, I analyze which Editorial Sur books were excerpted in the literary</p>
<p><hi rend="sup">1</hi> The most fruitful publication period of Sur was from 1931 through 1966. During this <lb/>thirty-six-year period Ocampo produced 302 issues, whereas only sixty-seven issues of the jour-<lb/>nal she had founded appeared from 1967 through 1992. Ocampo herself passed away in 1979.</p>
<p><hi rend="sup">2</hi> See Meyer; King (1981; 1986); and Willson. Less critical attention is given to Ocampo’s <lb/>publishing house, Editorial Sur (1933 –79).</p>
<p><hi rend="sup">3</hi> Editorial Sur published its first works in 1933 and continued to produce ten (or more) <lb/>books a year until the early 1970s. By 1985, there were no new works published under its <lb/>name. The firm was reestablished in 2005 and has since published a number of titles under <lb/>this imprint.</p>
<p><hi rend="sup">4</hi> I am currently working on a larger project about the history of Editorial Sur that details <lb/>the following marketing strategies: commonplace advertisements for Editorial Sur within the <lb/>literary journal Sur; advertisements on the cover flaps of Sur for Editorial Sur works; book re-<lb/>views of Editorial Sur works in Sur; inserted flyers for Editorial Sur books; and the promotional <lb/>sashes (or bands) that adorned many Editorial Sur books.</p>

journal and consider why certain titles might have been promoted more than <lb/>
others. In this way, I show how Ocampo’s decision to establish this publishing <lb/>
house was not merely to finance her literary journal, but rather a part of her <lb/>
business plan and overarching mission to introduce international writers to <lb/>
Latin American readers.<lb/>
<head>From Serial Publication to Teaser Chapter</head><lb/>
Serial publications— or serialized publications—appear frequently throughout <lb/>
the nineteenth century<hi rend="sup">5</hi> “Serialization,” in the words of Catherine Delafield, <lb/>
“was the process by which many nineteenth-century novels were published prior <lb/>
to their appearance in discrete volume form.”<hi rend="sup">6</hi> Certain nineteenth-century au-<lb/>
thors even began to construct chapters of a particular style and length to fit <lb/>
within the parameters of a serial publication. In England, Charles Dickens ex-<lb/>
pertly used this method for the publication of many of his novels and is perhaps <lb/>
its best-known practitioner. In America, according to Michael Lund, “the sheer <lb/>
number of significant authors and works first appearing in part from 1850 to <lb/>
1900 suggest that a central mode of the American literary tradition was the se-<lb/>
rial form, the continuing story.”<hi rend="sup">7</hi> The serial publication format also was popu-<lb/>
lar in France (<hi rend="italic">feuilleton</hi>) and Spain (<hi rend="italic">folletín</hi>) during the nineteenth century,<hi rend="sup">8</hi> and <lb/>
examples cropped up in Russia as well with the works of Dostoyevsky and Tol-<lb/>
stoy. Instances of serial publications, such as Edith Wharton’s <hi rend="italic">The House of Mirth</hi> <lb/>
(<hi rend="italic">Scribner’s Magazine</hi>, 1905), James Joyce’s <hi rend="italic">A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</hi> <lb/>
(<hi rend="italic">Egoist</hi>, 1914–15), and Ernest Hemingway’s <hi rend="italic">A Farewell to Arms</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Scribner’s Magazine</hi>, <lb/>
1929) continued to appear in later decades, but in the early part of the twentieth<lb/>
<lb/>
5. While serial publications were most prominent in the nineteenth century, they have <lb/>
much earlier origins: “Serial fiction was not a Victorian invention. As R.&amp;nbsp;M. Wiles has shown, <lb/>
already by the second quarter of the eighteenth century ‘number books, independently is-<lb/>
sued in weekly or month parts, wrapped in blue paper covers, had become a common com-<lb/>
modity in the publishing business’ (<hi rend="italic">Serial</hi>, 75)… By 1750 works thus published in fascicles <lb/>
already totaled several hundred and were occasionally issued in editions of as many as two or <lb/>
three thousand copies. Among them were both original and reprinted works, translated texts <lb/>
as well as those in the vernacular, and, among a wide variety of other genres, a number of <lb/>
examples of prose fiction, including Cervantes, Defoe, and imitations of Richardson such as <lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Pamela in High Life</hi>.” Graham Law, <hi rend="italic">Serializing Fiction in the Victorian Press</hi> (London: Palgrave, <lb/>
2000), 3.<lb/>

Routledge, 2015), 1.<lb/>

8. Alexandre Dumas’s <hi rend="italic">The Count of Monte Cristo</hi> (1844–45) and Gustave Flaubert’s <hi rend="italic">Madame <lb/>
Bovary</hi> (1856) originally appeared as serial publications in magazines in France. Many of the <lb/>
works of Benito Pérez Galdós also appeared in serial format in Spain. See Wright for more <lb/>
details on the development of the serial novel throughout Spain and Mexico.<lb/>
<pb n="169"/>
<p>
<lb/>century the use of this print format declined alongside the advent of new forms 
<lb/>of media, namely radio and television.<hi rend="sup">9</hi>
<lb/>With this background of serialized publications in mind, I argue that Ocampo’s literary journal <hi rend="italic">Sur</hi> in the late 1930s presented a new form that borrowed 
<lb/>certain aspects of serialized publications with an eye toward marketing. While 
<lb/>the teaser chapters that Ocampo presented to readers have their roots in earlier 
<lb/>serial publications, her excerpts were slightly different. Unlike serialized publica-
<lb/>tions that printed an entire work in installments, or fascicles, the teaser chapter 
<lb/>is exactly what its name describes: a single chapter (or, at times, two) that aimed 
<lb/>to excite readers about a forthcoming book and, by proxy, encouraged them to 
<lb/>buy the book once it was released. In a sense, these teaser chapters throughout 
<lb/>the pages of <hi rend="italic">Sur</hi> are a type of predecessor for the sample chapters— or “sneak 
<lb/>peaks” of forthcoming works—that appear at the end of many of today’s popular 
<lb/>novels.<hi rend="sup">10</hi> That is to say, these teaser chapters are a hybrid of a serialized install-
<lb/>ment publication and a sample of forthcoming works. Readers can get a taste for 
<lb/>certain books through a periodical publication (like serial publications), but they 
<lb/>must purchase the book to read it in its entirety (like sample chapters at the end of 
<lb/>contemporary novels). As I will show in the following sections, the teaser chapters 
<lb/>that Ocampo appears to have included strategically in her literary journal from 
<lb/>a variety of forthcoming Editorial Sur works align with her mission to encourage 
<lb/>a broader readership while also boosting sales.
</p>
<head>Sampling Editorial Sur</head>
<p>
<lb/>Before diving into the teaser chapters in <hi rend="italic">Sur</hi> I want to reflect briefly on the dif-
<lb/>ferences between marketing and propaganda. Both seek to persuade people, but 
<lb/>whereas marketing attempts to sell goods or services, propaganda tries to pro-
<lb/>mote a political cause or point of view. Ocampo certainly was concerned with 
<lb/>the marketing strategies of <hi rend="italic">Sur</hi> and Editorial Sur. The impetus behind those 
<lb/>projects was her drive to promote important works of literature. In a footnote to 
<lb/>the introduction of a special quadruple issue of <hi rend="italic">Sur</hi> dedicated to English litera-
<lb/>ture she made clear how she had helped to bring this about: “En 1933, antes de 
<lb/>la fiebre editorial argentina, <hi rend="smallcaps">SUR</hi> publicó las primeras traducciones de Aldous 
<lb/><hi rend="italic">Huxley</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Contrapunto</hi>), D. H. Lawrence (<hi rend="italic">Canguro</hi>), Virginia Woolf (<hi rend="italic">Un Cuarto Propio</hi>
<lb/>9. Fitzgerald’s <hi rend="italic">This Side of Paradise</hi> (1920) and <hi rend="italic">The Beautiful and Damned</hi> (1922) present an-
<lb/>other kind of serialization, yet this example is that in which the periodical publication in install-
<lb/>ments comes after the publication of the work as a single volume (<hi rend="italic">Chicago Herald and Examiner</hi> &amp; 
<lb/><hi rend="italic">Atlanta Georgian</hi>, 1921; <hi rend="italic">The Washington Herald</hi>, 1922), which suggests an even greater marketing 
<lb/>strategy since these second serializations tend to appear after large sales of the single-volume 
<lb/>work (West III).
<lb/>10. A number of recent publishing manuals encourage authors to include sample chapters 
<lb/>for their forthcoming or already published books in their back matter, especially if the book is 
<lb/>part of a larger series (Coker; Crayton; Lynch). I should note, however, that I have yet to see 
<lb/>an example of this publishing phenomenon in Spanish-language books.

<lb/>y Orlando) y James Joyce (Desterrados).”<hi rend="sup">11</hi> Ocampo’s decision to include in <hi rend="italic">Sur</hi><lb/>various promotional materials like teaser chapters from forthcoming Editorial <hi rend="italic">Sur</hi><lb/>titles signals a logical approach to introducing Latin American readers to<lb/>international authors and to selling her editions of their works.<lb/>The range of writers Ocampo published was itself evidence that she was not<lb/>attempting to promote a narrow party line. Broadly speaking, throughout her<lb/>literary journal she strived to maintain a neutral stance that was “outside poli-<lb/>tics,” especially in light of the censorship measures that Perón instituted during<lb/>his dictatorship.<hi rend="sup">12</hi> This neutral position could itself be viewed as political, but<lb/>throughout a variety of journal issues Ocampo explicitly reiterated her hostility<lb/>to partisan bias. For instance, in the same introduction to the quadruple issue<lb/>of <hi rend="italic">Sur</hi>, Ocampo discusses the monstrous qualities of propaganda: “En este siglo<lb/>la Propaganda devora al hombre como un nuevo dios que ni siquiera trata de<lb/>disimular que es un monstruo. Vivimos, dice C. Day Lewis, en un ‘pandemonio<lb/>de slogans, de himnos nacionales, de titulares, de altoparlantes, de manifiestos,<lb/>de coimas, de chismes desatinados e ideales altamente explosivos.’”<hi rend="sup">13</hi><lb/>She continues her diatribe by stating that <hi rend="italic">Sur</hi> is against any type of political propaganda<lb/>and, instead, simply wishes to provide its readers with examples of outstanding<lb/>literature: “En atmósferas de pandemonio ni poetas, ni artistas verdaderos pu-<lb/>eden respirar. No ha sido, ni será la atmósfera de nuestra revista. Y por eso este<lb/>número especial de <hi rend="smallcaps">SUR</hi> no es un número de propaganda. . . . Sólo se propone<lb/>dar a conocer algunos nuevos valores.”<hi rend="sup">14</hi><lb/>Editorial <hi rend="italic">Sur</hi> published forty-three books between the years 1936 and 1971<lb/>that have teaser chapters in <hi rend="italic">Sur</hi> (table 1).<hi rend="sup">15</hi> These pre-publication texts found<lb/>throughout the pages of Ocampo’s literary journal <hi rend="italic">Sur</hi> were not reserved for<lb/>one specific genre or type of literature, but rather reflected virtually every genre<lb/>published by Editorial <hi rend="italic">Sur</hi> during its decades-long run. More specifically, there<lb/>were excerpts of poetry, theater, novels, essays, short stories, and even memoirs<lb/>in <hi rend="italic">Sur</hi> that were later included in full-length books published by Editorial <hi rend="italic">Sur</hi>.<hi rend="sup">16</hi><lb/>
11. “In 1933, before the frenzy of Argentine publishing, <hi rend="smallcaps">SUR</hi> published the first transla-<lb/>tions of Aldous Huxley (<hi rend="italic">Point Counter Point</hi>), D.&amp;nbsp;H. Lawrence (<hi rend="italic">Kangaroo</hi>)<lb/>Virginia Woolf (<hi rend="italic">A Room of One’s Own</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Orlando</hi>), and James Joyce (<hi rend="italic">Exiles</hi>).”<lb/>
12. John King, “Towards a Reading of the Argentine Literary Magazine <hi rend="italic">Sur</hi>,” <hi rend="italic">Latin Ameri-<lb/>can Research Review</hi> 16, no.&amp;nbsp;2 (1981): 64.<lb/>
13. “In this century, Propaganda devours man like a new God who does not even try to<lb/>hide the fact that he is a monster. We live, as C. Day Lewis says, in a ‘pandemonium of slogans,<lb/>national anthems, headlines, loudspeakers, manifestos, bribes, misguided rumors, and highly<lb/>explosive ideals.” Victoria Ocampo, “Introducción,” <hi rend="italic">Sur</hi> 153 (1947): 11.<lb/>
14. “In atmospheres of pandemonium, neither poets nor true artists can breathe. This has<lb/>not been nor will it be the atmosphere of our journal. And for that reason, this special issue of<lb/><hi rend="smallcaps">SUR</hi> is not an issue of propaganda. . . . It only aims to make a few new (literary) values known.”<lb/>Ocampo, “Introducción,” 11.<lb/>
15. Editorial <hi rend="italic">Sur</hi> published a total of 345 books during this time span, which means that<lb/>12.5% of their titles were excerpted as teaser chapters in <hi rend="italic">Sur</hi>. That said, this percentage might<lb/>actually be slightly higher given that at least one of the titles with teaser chapters in <hi rend="italic">Sur</hi> was re-<lb/>published under a new title: Albert Camus, <hi rend="italic">Bodas</hi> [1957]; Albert Camus, <hi rend="italic">El verano&amp;nbsp;/ Bodas</hi> [1970].<lb/>
16. The following is the specific breakdown of each of the genres represented in these<lb/>teaser chapters: Novel (37%), Essay (26%), Memoir (14%), Short Stories (9%), Poetry (9%),<lb/>and Theater (5%).<lb/>
<pb n="171"/>
<p>In essence, these teaser chapters showcased the breadth and depth of material<lb/>
that this publishing firm produced. What is more, the authors who penned these<lb/>
diverse works hailed from around the globe (England, France, Argentina, Italy,<lb/>
Chile, Russia, Spain, the United States,<hi rend="sup">17</hi> Ireland, and Germany). However, the<lb/>
names of virtually all the authors of these sample chapters would have been<lb/>
known to readers, especially for the educated and elite consumers of <hi rend="italic">Sur</hi>.<lb/>
For instance, a few of the authors whose sampled works appeared in these issues<lb/>
included James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, Aldous Huxley, George Orwell, Gabriela<lb/>
Mistral, Albert Camus, and T.&amp;nbsp;E. Lawrence, as well as Victoria Ocampo herself.<lb/>
When viewed in tandem with the numerous ads that filled the opening and clos-<lb/>
ing pages of each issue of the literary journal <hi rend="italic">Sur</hi>, these teaser chapters reveal<lb/>
one potential way in which Ocampo might have marketed select works as a part<lb/>
of her more general mission to promote certain authors for her Latin American<lb/>
readers.<hi rend="sup">18</hi></p>
<p>While Ocampo’s literary journal tended to include only one pre-publication<lb/>
chapter from each of these books, there were instances in which several chap-<lb/>
ters—or even entire works—appeared in <hi rend="italic">Sur</hi> prior to the book publication with<lb/>
Editorial Sur. Consider, for instance, the following titles that had at least two<lb/>
chapters published in <hi rend="italic">Sur</hi> prior to their releases as single-volume works with Edi-<lb/>
torial Sur: André Gide’s <hi rend="italic">Perséphone</hi> (1936), Eduardo Mallea’s <hi rend="italic">La ciudad junto al río<lb/>
inmóvil</hi> (1936), Virginia Woolf’s <hi rend="italic">Un cuarto propio</hi> (1936), Aldous Huxley’s <hi rend="italic">Con los<lb/>
esclavos en la noria</hi> (1937), Victoria Ocampo’s <hi rend="italic">Virginia Woolf, Orlando y Cía</hi> (1938),<lb/>
and Silvina Ocampo’s <hi rend="italic">Autobiografía de Irene</hi> (1948).<hi rend="sup">19</hi> Multiple poems from Gabri-<lb/>
ela Mistral’s <hi rend="italic">Tala</hi> (1938) as well as Eduardo González Lanuza’s <hi rend="italic">La degollación de los<lb/>
inocentes</hi> (1938) and <hi rend="italic">Transitable cristal</hi> (1943) also appeared in the pages of <hi rend="italic">Sur</hi> prior<lb/>
to their official release with Editorial Sur. It is telling that early on multiple teaser<lb/>
chapters from Editorial Sur books—if not the entire works—appeared in <hi rend="italic">Sur</hi>.<lb/>
In essence, these early pre-publication chapters highlight the residual influence of<lb/>
serial publications. The only two books that were published in an entirely serial-<lb/>
ized format in <hi rend="italic">Sur</hi> prior to their release with Editorial Sur were Woolf’s <hi rend="italic">Un cuarto<lb/>
propio</hi> and Gide’s <hi rend="italic">Perséphone</hi>.<hi rend="sup">20</hi> These two works are the second and third Editorial<lb/>
Sur works that were pre-published in <hi rend="italic">Sur</hi>, respectively, which further stresses the<lb/></p>

<note place="foot" n="18">Alongside the promotional materials for Editorial Sur editions and articles in forthcoming issues of <hi rend="italic">Sur</hi>, the majority of advertisements found in the opening and closing pages of Ocampo’s literary journal throughout the 1930s and 1940s were for printers, bookstores, or other publishing houses in Buenos Aires.</note>

<note place="foot" n="20">I note in another work that this Spanish-language translation of Gide’s work with Editorial Sur was most likely “a type of reverse marketing to attract potential [buyers] by giving them access to a (successful) sample of the type of material that they publish” since, in addition to appearing in <hi rend="italic">Sur</hi> in its entirety, it was distributed free of charge in book form (Nora Benedict, <hi rend="italic">Borges and the Literary Marketplace: How Editorial Practices Shaped Cosmopolitan Reading</hi> [New Haven: Yale University Press, 2021], 276).</note>

the use of phrases like “continuará” [will continue] and “concluirá” [will con-<lb/>
clude] at the end of each separate chapter publication in Sur, which were spread<lb/>
out over four different issues from December 1935 to March 1936. Editorial Sur’s<lb/>
single-volume book publication of Un cuarto propio appeared in July 1936.<lb/>
In contrast to the multiple-teaser-chapter model, single teaser chapters be-<lb/>
came more common in the literary journal. The single-teaser chapter model<lb/>
coincided with Editorial Sur’s publication of the works of more high-profile,<lb/>
international authors. Generally speaking, this shift to a single-teaser chapter<lb/>
model not only would allow for the inclusion of more authors’ works, which<lb/>
certainly would have appealed to Ocampo’s more general goals, but also might<lb/>
be a logical change in light of the differences in sales that result from serialized<lb/>
publications and teaser chapters. While the presence of serialized publications<lb/>
within a journal might generate an uptick in buyers— or subscribers, these in-<lb/>
dividuals will only be purchasing issues of one particular journal, not separate<lb/>
books, and they might even stop their subscriptions after the last installment of a<lb/>
given work. On the other hand, the use of pre-publication chapters entices read-<lb/>
ers not only to continue to buy a given journal for the carefully curated snippets<lb/>
of forthcoming works, but also to purchase the books that are marketed with<lb/>
these teaser chapters. If the journal and publishing house are owned by the same<lb/>
individual, which is the case for Sur and Editorial Sur, this model would be the<lb/>
most logical and economically sound option as it encourages the largest amount<lb/>
of profit as well as the greatest number of readers and buyers.<lb/>
Another more subtle clue that these teaser chapters functioned as a type of<lb/>
marketing to help sell Editorial Sur editions are the footnotes that accompanied<lb/>
over half of the periodical publications.<hi rend="sup">21</hi> More specifically, the majority of these<lb/>
teaser chapters brought readers’ attention to the fact that the excerpt that they<lb/>
were about to read in Sur was part of a forthcoming Editorial Sur book. For in-<lb/>
stance, James Joyce’s Desterrados alerted readers that the “versión castellana pub-<lb/>
licará próximamente la Editorial SUR” [the Spanish version will be published<lb/>
shortly], while Conrado Nalé Roxlo’s Claro desvelo was already “en prensa” [in<lb/>
production] with Editorial Sur, and Gabriela Mistral’s Tala “publicará este mes”<lb/>
[will be published this month].<hi rend="sup">22</hi><lb/>
In comparison with these slight hints, Ocampo took a more direct route<lb/>
with other works. In particular, she endorsed Huxley’s Con los esclavos en la noria<lb/>
and Cyril Connolly’s La tumba sin sosiego more explicitly. Immediately before<lb/>
the first teaser chapter of Huxley’s work was a long introductory text about the<lb/>
publication and the “esfuerza editorial” [editorial effort] to produce this work<lb/>
in Spanish.<hi rend="sup">23</hi> What is more, this gloss did not simply announce the publica-<lb/>
</p>
<p>21. Over half of these Editorial Sur books that are promoted through teaser chapters are also reviewed in Sur.<lb/>
22. Virtually all of the other footnoted teaser chapters presented a similar linguistic for-<lb/>
mula to announce that these textual fragments were part of a larger work.<lb/>
23. I should note that both of the introductory texts that I discuss here only appeared<lb/>
before the excerpted teaser chapters in the literary journal Sur and were not included in the<lb/>
full book-length publications with Editorial Sur.<lb/>
</p>
<pb n="176"/>
<p>tion of Huxley’s novel with Editorial Sur, it conveyed the unique opportunity<lb/>
that readers had to acquire “una obra de gran importancia” [a work of great<lb/>
importance].<sup>24</sup> The editors of <hi rend="italic">Sur</hi> also stressed that this was the “primera traduc­<lb/>
ción [española] que aparece, pues el público no conoce aún más que la edición<lb/>
inglesa” [first Spanish translation to appear since the public does not know any­<lb/>
thing other than the English edition].<sup>25</sup> This particular tactic of emphasizing the<lb/>
fact that no other Spanish-language version of a given work exists is one that<lb/>
Editorial Sur employed frequently throughout the 1930s with great success.<sup>26</sup><lb/>
Similar to Huxley’s teaser chapters, the pre-publication chapter from Connolly’s<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">La tumba sin sosiego</hi> was prefaced by a lengthy two-page parenthetical note by<lb/>
Ricardo Baeza, the novel’s translator. Aside from providing a brief biography of<lb/>
Connolly and details on his other works, Baeza mentions that the complete trans­<lb/>
lation of his most recent novel (<hi rend="italic">La tumba sin sosiego</hi>) “publicará en breve la<lb/>
Editorial Sur” [will be published soon by Editorial Sur] (95). These two examples<lb/>
point to Ocampo’s meticulous attention to the promotion and marketing of her<lb/>
books.<lb/>
For most of these titles, the pre-publication chapters appeared in <hi rend="italic">Sur</hi> at least<lb/>
one to two months before their release as books by Editorial Sur. In this way,<lb/>
readers were made aware of forthcoming titles and given a preview of com­<lb/>
ing attractions with the hopes of building anticipation for the entire book. This<lb/>
marketing strategy makes sense given that over half of these works were the first<lb/>
authorized translations of foreign works available to readers in Latin America,<lb/>
which also aligned with Ocampo’s overarching mission and, given their unique<lb/>
status in the Spanish-language book industry, made their availability more de­<lb/>
sirable. That said, there are a few outliers (nine in total) whose teaser chapters<lb/>
appeared in <hi rend="italic">Sur</hi> in the same month as their full-length book publication. The<lb/>
vast majority of titles that fall into this camp of simultaneous publication are<lb/>
those by authors whose works appeared in Spanish and, as a result, did not re­<lb/>
quire translation, namely Conrado Nalé Roxlo, Gabriela Mistral, José Bianco,<lb/>
Juan Goyanarte, H. A. Murena, and Victoria Ocampo.<sup>27</sup> The only exceptions<lb/>
are Alexandre Arnoux’s <hi rend="italic">La cifra</hi>, which was published as a book with Editorial<lb/>
Sur in November 1955 and then excerpted in the January/February 1956 issue<lb/>
of <hi rend="italic">Sur</hi> (238: 87–90), and T. E. Lawrence’s <hi rend="italic">Siete pilares de la sabiduría</hi>, which was<lb/>
published as a book with Editorial Sur in September 1944 and then excerpted in<lb/>
the October 1944 issue of <hi rend="italic">Sur</hi> (120: 35–54). Given Ocampo’s interest in promot­<lb/>

<sup>25.</sup> “Un capítulo de <hi rend="italic">Eyeless in Gaza</hi>,” 48.<lb/>
<sup>26.</sup> The colophons for many international works produced by Editorial Sur during these<lb/>
years highlight the status of these books as the first Spanish-language translation authorized by<lb/>
the author (e.g., Aldous Huxley, <hi rend="italic">Contrapunto</hi> [1933], <hi rend="italic">Con los esclavos en la noria</hi> [1937]; D. H.<lb/>
Law­rence, <hi rend="italic">Canguro</hi> [1933], <hi rend="italic">La virgin y el gitano</hi> [1934]; André Malraux, <hi rend="italic">La condición humana</hi><lb/>
[1936]; Virginia Woolf, <hi rend="italic">Un cuarto propio</hi> [1936], <hi rend="italic">Orlando</hi> [1937], <hi rend="italic">Al faro</hi> [1938]; James Joyce,<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Desterrados</hi> [1937]; etc.). The advertising flyers inserted in <hi rend="italic">Sur</hi> to announce forthcoming<lb/>
works from Editorial Sur praised the novelty of their Spanish-language translations. Take, for<lb/>
instance, the flyer for Joyce’s <hi rend="italic">Desterrados</hi> that boldly states that “DESTERRADOS no ha sido traducido aún a<lb/>
ningún otro idioma; es por lo tanto una primicia más de SUR” [EXILES has not been trans­<lb/>
lated into any other language; it is therefore another first for SUR].<lb/>
<sup>27.</sup> Aside from these authors, the works of León Chestov, Ramón Fernández, and Joseph<lb/>
Jean Lanza del Vasto also appeared with simultaneous publications in <hi rend="italic">Sur</hi> and Editorial Sur.<lb/>
</p>
<pb n="177"/>
<lb/>ing exemplary literary works from writers of her time, it makes sense that she<lb/>
would have fueled anticipation for coming titles. The longer timeline involved in<lb/>
producing translations of these foreign works also might have factored into the<lb/>
months-long gap between teaser chapter publication in <hi rend="italic">Sur</hi> and full-length book<lb/>
publication with Editorial Sur.<hi rend="sup">28</hi><lb/>
<head>Promotional Trends</head><lb/>
Certain trends emerge with these pre-publication texts. In the pages that follow I<lb/>
explain why certain Editorial Sur works might have been promoted more heavily<lb/>
than others and, with the help of extant archival material, reveal additional finan-<lb/>
cial pressures that might account for some of Ocampo’s marketing decisions. In<lb/>
general terms, the rationale for the use of teaser chapters in <hi rend="italic">Sur</hi> falls into one of two<lb/>
categories: promotion of best sellers, or questions of copyright and authors’ permis-<lb/>
sions. Even though these two categories overlap in a number of ways, it will be use-<lb/>
ful to conceptualize the use of pre-publication chapters through these two lenses.<lb/>
If a publisher is looking to capitalize on international literary trends, then<lb/>
producing translations, especially the first authorized translations, of works that<lb/>
have already become commercial successes in other countries is a sound deci-<lb/>
sion. Ocampo’s editorial selections and keen eye for the best literary trends,<lb/>
therefore, made her a savvy businesswoman. In fact, Editorial Sur made many<lb/>
international best sellers available to Spanish-language readers for the first time.<lb/>
Perhaps more surprising is the fact that some of her firm’s translations are still<lb/>
the only Spanish-language translations available for certain foreign works. Here<lb/>
I examine two examples of best-selling authors whose work Editorial Sur trans-<lb/>
lated, published, and excerpted with teaser chapters in the literary journal <hi rend="italic">Sur</hi>:<lb/>
Aldous Huxley and Albert Camus.<lb/>
Editorial Sur published two of Aldous Huxley’s novels—<hi rend="italic">Contrapunto</hi> and<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Con los esclavos en la noria</hi>—as well as his short pamphlet <hi rend="italic">¿Cómo lo resuelve usted? El<lb/>
problema de la paz constructiva</hi>. In fact, Huxley’s <hi rend="italic">Contrapunto</hi> is the first work that<lb/>
Ocampo’s firm published, and one of the author’s most successful. A short three<lb/>
years later, in 1936, Ocampo acquired the translation and publication rights for<lb/>
Huxley’s <hi rend="italic">Eyeless in Gaza</hi>, which was already creating a stir: “That <hi rend="italic">Eyeless in Gaza</hi><lb/>
was awaited with growing interest is attested by its first-year sales in England,<lb/>
which at 26,700 copies […], were more than double those of <hi rend="italic">Brave New World</hi>.<lb/>
The reviews of <hi rend="italic">Eyeless in Gaza</hi> were the fullest and quite often the most analytical<lb/>
of any novel Huxley wrote.”<hi rend="sup">29</hi> According to the book’s colophon, <hi rend="italic">Con los esclavos<lb/>
en la noria</hi> was the first and only authorized Spanish translation of <hi rend="italic">Eyeless in Gaza</hi>,<lb/>
which accentuates its unique importance.<lb/>
Unlike <hi rend="italic">Contrapunto</hi>, the publication of Huxley’s <hi rend="italic">Con los esclavos en la noria</hi> with<lb/>
Editorial Sur was preceded—and highly anticipated—by two teaser chapters in<lb/>
Ocampo’s literary journal. What is more, as previously mentioned, the first of these<lb/>
<note place="foot"><hi rend="sup">28.</hi> The publication of foreign language works in translation is also more costly than pro-<lb/>
ducing a Spanish-language work. As a result, the earlier (and heavier) advertising and promo-<lb/>
tion of these works might have been an intentional effort to recuperate funds.</note><lb/>

<p><lb/>two teaser chapters was introduced with a lengthy page-and-a-half note to readers <lb/>that emphasized the importance of this literary work. From its opening line, this <lb/>introductory note presented an air of marketing: “La Editorial <hi rend="smallcaps">SUR</hi> dará pronto al <lb/>público de habla española una obra de gran importancia: la reciente y ya famosa <lb/>novela con que el autor de <hi rend="smallcaps">CONTRAPUNTO</hi> ha igualado y aún sobrepasado los <lb/>valores extraordinarios en cuanto a inteligencia y estilo que señalaron a ese título <lb/>como el de una de las novelas más importantes de nuestro tiempo.”<hi rend="sup">30</hi><lb/>Apart from singing the praises of this new novel, this note mentioned Huxley’s previous novel <lb/>published by Editorial Sur (<hi rend="italic">Contrapunto</hi>), which linked the two works and appeared <lb/>to encourage readers to purchase this earlier title if they had not done so already. <lb/>Finally, the author of this note suggested that this edition would be to the liking of <lb/><hi rend="smallcaps">Sur</hi>’s many readers: “<hi rend="smallcaps">SUR</hi> espera que sus ya muchos millares de lectores aprecien <lb/>el esfuerzo editorial que comporta el ofrecerles en forma tan rápida y prolija la <lb/>gran obra, de la que podrán leer hoy un capítulo escogido al azar y cuyo texto <lb/>se halla en prensa.”<hi rend="sup">31</hi> Along with this laudatory introductory note, the novel was <lb/>reviewed in <hi rend="italic">Sur</hi> by Julio Irazusta, the work’s translator.<hi rend="sup">32</hi><lb/>More than a traditional book review, this note focused on the difficulties of translating Huxley’s style and <lb/>highlighted the literary achievements of the work, like the development of a “ver-<lb/>dadera caracterización, personajes de inconfundible vida propia” [true depiction <lb/>(of) characters with an unmistakable life of their own] and “un hondo drama <lb/>según las mejores reglas, con <hi rend="italic">catharsis</hi> y todo” [an intense tragedy that follows the <lb/>best rules, with <hi rend="italic">catharsis</hi> and all].<hi rend="sup">33</hi> In the process, Irazusta referred extensively <lb/>to Huxley’s previously translated work that Editorial Sur published (<hi rend="italic">Contrapunto</hi>), <lb/>which might have further served to promote the firm’s books.<lb/></p>
<p><lb/>As it had done with Aldous Huxley’s <hi rend="italic">Con los esclavos en la noria</hi>, Editorial Sur <lb/>publicized its edition of Albert Camus’s <hi rend="italic">La peste</hi> extensively. In particular, a pre-<lb/>publication teaser chapter appeared within the pages of <hi rend="italic">Sur</hi> alongside numerous <lb/>advertisements for the edition. While Editorial Sur employed comparable mar-<lb/>keting techniques for other books that they published, Huxley’s and Camus’s <lb/>works needed almost no introduction given their level of international recogni-<lb/>tion (and subsequent anticipation). Originally appearing in French in 1947, “<hi rend="italic">La <lb/>Peste</hi> was published in a printing of 22,000 copies” according to Herbert Lottman, <lb/>which was “high for that time, high for a serious novel, but an underestimate<lb/></p>
<p><lb/><hi rend="sup">30.</hi> “Editorial <hi rend="smallcaps">SUR</hi> will soon provide the Spanish-speaking public with a work of great <lb/>importance: the recent and already famous novel with which the author of <hi rend="italic">Point Counter Point</hi> <lb/>has equaled and even surpassed the extraordinary values of intelligence and style that made <lb/>this book one of the most important novels of our time.” “Un capítulo de <hi rend="italic">Eyeless in Gaza</hi>,” 47.<lb/></p>
<p><lb/><hi rend="sup">31.</hi> “<hi rend="smallcaps">SUR</hi> hopes that their many thousand readers appreciate the editorial effort put forth <lb/>to offer them this great work in such a fast and meticulous form, from which they will be able <lb/>to read today a randomly chosen chapter from the work that is in production.” “Un capítulo <lb/>de <hi rend="italic">Eyeless in Gaza</hi>,” 48. While the description of certain teaser chapters being chosen at random <lb/>here pertains to Huxley’s novel, it can be applied more broadly to virtually all teaser chapter <lb/>selections in <hi rend="italic">Sur</hi>, which do not adhere to any pattern in terms of the book chapters that were <lb/>chosen to pre-publish.<lb/></p>

<lb/>on the part of the Librarie Gallimard of the suitability of the book for its era.”<hi rend="sup">34</hi><lb/>Lottman goes on to describe the incredible financial success of Camus’s novel:<lb/>“By the fall [of 1947] it had sold nearly 100,000 copies and Camus was joking to<lb/>Michel and Janine Gallimard that henceforth he’d have to pick up everybody’s<lb/>restaurant checks.”<hi rend="sup">35</hi> These publishing successes of <hi rend="italic">La Peste</hi> were not just reserved<lb/>for its first edition in the original French, but also spilled over to the first edition<lb/>of its Spanish translation with Editorial Sur.<lb/><lb/>Editorial Sur’s first edition of <hi rend="italic">La peste</hi> appeared in July of 1948 and was<lb/>promoted quite extensively by the literary journal <hi rend="italic">Sur</hi>. Immediately following its<lb/>initial publication, <hi rend="italic">Sur</hi> advertised the novel in virtually every issue, describing the<lb/>work as “la novela más famosa aparecida en Francia en los últimos veinte años.<lb/>El gran éxito de la post-guerra” [the most famous novel published in France<lb/>in the last twenty years. The great success of the postwar].<hi rend="sup">36</hi> What is more,<lb/>these same advertisements informed readers that this first edition of <hi rend="italic">La peste</hi> was<lb/>“agotada” [sold out] within a year of its publication date, but that it would be<lb/>reissued in a second edition. This new edition came out in December 1949 and<lb/>not only was heavily advertised in <hi rend="italic">Sur</hi>, just like the first edition, but also had a<lb/>noticeable price increase from nine Argentine pesos to twelve. The popularity<lb/>and extensive sales of <hi rend="italic">La peste</hi> were further attested in its publication eight more<lb/>times from 1951 to 1961.<hi rend="sup">37</hi> Coupled with these publications and sales tactics was<lb/>the review of <hi rend="italic">La peste</hi> by Rosa Chacel, who also happened to be the translator<lb/>of the work for Editorial Sur. Throughout her lengthy article on this novel and<lb/>her work in translating it into Spanish, she praised Camus for his literary ac-<lb/>complishments: “Ante todo, este libro es un ejemplar gloriosamente logrado de<lb/>arte dirigido” [Above all, this book is a gloriously accomplished model of guided<lb/>art].<hi rend="sup">38</hi> When viewed together, all of these marketing materials for <hi rend="italic">La peste</hi>—from<lb/>a pre-publication teaser chapter to its numerous advertisements and reviews—<lb/>highlight Ocampo’s aim to promote the works of foreign authors through both<lb/>the journal articles and books that she published.<lb/><lb/>Related to capitalizing on international bestsellers is Ocampo’s knack for<lb/>identifying widely anticipated books. Take, for instance, T. E. Lawrence’s <hi rend="italic">The<lb/>Mint</hi> (1955). <hi rend="italic">Publishers’ Weekly</hi> advertised the first edition of this work in their<lb/>July 31, 1954 issue: “DOUBLEDAY will bring out in February a limited edition<lb/>of 1,000 copies of ‘The Mint,’ a little-known work by T. E. Lawrence.… In<lb/>his will, Lawrence stipulated that the book should not be published, however,<lb/>
<pb n="180"/>
<p>
until certain people died. In 1936, Doubleday wished to publish the book, but<lb/>
because of the provisions of the will, was unable to do so at that time.”<note n="39">Publishers’ Weekly, July 31, 1954: 466–67.</note><lb/>
In their February highlights section from 1955, this same periodical noted that the<lb/>
publication of The Mint “is certain to be hailed as a major literary event.”<note n="40">Publishers’ Weekly, February 1955: 1772.</note><lb/>
In its<lb/>
issue of March 19, 1955, <hi rend="italic">Publishers’ Weekly</hi> stated that “[the first limited release<lb/>
was] oversubscribed, and no more copies were available by March 9,” which<lb/>
showcased readers’ interest in and demand for the work.<note n="41">Publishers’ Weekly, March 19, 1955: 1557.</note> A short few months<lb/>
after its initial publication with Doubleday, <hi rend="italic">The Mint</hi> appeared in translation with<lb/>
Editorial Sur (on May 28, 1955).<note n="42">Given the controversial nature of this work, Editorial Sur’s popular edition was expurgated. That said, in Ocampo’s personal copy of <hi rend="italic">El troquel</hi>, currently housed at Villa Ocampo in Argentina, she has filled in all of the censored passages herself in red pencil, and, according to advertisements in <hi rend="italic">Sur</hi> 230&amp;nbsp;[September&amp;nbsp;1954] there also was an “edición limitada y sin purgar” [limited edition and without censorship] available by subscription only.</note> However, it is important to note that this edi-<lb/>
tion was originally scheduled to appear simultaneously with the first English and<lb/>
French editions in February 1955: “SUR publicará este libro extraordinario en<lb/>
el mes de febrero del año próximo, simultáneamente con las ediciones inglesa y<lb/>
francesa” [SUR will publish this extraordinary book in the month of February<lb/>
next year, simultaneously with the English and French editions].<note n="43"><hi rend="italic">Sur</hi> 230 (1954), n.p.</note> Perhaps sens-<lb/>
ing the splash that this book would have, along with her own personal interest<lb/>
in Lawrence’s writings, Ocampo excerpted various chapters and pre-published<lb/>
them in <hi rend="italic">Sur</hi> as teasers in 1947 and 1951, well before the work’s slated release date.<lb/>
While the former publication in <hi rend="italic">Sur</hi> consisted of a few pages of fragments, the<lb/>
latter presented readers with an introductory note on the work, the difficulties of<lb/>
its translation, and a whopping eight chapters.<note n="44">The earlier fragments from 1947 are translated by Jorge Luis Borges and Adolfo Bioy Casares while the latter material from 1951, as well as the entire published book, are translated by Victoria Ocampo (with the assistance of Enrique Pezzoni and Ricardo Baeza).</note> From its paratextual material,<lb/>
readers learned that Ocampo, unlike any other publisher around the globe, “[ha<lb/>
recibido] autorización de publicar ocho capítulos” [received the authorization<lb/>
to publish eight chapters], which spoke to her literary connections and editorial<lb/>
prowess as a publisher.<note n="45">Victoria Ocampo, “The Mint,” <hi rend="italic">Sur</hi> 197 (1951): 1.</note> She even goes so far as to note how this material “[n]o<lb/>
es mucho, pero nos da un pregusto del libro extraordinario de que forman parte”<lb/>
[is not much, but it gives us a taste of the extraordinary book of which it forms a<lb/>
part].<note n="46">Ocampo, “The Mint,” 1.</note> Her subtle use of the word <hi rend="italic">pregusto</hi> here hints at how these chapters served<lb/>
as a preview of coming attractions and signaled her desire to develop readers’<lb/>
interest in the entire book that she would publish a few years later.<lb/>
</p>
<p>
While a large number of the authors whose works appeared with Editorial Sur<lb/>
might have been household names to an educated international audience, not all of<lb/>
their titles that appeared with Ocampo’s publishing house were critically acclaimed<lb/>
bestsellers, commercial successes, or the most adequate representations of their re-<lb/>
spective oeuvres. For these reasons, heightened marketing tactics might have been<lb/>
</p>
<pb n="181"/>
<p><lb/>necessary. Take, for instance, James Joyce’s only surviving play, Exiles, which was<lb/>
translated and published by Editorial Sur in 1937 as Desterrados. Unlike<lb/>
Ulysses or<lb/>
even The Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, Joyce’s Exiles is considered by many to<lb/>
be his least successful play and was hardly ever performed.<note n="47">Cor Hermans, Interbellum Literature. Writing in a Season of Nihilism (Leiden: Brill, 2017), 289.</note> When analyzing these<lb/>
examples, one might be tempted to argue that Ocampo had an eye toward the<lb/>
most accessible works—in terms of both the level of difficulty of the works them-<lb/>
selves and the ease of access to the rights for translation and publication—for her<lb/>
publishing firm. However, this is not the case since Editorial Sur published some<lb/>
of the first and only authorized Spanish translations of works of key twentieth-<lb/>
century writers, such as Virginia Woolf, William Faulkner, Graham Greene, Nor-<lb/>
man Mailer, Samuel Beckett, Albert Camus, and Aldous Huxley.<note n="48">Alongside these translated works, Editorial Sur published two of Jorge Luis Borges’s most important collections of short stories: El jardín de senderos que se bifurcan (1941) and Ficciones (1944).</note> And many of<lb/>
these authors’ translated and published works with Editorial Sur were their most<lb/>
notable, which is certainly what we saw with Aldous Huxley and Albert Camus.<lb/>
Another instance in which Editorial Sur heavily marketed a lesser-known<lb/>
work from a well-known author is with Graham Greene’s Un caso acabado (1961).<lb/>
Ocampo developed a close relationship with Greene after they first met in 1938<lb/>
and remained in his inner circle throughout her life.<note n="49">Wise and Hill note that Greene considered her “as one of his four best friends” (The Works of Graham Greene. Volume 2. A Guide to the Graham Greene Archives [London: Bloomsbury, 2015], 189).</note> Apart from his stays at<lb/>
her homes in Argentina, he dedicated his novel The Honorary Consul to her and<lb/>
she, in turn, published a total of sixteen of his books with Editorial Sur.<note n="50">The dedication to The Honorary Consul reads: “For Victoria Ocampo, with love and in memory of the many happy weeks I have passed at San Isidro and Mar del Plata.”</note> While<lb/>
a number of Greene’s novels reached the status of best-sellers, most notably The<lb/>
Heart of the Matter (1948), which Editorial Sur translated and published in 1949,<lb/>
Un caso acabado did not receive anywhere near the same amount of interest as<lb/>
his other works.<note n="51">“The Heart of the Matter was enormously popular, selling more than 300,000 copies in Britain. It was also a main selection of the Book-of-the-Month Club in America. Though Greene considered the book his most serious work to date, it brought him more money than all his previous entertainments combined” (Michael Sheldon, “Greene, (Henry) Graham,” Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, January 8, 2015, n.p.).</note> However, Ocampo promoted Greene’s<lb/>
Un caso acabado with a teaser chapter in the January 1961 issue of Sur, a full five months prior to its book-<lb/>
length publication with Editorial Sur.<note n="52">Héctor J. Puglia’s review of Un caso acabado (Sur 275 [1963]: 104–106) also marketed the novel from its very opening line: “Una nueva obra de Graham Greene es siempre una oportunidad para renovar el placer que produce la maestría de uno de los mejores narradores de la novelística actual” [A new work by Graham Greene is always an opportunity to rekindle the pleasure that the mastery of one of the best narrators of current collections of novels produces] (104). That said, Puglia concedes that the novel is “menos rica en matices y de contrucción menos rigurosa que las mejores obras de Greene” [less rich in nuances and constructed less rigorously than Greene’s best works] (Puglia, “Un caso acabado,” 106).</note> Even though this work was not as success-<lb/>
ful as his previous novels, it is possible that Ocampo relied on the cultural capital<lb/>
</p>
<pb n="182"/>
<p>
of his name, which she had already popularized through previous Editorial Sur<lb/>
translations of his best-selling works, to help promote and sell Un caso acabado.<lb/>
Finally, there is the question of author’s rights. Other writers and intellectu-<lb/>
als involved in the Argentine publishing industry have noted the difficulty and<lb/>
extremely high cost of acquiring authors’ rights, which might account for why<lb/>
Ocampo focused on promoting the works of authors for whom she had already<lb/>
secured the translation rights.<note n="53">Adolfo Bioy Casares recalled similar snags when working with Jorge Luis Borges on their “Séptimo Círculo” [Seventh Circle] collection with Emecé Editores in the 1940s: “el trabajo en la editorial nos asomó a los problemas de los derechos de autor, que hasta entonces habíamos ignorado. . . . Nos enteramos así de que algunas novelas que deseábamos incluir en El Séptimo Círculo no estaban libres” [our work in the publishing house showed us the problems of copyright that we had ignored up to that point. . . . We realized that some novels that we wanted to include in the Seventh Circle series were not free] (Adolfo Bioy Casares, Memorias: Infancia, adolescencia, y cómo se hace un escritor [Barcelona: Tusquets, 1994], 101).</note> Not only that, most of the Spanish-language edi-<lb/>
tions that she produced were the first and only authorized translations of these<lb/>
works, which made them all the more valuable. That is to say, Ocampo identified<lb/>
a number of the best international literary works earlier on in her career as a<lb/>
publisher and then proceeded to corner the market by acquiring the translation<lb/>
and publication rights for these titles. One of the ways in which Ocampo might<lb/>
have been able to skirt the issue of paying large sums of money to acquire au-<lb/>
thors’ rights was through her impressive networks of contacts. Her close friend-<lb/>
ships with Virginia Woolf, Igor Stravinsky, and Rabindranath Tagore are well<lb/>
known and these connections undoubtedly provided her with a great deal more<lb/>
publishing freedom and access than most Latin American editors of the time. In<lb/>
fact, her teaser publications of T. S. Eliot’s Sobre la poesía y los poetas and Cyril<lb/>
Connolly’s La tumba sin sosiego, both of which appeared in 1947 in the special<lb/>
quadruple issue of Sur dedicated to English literature, illustrated her impressive<lb/>
literary connections. In her introductory note to the entire issue, Ocampo alludes<lb/>
to her networks by stating that “la lista de agradecimientos, en lo que respecta a<lb/>
mis relaciones personales con Inglaterra, sería tan larga que no intentaré agotarla<lb/>
en este prólogo” [the list of acknowledgements, with regard to my personal rela-<lb/>
tions with England, would be so long that I won’t attempt to exhaust it in this<lb/>
prologue].<note n="54">Ocampo, “Introducción,” 9.</note> However, she still mentions several individuals by name who helped<lb/>
her fill the pages of the issues at hand. In particular, she notes her conversations<lb/>
with Connolly “sobre este número y sus hints me han sido preciosos” [about<lb/>
this issue and that his hints have been very valuable].<note n="55">Ocampo, “Introducción,” 8.</note> She also discusses Eliot’s<lb/>
foundational role in deciding on writers to include and the overall shape of the<lb/>
four-issue publication: “Yo quería saber lo que los ingleses pensaban de su propia<lb/>
literatura contemporánea y no cansaba de interrogarlos. . . . Así fué el propio T.<lb/>
S. Eliot quien eligió entre sus obras ¿Qué es un clásico? para este número de SUR”<lb/>
[I wanted to know what the English thought of their own contemporary literature<lb/>
and I didn’t tire of asking them. . . . Thus, it was T. S. Eliot himself who chose<lb/>
What is a Classic? from among his works for this issue of SUR].<note n="56">Ocampo, “Introducción,” 8. The version of Eliot’s “¿Qué es un clásico?” that appeared in Sur is notably different from the final published version in his Sobre la poesía y los poetas.</note><lb/>

<p>In a similar vein is the question of literary agents. Unlike other countries,<lb/>literary agents did not become a staple of the publishing industry in Latin Amer-<lb/>ica until the mid-twentieth century. One of the most well-known and successful<lb/>literary agents in Argentina during this time, who worked extensively with Oc-<lb/>ampo and Editorial Sur, was Lawrence Smith.<note n="57">Aside from Lawrence Smith, the only other two major literary agents in the Spanish-<lb/>speaking world during the twentieth century were Carmen Balcells and International Editors.</note> These individuals would benefit<lb/>financially from selling translation rights to publishing firms like Editorial Sur. In<lb/>particular, according to Smith himself, “It is inadvisable to sell translation rights<lb/>outright except in special cases. They should be paid for by a sum in advance<lb/>on royalties, or per edition published.”<note n="58">Lawrence Smith, “Translation Sales Down South,” <hi rend="italic">Publishers’ Weekly</hi>, September 13, 1941, 909.</note> Extant archival documents reveal that<lb/>Smith followed his own advice quite closely. More specifically, he helped facilitate<lb/>Ocampo’s acquisition, and ultimate publication, of works by William Faulkner,<lb/>Christopher Isherwood, George Orwell, H. G. Wells, and T. E. Lawrence for<lb/>Editorial Sur.<note n="59">The extant correspondence between Ocampo and Smith, currently housed at Villa<lb/>Ocampo in Argentina, mentions the following titles: William Faulkner’s <hi rend="italic">Light in August</hi>; Chris-<lb/>topher Isherwood’s <hi rend="italic">Goodbye to Berlin</hi>; George Orwell’s <hi rend="italic">Critical Essays</hi>; H. G. Wells’ <hi rend="italic">The Fate of</hi><lb/><hi rend="italic">Homo Sapiens</hi>; and <hi rend="italic">The Letters of T. E. Lawrence</hi>.</note> What is more, these same documents clearly stated the required<lb/>royalty payment of 5% of the sale price of any and all books. While these same<lb/>upfront costs and royalty payments might not have factored into every work that<lb/>Ocampo published with Editorial Sur, they help account for why the works of<lb/>certain authors—namely those with heftier price tags for the publisher—were<lb/>marketed more heavily than others. That is to say, Ocampo most likely would<lb/>not have wanted to lose exorbitant sums of money just to publish the work of<lb/>internationally acclaimed authors or of her close friends for that matter.<lb/>Regardless of the specific rationale for every teaser chapter that appeared<lb/>in <hi rend="italic">Sur</hi> prior to the release of its full-length book with Editorial Sur, what all of<lb/>these examples show is that Ocampo had a well-developed plan to popularize the<lb/>works of international writers not just in her literary journal, but also through her<lb/>publishing house. That is to say, taking a closer look at the teaser chapters that<lb/>appeared throughout Ocampo’s literary journal reveals her shrewd instincts for<lb/>identifying national and international authors whose literary works would inter-<lb/>est her readers and, as a result, sell well in their full-length book form. Moreover,<lb/>many of the titles that she selected to publish with Editorial Sur were the first<lb/>authorized Spanish translations of best sellers by well-known authors, such as<lb/>Albert Camus or Virginia Woolf, which resulted in large sales as is evident by<lb/>the fact that the first editions of these works were very often sold out within the<lb/>first few months of their publication. Even though Ocampo funneled a great deal<lb/>of her own money and resources into <hi rend="italic">Sur</hi> and Editorial Sur, she continued to<lb/>publish both the journal and books for nearly half a century, an impressive feat<lb/>made possible by her constant attention to the financial details of her literary<lb/>enterprise as well as her own personal mission to present readers with exemplary<lb/>works of international fiction and nonfiction.<lb/></p>
