Campden, Gloucestershire: <hi>Alcuin Press</hi>, 1932 [i.e., 1933]. [12] pp. Wrappers. Limited to 50 copies for the au-<lb/>\nthor. Reprinted (with a new title page) from <hi>The Colophon</hi> (D:1933, February), which had reprinted (with some added introductory paragraphs) the appen-<lb/>\ndix (pp. 141-46) to Carter’s edition of Browne’s <hi>Urne Buriall</hi> (B:1932). In the<lb/>\ncopy in my collection (inscribed “ex dono authoris 1933”), Carter changed the printed date “MCMXXXII” to “MCMXXXIII” and (another matter<lb/>\nof dating) revised the first line of page [7] by deleting “to be” and “shortly”<lb/>\nfrom the statement that his Browne edition was “to be published shortly.”<lb/>\nCf. D:1966 (Autumn) and C:2003 for a later essay with the same title (the first<lb/>\nfour words of which are a quotation from the last chapter of Urne Buriall).<lb/>\n</p>\n<p>A:1934<lb/>\n<hi>An Enquiry into the Nature of Certain Nineteenth Century Pamphlets</hi>.

Published 2 July 1934. 2000 copies printed,<lb/>\n700 of them for America. Copies intended for American distribution have<lb/>\n“$6.00” stamped at the top of the front dust-jacket flap. The four-page pro-<lb/>\nspectus, which indicates that the book can be ordered for 15s from Birrell<lb/>\n&amp; Garnett (where Pollard was a partner), states that the book “introduces<lb/>\nscientific methods which have never before been applied to bibliographi-<lb/>\ncal problems of this period.” For Carter’s later writings on the Wise-Forman<lb/>\nforgeries (some of them in collaboration with Graham Pollard), see especially<lb/>\n“<hi rend=\"bold\">Thomas J.
