Elwin wrote in his preface to the first volume, published in 1871, that<lb/>\nPope presented several of his manuscripts to the son of Jonathan Richardson, the portrait-<lb/>\npainter. . . . Richardson’s interlined copy of the first quarto volume of Pope’s poetry passed<lb/>\ninto the hands of Malone, and was ultimately bought by Mr. Croker. The manuscripts<lb/>\nwhich Richardson possessed in the handwriting of Pope were purchased by Dr. Chauncey,<lb/>\nand are still the property of his descendants.<lb/>\n<lb/>\n‘Richardson’s interlined copy of the first quarto volume of Pope’s poetry’ is<lb/>\nthe copy of the 1717 <hi>Works</hi> presented by Pope to Jonathan Richardson the elder,<lb/>\nbearing notes in Malone’s hand, which is now in the Berg Collection (Smith,<lb/>\n‘Alexander Pope’, 12). This copy was, as Elwin reports elsewhere, annotated by<lb/>\nRichardson the younger, but was evidently not included with the ‘first Editions<lb/>\ncorrected’ in the sale of 1776.<lb/>\nHaving been in Croker’s possession, it was no doubt among the materials of<lb/>\nCroker’s on which Elwin founded his work, and readings from it occur in<lb/>\nElwin’s first two volumes.<lb/>\nThere are points at which Elwin appears to be citing, and strangely<lb/>\nmisrepresenting, Pope’s manuscripts, when I suspect that he is actually working<lb/>\nfrom Richardson’s annotations.<lb/>\n<lb/>\nIn his introduction to the third volume of the Elwin–Courthope edition,<lb/>\nCourthope thanked Elwin ‘for his liberality in allowing me to use his transcript<lb/>\nof the Chauncy MS., which throws so much light on the meaning of Pope’s sat-<lb/>\nires’; he referred again, a few pages later, to ‘the transcript which Mr. Elwin has<lb/>\nmade from the Chauncy MS.’<lb/>\nThis form of words suggests that Courthope did not realize that the transcript<lb/>\nwhich Elwin had communicated to him included readings from multiple<lb/>\nmanuscripts.<lb/>\nThe first references to the ‘Chauncy MS.’ in the collations in this volume are in<lb/>\nthose to the <hi>Epistle to Bathurst</hi>, where its readings correspond to those of<lb/>\nHuntington HM 6007 and HM 6008 (Lot 487)<lb/>\n</p>\n<div type=\"footnotes\">\n<p>23. <hi>The Works of Alexander Pope</hi>, ed.

Of course, a book might in theory have been owned by Chauncy and then Malone if the latter had bought it at the Chauncy sale of 1790, of which he owned a catalogue — see <hi>A Catalogue of the Greater Portion of the Library of the Late Edmond Malone, Esq.</hi> (London: Sotheby, 1818), 12 (Lot 371) — but there was no 1717 <hi>Works of Pope</hi> in the Chauncy sale.<lb/>\n25. <hi>Works of Alexander Pope</hi>, ed.

See the discussions of some of these readings in Schmitz, <hi>Pope’s Windsor Forest</hi>, 13, and idem, <hi>Pope’s Essay on Criticism 1709</hi>, 22; Schmitz did not realize that Elwin was working from Richardson’s annotations rather than from the holograph, and therefore saw some of his readings as ‘incorrect to the point of curiosity’ (<hi>Pope’s Essay</hi>, 22).<lb/>\n27. <hi>Works of Alexander Pope</hi>, ed.

Vander Meulen, <hi>Pope’s Dunciad of 1728</hi>, 43 proposes that Courthope’s ‘MS.’ is ‘probably to be construed as plural’, but a simple misunderstanding on Courthope’s part seems likelier.<lb/>\n</p>\n</div>",
