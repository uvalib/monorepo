In the copy Carter presented to John Hayward, Carter wrote, “The notes for this catalogue were put together in haste, & I am not proud of them. The format is a disgrace to the Scribner press, & I am ashamed of it. But some of the contents are, I think, rather nice, though it’s too deliberately mixed a bag to be of more than ephemeral interest. Please do not show it to anyone in or near the trade” (quoted from Rota catalogue 290 [1999], item 99).<lb/>B:1953<lb/><hi>Rare Books in Science and Thought, 1490-1940</hi>.
