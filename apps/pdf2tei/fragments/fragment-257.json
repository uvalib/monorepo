There follows one of the most ambiguous and conflicted passages in the<lb/>\nvolume:<lb/>\nI never experienced more milk and water treatment in my life. I advertised my entertainment however and was tolerably attended. . . . I sincerely believe, had it not been for the<lb/>\ninterference of a friend, I must have used the word intolerably. To this gentleman,<lb/>\nwho is no other than T. S. Esq.[,] I shall beg leave to say, that if he meant his friendship<lb/>\nand attention to my interest should finish where it apparently has— God forbid I<lb/>\nshould load him with more trouble than he is willing to suffer! So far from it—I here,<lb/>\nin the face of the world, acquit him of any intentions in relation to me, but those of<lb/>\nserving, obliging, and pleasing me; and should it so happen that neither upon paper,<lb/>\nnor any other way, we again exchange a single word, my wishes towards him are, may<lb/>\nhe enjoy a long life of health, happiness, and prosperity! And I hope he retains so<lb/>\nmuch of his former good wishes for me, as to return an equal portion of esteem, with<lb/>\nequal sincerity. (91)<lb/>\nReaders are expected to recall that the first eleven letters of the MT had been addressed “To T. S. Esq.” Dibdin later chose to reveal the identity of this individual,<lb/>\nfor in his <hi>Professional Life</hi> he states: “The name of Theophilus Swift, Esq. will be<lb/>\nseen at the head of some of the poetry. . . . To this gentleman I addressed a few<lb/>\nletters in my original Tour.”7 Swift (1746–1815), whose parents were both cousins<lb/>\nof Jonathan Swift, the author of <hi>Gulliver’s Travels</hi>, was an eccentric Irish barrister.<lb/>\nThe fullest contemporary description describes him as “an excellent classic [sic]<lb/>\nscholar, and versed likewise in modern literature and belles lettres. . . . [He was]<lb/>\na sincere, kind-hearted man; but . . . at the same time, the most visionary of created beings. He saw every thing whimsically—many things erroneously—and<lb/>\nnothing like another person.”8 Swift had just commenced a literary career by<lb/>\npublishing a lengthy poem, <hi>The Temple of Folly</hi>. It is not clear when or where he<lb/>\nand Dibdin first became connected, but it was sometime prior to this consequential meeting in Worcester, as a cryptic clue inserted into the MT indicates. In a<lb/>\nletter to Swift of 16 October 1787, Dibdin writes: “You may remember, in a letter<lb/>\nwritten to me some time ago, you wondered at my advertising my entertainment<lb/>\nat Birmingham” (25). Dibdin performed at Birmingham in between his two visits<lb/>\nto Worcester. The reference to the earlier letter suggests that Swift was probably<lb/>\nnot at Worcester when Dibdin first visited, or he would hardly have needed to<lb/>\n</p>\n<note n=\"6\" place=\"foot\">I am much indebted to Richard Foster, the Fellows’ Librarian, Winchester College, for<lb/>\nallowing me access to the manuscript, for his generous hospitality when I visited Winchester,<lb/>\nand for the information that the manuscript was donated to the College in the 1830s or 1840s<lb/>\nby the Rev. Peter Hall (1803–49), a prolific collector of books and manuscripts and a former<lb/>\nWinchester student. The records show that the manuscript was bound when first acquired by<lb/>\nthe College, though it was subsequently rebound in the twentieth century. The history of the<lb/>\nmanuscript before Hall acquired it, presumably no earlier than the 1820s, is unknown, but it<lb/>\nseems likely that Dibdin’s printer, Joseph Gales, made the original decision to bind together<lb/>\nthe letters that constitute it.</note>\n<note n=\"7\" place=\"foot\">Dibdin, <hi>Professional Life</hi>, 3:7.</note>\n<note n=\"8\" place=\"foot\"><hi>Sir Jonah Barrington</hi>, <hi>Personal Sketches of His Own Times</hi>, 2 vols.
