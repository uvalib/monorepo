  "tei": "<pb n=\"225\"/>\n<p>\nvolume begins with An Essay on Man.<note n=\"14\">The volume was sold at Sotheby’s on 10 February 1971, to Charles Traylen, an English<lb/>bookdealer acting ultimately for Yale University Library, but its export was, controversially,<lb/>prevented: see Peter Hopkirk, ‘Dispute over plans to export Pope manuscript [sic]’, The Times,<lb/>15 January 1971, 3, and subsequent letters to The Times by Peter Eaton (2 February 1971, 15),<lb/>Charles Traylen (10 February 1971, 13), and P. J. Korshin (24 March 1971, 15). Its British Mu-<lb/>seum accession stamp is dated 30 September 1971.<lb/></note><lb/>\nIt has not previously been identified as a<lb/>\nRichardson–Chauncy book. The second volume, ‘The Essay on Man, with ...<lb/>\nerrata in first edition’, must be ‘the volume now in the Berg collection [79-432]<lb/>\nthat contained among other Pope material a copy of the Essay on Man and the<lb/>\nmanuscript of the First Satire of the Second Book of Horace’, for this copy, annotated<lb/>\nin a hand or hands other than Pope’s, has Chauncy ownership inscriptions, and<lb/>\nwas, as we shall see, with the other Richardson–Chauncy books when Elwin<lb/>\ncollated it.<note n=\"15\">Vander Meulen, Pope’s Dunciad of 1728, 42; the manuscript is Smith, ‘Alexander<lb/>Pope’, PoA 181.<lb/></note><lb/>\n478 The Dunciad, first edition, large paper, frontispiece, filled with MS. Notes<lb/>\nand corrections from the first Broglio MS. by Mr. Pope himself, uncut | 8vo. Dublin,<lb/>\n1728<lb/>\n₤13 to Thompson. This is the 1728 Dunciad, actually annotated by Jonathan<lb/>\nRichardson rather than by ‘Mr. Pope himself ’, which is now in the Berg collec-<lb/>\ntion of the New York Public Library (Smith, ‘Alexander Pope’, entry PoA 32),<lb/>\nand was reproduced in facsimile with commentary by David Vander Meulen in<lb/>\n1991. Vander Meulen notes that this copy and the other two Dunciads listed here<lb/>\nall have the manuscript date 1777 on their title pages, which ‘seems to indicate<lb/>\nthat in that year they were part of a single collection, probably that of Dr. Charles<lb/>\nChauncy ... or his brother and heir Nathaniel. . . . But then parts of the trail<lb/>\nbecome obscure’.<note n=\"16\">Vander Meulen, Pope’s Dunciad of 1728, 42.<lb/></note><lb/>\nWe can now be confident that all three Dunciads were Rich-<lb/>\nardson–Chauncy books; that the collection was still Charles’s until the end of<lb/>\n1777 (he died on 25 December but his will was not proved until 1778); and that<lb/>\nthey remained in the family until 1887, when they were sold as Lots 478, 479,<lb/>\nand 480. Thompson bought six other lots in the 1887 sale; the six others all went<lb/>\nto the library of William Nassau Lees, sold in 1889; this is therefore doubtless the<lb/>\nannotated Dunciad which was Lot 75 in Nassau Lees’ sale, described by Smith<lb/>\n(‘Alexander Pope’, 2) as unlocated. It is, by the way, an odd coincidence that just<lb/>\nas Charles Chauncy bought the Richardson manuscripts of Pope in April 1776<lb/>\nand died twenty months later, in December 1777, so Nassau Lees bought them<lb/>\nin July 1887 and died twenty months later, in March 1889.<lb/>\n479 The Dunciad. Another copy, large paper, frontispiece, with MS. corrections,<lb/>\ncopied from Pope’s copy by Jonathan Richardson junr. uncut | 8vo. ib. 1728<lb/>\n₤7 7s. to Colonel (Francis) Grant. This is the 1728 Dunciad now at the Huntington<lb/>\nLibrary, 106517 (Smith, ‘Alexander Pope’, PoA 34), which was bought by B. F.<lb/>\nStevens at Grant’s sale, was in the library of Robert Hoe by 1905, and was bought<lb/>\nby Huntington at the Hoe sale in 1912; Vander Meulen remarks of this and the<lb/>\n</p>",
