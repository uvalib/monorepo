Sir <hi>Anthony Wagner</hi> in his study<lb/>\nof the arms of outstanding figures from the history of the <hi>United Kingdom</hi> names<lb/>\nPope as one of those who were not armigerous, but he also points to <hi>Joshua Reynolds</hi><lb/>\nand <hi>John Locke</hi> as among those who used arms ‘but without apparent<lb/>\nright.’52 Pope used them, I suspect, only in the specific context of this poem, and<lb/>\nit may not have mattered to him at all that they were not ratified by a College<lb/>\nthat served a regime he did not respect. In so advertising his family, Pope may<lb/>\nhave recollected the introduction by <hi>Caleb D’Anvers</hi> to his family history in<lb/>\n<hi>Craftsman</hi> 28 (13 March 1727): ‘Though it is generally esteem’d an indecent, as<lb/>\nwell as an invidious <hi rend=\"bold\">Task</hi>, for a Man to mention himself, or extol his own Fam-<lb/>\nily; yet in some Cases it becomes not only excusable, but even praise-worthy;<lb/>\nespecially when it is made necessary for our Self-defence’. D’Anvers goes on to<lb/>\nassociate his family’s place in ‘<hi>Books of Heraldry</hi>’ with a patriotism ‘exposed to<lb/>\n‘Obloquy and Reproach’.53<lb/>\n<lb/>\nTo <hi>Arbuthnot</hi> clearly responds to the attacks on Pope by <hi>Lord Hervey</hi>, or Lady<lb/>\n<hi>Mary Wortley Montagu</hi>, or both, in <hi>Verses Address’d to the Imitator of Horace</hi> (March<lb/>\n1733) and by Hervey in <hi>An Epistle from a Nobleman to a Doctor of Divinity</hi> (November<lb/>\n1733). Pope says as much in the ‘<hi>Advertisement</hi>’ prefixed to the first edition; his<lb/>\nnotes to <hi>To Arbuthnot</hi> refer to the <hi>Verses</hi>; and a new edition of the <hi>Verses</hi> seems to<lb/>\nhave been printed especially to accompany <hi>To Arbuthnot</hi> in January 1735. The<lb/>\nheraldic image at the end of <hi>To Arbuthnot</hi> responds to a particular attack on him<lb/>\nin the <hi>Verses</hi>:<lb/>\n<quote>none thy crabbed Numbers can endure,<lb/>\nHard as thy Heart, and as thy Birth obscure.54</quote><lb/>\n<lb/>\nIn an ‘<hi>Advertisement</hi>’ prefixed to the first edition of <hi>An Epistle from Mr. Pope to<lb/>\nDr. Arbuthnot</hi> which was substantially repeated in the <hi>Works</hi> Pope says he had no<lb/>\nthought of publishing the poem till it pleas’d some Persons of Rank and Fortune to<lb/>\nattack in a very extraordinary manner, not only his Writings, but his Morals, Person, and<lb/>\nFamily: of which he therefore thought himself obliged to give some account.
