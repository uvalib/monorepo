Bridgham (1808\u0002013\u000201883) oversaw the moulding and casting opera-<lb/>\ntions in Boston Bewick\u001fs stereotype foundry.<lb/>\nHe had a long career in job print-<lb/>\ning, beginning around 1828 in Providence, RI.<lb/>\nHe first appears in Boston city directories in 1835 identified as a stereotype founder and then drops out of sight after the company closed down in 1836.<lb/>\nHe reappears in the 1840s as a printer,<lb/>\nfor a while successful enough to obtain a steam power press and exercise the right<lb/>\nto display his name in Boston imprints.<lb/>\nIn the 1850s he moved to Brooklyn and<lb/>\nmade his living as a reporter in the office of the Associated Press.<lb/>\nAfter just over ten years in journalism, he resumed the printing business, taking on small jobs<lb/>\nat various New York addresses until he died in 1883.<lb/>\nAn obituary indicates that he had been more than a mere journeyman and was <hi>“well-known”</hi> for his print-<lb/>\ning work in Boston.<lb/>\nHe was prominent enough to have taken out the copyright for one of Boston Bewick’s stereotype ventures.<lb/>\nAmong other achievements he published an engraved miniature facsimile of the Declaration very popular in its day.<lb/>\nIt reached a wide public in Boston and New York\u00026mdash;and may have even gone as far as England.<lb/>\nI believe it to be the source of the Sussex Declaration.<note n=\"9\" place=\"foot\">[Providence] <hi rend=\"italic\">Rhode-Island American</hi> (20 June 1828), 4; <hi rend=\"italic\">American Magazine of Useful and Entertaining Knowledge</hi> 1, no.\u000204 (December 1834), advertisements; [Boston] <hi rend=\"italic\">Daily Evening Transcript</hi> (29 July 1847), 2; Richard A.

Perhaps acting on his own account, Bridgham obtained the copyright for <hi rend=\"italic\">Worship God and Keep His Commandments</hi> (1835), an illustrated broadside “stereotyped and printed by the Boston Bewick Company.”</note></p>\n<div type=\"section\" n=\"3\">\n<head>III</head>\n<p>Dated 1836, the copyright statement in Bridgham’s facsimile contains his name,<lb/>\nbut otherwise it is difficult to determine what role he took in its design and pro-<lb/>\nduction.<lb/>\nPerhaps he had the idea to make a miniature facsimile, a tour de force<lb/>\nof lettering and engraving printed on coated paper, all the better to display the<lb/>\nprecision craftsmanship of the artists he employed.<lb/>\nHe probably knew about pre-<lb/>\nvious attempts to sell Declaration novelties in unusual formats such as prints on<lb/>\nsilk or satin and, most notably, a commemorative handkerchief priced at a dollar<lb/>\nin 1826.<lb/>\nOther types of pocket curiosities had already found a ready market in<lb/>\nAmerica\u00026mdash;portrait miniatures, miniature silver toys, and thumb Bibles, just to<lb/>\nmention a few examples.<lb/>\nBy catering to this fashion, he started a trend soon to<lb/>\nbe taken to an extreme by the Philadelphia bank note engraver Charles Toppan,<lb/>\nwho downsized the Declaration to fit inside a 2 by 3 inch card on coated stock,<lb/>\na promotional keepsake first issued in 1840.<note n=\"10\" place=\"foot\">In <hi rend=\"italic\">Congress, July 4th. 1776. The Unanimous Declaration of the Thirteen United States of America</hi>, Boston: L. H. Bridgham, 1836.
