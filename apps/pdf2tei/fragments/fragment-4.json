Carter had been reading Browne since his Eton days, and by the early 1930s he was on the trail of author-corrected copies of the first edition (as his letter to the <hi>Times Literary Supplement</hi> on 16 July 1931 shows), while he was working on a new edition, at the request of Desmond Flower (of Cassell’s).<lb/>\nHe was able to locate and use six such copies before his edition came out, only two of which had previously been known.<lb/>\nThe thoroughness of his work is symbolized by his annotated copy of Edward H. Marshall’s 1929 Mac-<lb/>\nmillan edition: its leaves, mounted on larger paper, were interleaved with blanks, which were covered with his notes reporting collations, references, and critical observations (described in G. F. Sims catalogue 102 [1979],<lb/>\nitem 85).<lb/>\nAs he noted in his introduction, he had collated all editions be-<lb/>\nfore 1800 and all published in Great Britain since then (though he does<lb/>\nnot mention collating multiple copies of the early editions).<lb/>\nCarter’s editorial approach was admirable. Because the successive<lb/>\nlifetime editions were unreliable, he based his text on the first edition<lb/>\nand reported all his departures from it (except the correction of turned,<lb/>\ndropped, or transposed letters), as well as the results of his collations.<lb/>\nAside from the adoption of Browne’s own corrections, the departures<lb/>\nwere few because he retained the punctuation and spelling of the first<lb/>\nedition (except the long s and the ”sporadic” use of v for u).<lb/>\nHe correctly recognized that Browne’s “use of commas and semicolons, like his use of initial capitals and italics is too much a part of himself and his period to submit to this wholesale modernization [of earlier editors].”<lb/>\nNevertheless he did make an “irreducible minimum of corrections where the com-<lb/>\npositor’s carelessness has produced intolerable obscurity.”<lb/>\nClearly there is room for disagreement here, for some of the obscurity may not have<lb/>\nbeen caused by the compositor, and in any case what is intolerable is a subjective matter.<lb/>\nBut critical editing necessarily entails judgment, and these alterations are all recorded<lb/>\nin the notes. The introduction ends with a gracious point not often made: although he has criticized earlier edi-<lb/>\ntions, he says, “one cannot begin to criticize an edition until one has used it thoroughly, so that criticism becomes almost a proof of obligation.”<lb/>\nOn 2 July 1934, less than two years after the Browne edition, Carter’s<lb/>\nthird major publication appeared—the one that made him a book-world<lb/>\n",
