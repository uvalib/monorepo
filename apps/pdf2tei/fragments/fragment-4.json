  "tei": "<pb n=\"4\"/>\n<p>\n<lb/>the Garden of Cyrus (originally published in 1658, with “Urne Buriall” as a\n<lb/>subtitle to “Hydriotaphia”). It was a lavish production, elegantly printed\n<lb/>by the Curwen Press and published (in an edition of 215 copies) by Cassell\n<lb/>&amp; Company with thirty drawings by Paul Nash (printed by collotype and\n<lb/>colored by pochoir) and a morocco and vellum binding designed by him.\n<lb/>This handsome book is regularly regarded as one of the masterpieces of\n<lb/>twentieth-century book production—as, for example, in Martin Hutner\n<lb/>and Jerry Kelly’s A Century for a Century (Grolier Club, 1999). But the work\n<lb/>also makes a scholarly contribution to the study of Browne. Carter had\n<lb/>been reading Browne since his Eton days, and by the early 1930s he was\n<lb/>on the trail of author-corrected copies of the first edition (as his letter to\n<lb/>the Times Literary Supplement on 16 July 1931 shows), while he was working\n<lb/>on a new edition, at the request of Desmond Flower (of Cassell’s). He was\n<lb/>able to locate and use six such copies before his edition came out, only\n<lb/>two of which had previously been known. The thoroughness of his work\n<lb/>is symbolized by his annotated copy of Edward H. Marshall’s 1929 Mac-\n<lb/>millan edition: its leaves, mounted on larger paper, were interleaved with\n<lb/>blanks, which were covered with his notes reporting collations, references,\n<lb/>and critical observations (described in G. F. Sims catalogue 102 [1979],\n<lb/>item&nbsp;85). As he noted in his introduction, he had collated all editions be-\n<lb/>fore 1800 and all published in Great Britain since then (though he does\n<lb/>not mention collating multiple copies of the early editions).\n<lb/>Carter’s editorial approach was admirable. Because the successive\n<lb/>lifetime editions were unreliable, he based his text on the first edition\n<lb/>and reported all his departures from it (except the correction of turned,\n<lb/>dropped, or transposed letters), as well as the results of his collations.\n<lb/>Aside from the adoption of Browne’s own corrections, the departures\n<lb/>were few because he retained the punctuation and spelling of the first\n<lb/>edition (except the long s and the “sporadic” use of v for u). He correctly\n<lb/>recognized that Browne’s “use of commas and semicolons, like his use of\n<lb/>initial capitals and italics is too much a part of himself and his period to\n<lb/>submit to this wholesale modernization [of earlier editors].” Nevertheless\n<lb/>he did make an “irreducible minimum of corrections where the com-\n<lb/>positor’s carelessness has produced intolerable obscurity.” Clearly there\n<lb/>is room for disagreement here, for some of the obscurity may not have\n<lb/>been caused by the compositor, and in any case what is intolerable is a\n<lb/>subjective matter. But critical editing necessarily entails judgment, and\n<lb/>these alterations are all recorded in the notes. The introduction ends with\n<lb/>a gracious point not often made: although he has criticized earlier edi-\n<lb/>tions, he says, “one cannot begin to criticize an edition until one has used\n<lb/>it thoroughly, so that criticism becomes almost a proof of obligation.”\n<lb/>On 2 July 1934, less than two years after the Browne edition, Carter’s\n<lb/>third major publication appeared—the one that made him a book-world\n<lb/>\n</p>",
