It is not a rare name, in other words, and descendants of Wil-<lb/>liam Waynflete survive on both sides of the Atlantic. Someone other than Carter<lb/>could well have chosen to use “John Waynflete” in 1934. And it might not be a<lb/>pseudonym at all.<lb/><lb/>The collections of Carter’s papers in various libraries (Eton, King’s, Cam-<lb/>bridge University Library, Bodleian, and Lilly among them) do not seem to con-<lb/>tain anything relevant; Sebastian Carter, John’s nephew, knows nothing about<lb/>the novel; and Michael Meredith tells me that it was not among Carter’s copies<lb/>of his own books at the time of his death. Carter’s authorship of it has not been<lb/>proved or disproved. The question comes down to how one evaluates the likeli-<lb/>hood that anyone other than Carter could have used “John Waynflete” versus<lb/>the likelihood that Carter could have written something, even as a parody, with<lb/>the style and content of this novel. Unless there is evidence that I am not aware<lb/>of, I think it seems reasonable to say that the arguments against John Carter’s<lb/>authorship of The Fall of the Titan are stronger than those supporting it.",
