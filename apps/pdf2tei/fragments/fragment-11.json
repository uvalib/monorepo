Mr. Haber, as students of his writings must by now be well<lb/>\naware, is afflicted with no such humility. This puts him at an advantage in the protracted<lb/>\ncontroversy into which I have been, most reluctantly, drawn. But I am not<lb/>\nsure that the advantage is shared by the poet and his readers, whom each of us is<lb/>\ntrying in his own way to serve.<lb/>\n</p>\n<p>Haber’s Complete Poems was withdrawn after several impressions (following the English publisher’s insistence that it was unauthorized), and the<lb/>\ndebate over The Collected Poems finally ended almost a decade later, when<lb/>\nWhite reported (11 January 1968) only three “trifling errors” in the latest<lb/>\nimpression (the correction of which he acknowledged on 1 October 1971).<lb/>\nBut since in the same issue (11 January 1968) Haber pursued his feud<lb/>\nwith Sparrow, Carter could not resist one more sarcastic retort (14 March<lb/>\n1968). Reacting to Haber’s account of first looking into the manuscripts,<lb/>\nCarter says, “It is as if stout Cortes had beheld the Pacific for the first<lb/>\ntime (except that Cortes, if Keats is to be believed, was silent).” And in the<lb/>\nsame letter Carter calls White “that indefatigable vigilante of Housman’s<lb/>\ntext.” The condescending tone was inappropriate, for Carter should himself have been such a vigilante, having accepted the task of editing these<lb/>\npoems. Nevertheless, his 1939 edition gave readers convenient access to<lb/>\nthe body of Housman’s poetry for the first time; and, in its successive revisions,<lb/>\nit remained the standard text for many decades.<lb/>\n</p>\n<p>Aside from his various book publications of the 1930s, Carter made<lb/>\nimportant contributions to the book world during these years through his<lb/>\njournalism and his participation in other activities that promoted communication<lb/>\namong members of that world. His first book-related journalism appeared in <hi>Publishers’ Weekly</hi>, as a result of his having become<lb/>\nacquainted with its editor, Frederick G. Melcher, during his first trip to<lb/>\nNew York in 1929. At that time <hi>Publishers’ Weekly</hi> was a crucial journal<lb/>\nfor the antiquarian-book world as well as the new-book world through its<lb/>\ninclusion of a department called “Old and Rare Books,” which provided<lb/>\nsubstantial articles and reviews along with columns by Frederick M. Hopkins<lb/>\n(“Rare Book Notes”) and Jacob Blanck (“News from the Rare Book<lb/>\nShops”). Carter became a regular contributor, producing nearly seventy<lb/>\npieces (articles, reviews, letters) from 1930 through 1947, at which time<lb/>\nthe function of the rare-book section was taken over by a new periodical,<lb/>\n<hi>Antiquarian Bookman</hi>.
