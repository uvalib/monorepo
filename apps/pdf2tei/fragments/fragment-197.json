It is highly likely that while Burlington was helping Pope<lb/>\nprotect himself from prosecution, Kent was illustrating his book. A letter from<lb/>\nthe same period suggests that the Burlingtons had pre-publication knowledge<lb/>\nof the frontispiece, Pope interpreting it as a representation not of the King but<lb/>\nof himself: ‘I beg my Lady Burlington’s Patronage of the Ass &amp; the <hi>Dunciad</hi>,<lb/>\nme and my burden.’25 When the three lords (Burlington, Oxford, and Bathurst)<lb/>\nprotected Pope by temporarily buying the copyright to the <hi>Dunciad Variorum</hi>, a later as-<lb/>\nsignment makes it clear that Burlington was the leading figure, while Kent was<lb/>\none of the witnesses.26<lb/>\nIn the centre of the <hi>Dunciad Variorum</hi> headpiece, later used in the <hi>Works</hi>,<lb/>\nwhere an action of the Odyssey might be depicted, is the head of an owl, crowned<lb/>\nwith a jester’s cap; his supporters are two asses; the foliage that customarily links<lb/>\nthe design consists of thistles. J. Paul Hunter points to the proximity of the asses’<lb/>\nears to the ‘Ear of Kings’ in the <hi>Dunciad Variorum</hi> just below the headpiece, in the<lb/>\nsecond line of the poem. A multivalent indication of Pope’s attitude lies in the<lb/>\nmotto ‘<hi>Nemo me impune lacessit</hi>’: no one attacks me with impunity. The motto<lb/>\nis that of the Order of the Thistle. Pope had shown an interest in the thistle<lb/>\nas a symbol in his first Pastoral, in a riddle that marked the union of Scotland<lb/>\nand England, the thistle having replaced the French lily in the first and fourth<lb/>\nquarters of the national shield.27 Pope’s riddle was possibly designed to honour<lb/>\nQueen Anne, who had revived the Order of the Thistle in 1703, but she was<lb/>\nonly repeating the more significant revival of her father, James II of England<lb/>\nand VII of Scotland, in 1687. This was inescapably a Scottish and, in origin, a<lb/>\nStuart order. Mengel notes the suitability of the thistle as an emblem for satire<lb/>\nand suggests possible connection with ideas of Scottish stupidity, but the motto<lb/>\nfits as uncomfortably with George II as it does with the owl dunce, both of<lb/>\nwhom were being attacked with impunity. Pope claimed in the <hi>Works</hi> that the<lb/>\n<hi>Dunciad Variorum</hi> had been presented to the King: ‘We are willing to acquaint<lb/>\nposterity that this Poem (as it here stands) was presented to King George the<lb/>\nSecond and his Queen, by the hands of Sir R. Walpole, on the 12th of March<lb/>\n1728/9’ (<hi>Works II, Dunciad</hi>, 87). William Kupersmith points to Erasmus ‘<hi>Similes habent labra lactusas</hi>’, which is equivalent to the English ‘A thistle is a fat<lb/>\nsalad for an ass’s mouth’.28 A bad patron (including the King) and bad writers<lb/>\ngo together.</p>\n<note place=\"foot\" n=\"25\">Correspondence, 1:532–3 and 2:4.</note>\n<note place=\"foot\" n=\"26\">BL MS Egerton 1951, f. 7; Rogers, Major Satires, 116. Pope had himself assigned the copy to Lords Burlington, Oxford, and Bathurst.
