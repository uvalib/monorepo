Namely, the 1825 Trist<lb/>\ncatalog is an eclectic text, comprising the entries in Jefferson’s lost 1824 list (itself<lb/>\nan expanded and revised copy of the Trist 1823 catalog), but omitting books that<lb/>\nhad been ordered from Bohn by Gilmer and listed in Kean’s 1825 catalog.<sup>62</sup> Evidence for this filiation via selective recopying and methodical omission abounds.<lb/>\nFigures 11 and 12 collate corresponding entries in the second subject chapter.<lb/>\nThe theorized pattern of hybrid and selective copying that produced the 1825 Trist<lb/>\ncatalog can be expressed formulaically. That is, if n = the contents of the 1825 Trist catalog,<lb/>\ni = the contents of the lost 1824 catalog, and z = the contents of the 1825 John Vaughn Kean<lb/>\ncatalog, then n = i – z.</p>\n<figure>\n  <head>Figure 11</head>\n  <figDesc>Page 5 of the 1823 Trist catalog showing the first six entries of Chapter 2, <hi>Modern History, Foreign</hi>.
