S. Williams’ reply has not survived, in Brontë’s correspondence with the firm later that month about their “objections” to the first chapter, she wanted to know in particular their reasons for requesting a change: “I should like you to explain to me more fully the ground of your objections—is it because you think this chapter will render the work liable to severe handling by the press? Is it because knowing as you now do the identity of ‘Currer Bell’—this scene strikes you as unfeminine—? Is it because it is intrinsically defective and inferior—? I am afraid the first two reasons would not weigh with me—the last would.”137<lb/></p>\n<p>Apparently, Brontë soon afterward received a reply from Williams that, in her words, was “calculated to command careful consideration.”138<lb/>It seems that Williams and Taylor had advised her to “give up Malone and Donne”—two curates who undergo satirical treatment in the published version of the novel, but who may have been subject to even harsher treatment in an earlier version, given that her publishers apparently had told her that the chapter pushed the boundaries of good taste and “artistic treatment.”<lb/></p>\n<div type=\"footnotes\">\n<note n=\"134\">On August 21, 1849, Brontë writes to W. S. Williams: “If I remember rightly my Cornhill critics object to ‘Hollow’s Mill,’ nor do I now find it appropriate. It might rather be called ‘Fieldhead’—though, I think ‘Shirley’ would perhaps be the best title: ‘Shirley,’ I fancy, has turned out the most prominent and peculiar character in the work. Cornhill may decide between ‘Fieldhead’ and ‘Shirley.’” See Letters, 2:237. Brontë did refer to the manuscript as ‘Shirley’ in a communication sent on March 1, 1849 to James Taylor; notably, this was after she sent the first draft (and presumably the prior title of ‘Hollow’s Mill’) to Smith, Elder on February 4, 1849. See Letters, 2:188.<lb/></note>\n<note n=\"135\">The leaf numbering for the first chapter is likely not part of the “A” and “B” sequences described but was introduced during a later pencil-and-ink revision (as with the brown-ink “D” sequence).<lb/></note>\n<note n=\"136\">Letters, 2:176.<lb/></note>\n<note n=\"137\">Letters, 2:181.<lb/></note>\n<note n=\"138\">Letters, 2:185.<lb/></note>\n</div>",
