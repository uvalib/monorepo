<p><hi rend="dropcap">J</hi>ohn carter was one of the most prominent and significant <lb/>
figures in the Anglo-American book world in the twentieth <lb/>
century. Indeed, he held a unique position, for he distinguished <lb/>
himself as a bookseller, a collector, a scholar, and a writer, equally <lb/>
at home and equally recognized on both sides of the Atlantic. <lb/>
He created innovative rare-book catalogues for the Scribner Book Store; <lb/>
formed several notable collections, especially of Catullus and Housman; <lb/>
was a pioneer investigator of the bibliographical problems of nineteenth-<lb/>
century publishers’ bindings; performed (with Graham Pollard) a classic <lb/>
piece of bibliographical detection in uncovering the Wise-Forman forger-<lb/>
ies; produced a scholarly edition of Sir Thomas Browne’s <lb/>
Urne Buriall and <lb/>
the Garden of Cyrus; and wrote (or co-wrote or co-edited) several celebrated <lb/>
works—An Enquiry into the Nature of Certain Nineteenth Century Pamphlets <lb/>
(1934), Taste and Technique in Book-Collecting <lb/>
(1948), ABC for Book-Collectors <lb/>
(1952), and Printing and the Mind of Man (1967).<lb/></p>
<p>A record of his published writings is obviously a basic guide to his ac-<lb/>
complishment. But such a record is also desirable for another reason that <lb/>
would not apply to many people: nearly every piece he wrote, no matter <lb/>
how small (including brief reviews and letters to editors), is worth reading <lb/>
for its style and wit. I am therefore presenting here a handlist (following in <lb/>
Carter’s tradition of handlist-writing) that will enable readers to find these <lb/>
pieces. Carter published so prolifically (some 1500 items are known) in such <lb/>
a wide array of venues that there are bound to be many items I have missed, <lb/>
especially among his letters to editors. But what is here is a comprehensive <lb/>
nucleus to which additions can be made. As Carter said in his handlist of <lb/>
Stanley Morison, it is “intended to serve as a series of signposts now and as <lb/>
a basis for amplification, correction and addition in the future.”<lb/></p>
<p>As an introduction to the handlist, I shall attempt a brief assessment of <lb/>
Carter’s achievement, which is a by-product of the overview provided by <lb/>
the handlist. It is inevitably biographical to some extent; but the empha-<lb/>
sis is on Carter’s writings, not his life, because a book-length biography <lb/>
already exists: Donald C. Dickinson’s John Carter: The Taste and Technique of <lb/></p>
<pb n="2"/>
<p>
<a> a Bookman (2004). The biographical details selected for mention here and<lb/>
 in the handlist (many of which do not appear in the Dickinson book) are<lb/>
 those that seem to me most relevant for understanding the background<lb/>
 and context of his writings and his wide influence. I knew John Carter for<lb/>
 only the last ten years of his life: some of my recollections were written<lb/>
 up in section 36 of my memoir, “The Living Room” (published in vol-<lb/>
 ume 59 of <hi rend="italic">Studies in Bibliography</hi> and then in <hi rend="italic">Books in My Life</hi>, 2021), and<lb/>
 I dedicated my book about book-jackets to his memory. I shall not forget<lb/>
 the many kindnesses he showed me and the important favors he did for<lb/>
 me, and the present offering is a reflection of my gratitude.<lb/>

<head><hi rend="smallcaps">ASSESSMENT</hi></head><lb/>
<head>The<lb/>1930s</head><lb/>
<p>
John Carter’s first post-collegiate publication on a bookish subject, an<lb/>
 article on “Original Condition” in the 15 November 1930 issue of<lb/>
 <hi rend="italic">Publishers’ Weekly</hi>, came only three years after college and inaugurated an amaz-<lb/>
 ing four-year period of brilliant productivity. Born John Waynflete Carter<lb/>
 at Eton on 10 May 1905, he was educated at Eton and King’s College<lb/>
 Cambridge, where he achieved a double first in the classical tripos and<lb/>
 an honors degree in 1927. By that time he was already collecting Catullus<lb/>
 and had become interested in textual criticism through the influence of A.<lb/>
 E. Housman’s lectures. Almost immediately after leaving Cambridge he<lb/>
 was hired (in September 1927) by the London office of Charles Scribner’s<lb/>
 Sons to locate rare books to be sold in their New York shop. In the three<lb/>
 years between then and that 1930 article, he was becoming acquainted<lb/>
 with the book dealers and collectors both in Britain and in America (his<lb/>
 first visit to New York being January to April 1929). But he was clearly do-<lb/>
 ing more, for his first three letters to the <hi rend="italic">Times Literary Supplement</hi><lb/>
 (in 1931-<lb/>
 33) show that by then he was already immersed in research on Sir Thomas<lb/>
 Browne, publishers’ bindings, and the pamphlets that became known as<lb/>
 the Wise-Forman forgeries—the subjects of his first major publications<lb/>
 (and of his early articles for the main book-collecting journals of the time,<lb/>
 <hi rend="italic">The Book Collector’s Quarterly</hi> in England and <hi rend="italic">The Colophon</hi> in America).<lb/>
</p>
<p>
In May 1932 he published <hi rend="italic">Binding Variants in English Publishing, 1820-</hi><lb/>
 1900 as the sixth volume in Michael Sadleir’s important <hi rend="italic">Bibliographia</hi> se-<lb/>
 ries, which had the significant subtitle “Studies in Book History and Book<lb/>
 Structure” (where “structure” makes clear the interest in bibliographical<lb/>
 analysis). Sadleir, a publisher (Constable was his firm), novelist, and col-<lb/>
 lector, had already established himself (he was sixteen and a half years<lb/>
 older than Carter) as a bibliographical scholar and a pioneer historian<lb/>
 of publishers’ bindings. He had published a bibliography of Trollope in<lb/>
 1928 (a landmark through its explicit demonstration that an author bibli-<lb/>
</p></a></p>
<pb n="3"/>
<lb/>ography can be a contribution to the history of publishing); and two years<lb/>later The Evolution of Publishers’ Bindings Styles, 1770-1900 came out as the<lb/>first volume in his Bibliographia series. Carter’s admiration for Sadleir<lb/>is suggested by a letter he wrote to The Times on 20 December 1957 to<lb/>supplement The Times’s obituary of Sadleir: “None of those who moved<lb/>in his orbit . . . was ever made to feel a satellite. But in our corner of the<lb/>sky a star has fallen.” An “avowed disciple” of Sadleir (as he called himself<lb/>in a 1970 article), Carter had been following Sadleir’s lead in investigat-<lb/>ing edition binding; and he had published articles on the subject in 1931<lb/>and 1932 that he was able to incorporate into his 1932 book. In the first<lb/>chapter of that book, he modestly called it “a rather swollen appendix” to<lb/>Sadleir’s book, but it is much more than that in several ways.<lb/>First, the chapter called “Historical,” though it is a condensed ac-<lb/>count of the beginnings and early use of cloth for bindings, draws on his<lb/>own original research in publishers’ catalogues and trade journals. Sec-<lb/>ond, the bulk of the first half is a detailed account of how to go about in-<lb/>vestigating the bindings of nineteenth-century books and determining the<lb/>order of variant bindings. He touches on the use of publishers’ records<lb/>and catalogues, review copies, inscriptions, inserted advertisements, end-<lb/>papers, and edge treatments, among much else, and he deals with such<lb/>topics as special bindings, series variants, and bindings-up of parts, along<lb/>with the description of cloth grains. The first half of the book (“General”),<lb/>which also includes a “specimen investigation,” provides a “method of<lb/>attack” that is then applied in the second half (“Particular”) to numerous<lb/>books by some five dozen authors. This extensive survey of examples,<lb/>based on the examination of an impressive number of copies, is yet an-<lb/>other contribution of the book, making it useful for reference—and in<lb/>the process displaying Carter’s cautious and undogmatic way of reaching<lb/>conclusions.<lb/>The book is addressed to “students and amateurs of book-structure”<lb/>(p. xi), and Carter is concerned throughout to advance bibliographical<lb/>study. He hopes to show “what an immensely important part of bibliog-<lb/>raphy they [binding variants] become when they are taken seriously,” and<lb/>he wants to help “develop a scientific method on general lines for dealing<lb/>with so frequent a phenomenon” (p. 6). He makes clear that “the attitude<lb/>of mind most desirable in a bibliographer is suspicion” (p. 39), and he<lb/>stresses the necessity for examining multiple copies. His more specific<lb/>observations on analyzing bindings form a perfect set of instructions for<lb/>the beginner on how best to approach a nineteenth-century book: they<lb/>have not been superseded, nor have they been stated in more attractive<lb/>prose. Of the several pioneer studies of publishers’ bindings by Carter and<lb/>Sadleir, this one is the most continuingly useful, still valuable as a guide.<lb/>A few months after Binding Variants, another of Carter’s major pub-<lb/>lications came out: his edition of Sir Thomas Browne’s Urne Buriall and<lb/>
<pb n="4"/>
<p>the Garden of Cyrus (originally published in 1658, with “Urne Buriall” as a<lb/>
subtitle to “Hydriotaphia”). It was a lavish production, elegantly printed<lb/>
by the Curwen Press and published (in an edition of 215 copies) by Cassell<lb/>
&amp; Company with thirty drawings by Paul Nash (printed by collotype and<lb/>
colored by pochoir) and a morocco and vellum binding designed by him.<lb/>
This handsome book is regularly regarded as one of the masterpieces of<lb/>
twentieth-century book production—as, for example, in Martin Hutner<lb/>
and Jerry Kelly’s A Century for a Century (Grolier Club, 1999). But the work<lb/>
also makes a scholarly contribution to the study of Browne. Carter had<lb/>
been reading Browne since his Eton days, and by the early 1930s he was<lb/>
on the trail of author-corrected copies of the first edition (as his letter to<lb/>
the Times Literary Supplement on 16 July 1931 shows), while he was working<lb/>
on a new edition, at the request of Desmond Flower (of Cassell’s). He was<lb/>
able to locate and use six such copies before his edition came out, only<lb/>
two of which had previously been known. The thoroughness of his work<lb/>
is symbolized by his annotated copy of Edward H. Marshall’s 1929 Mac-<lb/>
millan edition: its leaves, mounted on larger paper, were interleaved with<lb/>
blanks, which were covered with his notes reporting collations, references,<lb/>
and critical observations (described in G. F. Sims catalogue 102 [1979],<lb/>
item 85). As he noted in his introduction, he had collated all editions be-<lb/>
fore 1800 and all published in Great Britain since then (though he does<lb/>
not mention collating multiple copies of the early editions).<lb/></p>

<p>Carter’s editorial approach was admirable. Because the successive<lb/>
lifetime editions were unreliable, he based his text on the first edition<lb/>
and reported all his departures from it (except the correction of turned,<lb/>
dropped, or transposed letters), as well as the results of his collations.<lb/>
Aside from the adoption of Browne’s own corrections, the departures<lb/>
were few because he retained the punctuation and spelling of the first<lb/>
edition (except the long s and the ”sporadic” use of v for u). He correctly<lb/>
recognized that Browne’s “use of commas and semicolons, like his use of<lb/>
initial capitals and italics is too much a part of himself and his period to<lb/>
submit to this wholesale modernization [of earlier editors].” Nevertheless<lb/>
he did make an “irreducible minimum of corrections where the com-<lb/>
positor’s carelessness has produced intolerable obscurity.” Clearly there<lb/>
is room for disagreement here, for some of the obscurity may not have<lb/>
been caused by the compositor, and in any case what is intolerable is a<lb/>
subjective matter. But critical editing necessarily entails judgment, and<lb/>
these alterations are all recorded in the notes. The introduction ends with<lb/>
a gracious point not often made: although he has criticized earlier edi-<lb/>
tions, he says, “one cannot begin to criticize an edition until one has used<lb/>
it thoroughly, so that criticism becomes almost a proof of obligation.”<lb/></p>

<p>On 2 July 1934, less than two years after the Browne edition, Carter’s<lb/>
third major publication appeared—the one that made him a book-world<lb/></p>
<pb n="5"/>
<p>celebrity: <hi rend="italic">An Enquiry into the Nature of Certain Nineteenth Century Pamphlets</hi>,<lb/>
written in collaboration with Graham Pollard, a bookseller with the firm<lb/>
of Birrell &amp; Garnett. The story of how Carter and Pollard uncovered the<lb/>
Wise-Forman forgeries has been told often; indeed, it is one of the best-<lb/>
known episodes in bibliographical history, familiar to many people out-<lb/>
side the book world (as a result of such treatments as Richard D. Altick’s,<lb/>
in his 1950 book <hi rend="italic">The Scholar Adventurers</hi>, and Dwight Macdonald’s, in a<lb/>
1962 <hi rend="italic">New Yorker</hi> article, as well as Carter’s own accounts). Its wide appeal<lb/>
is understandable, as the story of two young booksellers who, through<lb/>
persistent research, were able to bring down a dominant and respected<lb/>
figure (for Thomas J. Wise was a distinguished collector and widely known<lb/>
book-world symbol, the author of many bibliographies, and a former<lb/>
president of the Bibliographical Society). It also has the elements of a de-<lb/>
tective story, with parts of a puzzle gradually, but inexorably, falling into<lb/>
place. And in the <hi rend="italic">Enquiry</hi>, given the panache of Carter’s prose, the story<lb/>
was given a presentation that increased its appeal.<lb/></p>

<p>Many of the people who are attracted to the story for all these reasons,<lb/>
however, do not recognize its important contribution to bibliographical<lb/>
scholarship. Identifying the perpetrators (which the book did not explic-<lb/>
itly do) is a different activity from proving that the pamphlets are indeed<lb/>
fraudulent. In the absence of explicit documents, the former involves<lb/>
circumstantial evidence, such as the fact that the suspected pamphlets<lb/>
entered the market from the stock of a single dealer (Herbert E. Gorfin).<lb/>
But the latter requires physical evidence from the items themselves. The<lb/>
use of such evidence for investigating books of earlier periods was well es-<lb/>
tablished by this time, but the bibliographical analysis of nineteenth- and<lb/>
twentieth-century books was in its infancy. The attention paid to “points”<lb/>
in modern books by collectors, dealers, and the writers of author bibliog-<lb/>
raphies was a form of physical examination, but it was often undisciplined<lb/>
and lacking in a concern for uncovering book-production history. Pub-<lb/>
lishers’ bindings, however, were beginning to be seriously studied, under<lb/>
the leadership of Sadleir and Carter. And the <hi rend="italic">Enquiry</hi> took a major step<lb/>
forward in demonstrating ways in which the analysis of paper and type<lb/>
could also be applied to post-1800 books.<lb/></p>

<p>It is possible that Carter’s collecting of detective fiction played a role<lb/>
in inspiring the analysis of paper reported in the <hi rend="italic">Enquiry</hi>. He was certainly<lb/>
aware of the detective stories of R. Austin Freeman (discussed in his es-<lb/>
say in <hi rend="italic">New Paths in Book Collecting</hi> as reaching “a new level in scientific<lb/>
detection”), and it is not unlikely that he knew “The Apparition of Burl-<lb/>
ing Court” (1923; collected in <hi rend="italic">The Puzzle Lock</hi>, 1925). In that story, the<lb/>
detective, Dr. Thorndyke, proves a book to be fraudulent through several<lb/>
physical tests, the decisive one being a laboratory examination of the pa-<lb/>
per, which showed that the paper contained mechanical wood-pulp and<lb/></p>
<pb n="6"/>
esparto. Thorndyke stated that “esparto was not used until 1860,” which<lb/>
was twenty years after the purported date of the book. It turns out that the<lb/>
presence of esparto in the paper of some of the pamphlets that Carter and<lb/>
Pollard were investigating was the basis for proving them to be forgeries.<lb/>
(Although Dr. Thorndyke is not referred to, another fictional detective,<lb/>
Edgar Allan Poe’s Auguste Dupin, is cited as a precursor in a later chapter<lb/>
[p. 87].) Whether or not there was any connection with Dr. Thorndyke,<lb/>
Carter and Pollard used the same procedure: after having the papers of<lb/>
the pamphlets tested and determining the dates when esparto and chemi-<lb/>
cal wood-pulp were introduced into papermaking, they found that twenty-<lb/>
two of the pamphlets had printed dates that preceded the dates when their<lb/>
paper would have been available, and thus they were fraudulent.<lb/>
The authors were aware that their use of paper evidence was more<lb/>
groundbreaking than that of typographical evidence. The paper test, they<lb/>
said, “has not hitherto been applied to bibliographical purposes” (p. 42),<lb/>
whereas, in the opening sentence of the chapter on type, they call atten-<lb/>
tion to Robert Proctor’s work, decades earlier, identifying the printers<lb/>
of incunabula through the type designs. They also note that Proctor, a<lb/>
friend of William Morris, had in 1898 questioned (on the basis of its type)<lb/>
the Morris pamphlet that Carter and Pollard proved to be a forgery.<lb/>
The typographical tests they used throughout were proposed by Stanley<lb/>
Morison (they could hardly have had a greater typographical adviser).<lb/>
He noticed the kernless “f” and “j” and the tilted question mark used<lb/>
in many of the pamphlets; and these characteristics not only provided<lb/>
another dating test (based on the earliest use of a kernless font) but also<lb/>
led to the identification of the printer as Richard Clay &amp; Sons (Clay had<lb/>
added that question mark to the font). The Clay firm was not involved in<lb/>
the deception: having been commissioned by Wise to print many facsimi-<lb/>
les for the Browning and Shelley societies, they had no reason to question<lb/>
the imprints and dates being placed on these other pamphlets. Carter and<lb/>
Pollard concluded that sixteen of the fraudulent pamphlets were definitely<lb/>
printed by Clay &amp; Sons and that all the rest probably were.<lb/>
The analysis of paper and type is set out in chapters 4 and 5 with<lb/>
meticulous care and exemplary thoroughness. These chapters are part<lb/>
of the six that constitute part I, “Deduction,” tracing the story from the<lb/>
initial suspicion to the “proved conclusion.” In the last chapter of part I,<lb/>
the authors say, “With all its drudgery, detective work has a great intel-<lb/>
lectual fascination” (p. 93)—and this fascination has been conveyed to<lb/>
the reader. With the “machinery of detection” having been set forth, the<lb/>
authors move in part II, “Reconstruction,” to a description of the forger’s<lb/>
motivation, methods, and marketing strategies. Then comes the largest<lb/>
section of the book, part III, “Dossiers,” in which each of forty-six pam-<lb/>
<pb n="7"/>
phlets (by fifteen authors) is given a thorough account, reporting (among <lb/>
other things) the history of references to it, the location of known cop-<lb/>
ies, the results of tests, and a conclusion. The book as a whole not only <lb/>
demonstrates the use of certain paper and typographical tests in biblio-<lb/>
graphical analysis but also provides a model of how to draw conclusions <lb/>
cautiously and present the results responsibly.<lb/>
Another attraction of the book is its prose style. Although the book was <lb/>
a true collaboration between Carter and Pollard, Carter’s voice emerges <lb/>
plainly at many points, and some chapters are clearly his work, especially <lb/>
those in part II. The opening one, “The Modern First Edition Market, <lb/>
1885-1895,” is an expert survey of the development of interest in literary <lb/>
first editions (a preview of the more detailed account in <lb/>
Taste and Tech-<lb/>
nique in Book-Collecting), providing the necessary context for understand-<lb/>
ing why the kinds of pamphlets that Wise produced were sought after. It <lb/>
has many characteristic touches, such as this: “New vistas were opening <lb/>
before the collectors’ eyes, each with a glint of Eldorado at the end” (p. <lb/>
107). In “these feverish and speculative conditions,” Carter added, “it <lb/>
would have been almost surprising if there had not<lb/>
 been some collateral <lb/>
descendant of Annius to perceive this golden opportunity. . . . At this time, <lb/>
the thing was, comparatively, easy money: the fish were rising, he [the <lb/>
forger] found (after a few experiments) the right fly, and they swallowed it <lb/>
with a regularity and unanimity which must have been to him exceedingly <lb/>
satisfactory” (pp. 108-09).<lb/>
The chapter on “Establishing the Pedigrees” shows Carter at his most <lb/>
skillful, for he convincingly points the finger at Wise without saying out-<lb/>
right that Wise created the forgeries (which could not be said, since the <lb/>
documentary evidence that later turned up—incriminating Harry Buxton <lb/>
Forman as well as Wise—was not known at that time). Wise could be <lb/>
criticized in other ways, however, especially for his supposed failure to be <lb/>
suspicious of the pamphlets, given the circumstances of their appearance <lb/>
and his bibliographical expertise. His behavior, Carter suggests, “savoured <lb/>
of Nelson with the telescope to his blind eye” (p. 134). Carter was unspar-<lb/>
ing in his condemnation of the “shocking negligence” of Wise (even though <lb/>
he had to call the forger “anonymous”) and of the resulting damage:<lb/>
Mr. Wise, by his credulity, by his vanity in his own possessions, by his dogmatism, by <lb/>
abuse of his eminence in the bibliographical world, has dealt a blow to the prestige <lb/>
of an honourable science, the repercussions of which will be long and widely felt. . . . <lb/>
Like the thirteenth stroke of a faulty clock, which discredits the accuracy of the hours <lb/>
which have gone before, the spuriousness of these books must inevitably cast asper-<lb/>
sions on many similar books which are, in fact, genuine. . . . If Mr. Wise, one of the <lb/>
most eminent bibliographers of our time, can be so extensively wrong, who can we <lb/>
be sure is right? (pp. 141– 42)<lb/>
<pb n="8"/>
<p>The Enquiry is a landmark of bibliographical analysis and the presentation<lb/>
of bibliographical evidence, and it is written in such a way that it is an<lb/>
enduringly readable story of detection.<lb/>
The three major books of 1932-34 were not Carter’s only significant<lb/>
publications of the early 1930s. In November 1934, four months after the<lb/>
Enquiry appeared, Constable (in London) and Scribner’s (in New York)<lb/>
brought out a volume of essays (planned by him and Michael Sadleir)<lb/>
that he edited, entitled New Paths in Book Collecting. There had of course<lb/>
been a number of books about book collecting during the previous forty<lb/>
years, but what made this one distinctive was that it consisted of essays<lb/>
by different writers, each taking up an appealing direction for collecting.<lb/>
The authors were drawn primarily from his and Sadleir’s circle of book-<lb/>
world friends, half of them dealers and half collectors: Carter (on “Detec-<lb/>
tive Fiction”), Sadleir (“Yellow-Backs”), P. H. Muir (“Ignoring the Flag”<lb/>
and “War Books”), Graham Pollard (“Serial Fiction”), David A. Randall<lb/>
(“American First Editions, 1900-1933”), Thomas Balston (“English Book<lb/>
Illustration, 1880-1900”), C. B. Oldman (“Musical First Editions”), and<lb/>
John T. Winterich (“The Expansion of an Author Collection”). When<lb/>
Carter commented on this book in 1948 (in Taste and Technique in Book-<lb/>
Collecting), he called it “only one instance of the responsible part taken in<lb/>
recent years by professional booksellers, not merely through their practi-<lb/>
cal influence exerted in the course of business but also by their contribu-<lb/>
tions to bibliophilic literature and propaganda, in the formulation and<lb/>
the exposition of theory, of policy and of practice in the book-collecting<lb/>
world” (Cambridge edition, p. 84). Here he was not only observing a de-<lb/>
velopment but also describing the path he saw for himself as a bookseller,<lb/>
one he faithfully followed.</p>
<p>The title of the volume was not meant to suggest that the subjects<lb/>
discussed were entirely new, for some collectors were already focusing<lb/>
on them; but they were new in the sense that they were not traditional,<lb/>
and the purpose of the book was to call attention to, and encourage,<lb/>
the approach to collecting represented by these trends. It was the paths<lb/>
that were new, not necessarily the subjects: the book aimed not to “dic-<lb/>
tate” but “to suggest by means of examples” (p. 7). As Carter remarked<lb/>
in Taste and Technique, the volume was “one gambit” in the “general<lb/>
propagandist movement towards diversity of method” (p. 84). Through-<lb/>
out his career, Carter argued that collectors should think on their own<lb/>
and not simply repeat what earlier collectors had done. In the intro-<lb/>
duction to this volume, for example, he says that collectors should have<lb/>
“enough independence to dislike joining the herd movements which<lb/>
are always ploughing their way across the book market” (p. 6). The<lb/>
point is made several times in the opening pages through metaphor.<lb/>
For example:</p>
<pb n="9"/>
<p>A collection of “high spots” may sound the chord of C major, which is indeed a fine <lb/>
and resounding noise; yet there are other and more subtle harmonies, the pleasantest <lb/>
of which are those which we evolve for ourselves. These are composed of notes which <lb/>
anyone can use and many have used, but by our own arrangement of them we can <lb/>
achieve a sound never heard before. (p. 11)<lb/>
Earlier, in a visual metaphor, he says that the coherence of such a collec-<lb/>
tion can reveal a “beautiful pattern” (p. 4). This newly revealed pattern, <lb/>
like the “sound never heard before,” makes a “contribution to knowl-<lb/>
edge” (a phrase used on the first page). Implicit in all the essays that <lb/>
follow (“essays in method,” he calls them), and often explicit as well, is a <lb/>
recognition that collecting is a form of historical study and that follow-<lb/>
ing new paths increases our understanding of the past. With this kind of <lb/>
grounding, New Paths remains one of the most perceptive and inspiring <lb/>
of introductory guides.<lb/></p>
<p>Carter followed up on this book in two ways the same year. With <lb/>
Sadleir, he organized an exhibition “arranged to illustrate” New Paths at J. <lb/>
&amp; E. Bumpus, accompanied by a substantial annotated catalogue; and for <lb/>
the Scribner Book Store he put together a catalogue on detective fiction <lb/>
(largely from his own collection). (In the next few years, he and David A. <lb/>
Randall, head of Scribner’s Rare Book Department in New York as of <lb/>
March 1935, publicized many more new paths in their catalogues.) His <lb/>
interest in publishers’ bindings also led to further contributions to their <lb/>
history in the form of two introductions to Elkin Mathews catalogues <lb/>
(1932) and two small books, Publishers’ Cloth (1935, in connection with <lb/>
an exhibition at the New York Public Library) and More Binding Variants <lb/>
(1938, a supplement to his 1932 book).<lb/></p>
<p>His editorial work also continued with editions of Housman’s <lb/>
Introductory Lecture (1933) and The Collected Poems (1939) and an incomplete <lb/>
edition of Catullus (two fascicles only, 1934-35). (The Collected Poems was <lb/>
published without an editor’s name; but four years later, in the course of <lb/>
an article in the Times Literary Supplement on 5 and 12 June 1943, Carter <lb/>
revealed his editorship publicly.) These efforts, however, did not have the <lb/>
scholarly merit of the Browne edition. The Housman Collected Poems, to <lb/>
take the primary example, could have been a triumph; but it was hastily <lb/>
produced and involved faulty editorial judgments. Housman’s will autho-<lb/>
rized his brother Laurence to destroy some manuscripts and to oversee <lb/>
the use of the others; and Laurence in turn asked Carter (who had helped <lb/>
organize the manuscripts) to produce an edition of the poetry. The result <lb/>
was criticized, beginning in the autumn of 1952 (when the book was in <lb/>
its thirteenth impression), by two American scholars, Tom Burns Haber <lb/>
(Ohio State) and William White (Wayne State), leading to an acrimonious <lb/>
feud that erupted periodically in the pages of the Times Literary Supplement <lb/>
(and, to a lesser extent, The Book Collector) over the next sixteen years.<lb/></p>
<pb n="10"/>
<p>It started on 26 September 1952 in the TLS with a letter from White, <lb/>
using information from Haber, who had studied the Housman manu-<lb/>
scripts, beginning in 1950, much more thoroughly than Carter had. <lb/>
White’s letter, referring to Carter’s “slip-shod editing,” alludes to the <lb/>
two concerns that were the basis of their criticism: the outright errors <lb/>
in the text and the questionable judgment underlying the handling of <lb/>
uncanceled manuscript alternatives, where Carter followed the choices <lb/>
made by Laurence Housman in the poems included in his posthumous <lb/>
editions. Carter’s response (24 October 1952) was weak on both counts. <lb/>
Regarding the first, he said he had only claimed “a more correct text.” As <lb/>
for the second, he asserted that “the person authorized to perform this <lb/>
[choice among variants] . . . was the author’s brother, whose judgment <lb/>
they [White and Haber] are not entitled to challenge.” Haber’s long letter <lb/>
on 7 November mainly described the history of the manuscripts and his <lb/>
work with them; and it was not until a year later (2 October 1953) that <lb/>
Haber, in a good letter summarizing the situation, made a proper reply <lb/>
to Carter’s second point. Carter, he said, “is speaking wildly when he <lb/>
says (of the poet’s brother) that consanguinity endows an editor with om-<lb/>
niscience when choosing between alternative readings in a manuscript.” <lb/>
Haber ends by regretting that the text “should be toyed with once again,” <lb/>
since the fourteenth impression, about to appear, was not to be a thor-<lb/>
ough revision.<lb/>
That fourteenth impression, “freshly corrected” according to Carter <lb/>
(23 October 1953), still contained errors that were noted by White (12 <lb/>
February 1954), who also questioned Carter’s assertion that Housman’s <lb/>
will gave his brother the right to choose between variants. Despite Carter’s <lb/>
assurance (5 March 1954), White’s quotation from the will (14 May 1954) <lb/>
suggests that Carter was incorrect. But this point, of course, is a legal one <lb/>
and is irrelevant to a scholarly editor’s obligation to think through textual <lb/>
decisions independently. The debate was quiescent for the next five years; <lb/>
but during that time Haber’s The Manuscript Poems of A. E. Housman (1955) <lb/>
appeared, and it produced discussion in the TLS (1 July 1955; 15 June, 20, <lb/>
27 July 1956) and The Book Collector (4:110-14) that intensified the lack of <lb/>
civility between Carter and Haber—though the anonymous front-page <lb/>
TLS review of Haber’s book on 29 April 1955, one of the most severe at-<lb/>
tacks the TLS has ever published, was not by Carter but by his friend and <lb/>
occasional collaborator John Sparrow.<lb/>
The controversy over The Collected Poems revived again when Haber <lb/>
brought out a volume in 1959 called Complete Poems: Centennial Edition <lb/>
(from the same American publisher as The Collected Poems), which contained the <lb/>
same poems as Carter’s edition but with different texts. Carter asked (29 <lb/>
May 1959) whether Haber had received authorization from the Housman <lb/>
estate, questioned a number of readings, and said that Haber’s textual es-<lb/>
</p>
<pb n="11"/>
<p>say “follows the expectable line of quiet superiority.” After Haber replied<lb/>
(24 July 1959), Carter maintained that only his edition was authorized and<lb/>
that Haber was not qualified to “tamper” with the text; and he concluded<lb/>
his letter (14 August 1959) as follows:<lb/></p>
<p>I am if anything more conscious to-day of the fallibility of my eyes and of my<lb/>
judgment than I was, thirty-odd years ago, when Housman lectured to us on textual<lb/>
criticism at Cambridge. Mr. Haber, as students of his writings must by now be well<lb/>
aware, is afflicted with no such humility. This puts him at an advantage in the pro-<lb/>
tracted controversy into which I have been, most reluctantly, drawn. But I am not<lb/>
sure that the advantage is shared by the poet and his readers, whom each of us is<lb/>
trying in his own way to serve.<lb/></p>
<p>Haber’s Complete Poems was withdrawn after several impressions (follow-<lb/>
ing the English publisher’s insistence that it was unauthorized), and the<lb/>
debate over The Collected Poems finally ended almost a decade later, when<lb/>
White reported (11 January 1968) only three “trifling errors” in the latest<lb/>
impression (the correction of which he acknowledged on 1 October 1971).<lb/></p>
<p>But since in the same issue (11 January 1968) Haber pursued his feud<lb/>
with Sparrow, Carter could not resist one more sarcastic retort (14 March<lb/>
1968). Reacting to Haber’s account of first looking into the manuscripts,<lb/>
Carter says, “It is as if stout Cortes had beheld the Pacific for the first<lb/>
time (except that Cortes, if Keats is to be believed, was silent).” And in the<lb/>
same letter Carter calls White “that indefatigable vigilante of Housman’s<lb/>
text.” The condescending tone was inappropriate, for Carter should him-<lb/>
self have been such a vigilante, having accepted the task of editing these<lb/>
poems. Nevertheless, his 1939 edition gave readers convenient access to<lb/>
the body of Housman’s poetry for the first time; and, in its successive revi-<lb/>
sions, it remained the standard text for many decades.<lb/></p>
<p>Aside from his various book publications of the 1930s, Carter made<lb/>
important contributions to the book world during these years through his<lb/>
journalism and his participation in other activities that promoted com-<lb/>
munication among members of that world. His first book-related jour-<lb/>
nalism appeared in Publishers’ Weekly, as a result of his having become<lb/>
acquainted with its editor, Frederick G. Melcher, during his first trip to<lb/>
New York in 1929. At that time Publishers’ Weekly was a crucial journal<lb/>
for the antiquarian-book world as well as the new-book world through its<lb/>
inclusion of a department called “Old and Rare Books,” which provided<lb/>
substantial articles and reviews along with columns by Frederick M. Hop-<lb/>
kins (“Rare Book Notes”) and Jacob Blanck (“News from the Rare Book<lb/>
Shops”). Carter became a regular contributor, producing nearly seventy<lb/>
pieces (articles, reviews, letters) from 1930 through 1947, at which time<lb/>
the function of the rare-book section was taken over by a new periodical,<lb/>
Antiquarian Bookman. (Publishers’ Weekly did not forget its role in Carter’s<lb/>)</p>
<pb n="12"/>
career and offered one of the most informative biographical articles about <lb/>
him in its issue of 3 January 1953.) When, in the issue of 20 December <lb/>
1941, he looked back on his <hi rend="smallcaps">PW</hi> writings, he found “some couched in <lb/>
the intolerant language of youth, others in the autocratic style of middle <lb/>
age, but none of them expressing sentiments to which their writer would <lb/>
not still subscribe.” They include some of the best articles he ever wrote.<lb/>
At the same time Carter was playing a role in the creation of another <lb/>
outlet for book-world news, the back page of the Times Literary Supplement. <lb/>
Michael Sadleir was the prime mover in this endeavor: in early 1931 he <lb/>
convened a group of friends (including Carter, Pollard, Percy Muir, John <lb/>
Hayward, and Dudley Massey) to discuss with Simon Nowell-Smith, a <lb/>
new member of the Times staff, the possibility of expanding the cover-<lb/>
age of the book world on the <hi rend="smallcaps">TLS</hi> back page from the limited “Notes <lb/>
on Sales” it presently carried. This group, which became known as the <lb/>
“Biblio Boys,” continued (with an evolving membership) to have monthly <lb/>
dinners for many decades; it stands as a major example of the role that <lb/>
social connections and personal communication can play in the respon-<lb/>
sible development of a field (as glimpsed in Bertram Rota catalogue 290, <lb/>
The Biblio-Boys, 1999). The earliest instance of the group’s influence was <lb/>
the invigoration of the <hi rend="smallcaps">TLS</hi> back page, which did become a widely fol-<lb/>
lowed forum for the antiquarian-book world. Carter was by far its most <lb/>
prolific contributor—and, beginning in 1946 during Stanley Morison’s <lb/>
editorship, its formally appointed supervisor, a position he kept (except <lb/>
during his Washington years, 1953-55) until 1967, when the bibliographi-<lb/>
cal page ceased to be a regular feature. He wrote about 700 reviews for <lb/>
the <hi rend="smallcaps">TLS</hi> between 1931 and the end of his life, along with some 300 other <lb/>
pieces (letters, articles, and notes, many of them amounting to additional <lb/>
reviews). His sensible and well-expressed views (which had a scholarly <lb/>
underpinning) were thereby given wide circulation. But the <hi rend="smallcaps">TLS</hi> policy of <lb/>
anonymity meant that most readers (those not privy to book-world gos-<lb/>
sip) were not aware that Carter’s was the dominant voice through which <lb/>
they were being provided with remarkably thorough coverage from the <lb/>
antiquarian-book world, including reports of auctions and exhibitions as <lb/>
well as reviews of bibliographical journals and books.<lb/>
Another product of the Biblio Boys’ conversations, though of much <lb/>
shorter duration, was Bibliographical Notes &amp; Queries, a periodical that <lb/>
Muir undertook to edit from the Elkin Mathews shop, beginning in Janu-<lb/>
ary of 1935. Carter did his part to make the journal succeed by furnishing <lb/>
a large number of queries and replies (many under pseudonyms), covering <lb/>
a wide range of topics, from publishing practices to specific books (often <lb/>
with substantial discussions). But the services to scholarship provided by <lb/>
the journal were not sufficiently used to allow it to continue past the May <lb/>
1939 issue. It was nevertheless a valiant attempt to promote the inter-<lb/>
<pb n="13"/>
<p>change of ideas and information, a perennial concern of Carter’s circle <lb/>
of book-world friends. His own efforts—in reviews, notes, catalogue en-<lb/>
tries, talks, and conversations—took up a lot of his time, but they played <lb/>
a major role, through their ubiquity and style, in educating all kinds of <lb/>
participants in the book world. And they did not prevent his producing <lb/>
substantial scholarly work. In May of 1939, when BN&amp;Q ended and he <lb/>
marked his thirty-fourth birthday, he could look back on a decade of im-<lb/>
pressive accomplishment, rarely equaled in bibliographical history.<lb/>
</p>
<head>The 1940s</head><lb/>
<p>Carter’s role in the war effort began in September 1939, when he be-<lb/>
came a press censor for the Ministry of Information, serving as informa-<lb/>
tion secretary to the Minister, Brendan Bracken. His duties there allowed <lb/>
him to continue his work at Scribner’s (whose office at 23 Bedford Square <lb/>
was around the corner); but four years later, in November 1943, he was <lb/>
named director of the General Division of the Ministry’s New York office, <lb/>
called British Information Services, which necessitated his taking a leave <lb/>
of absence from Scribner’s. (In his New York position, which involved <lb/>
being supervisor of publications, he wrote in 1945 an anonymous and <lb/>
widely circulated pamphlet, Victory in Burma, intended to show, as he says <lb/>
at the outset, that Britain’s Burma campaigns “have been an integral and <lb/>
a vital part of the over-all Allied strategy in the war against Japan.”) His <lb/>
government service ended in October 1945; and at the beginning of 1946 <lb/>
he was named managing director of Scribner’s London office, with new <lb/>
responsibilities added to his previous ones. It is understandable, therefore, <lb/>
that the pace of his writing in the 1930s could not be maintained in the <lb/>
1940s. But he did produce a major book and kept up his journalistic pres-<lb/>
ence, even adding two mass-circulation magazines, The Atlantic Monthly <lb/>
and The Cornhill Magazine, to his outlets (having written some theater <lb/>
reviews for The Spectator in 1940).<lb/>
</p>
<p>His reviews and reports for Publishers’ Weekly in the late 1930s and <lb/>
early 1940s contain many moving references to the war. He begins his <lb/>
comment on the first volume of W. W. Greg’s drama bibliography this <lb/>
way: “This is the week of Hitler’s invasion of Holland, Belgium, Luxem-<lb/>
bourg and France. It is, therefore, a week in which the words ‘important’ <lb/>
and ‘a major event’ sound a little odd when applied to a book.” Later in <lb/>
the same column, he notes the ending of Bibliographical Notes &amp; Queries and <lb/>
adds, “Let us hope that it may revive, with other humane activities, when <lb/>
we reach that post-war world which now looks so much like a mirage” <lb/>
(15 June 1940). The title of another piece, “Bomb-Proof Bibliography” <lb/>
(21 October 1939), is explained at the outset: “When the newspapers <lb/>
are full of the war, and our sleep is constantly interrupted by air-raid <lb/>
</p>
<pb n="14"/>
warnings, it is comforting to turn, for a change of air, to these scholarly<lb/>
pages” (referring to Dorothy Blakey’s Minerva Press bibliography). In the<lb/>
spring of 1941 he could report, in reference to the Maggs shop, that “the<lb/>
nightingale is still singing in Berkeley Square—this year in the key of B<lb/>
minor” (19 April 1941).<lb/>
One of the high points of the war years for him, and one of the most<lb/>
emotional, was the occasion (7 July 1941) when he presented to Churchill<lb/>
the manuscript of Clough’s poem that Churchill had read in a radio broad-<lb/>
cast two months earlier; his charming account, in the issue of 2 August<lb/>
1941, is “Clough to Churchill.” On that occasion he also gave Churchill<lb/>
a copy of <hi rend="italic">Grim Glory</hi>, the 1941 book of wartime photographs edited by his<lb/>
wife, for which he had composed the dedication to Churchill. (Five years<lb/>
earlier, on 26 December 1936, he had married Ernestine Fantl, a native<lb/>
of Savannah, Georgia, who was then the curator of architecture at the<lb/>
Museum of Modern Art.) The most memorable of all these pieces, “A<lb/>
Bookseller’s Day in London” (2 November 1940), reports that “it’s three<lb/>
weeks now since I went to sleep not hearing a German bomber some-<lb/>
where overhead”; and he wakes up to “the now all too familiar sound of<lb/>
the demolition squads shovelling piles of broken glass into trucks.” Instead<lb/>
of reading the morning papers he turns to a favorite essay by his great-<lb/>
great-uncle William Johnson Cory, “which makes me think of sanity and<lb/>
the classics and all the things I was brought up to respect.” His account of<lb/>
his day’s routine under wartime conditions is journalism at its best, vividly<lb/>
conveying the atmosphere of a particular time and place.<lb/>
Carter’s major book of the 1940s resulted from his being asked to de-<lb/>
liver the Sandars Lectures in Bibliography at Cambridge in 1947. Entitled<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Taste and Technique in Book-Collecting</hi>, the book was published on 26 July<lb/>
1948 by R. R. Bowker in New York (the publisher of <hi rend="italic">Publishers’ Weekly</hi>)<lb/>
and, three months later (on 29 October), by Cambridge University Press<lb/>
in England. (The Cambridge edition is preferable, with its wonderful<lb/>
typography, its comfortable feel in the hand, and its old-fashioned use<lb/>
of recto running-titles, obviously written by Carter, that summarize the<lb/>
content of each two-page spread—this last a feature of the <hi rend="italic">Enquiry</hi> also.<lb/>
For typographic excellence, the book was named one of the “Fifty Books<lb/>
of the Year” by the National Book League.) It is, in my opinion, Carter’s<lb/>
best book, and the best book about book collecting ever written. Although<lb/>
it has many devotees, it has nevertheless been overshadowed by several<lb/>
of his other books. The reason may be its title, which sounds like a how-<lb/>
to manual. But the book is actually a perceptive historical study of book<lb/>
collecting, along with an account of the role of taste and technique (that<lb/>
is, connoisseurship) in making it a serious scholarly pursuit. He states in<lb/>
the preface that it is “not a primer or a text-book or a manual for begin-<lb/>
ners” but rather “a somewhat ruminative treatise”— or, as he later says,<lb/>
<pb n="15"/>
an “advanced treatise of a general kind” (Cambridge edition, p. 107). And<lb/>
he begins the second part by describing what is to follow as “reflexions,<lb/>
not advice.” No one, he believes, “can learn how to collect from manuals<lb/>
or at second hand” (p. 91). Nevertheless, the book is full of well-reasoned<lb/>
observations, and anyone who takes them to heart will have acquired the<lb/>
best kind of preparation—not conveyed by instructions but by penetrat-<lb/>
ing insights born of wide experience and learning.<lb/>
The book is a tour de force, or a series of such tours, for each chapter<lb/>
is a showpiece. Elegant in structure, as in all other aspects, it is divided<lb/>
into two parts of six chapters each: the first part is called “Evolution”<lb/>
and the second “Method.” This pairing is not to be equated with “taste”<lb/>
and “technique,” because the latter two (for which we could substitute<lb/>
“temperament” and “approach”) run throughout the book as a unifying<lb/>
thread. The “Evolution” section is a marvelously rich account of nine-<lb/>
teenth-century British and American collecting (with a few glimpses of<lb/>
earlier centuries and the European continent)—rich both in the number<lb/>
of individuals cited and in the analyses of the patterns and motives they<lb/>
display (not forgetting the role of literary criticism). The second part,<lb/>
“Method,” includes chapters on “Tools and Terminology,” “Bookshop<lb/>
and Auction Room,” “Rarity” (the longest chapter and a particularly<lb/>
impressive one), and “Condition.” Even the discussion of reference books<lb/>
(in the first of these), is enjoyable; and although it is inevitably dated in its<lb/>
citations, it is still worth reading for its astute comments on categories of<lb/>
reference works. In the same way, the fact that the examples drawn on in<lb/>
every chapter have to be from before 1949 does not make the book seem<lb/>
dated, for they so thoroughly document a wide range of situations that<lb/>
one can see their applicability to any period. And the awesome profusion<lb/>
of examples, one of the hallmarks of the book, is an extreme demonstra-<lb/>
tion of the feats of memory attainable by attentive booksellers.<lb/>
The final chapter is appropriately on “Condition,” for a subcategory<lb/>
of that topic, “original condition,” turns up throughout the book: the pri-<lb/>
mary movement, after all, in the story that Carter tells of the evolution<lb/>
of book collecting is the growing concern with preserving books in their<lb/>
original condition. The earlier interest in possessing books in fine bindings<lb/>
began changing in the late nineteenth century, with Wise as a principal<lb/>
instigator, to an emphasis on the historical significance of original condi-<lb/>
tion. Carter’s investigations of nineteenth-century publishers’ bindings is<lb/>
an indication of his firm belief in the importance of such condition. If the<lb/>
published forms of books are relatively easy to define after the introduc-<lb/>
tion of edition-binding, they are not obvious for earlier books. From his<lb/>
first article, entitled “Original Condition: An Appeal to Reason” (1930),<lb/>
Carter continually argued for a “reasonable” approach to this question.<lb/>
By that he meant that a collector should not hold out for a copy in the un-<lb/>
<pb n="16"/>
bound or temporarily bound condition that occasionally survives; instead,<lb/>
one should be satisfied with a contemporary bound copy (which could be<lb/>
one of the copies originally offered for retail sale). For this period, in other<lb/>
words, original condition could refer to any of the forms that might have<lb/>
been encountered in a bookseller’s shop.<lb/>
His position is indeed reasonable, but when he writes on this subject,<lb/>
he is inclined to take one false step: to use, as a support for his point of<lb/>
view, the idea that boards or wrappers were “by intention ephemeral” (p.<lb/>
178), representing “the chrysalis stage of production” (p. 180). The print-<lb/>
er’s or publisher’s assumption that wrappers or boards would be replaced<lb/>
does not alter the historical fact that such a stage existed and is therefore<lb/>
worthy of attention. Carter does recognize the value of the bibliographi-<lb/>
cal evidence (as he always does), but there was no need to introduce, as<lb/>
if it were relevant, the presumed expectations of the producers of the<lb/>
books. To do so may be a consolation for collectors, but it is a rare lapse<lb/>
in logic for Carter.<lb/>
As usual, his prose is a delight (even though in the 1970 reprint he<lb/>
claimed to detect “a certain stylistic dandyism” in it). The book should be<lb/>
read slowly, so that each paragraph (and most of its constituent sentences)<lb/>
can be savored. The richness of the texture is created by—to name some<lb/>
of its elements—balanced syntax, precise but often surprising diction,<lb/>
striking metaphors, a profusion of proper names and italicized titles, a<lb/>
judicious sprinkling of foreign words (including untransliterated Greek),<lb/>
and an affinity for colons. One cannot help but think that his love of<lb/>
seventeenth-century prose, especially Thomas Browne’s, played its part.<lb/>
Dipping into the book anywhere is likely to pull up a memorable, and of-<lb/>
ten aphoristic, sentence, such as: “whenever expertise becomes an end in<lb/>
itself instead of the means to an end, it results in empty virtuosity” (p. 81).<lb/>
Or, on the fondness some collectors feel for books of their youth: this at-<lb/>
traction “often reflects the unpredictable influence of some miscellaneous<lb/>
shelf which the mere accident of propinquity at a receptive period has<lb/>
endowed with an unforgotten magic” (p. 72). Or, for a more extended ex-<lb/>
ample, dealing with one of Carter’s favorite, and most important, topics:<lb/>
And if I return now to individuality of taste and the variety of approach involved<lb/>
in breaking new ground—both healthy signs of originality, enterprise and intelli-<lb/>
gence—it is for the purpose of emphasising the importance of a sense of balance in<lb/>
the general structure. For although I have been, and remain, a proponent of idiosyn-<lb/>
crasy, a warm supporter of the unusual approach in book-collecting, I have detected<lb/>
in myself and have sometimes suspected among my book-collecting friends a ten-<lb/>
dency to a certain esotericism of taste which is analogous to, and is indeed sometimes<lb/>
allied with, that conscious virtuosity in technique to which I referred earlier. It is,<lb/>
equally with the other, a perfectly legitimate tendency in the sophisticated collector,<lb/>
as long as it is clearly recognised as such. But since it is the sophisticated collectors<lb/>
<pb n="17"/>
<p>who most influence the unsophisticated, there is always a danger that their manner-<lb/>
isms, whether of taste or method, will be imitated (and usually exaggerated) while <lb/>
their underlying purpose remains unrecognised: just as many an architect who slaps <lb/>
on a swag here or a cupola there fondly supposes himself to be thereby qualifying for <lb/>
comparison with Wren or Brunelleschi. (pp. 88-89)<lb/>
The rhythms of this paragraph, the placement of its pauses, leading to-<lb/>
ward the summarizing simile, make it a characteristic performance.<lb/>
The personality that comes through is learned and humane—to use <lb/>
the adjectives that Carter applied on the first page to A. W. Pollard’s <lb/>
great essay on book collecting in the eleventh edition of the Encyclopaedia <lb/>
Britannica. Carter’s scholarly temperament, and his consequent concern <lb/>
with history, are evident throughout, epitomized perhaps in his insistence <lb/>
that any “restoration” of a book be accompanied by a statement in which <lb/>
“the nature of the repairs made to it” are “recorded indelibly” (p. 185). <lb/>
He insisted that scholarly bibliographical analyses have “a strong claim <lb/>
on the attention of the average collector” (p. 114), and he recognized <lb/>
the role of collectors as scholars: “the ultimate value of the bibliophile <lb/>
to pure scholarship depends on his recognition as an active entity, not <lb/>
a mere appendix” (p. 99). In his discussion of Sadleir’s Bibliographia <lb/>
series, Carter observed that it was “marked by a scholarly appreciation <lb/>
of the importance of book-structure and publishing practice to the intel-<lb/>
ligent collector, whose acquiescence in this proposition was enlisted by <lb/>
being taken for granted” (p. 61). There could be no better description of <lb/>
Carter’s own book.<lb/>
The same mind is obviously at work in his journalism of the 1940s. <lb/>
For example, in reviewing J. D. Cowley’s Bibliographical Description and <lb/>
Cataloguing, he said, “The principles of bibliography are valid for books <lb/>
of all periods, and even the chronicler of a living author is the better for <lb/>
having learned how to collate an incunable” (<hi rend="italic">Publishers’ Weekly</hi>, 16 March <lb/>
1940). And after the war, when he described the great Yale convocation <lb/>
of October 1946 to “mark the return of the University’s collections to <lb/>
peacetime use” (<hi rend="italic">Publishers’ Weekly</hi>, 23 November 1946), he concluded his <lb/>
highly laudatory account with these important reflections:<lb/>
Objects—books, pictures, or bones—are part of the stuff of scholarship, of culture, <lb/>
of ideas. It is axiomatic that it is the duty of institutions to acquire, preserve and <lb/>
catalog them; generally agreed, though not everywhere achieved, that they should <lb/>
be readily available to those who need to study them; but much less often recognized <lb/>
that they require to be actively injected into the thoughts and studies of the academic, <lb/>
and also of the wider, world outside their glass cases. Every year museums and librar-<lb/>
ies get fuller and the problem of exploiting their resources more formidable. The <lb/>
methods by which this can best be done vary with the circumstances; but the amount <lb/>
of imagination and enterprise being devoted in this country [the United States] to <lb/>
making such collections as Yale’s not a mere adjunct but an integral and living part <lb/>
</p>
<pb n="18"/>
<p>of the world of taste and scholarship is something of which Americans may rightly be proud.<lb/>
That these enlightened ideas, and others like them, were expressed in a<lb/>
journal with the wide readership (mostly nonbibliographical) of Publishers’<lb/>
Weekly was fortunate; and one cannot help regretting that Carter’s voice<lb/>
was not much heard there after the rare-book department was ceded to<lb/>
the Antiquarian Bookman in 1948.<lb/></p>
<p>Two other publications of the 1940s deserve mention. In 1941, Carter<lb/>
and Brooke Crutchley (of Cambridge University Press) produced a re-<lb/>
vised edition of Harry G. Aldis’s 1916 The Printed Book. Although their<lb/>
edition is now superseded, it is significant for the role it played for a<lb/>
decade or two. Their contribution was to provide up-to-date coverage<lb/>
of the nineteenth-century revolution in book production, especially the<lb/>
introduction of publishers’ binding and new methods of printing and il-<lb/>
lustration. The book was one more element in Carter’s ongoing effort to<lb/>
promote the study of nineteenth-century books. And since it sold well<lb/>
(with reprintings occurring in 1947 and 1951), it served that purpose ef-<lb/>
fectively. At the other end of the decade, in 1948, another of Carter’s<lb/>
perennial concerns was represented in The Firm of Charles Ottley, Landon &amp;<lb/>
Co. (the title-page authorship credited to Carter “with Graham Pollard”).<lb/>
As the subtitle indicated, it was a “footnote to An Enquiry,” proving four<lb/>
more pamphlets fraudulent and serving as the first interim report on the<lb/>
continuing investigation of the Wise-Forman forgeries.<lb/></p>
<head>The 1950s</head>
<p>The next decade was one of dramatic change in Carter’s life. In early<lb/>
1953 Scribner’s closed most of its London operations, thus ending Cart-<lb/>
er’s quarter-century association with the firm (during which time he had<lb/>
made thirty-six Atlantic crossings). And in October of 1955 he happily<lb/>
joined Sotheby’s book department as a half-time associate, with special<lb/>
responsibility for being the American representative (a particularly appro-<lb/>
priate appointment since he already knew the American scene so well);<lb/>
this arrangement left him free to engage at the same time in independent<lb/>
consulting for collectors and librarians, an activity that extended the in-<lb/>
fluence of his ideas.<lb/>
During the two and a half years in between (from April 1953 to Oc-<lb/>
tober 1955), he was based at the British Embassy in Washington as the<lb/>
personal assistant (with the rank of Counsellor) to the British ambassador,<lb/>
Sir Roger Makins (a service for which he was later named Commander of<lb/>
the Order of the British Empire). He was a perfect choice, with his wide<lb/>
knowledge of the United States and his elegance in manner and dress as<lb/>
</p>
<pb n="19"/>
<p>well as in speaking and writing. The job had a large social component,<lb/>
and Carter and his wife greatly enjoyed this period of their lives. (In her <lb/>
entertaining and perceptive 1974 autobiography, <hi rend="italic">With Tongue in Chic</hi>, she <lb/>
says, “The Washington years were golden years.”) The flavor of their <lb/>
Washington life is suggested by a thank-you note from T. S. Eliot written <lb/>
on 22 May 1955, after a luncheon party at the Carters’ Georgetown house <lb/>
(quoted from R. M. Smythe auction catalogue 157, 13 November 1996, <lb/>
lot 412, with one correction):<lb/>
Dear Ernestine<lb/>
I can’t leave Washington without writing to thank you &amp; John for your hospitality <lb/>
– for a delicious lunch beautifully served in perfect surroundings and in a company <lb/>
at once distinguished and sympathetic. And if you were leaving Washington in the <lb/>
autumn for any other destination than London, I should say how sorry I was not to <lb/>
be able to look forward to a similar occasion next year.<lb/>
Yours gratefully<lb/>
Tom Eliot<lb/>
The glamorous life implied here (or “glittering,” as Ernestine called it) was <lb/>
not an unaccustomed one for the Carters: given the connections Carter <lb/>
had made through the international world of collecting and the fact that <lb/>
Ernestine had been, before the move to Washington, an influential fash- <lb/>
ion journalist with the English <hi rend="italic">Harper’s Bazaar</hi> (becoming Women’s Editor <lb/>
of <hi rend="italic">The Sunday Times</hi> on their return to London, and later Associate Editor), <lb/>
their combined circle of celebrity acquaintances was impressive, as was <lb/>
their entertaining. I have remarked in the past on the interdependence <lb/>
of all parts of a person’s life and on how the scholarly (or bibliographical) <lb/>
and the social nourish each other. One illustration of this point that I have <lb/>
used is the life of Mary Hyde, and it happens that the Hydes were New <lb/>
York friends of Carter. When Carter was setting up a New York office for <lb/>
Sotheby’s, Donald Hyde provided space and secretarial help in his law <lb/>
firm’s financial-district premises at 61 Broadway. Carter’s writings, no less <lb/>
than his bookselling activities, benefited from the knowledge and contacts <lb/>
furnished by his full social life.<lb/>
Eighteen months before Carter began at the embassy in Washington, <lb/>
he delivered one of the Windsor Lectures at the University of Illinois <lb/>
and produced for that occasion a landmark essay, “<hi rend="italic">Some Bibliographical <lb/>
Agenda</hi>”—agenda, that is, for the study of nineteenth-century English <lb/>
books, which was the subject of this lecture series in October 1951. (The <lb/>
essay was published the next year in a volume that included the essays <lb/>
by the other two lecturers that year, Gordon N. Ray and Carl J. Weber; <lb/>
Carter also selected it for his 1956 collection, <hi rend="italic">Books and Book-Collectors</hi>.) <lb/>
In his essay, Carter set the stage for future work: after summarizing the <lb/>
revolutionary changes in book production in the nineteenth century that <lb/>
</p>
<pb n="20"/>
<p>complicate bibliographical research on books of that period and after<lb/>
outlining what little work had been done, he focused on a few of the<lb/>
complicating features, such as cancels, binding variants, and inserted ad-<lb/>
vertisements. His comments, as always, are grounded in an understanding<lb/>
of the importance of printing and publishing history for bibliographical<lb/>
analysis and description.<lb/></p>
<p>At the time, Fredson Bowers’s Principles of Bibliographical Description<lb/>
was a relatively new book, having been published at the very end of<lb/>
1949; but Carter had absorbed it, and he ended his essay with a gener-<lb/>
ally shrewd assessment. He was sympathetic, of course, with Bowers’s<lb/>
conception of bibliography as historical scholarship, and he welcomed<lb/>
Bowers’s efforts to systematize work on modern books. But he correctly<lb/>
noted that Bowers’s lack of experience (at that time) with nineteenth- and<lb/>
twentieth-century books weakened his treatment of them, which showed<lb/>
“signs of the rigidity natural to a cautious man operating in comparatively<lb/>
unfamiliar territory.” One result, as Carter recognized, is that Bowers<lb/>
inappropriately extended to the period of publishers’ bindings the idea<lb/>
that only the sheets (and not the binding) of a book could be a determi-<lb/>
nant of issue. The one place where Carter slipped up was when he said<lb/>
that Bowers’s collation formula might be “unnecessarily elaborate” for<lb/>
nineteenth-century books, seemingly not recognizing that the formula<lb/>
was not elaborate for books with a simple structure and that the for-<lb/>
mulary had to be prepared to handle complex structures, which many<lb/>
nineteenth-century books certainly do have. But if we make allowance<lb/>
for this misjudgment, we can still read the essay with profit for its many<lb/>
helpful insights and its point of view.<lb/></p>
<p>About a year after Carter delivered this lecture, his ABC for Book-<lb/>
Collectors (1952) was published—the book that has proved to be his most<lb/>
famous one. It has sold well throughout the English-speaking world for<lb/>
several generations and is now in its ninth edition (having been sensitively<lb/>
revised several times since his death by Nicolas Barker, most recently<lb/>
with Simran Thadani). The book was not the first glossary of book-world<lb/>
terms: a well-established one, The Bookman’s Glossary, had been published<lb/>
in 1926 by R. R. Bowker, the publisher of the American edition of Carter’s<lb/>
Taste and Technique, and was in its third edition in 1952. Carter’s concern<lb/>
with improving it had been shown in a letter noted in Publishers’ Weekly<lb/>
on 11 August 1945; but the Glossary was geared more toward librarians and<lb/>
publishers than collectors and dealers, and the ABC was, as Carter says<lb/>
in his preface, the first “to deal comprehensively with the terminology of<lb/>
this particular subject and no other.” He benefited from the advice of an<lb/>
impressive group of consultants, enumerated in the preface as “a sort of<lb/>
Tenth Legion,” and the result was a remarkably thorough treatment. It<lb/>
included not only terms one encounters in dealers’ catalogues and basic<lb/></p>
<pb n="21"/>
<p>concepts of collecting (such as “condition”) but also standard reference<lb/>
books and fundamental points of bibliographical analysis.<lb/>
Indeed, Carter’s recognition of the essential role of bibliographical<lb/>
scholarship in collecting is a notable feature of the book. One learns, for<lb/>
example, about formes and collations, the bibliographical meanings of<lb/>
“sheet” and “signature,” and the importance of distinguishing integral<lb/>
from inserted advertisements. And the information is sound, as when he<lb/>
emphatically states that collations are necessary for modern books. He<lb/>
even brings up press figures, clearly summarizing the current knowledge<lb/>
of them and then adding, “The bibliographers have not made much out<lb/>
of them yet. But they will.” The only place I have found in the first edition<lb/>
where Carter slips up seriously is when he says that valuing dust-jackets<lb/>
is “a matter of taste,” noting that Morris L. Parrish, “one of the greatest<lb/>
sticklers who ever lived,” threw them away; he should simply have said<lb/>
that Parrish was wrong.</p>
<p>(The reference to Parrish was deleted twenty<lb/>
years later, in the fifth edition.) Another distinguishing characteristic of<lb/>
the book is that its advice is conveyed in the entertaining prose that was by<lb/>
then well-honed. Commenting on the undiscriminating citation of author<lb/>
bibliographies (at the end of the entry for “Bibliography”), Carter says,<lb/>
The judicious collector soon learns that verdicts are not infallible just because they<lb/>
are in print; that the cry of “Not in Prism” should excite him only if Prism’s book<lb/>
both claims to be comprehensive and has some reputation for accuracy; but that as<lb/>
long as others continue to cherish a variant or issue canonised by however incom-<lb/>
petent a bibliographer, so long will booksellers continue to cite even an incompetent<lb/>
bibliography rather than none at all.</p>
<p>And the long entry on “Rarity” begins this way (with what is probably the<lb/>
most quoted passage in the book):<lb/>
Rarity is the salt in book-collecting. But if you take too much salt, the flavour of the<lb/>
dish is spoiled; and if you take it neat it will make you sick. Similarly, those book-<lb/>
collectors who exalt rarity above any other criterion tend to develop third-degree<lb/>
bibliomania, which is a painful and slightly ridiculous ailment.<lb/>
It is easy to see why this book is such a pleasure to consult. The book<lb/>
world is fortunate to have a reliable source of basic information that has<lb/>
been, through its appeal, widely disseminated and influential.</p>
<p>In 1958 Carter brought out a revised edition of Browne’s <hi rend="italic">Urne Buriall</hi><lb/>
and <hi rend="italic">the Garden of Cyrus</hi>, marking the three-hundredth anniversary of its<lb/>
original appearance. As published by Cambridge University Press in a<lb/>
compact and attractive volume, it gave Carter’s text a much wider circu-<lb/>
lation than it had achieved in the limited edition of 1932, a not inconsid-<lb/>
erable service. And the two-page preface shows the skill and charm that<lb/>
Carter brought to the writing of such pieces. In his praise of Browne’s two<lb/>
</p>
<pb n="22"/>
<p>great essays as “the perfected products of his maturity,” Carter displayed<lb/>
the maturity of his own prose:<lb/>
<lb/>
in <hi rend="italic">Urne Buriall</hi>, the curious lore, the strange fantasies, the whimsical speculations,<lb/>
the extraordinary conceits, the relish for picturesque legend and equally picturesque<lb/>
reality, the fascination exerted on the author by bizarre historical and mythical fig-<lb/>
ures—all these jewelled elements, like the thousand small pieces of stained glass in<lb/>
a great rose window, are harmonised by Browne’s deeply reflective imagination, and<lb/>
patterned, with the most polished and elaborate artistry, into paragraph after para-<lb/>
graph of baroque magnificence.<lb/>
</p>
<p>Carter was able to emend Browne’s text with a few further authorial<lb/>
corrections, drawn from six additional author-corrected copies that had<lb/>
become known since 1932 (bringing the total to twelve), as well as several<lb/>
other justifiable emendations.<lb/>
</p>
<p>Otherwise, however, this edition is less desirable in three ways. First,<lb/>
Browne’s marginal references are omitted. Second, Carter reports that<lb/>
“a quarter of a century’s reflection has convinced me of the over-severity<lb/>
of my earlier reaction” against the modernizing of previous editors, and<lb/>
he therefore modernizes spelling and punctuation in a few places—in<lb/>
only a very few, fortunately, or so it seems (though one cannot be sure<lb/>
without a full collation, since these changes are not listed). Third, the<lb/>
short list of “Emendations in the Present Text” records only the emenda-<lb/>
tions to his 1932 text (except, that is, for the occasional modernizing of<lb/>
accidentals), and thus one does not have a complete list of emendations<lb/>
to the first edition, such as the one in his 1932 edition—“which,” he says,<lb/>
“was too elaborate to repeat in a reading edition and to which readers<lb/>
concerned with such things are referred.” But that earlier edition can be<lb/>
consulted only in rare-book rooms. And in any case, the idea of a “read-<lb/>
ing edition”—“for the general reader, not for the antiquarian or for the<lb/>
specialist”—is suspect. Ordinary readers are often interested in textual<lb/>
alterations; and when they are not, the presence of the information does<lb/>
not deter them from reading. That Carter continued to be concerned with<lb/>
Browne’s text is shown by his “working copies” of the two impressions of<lb/>
this edition, in which he marked eleven possible revisions in the first and<lb/>
eight corrections in the second.<lb/>
</p>
<p>Carter’s other publications of the 1950s were mostly useful contin-<lb/>
uations of his long-standing enthusiasms: handlists of A. E. Housman,<lb/>
Stanley Morison, and William Johnson Cory (plus an edition of Cory),<lb/>
showing how valuable the handlist genre can be; and essays on book col-<lb/>
lecting, Wise, and publishers’ bindings, some of them in the new journal<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">The Book Collector</hi>. He also continued to produce reviews steadily and to<lb/>
write occasional biographical accounts and obituaries, primarily (but not<lb/>
exclusively) of book-world figures. Two obituaries from <hi rend="italic">The Times</hi> in this<lb/>
</p>
<pb n="23"/>
<p>period display his prose in response to two contrasting personalities. Of <lb/>
Belle da Costa Greene, Morgan’s librarian, he wrote (19 May 1950):<lb/>
The elder J. Pierpont Morgan was a formidable and autocratic grandee, and not, <lb/>
one may suppose, an easy master. His librarian steadily enhanced his original confi-<lb/>
dence in her without sacrificing one jot of her own imperious temper, so that in her <lb/>
later years the posture of the autocrat came perhaps the more naturally to her. She <lb/>
was always direct, she was no respecter of persons, she could on occasion be high-<lb/>
handed; but in a world where dust settles as easily on persons as on things these are <lb/>
refreshing tactics.<lb/>
In his portrait of Wilmarth Lewis’s wife, he said (14 May 1959):<lb/>
She was Annie Burr Auchincloss; and the stamp of that aristocratic lineage was <lb/>
as plainly visible in her handsome presence as it was subtly perceptible beneath the <lb/>
charm and friendliness of manner which endeared her not merely to her own wide <lb/>
acquaintance but to hundreds of scholars, students and connoisseurs whom her hus-<lb/>
band’s dedicated passion for Strawberry Hill and its master continually drew into <lb/>
the Farmington orbit.<lb/>
These examples of Carter’s effectiveness in this genre can be duplicated <lb/>
from all parts of his career. The bookseller A. W. Evans, for example, <lb/>
“would dominate you by a combination of personal charm and an easy, <lb/>
urbane scholarship which endowed the transaction with an atmosphere <lb/>
of mutual privilege” (19 April 1943). And who besides Carter would have <lb/>
said that the death of the collector Louis H. Silver extinguished “a fire <lb/>
before which his many friends delighted to warm their hands” (5 Novem-<lb/>
ber 1963), or that there was an “ironically sad splendour” in the timing of <lb/>
the choreographer Andrée Howard’s death (20 April 1968)? (His writing <lb/>
about Howard reflects his love of ballet; his use of “sad splendour” may <lb/>
echo the title of Sadleir’s novel Desolate Splendour.)<lb/>
Two publications of 1956-57 serve to mark these years (when he was <lb/>
beginning work at Sotheby’s) as a turning point: one consolidated what <lb/>
had gone before, and the other looked forward. The first was a gathering <lb/>
of his essays called Books and Book-Collectors (1956), consisting of eighteen <lb/>
pieces written between 1934 and 1955 and including treatments of Wise, <lb/>
detective fiction, the study of nineteenth-century books, and collecting his-<lb/>
tory, along with eight biographical sketches and his amusing review of his <lb/>
own ABC. It is an appealing selection, which served to introduce new read-<lb/>
ers to his prose. And it preserved in book form essays that are otherwise not <lb/>
very accessible. (There are many more that deserve to be collected.) The <lb/>
other publication—the one that looked forward to his new life—was <lb/>
Sotheby’s 213th Season, 1956-1957, a pictorial review of the season in pamphlet <lb/>
form, with an introduction by him. Carter initiated the idea of an annual <lb/>
review (which he edited for the first few years) in this modest fashion, and <lb/>
it evolved into the series of elaborate volumes called Art at Auction.</p>
<pb n="24"/>
<head>The 1960s and 1970s</head><lb/>
<p>From the time he began at Sotheby’s in 1955, Carter was occupied <lb/>
with devising ways to bring American auction business to London, a task <lb/>
he was ideally suited for and very successful at accomplishing; and after <lb/>
1960, when Sotheby’s decided to open a full-time New York office with <lb/>
Peregrine Pollen as head, he was also helping to get that office established. <lb/>
His efforts to publicize Sotheby’s were coincidentally assisted by the three <lb/>
American lecture tours he was asked to make for the English Speaking <lb/>
Union in 1961-63. Another instance of his supporting the sale of art dur-<lb/>
ing this period (though without any mention of Sotheby’s) was a letter <lb/>
he wrote to <hi rend="italic">The Times</hi> from New York (published 21 March 1962), which <lb/>
serves as a good illustration of his epistolary style:</p><lb/>
<p><hi rend="italic">Everyone’s Business</hi><lb/>
Sir,— To an Englishman at this distance the attitudes of Parliament, press, and <lb/>
public towards the Royal Academy seem (with the honourable exception of <hi rend="italic">The <lb/>Times</hi>) oddly governessy.<lb/>
The Academy, surely, is a society of gentlemen accountable, like any other club, <lb/>
to its membership and to the law of the land: but how to anyone else? It owns certain <lb/>
property; it has certain liabilities. Like many other clubs, it is a victim of the economic <lb/>
arithmetic of the 1960s. Some clubs raise the subscription: others charge more for <lb/>
whisky: others again let in cads. The Academy decides to sell a picture.<lb/>
Would even a member of Parliament, let alone any busybody who can spell <lb/>
Leonardo, presume to interfere publicly in the private affairs of the Athenaeum or <lb/>
White’s, of the Beefsteak or the Garrick? And if they did, would you, Sir, print their <lb/>
letters? I take leave to doubt it, while remaining<lb/>
Your obedient servant,<lb/>
John Carter</p><lb/>
<p>Below his name, he gave his New York address as the Grolier Club, char-<lb/>
acteristically linking his location with the content of the letter (a practice <lb/>
that goes back to a 1930 letter in <hi rend="italic">Bookmart</hi> about defining “first edition,” <lb/>
where he used the First Edition Club as his address).</p><lb/>
<p>But all the travel and negotiations of these years (which he called <lb/>
“hectic” in a 1971 recollection) did not prevent his devoting a great deal <lb/>
of time and energy (in the early and middle 1960s) to the project that led <lb/>
to <hi rend="italic">Printing and the Mind of Man</hi> (a title for which he was responsible). Carter <lb/>
played a major role, first as an active member of the Supervisory Com-<lb/>
mittee for a historical display (of which Stanley Morison was the “inspirer <lb/>
and foster-father,” as Carter put it) to be held in conjunction with the July <lb/>
1963 International Printing Machinery and Allied Trades Exhibition, and <lb/>
then as co-editor (with Percy Muir) of an expanded catalogue of books <lb/>
that were selected to show the impact of printing on intellectual history.</p>
<pb n="25"/>
<p><lb/>The majestic volume that appeared in 1967 was designed by John Dreyfus (with title-page lettering engraved by Reynolds Stone) and printed<lb/>at Cambridge University Press for publication by Cassell. The writing was equal to the design, with substantial commentaries produced by (in ad-<lb/>dition to Carter and Muir) Nicolas Barker, H. A. Feisenberger, Howard Nixon, and S. H. Steinberg. Carter’s hand is evident throughout, though<lb/>he was the sole author of only a few entries. (The entries are unsigned, but Muir indicated the authorship in a set of proofs, now at Cambridge<lb/>University Library.) Carter wrote the commentaries on Maimonides, Shakespeare, Lewis Carroll, and Churchill and was the co-author (with<lb/>Muir) of four others. The Churchill item (his speech of 20 August 1940) is the last of the 424 entries in the book. It is not surprising that Carter<lb/>wrote this entry, given his admiration for Churchill (as shown by his 1941 account of meeting him, mentioned above). In the entry, having cited<lb/>the Gettysburg Address, he says, “Lincoln and Churchill were far more than a century apart in temperament, but they shared a genius for<lb/>language.” He ends his commentary by noting that Churchill had “an eloquence that matched the hour.”</p>
<p><lb/>The volume can be seen as an elaborate presentation of one of Carter’s “new paths”—not one taken up in New Paths but one that he and Randall<lb/>had promoted at Scribner’s, as reflected in Carter’s 1938 catalogue on Science and Thought in the Nineteenth Century. But new paths can evolve<lb/>into established paths, and Printing and the Mind of Man became a signpost for collectors, with “PMM” being cited in dealers’ descriptions, and<lb/>it thus turned into the kind of list that Carter always advised collectors not to follow. And, like any selection, its choices were subjective,<lb/>reflecting in this case an English-language bias. How comprehensive it is as a record of the writings that in printed form have affected Western<lb/>civilization can be debated. But it remains a readable and well-informed guide to some of the monuments (many of them undebatable) of<lb/>intellectual history.</p>
<p><lb/>Aside from Printing and the Mind of Man, Carter’s principal publications of the 1960s came at the beginning and end of the decade. First, in<lb/>1961, was a useful edition (with a graceful and informative preface) of Housman’s Selected Prose, which made more widely available some pas-<lb/>sages from Housman’s celebrated prefaces to his Latin editions, as well as some of his other writings on textual criticism. (One may object to the<lb/>way the prefaces were cut and also to two of Carter’s editorial practices: after reporting Housman’s concern for accuracy, he says that “minor vari-<lb/>ations of typographical details [unspecified] have been accommodated to the style in current use at Cambridge”; and he also inserts six com-<lb/>mas without noting precisely where these “temerities” occur.) Then in 1968-70 a series of four “Working Papers” for a revised edition of the<lb/>Enquiry were published as pamphlets in limited editions to be distributed<lb/></p>
<pb n="26"/>
by Blackwell’s. (The revision of the Enquiry that Carter and Pollard had<lb/>
worked on sporadically for decades never appeared; but in 1983 Nicolas<lb/>
Barker and John Collins brought out a supplementary volume, A Sequel<lb/>
to “An Enquiry into the Nature of Certain Nineteenth Century Pamphlets”: The<lb/>
Forgeries of H. Buxton Forman and T. J. Wise Re-Examined, bringing together<lb/>
all the Wiseian research that had accumulated.) One product of Carter’s<lb/>
New York life in the middle of the decade was a series of six charming<lb/>
pamphlets called “Halcyon Booklets,” financed by Mary Jean Kempner<lb/>
Thorne and published (with Carter as editor) between 1964 and 1966 un-<lb/>
der the imprint of the Halcyon-Commonwealth Foundation, which had<lb/>
been set up chiefly for this purpose. The series gave Carter an outlet for<lb/>
reprinting some favorite essays, such as Churchill’s “Iron Curtain” speech<lb/>
and William Johnson Cory’s “On the Education of the Reasoning Facul-<lb/>
ties,” a touchstone for Carter throughout his life.<lb/>
His other publications during these years (aside from reviews) con-<lb/>
sisted mainly of essays in exhibition catalogues on Wise and Housman<lb/>
and pieces for the Antiquarian Bookman and The Book Collector. A reminis-<lb/>
cent note, not surprisingly (and indeed appropriately), entered into some<lb/>
of these writings, such as those on collecting Catullus, detective fiction,<lb/>
and Housman. Two others should be noted. For the 1970-71 volume of<lb/>
Art at Auction, he wrote an essay on the early history of Sotheby’s in New York<lb/>
that he subtitled “Some Egotistical Reminiscences”: it is of absorbing in-<lb/>
terest for the study of bookselling history and of Carter’s biography. And<lb/>
when the Private Libraries Association in 1970 handsomely reprinted his<lb/>
Taste and Technique in Book-Collecting, he added as an “Epilogue” his presi-<lb/>
dential address to the Bibliographical Society, delivered on 18 November<lb/>
1969 and entitled “Taste and Technique in Book Collecting, 1928-1968.”<lb/>
These dates are significant, for they cover more than the twenty years<lb/>
since his book was first published and go back another twenty years to<lb/>
the beginning of his career. He is thus reflecting on his whole professional<lb/>
life, describing such changes (in which he played a part) as the growth<lb/>
of institutional collecting and of an interest in authors’ archives and the<lb/>
monuments of science and intellectual history. The essay is of a piece<lb/>
with the 1948 book in its prose style and its multiplicity of examples, but<lb/>
it is far more personal—as in the delightful five-page tour of the great<lb/>
assemblage of illustrious antiquarian bookshops in London during his<lb/>
time, with his incisive impressions of their proprietors. Although the piece<lb/>
ends uncertainly, with some apprehension as to how collectors will react<lb/>
to the new investigative techniques affecting author bibliographies, the<lb/>
preceding four pages show that Carter, as usual, had kept abreast of de-<lb/>
velopments in analytical bibliography. It does not seem unexpected that<lb/>
he would give this climactic position, in an essay on book collecting, to<lb/>
bibliographical scholarship.<lb/>
<pb n="27"/>
<p>
In the spring of 1970 Carter completed his term as president of the <lb/>
Bibliographical Society; and from the autumn onward, his life was domi-<lb/>
nated by health problems, including some small strokes. He died on 18 <lb/>
March 1975, two months short of his seventieth birthday. During his last <lb/>
year he was awarded the Bibliographical Society’s Gold Medal, and two <lb/>
of his publications were tributes to Percy Muir and Graham Pollard, two <lb/>
friends with whom he had been closely associated since the late 1920s. I <lb/>
am glad that Lord Redcliffe-Maud, in his unpublished oration for Carter’s <lb/>
funeral at Eton on 5 May 1975, referred to Carter’s “unpatronising kind-<lb/>
ness to people younger (or less learned) than himself.” And it was equally <lb/>
important to mention his “extraordinary success in setting himself rigor-<lb/>
ous, incorruptible professional standards without ever losing his amateur <lb/>
status.” These, along with personal loyalty, were prominent among his <lb/>
defining characteristics.<lb/><lb/>
There are many reasons to remember John Carter. The first one I <lb/>
want to mention is his prose style—not that it is more important than his <lb/>
bibliographical contributions, but because it is basic to the role he played <lb/>
in bibliographical history as a communicator to a wide audience. And he <lb/>
does deserve attention as a writer. His prose, stylish and witty, is a joy to <lb/>
read, and once people start reading, they want to read more. That is why <lb/>
the <hi rend="italic">ABC</hi> has sold so well: it is not simply consulted as a reference book but <lb/>
read all the way through, since one entry leads a person on to the next. <lb/>
Even people not particularly interested in the book world, when they are <lb/>
exposed to an essay of his, want to find another one. And in the process, <lb/>
of course, they learn something about books. Which brings us to his role <lb/>
as an educator. The impulse for a good deal of his writing, I think, was <lb/>
to educate—both the general public and his book-world colleagues, to <lb/>
set them on a sensible course of thinking about books as physical objects. <lb/>
(Sadleir, reviewing the <hi rend="italic">ABC</hi> in <hi rend="italic">The Spectator</hi>, referred to Carter’s “quali-<lb/>
ties as an educator.”) That motive underlies not only the <hi rend="italic">ABC</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Binding <lb/>Variants</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Taste and Technique</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Printing and the Mind of Man</hi> but also the <lb/>
running commentary formed by his extensive journalism.<lb/><lb/>
Furthermore, he had the knowledge to be a generally reliable guide. <lb/>
He not only had the practical experience of examining thousands of books <lb/>
as a bookseller and a collector; he also had a thorough acquaintance with <lb/>
the history of his field and the literature of bibliographical scholarship, <lb/>
gained through reviewing many hundreds of books about books (it is hard <lb/>
to imagine that anyone has ever reviewed more of them). Occasionally, <lb/>
however, he faltered. His editions of Browne (the second one), Catullus, <lb/>
and Housman showed that he had not thought as carefully about textual <lb/>
criticism as he had about bibliophily and bibliography. Even in those <lb/>
areas, there were some minor missteps when he commented on original <lb/>
</p>
<pb n="28"/>
condition, the collation formula, and dust-jackets. But normally his judg-<lb/>
ments stand up well, as do his own bibliographical investigations. The <lb/>
study of nineteenth-century books has of course moved on from where <lb/>
he left it; but his Binding Variants, More Binding Variants, Publisher’s Cloth, <lb/>
and the Enquiry were pioneer efforts, demonstrating ways of focusing on <lb/>
physical evidence in nineteenth-century books. And his own principal <lb/>
collections remain intact, available to support further research: publish-<lb/>
ers’ bindings at the Bodleian, detective fiction and Housman at the Lilly, <lb/>
Catullus at Texas, and Cory at Eton.<lb/>
John Carter’s name was known to everyone in the English-speaking <lb/>
antiquarian-book world of the middle decades of the twentieth century. <lb/>
His presence was felt through his influential conversations and consulta-<lb/>
tions with collectors and dealers, librarians and scholars; his involvement <lb/>
with notable catalogues, important auctions, and celebrated transactions; <lb/>
his place on the boards of organizations and journals; his continuous <lb/>
reporting of bibliographical events and issues; his prolific reviewing of <lb/>
books, periodicals, and exhibitions; his lecturing to both scholarly and <lb/>
general audiences; and his authorship and editorship of innovative and <lb/>
fundamental publications. By means of these activities, he promoted in-<lb/>
ternational unity in the antiquarian-book world and publicized the inte-<lb/>
gral role of bibliographical scholarship in bookselling and book collecting. <lb/>
To have been the book-world voice for two generations, leaving a trail <lb/>
of informed and civilized commentary along with several classic works in <lb/>
admirable prose, is a considerable legacy.<lb/>

In sections D and E, <lb/>a letter preceding each entry indicates whether it is an article (A), an editorial (E), <lb/>a letter to an editor (L), a note or query (N), an obituary (O), or a book or journal <lb/>review (R). (Articles and notes can be long or short, and the distinction between <lb/>them can sometimes be subjective.) Offprints of articles, often made available <lb/>with printed wrappers (and sometimes with changed pagination), are not nor-<lb/>mally noted; but a few inscribed by Carter are cited. Cross-references consist of <lb/>a section letter followed by a year (and sometimes, for ease of reference, a month <lb/>also). All items are signed “John Carter” except where otherwise indicated.</p>
<p>Seven categories of material offer special problems, and my comments on <lb/>them here are meant to supplement the entries for them in the handlist below:</p>
<p>(1) Letters to Editors, 1927-75. Letters to editors formed an important genre <lb/>of writing for Carter, and he was a prolific writer of them. They appeared in a <lb/>wide range of journals, and I am well aware that there have to be a large number <lb/>that I have missed, especially in some of the book-trade weeklies and some of the <lb/>non-book-world periodicals. But many are here, offering a good sample of his <lb/>epistolary style, providing a considerable amount of biographical information, <lb/>and displaying the personality that the letters projected. For Carter’s many letters <lb/>to the Times Literary Supplement, see the discussion in section E below.</p>
<p>(2) Scribner Catalogues, 1927-53. Carter was employed by Charles Scribner’s <lb/>Sons in September 1927 as the London representative for the Scribner Book <lb/>Store in New York, with the responsibility for acquiring British and European <lb/>continental books to be sold in the store’s Rare Book Department. The head of <lb/>that department when Carter was hired was John C. Champion, who was suc-<lb/>ceeded in March 1935 by David A. Randall, with whom Carter worked until <lb/>Scribner’s London office was closed in 1953. Thus any of the approximately fifty <lb/>catalogues issued by the Rare Book Department between 1927 and 1953 (or the <lb/>nearly two dozen Rare Book Bulletins starting in 1939) could include entries <lb/>written by Carter, especially for books that he had supplied. Beginning with his <lb/>second trip to New York in early 1932, he worked closely with Champion and <lb/>was responsible for a changed direction in the catalogues, now featuring books <lb/>that reflected new approaches to collecting (an interest that resulted in 1934 in <lb/>his anthology New Paths in Book Collecting). The first of these was First Editions of <lb/>Famous Adventure Stories, 1831-1922 (catalogue 92, November 1932), and another <lb/>was Detective Fiction (catalogue 98, 1934); Carter wrote introductions to both. Af-<lb/>ter Randall’s arrival, the collaboration was even closer, and still more innovative <lb/>topics appeared. According to Randall’s autobiography, Dukedom Large Enough <lb/>(1969), Carter was responsible for catalogues dealing with the Modern Library, <lb/>“science and thought,” and classical music (though of course he would have <lb/>contributed to many others). There is sufficient evidence for including entries <lb/>for sixteen Scribner catalogues and one Rare Book Bulletin in section B below,</p>
<pb n="30"/>
<p>
as pamphlets edited by Carter: catalogues 92 (1932), 94-95 (1933), 98 (1934), 100 <lb/>
(1935), 112-13 (1937), 117 (1938), 119-21 (1938), 124 (1940), 131 (1945), 133 (1946), <lb/>
137 (1951), and 138 (1953) and bulletin 4 (1939). Other catalogues and bulletins <lb/>
may fall into this category as well (such as the undated and unnumbered 52-<lb/>
page catalogue, reproduced from typescript, of Conan Doyle material). Although <lb/>
Randall stated that he compiled Familiar Quotations: A Collection of Their Earliest <lb/>
Appearances (catalogue 102, 1935), it seems likely that Carter collaborated with <lb/>
him on the introduction. A blanket entry for all the Scribner catalogues and bul-<lb/>
letins from 1927 through 1953 is included in section C, as a way of representing <lb/>
the scattered entries and notes that he wrote for many catalogues over the years.<lb/>
(3) Double Crown Club Menus, 1933-36. A blanket entry for the delightful <lb/>
menus of this dining club of typophiles (of which Carter was president in 1946) <lb/>
is included in section B because Carter (elected to the Club in 1932) was secretary <lb/>
from 1933 to 1936 and can therefore be thought of as the editor of the menus <lb/>
during those years, each of which was designed by a different person (often a <lb/>
prominent book designer or artist). He designed two himself, numbers 38 (May <lb/>
1933) and 55 (April 1936); and he was the subject of a third, number 65 (February <lb/>
1938), which was for the meeting at which he spoke on “Cheap Reprints” (a talk <lb/>
printed in Typography for Winter 1938). Forty-eight of the menus from Carter’s <lb/>
own collection (ranging from 1924, when the Club began, to 1970, and including <lb/>
the two he designed) were listed in Potter Books catalogue 7 (May 1977). Carter <lb/>
was also one of the speakers who participated in the discussion of Stanley Mori-<lb/>
son at the November 1967 dinner, which resulted in a separate publication (see <lb/>
C:1968). A biographical entry for Carter is included in The Double Crown Club: <lb/>
Register of Past and Present Members (1949); and James Moran’s The Double Crown <lb/>
Club: A History of Fifty Years (1974) quotes from Carter’s witty reports on the meet-<lb/>
ings and is entered in section C.<lb/>
(4) Pseudonymous and Unsigned Contributions to Bibliographical Notes &amp; Que-<lb/>
ries, 1935-39. This journal resulted from conversations among the members of <lb/>
Michael Sadleir’s informal dining group (the “Biblio Boys”), who recognized the <lb/>
desirability of greater communication in the rare-book world. P. H. Muir (of El-<lb/>
kin Mathews Ltd.) was its editor from the start, in January 1935, with David A. <lb/>
Randall (of Scribner’s) joining him as “American editor” in October. Although <lb/>
members of the group did their best to support the journal through numerous <lb/>
contributions, many under pseudonyms, there was insufficient material for it to <lb/>
continue after May 1939. (At that point fifteen issues—four for 1935 designated <lb/>
as volume 1 and eleven, numbered as twelve, for 1936-39 as volume 2—had <lb/>
been published, totaling 151 pages and containing 330 queries, with replies to <lb/>
many of them; Cordex “self-binding” cases, with gilt-lettered spines, for shelving <lb/>
each of the two volumes were also available.) Carter contributed 39 items using <lb/>
his own name, and some of his comments were substantial: for example, his notes <lb/>
on Thomas Gray’s Odes (in May 1936 and April and November 1938) amount <lb/>
to more than 2500 words, and those on Florence Nightingale’s Notes (October <lb/>
1935), a 1684 edition of Catullus (May 1936), and Melville’s Typee (February <lb/>
1937) are at least 750 words each. And the only two articles that appeared in the <lb/>
journal, written to fill out the last two pages of the last two issues, were his. He <lb/>
</p>
<pb n="31"/>
also contributed under several pseudonyms. In his own bound set of the fifteen<lb/>
issues (now in my collection), Carter wrote, “Among the pen names adopted by<lb/>
J.W.C. are Richard Gullible, Harriet Marlow, E. Schlengemann, George Wayn-<lb/>
flete, Milton A. Hellman.” He also identified “Harriet Marlow,” a name taken<lb/>
from Beckford’s fiction, as his in <hi rend="italic">Publishers’ Weekly</hi> 140 (1941 [9 August]): 381.<lb/>
“E. Schlengemann” was the person from whom the British Museum bought its<lb/>
first copies of the forgeries (see the <hi rend="italic">Enquiry</hi>, p. 145). It is surprising that “Richard<lb/>
Gullible” is in this list because that name was used by Richard Jennings in 1934<lb/>
for his series of six parodies (sent to Carter and Graham Pollard as letters) that<lb/>
came to be known as the ”Gullible Papers”; Carter arranged for the printing of<lb/>
those leaflets, and his account is in <hi rend="italic">The Book Collector</hi> 8 (1959): 182–83 (see also lot<lb/>
44 in the Sotheby catalogue of the Carter sale, 24 March 1976). But his listing<lb/>
of the name here means that the two items signed with this name in <hi rend="smallcaps">BN&amp;Q</hi> can<lb/>
be assigned to him. Since he says that these five names were “among” the ones<lb/>
he used, there were certainly others. Percy Muir, in a letter to me on 5 April<lb/>
1978, said that “all the Carter aliases” in the journal were “Harriet Marlow,” “E.<lb/>
Schlengemann,” and “Holmlock Shears”; but he then named two more as “pos-<lb/>
sibles”: “Ignoramus” and “Michael Trevanion.” The latter is well established<lb/>
as a name used by Simon Nowell-Smith and can be ruled out. But if we accept<lb/>
“Holmlock Shears” (used once) and “Ignoramus” (used twice), we have seven<lb/>
names, and I have included items with all seven signatures in section D below<lb/>
(totaling 42 items). It is likely that there are still other pseudonymous contribu-<lb/>
tions by Carter, and some of the unsigned items might be his as well; to cover<lb/>
this possibility, section D also includes a blanket entry for such pieces at 1935–39.<lb/>
<lb/>
(5) <hi rend="bold">British Information Services Pamphlets</hi>. From November 1943 through Oc-<lb/>
tober 1945, Carter was director of the General Division of British Information<lb/>
Services in New York (at 30 Rockefeller Plaza). One of his responsibilities was to<lb/>
oversee the preparation and production of the many BIS publications, including<lb/>
a large series of pamphlets intended for wide public distribution, as he explained<lb/>
in a detailed article about the BIS operation, “Publishing—But for Free,” in <hi rend="italic">Publishers’<lb/>
Weekly</hi> on 10 November 1945 (148: 2136–39). Any, or all, of the BIS pamphlets published<lb/>
during this period can be considered to have been edited by him, but his exact<lb/>
(and no doubt varying) involvement in them is not known. One that appeared<lb/>
soon after his arrival (and is mentioned in his 1945 article) is likely to have<lb/>
received particular editorial attention from him, given his admiration for<lb/>
Churchill: <hi rend="italic">Winston Churchill, Prime Minister: A Selection from Speeches Made by<lb/>
Winston Churchill during the Four Years That Britain Has Been at War</hi> (December<lb/>
1943). The pamphlets dealt not only with the war but also with British life in<lb/>
general; other titles from these years include <hi rend="italic">Britain’s Industrial Cities</hi> (1944), <hi rend="italic">Britain’s<lb/>
Sea Power</hi> (1944), <hi rend="italic">The British Commonwealth and Empire</hi> (1944), <hi rend="italic">Fifty Facts about<lb/>
the Middle East</hi> (1944), <hi rend="italic">Flying Bombs</hi> (1944), <hi rend="italic">John Britain</hi> (1944), <hi rend="italic">A Picture of<lb/>
Britain: Background of a People</hi> (1944), <hi rend="italic">African Achievement</hi> (1945), <hi rend="italic">Britain’s<lb/>
Future in the Making</hi> (1945), <hi rend="italic">The British Merchant Navy</hi> (1945), and <hi rend="italic">Miracle<lb/>
Harbor</hi> (1945). To cover Carter’s editorial work on BIS publications, a blanket<lb/>
entry is included in section B at 1943–45. Only one of the BIS pamphlets, <hi rend="italic">Victory in<lb/>
Burma</hi> (1945), is known to have been entirely written by Carter, and it is listed in<lb/>
section A.<lb/>
<pb n="32"/>
<p>
<lb/>(6) Unsigned Commentary in <hi rend="italic">The Book Collector</hi>, 1952-75. Carter’s set of <hi rend="italic">The Book Collector</hi> is at the Library of Congress. There are well over a hundred places <lb/>where Carter made some kind of marginal note (or put a question mark or excla-<lb/>mation point in the margin), often for the purpose of questioning a statement or <lb/>its wording; and there are about sixty places where he simply put a line or a check <lb/>mark or an X in the margin. In only fourteen places did he indicate his author-<lb/>ship of unsigned paragraphs in the ”Commentary” (or “News and Comment”) <lb/>section by writing his initials or “I drafted this” in the margin. There may be no <lb/>distinction between these two kinds of annotation; but it is possible that “I drafted <lb/>this” indicates later revision by someone else (though the result would probably <lb/>still be primarily his writing). All fourteen are given entries in section D below. <lb/>It seems very likely that he wrote still other unsigned paragraphs as well, and <lb/>they are represented by a blanket entry for 1952-75. As for his pseudonymous <lb/>contributions of notes and queries to <hi rend="italic">The Book Collector</hi>, see the discussion above <lb/>for <hi rend="italic">Bibliographical Notes &amp; Queries</hi>, since he continued to use the same pseudonyms <lb/>in this revival of the function of the old journal.
</p>
<p>
<lb/>(7) Sotheby Catalogues, 1955-72. From October 1955, when Carter became an <lb/>associate in the book department at Sotheby’s, until July 1972, when he retired, <lb/>he was in a position to write up entries for inclusion in Sotheby auction cata-<lb/>logues, and he occasionally did so. For example, Anthony Hobson told me that <lb/>Carter gave him a hand in cataloguing Sydney Cockerell’s collection in 1956. <lb/>And John Kerr and P. J. Croft identified for me several lots that were described <lb/>by Carter: in the 1 December 1964 sale, lots 526 and 528; 6-7 December 1966, <lb/>lot 611; 8-9 July 1968, lots 782-827 and 840; and 9-10 December 1968, lots 756-<lb/>57a. He also catalogued the manuscript of Evelyn Waugh’s <hi rend="italic">Scoop</hi> for the sale <lb/>of 7-8 July 1969 and Lear’s <hi rend="italic">A Book of Nonsense</hi> for the sale of 22 June 1970, and <lb/>any lot of Housman material was probably catalogued by him. But according <lb/>to Hobson and Kerr, he did not otherwise write many catalogue entries. I have <lb/>included a blanket entry in section C for all the Sotheby catalogues from 1955 <lb/>to 1972, as a way of representing the scattered entries that he wrote over the <lb/>years. Also entered in section C are a preface, an introduction, and a note of <lb/>acknowledgment that have been identified as his in the catalogues for the Sadleir <lb/>(1958), Silver (1965), and Diaghilev (1968) sales. There are two catalogues that <lb/>have so far been identified as ones that Carter was entirely responsible for: those <lb/>for the Pariser sale of Wiseiana on 4-5 December 1967 and for the Ewing sale <lb/>of Victorian fiction on 12-13 October 1970; these catalogues are given entries in <lb/>section B, as books edited by Carter.
</p>
<p>
<lb/>The basis for the attribution of other unsigned or pseudonymous publications, <lb/>except for those in the <hi rend="italic">Times Literary Supplement</hi>, is sometimes explained within the <lb/>entries themselves and otherwise can normally be assumed to be the collections of <lb/>press cuttings in the Eton and Cambridge University libraries. For the unsigned <lb/>contributions to the <hi rend="italic">Times Literary Supplement</hi>, see section E below.
</p>
<p>
<lb/>Finally, there are two other matters I must comment on. First is the question <lb/>whether Carter wrote <hi rend="italic">The Fall of the Titan</hi> (London: Lincoln Williams, 1934), a <lb/>novel by “John Waynflete,” according to the title page. The authorship of this <lb/>
</p>
<pb n="33"/>
<p>work has often been attributed to John Carter by collectors and library cata<lb/>loguers because his middle name was Waynflete and because he occasionally <lb/>used “John Waynflete” as a pseudonym beginning in 1944 (having used “George <lb/>Waynflete” from 1939 and “Waynflete” from 1940). Neither the content nor the <lb/>stilted style of this sentimental anti-Labour novel suggests Carter’s authorship; <lb/>but the idea has been proposed that it might have been written as a parody. The <lb/>question is fully discussed in the appendix below. Since Carter’s authorship has <lb/>never been proved or disproved (but seems unlikely), I am mentioning the book <lb/>here rather than including it in the handlist.<lb/></p>
<p>Second, during the time (April 1953 to October 1955) when Carter was the <lb/>personal assistant to Sir Roger Makins, the British ambassador to the United <lb/>States, he wrote some speeches and articles for Makins. A few of them, in the <lb/>form of carbon-copy typescripts (annotated by Carter) and in published form <lb/>(no doubt revised by Makins), are in the Carter collection at Eton. The extent to <lb/>which Makins’s published articles reflect Carter’s ghostwriting is uncertain, and <lb/>I have not included any of them in the handlist.<lb/></p>
<p>I have collected Carter’s publications for many years, and that process has <lb/>brought numerous items to my attention that I would not otherwise have known <lb/>about. I have also drawn on the collections of Carter material at Eton College, <lb/>King’s College Cambridge, the Cambridge University Library, the Bodleian Li-<lb/>brary, the Library of Congress, the Lilly Library, the Grolier Club, the Harry <lb/>Ransom Center, and the R. R. Bowker Company. There are many people to <lb/>whom I owe a debt of gratitude. I wish first to acknowledge the generosity of A. <lb/>S. G. Edwards, who has repeatedly alerted me to (and even provided copies of ) <lb/>many obscure items over the past forty years. He also read a draft of this essay <lb/>and handlist, as did Nicolas Barker (who made helpful comments) and Michael <lb/>Meredith (whose help included checking some material at Eton that I might not <lb/>have seen on my visit there). In addition, I wish to record my indebtedness to <lb/>the following individuals (many of them now deceased): Richard Bucci, Ernes-<lb/>tine Carter, Sebastian Carter, Meghan Constantinou, P. J. Croft, Arthur Crook, <lb/>Brooke Crutchley, Scott Ellwood, Basie Bales Gitlin, Harrison Hayford, Richard <lb/>Colles Johnson, John Kerr, Marie Korey, Richard Landon, Elizabeth Lynch, <lb/>Charles W. Mann, William Matheson, David McKitterick, Percy Muir, A. N. L. <lb/>Munby, Paul Needham, Robert Nikirk, Simon Nowell-Smith, Jean Peters, David <lb/>A. Randall, Ronald R. Randall, William B. Todd, David L. Vander Meulen, <lb/>James M. Wells, and David Whitesell. For permission to quote from Carter’s <lb/>unpublished annotations, I am grateful to Michael Meredith, acting on behalf of <lb/>Eton College Library.<lb/></p>

In the copy in my collection (inscribed “ex dono authoris 1933”), Carter changed the printed date “MCMXXXII” to “MCMXXXIII” and (another matter of dating) revised the first line of page [7] by deleting “to be” and “shortly” from the statement that his Browne edition was “to be published shortly.” Cf.

I also selected the photographs, which I still think first-rate.” For Carter’s<lb/>
account of the publication program of British Information Services in New<lb/>

October 1945), see his “Publishing—But for Free” (D:1945, November). In<lb/>
that article he refers to <hi rend="italic">Victory in Burma</hi> as one of the “popular pamphlets”<lb/>
dealing with the war but does not reveal his authorship of it. Given the huge<lb/>
numbers of these pamphlets that were printed, <hi rend="italic">Victory in Burma</hi> must have<lb/>
been the most widely circulated of all Carter’s writings, with the possible<lb/>

<pb n="37"/>
<p>indicating that the book could be ordered from Bowker for $5, notes that<lb/>
Carter’s work “is always eagerly awaited by fellow bookmen on both sides<lb/>
of the Atlantic.” According to Bowker records, 2000 copies were published<lb/>
on 26 July 1948. An advance extract from the last chapter (“Condition”)<lb/>
had been published in Publishers’ Weekly (also published by Bowker) on 22<lb/>
November 1947 (D:1947). On 8 June 1948 Carter wrote to Sol Malkin (edi-<lb/>
tor of Antiquarian Bookman), asking him to include, in the issue closest to the<lb/>
book’s publication date, a notice (in the “Sack Cloth and Ashes Department”)<lb/>
of an error in his discussion of a variant in Boswell’s Johnson (this letter is<lb/>
cited in Richard Cady catalogue 21 [1985], item 23). Then in early 1949,<lb/>
Carter arranged for an erratum slip to be printed, correcting this error: on<lb/>
page 98 he had said that the “gve/give” variant in Boswell’s Johnson<lb/>
is one of two examples of points that are “neither interesting nor significant”; the er-<lb/>
ratum slip notes that “the priority of the gve reading was long ago established<lb/>
by Prof. Pottle” in his bibliography of Boswell. A proof of this erratum slip,<lb/>
dated 1 February 1949, is in the Bowker files; a copy of the final slip, signed<lb/>
“J.C.” in print, is taped into the Rosenwald copy in the Library of Congress.<lb/>
By 7 November 1955, there were still 133 copies of the book unsold, and<lb/>
these were given to Carter.<lb/>
English (Cambridge University Press) edition: Cambridge: Cam-<lb/>
bridge University Press, 1948. xi,201 pp. Cloth, dust-jacket. Price 15s.<lb/>
1500 copies printed (according to a publisher’s dummy in the collection of Richard<lb/>
Landon). The Cambridge edition (a new typesetting) was published three<lb/>
months after the American edition, on 29 October 1948, according to a re-<lb/>
view copy in my collection. And the copy (also in my collection) that Carter<lb/>
gave to his friend Brooke Crutchley, the University printer, has an inscription<lb/>
(“for the printer from a completely satisfied author”) dated 26 October 1948.<lb/>
(The American preface is dated 1 December 1947, and the English preface<lb/>
is dated 21 July 1948, only five days before the American publication date.)<lb/>
Since the error that necessitated the erratum slip in the American edition had<lb/>
come to Carter’s attention by early June (see above), he was able to make a<lb/>
change during production of the Cambridge edition. A set of the Cambridge<lb/>
proofs in my collection, dated 5–6 May 1948 (with the title-page date of “194”,<lb/>
before the fourth digit was known), has the same erroneous text on p. 103 that<lb/>
the American edition has on p. 98. But the Cambridge edition as published<lb/>
in October has a revised text, with the passage altered in two ways. First, the<lb/>
cancels in Shelley and Conrad, which in the earlier text “produced a genuine<lb/>
distinction of issue,” now “make a proper bibliographical ‘point.’” Second,<lb/>
the Boswell example is attached to this sentence (“as does the misprint ‘gve’<lb/>
for ‘give’ on p. 135, vol. 1 of Boswell”), so that in the next sentence only some<lb/>
transposed lines in South Wind (and not the Boswell misprint) are “neither<lb/>
interesting nor significant.” The introduction was reprinted (condensed) from<lb/>
the English edition in Good Living (C:1948) and, from the American edition, in<lb/>
William Targ’s Bouillabaisse for Bibliophiles (C:1955); chapter 10 was reprinted<lb/>
(condensed) from the American edition as “Bookseller and Auctioneer” in<lb/>
The Atlantic Monthly (D:1948, July) and, from the English edition, as “Book-<lb/>
shop and Auction Room” in The Bookseller (D:1948, December); and chapter <lb/>
</p>
<pb n="38"/>
<p>11 was reprinted (condensed) from the American edition as “Reflections on Rarity” in The New Colophon (D:1948, April).<lb/>The tenth paragraph of chapter 10 was quoted on the front cover of AB Bookman’s Weekly for 20-27 Septem-<lb/>ber 1976 (58: 1545). Second impression, with corrections: 1949. The correction to page 103 made in the first Cambridge impression evidently did<lb/>not seem adequate to Carter, for in the second impression he deleted the Boswell reference entirely (shortening the page by one line, accommodated<lb/>by a larger space in the mid-page section division).</p>

Includes material “to be read<lb/>as a paper to the Bibliographical Society [in November],” as stated in a<lb/>“Prefatory Note” dated 25 October 1948. Dedicated to “S.M.” and “M.S.”<lb/>(Stanley Morison and Michael Sadleir). In an inscribed copy (listed in Ulysses<lb/>Bookshop catalogue 13 [1992], item 104), Carter wrote below the eight-line<lb/>Latin dedication, “The only work in Latin of John Carter.” (But he also wrote<lb/>a Latin dedication for his Morison handlist, A:1950.) Reissue with a leaflet of<lb/>“Corrections and Additions” laid in: 1967 (leaflet date). [4],95 pp. See A:1967.</p>
<p>A:1950<lb/>A Handlist of the Writings of Stanley Morison. With notes by Morison and indexes<lb/>by Graham Pollard. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press for private dis-<lb/>tribution, 1950. ix,46 pp. Paper-covered boards, dust-jacket. Limited to 500<lb/>copies. A tribute to Morison on his sixtieth birthday (6 May 1949). Laid into<lb/>some copies is Morison’s eight-page Prolegomena ad Curriculum Vitae (Cam-<lb/>bridge, 1949). Carter’s copy, with his bookplate, at the Library of Congress<lb/>provides additional information. At the foot of the front free endpaper he<lb/>wrote: “First copies bound 7 June for distribution to some of those attending<lb/>at the Senate House, Cambridge, 8 June, for S.M’s Litt.D.” He also wrote<lb/>on this endpaper: “There are two states of the dedication leaf: this is the<lb/>second.” The dedication in this copy reads “EDVARDO / DIANAE FILIO<lb/>/ VIATICVM”. On a letter of thanks from Morison to Carter, 15 June 1950<lb/>(laid in), Carter noted: “a longer and more specific dedication was provided<lb/>(at the printer’s request) for the majority of copies.” In a fuller account for<lb/>The Book Collector (“Morisonianum,” D:1965, Autumn), Carter gave the text<lb/>of the longer dedication: “EDVARDO / HVNC PATRINI SVI / SCRIP-<lb/>TORIVM CATALOGVM / A PATRE EXCVSVM / DICAT EDITOR”. <lb/>He also explained that the shorter dedication was his original and preferred<lb/>one and that he asked the printer to use it for a few copies after the main</p>
<pb n="39"/>
<p>press run had been completed.<lb/>
Thus the second state as printed preserves<lb/>
the earlier version of the text. There is also a printed presentation slip (“with<lb/>
the compliments of the author and printer”) laid in Carter’s copy and an<lb/>
erratum slip stapled to the verso of the dedication leaf: “For MR MORI-<lb/>
SON, read DR MORISON, passim / (The edition of this erratum is limited<lb/>
to 25 copies)”. Although the book was not intended for public sale, Carter<lb/>
reported in his <hi rend="italic">Book&amp;nbsp;Collector</hi> piece that fifty copies in 1958, and twelve more<lb/>
in 1965, were sold to Elkin Mathews for sale to the public. For Carter’s later<lb/>

is “Todd dustjacket / 7i” in the upper right corner of the title page. The<lb/>
reference is to Thomas J. Wise: Centenary Studies, edited by William B. Todd<lb/>
(C:1959), the jacket of which is mentioned in the first sentence of this pam-<lb/>
phlet. Carter may simply be calling attention to the fact that the jacket copy<lb/>
considers The Death of Balder a potential Wise forgery, whereas this Working<lb/>
Paper shows that it was not. The significance of “7i” is not clear, but pos-<lb/>
sibly Carter wished to make a change (not necessarily connected with that<lb/>
jacket) in the footnote (numbered 1) on page 7. The only other annotation<lb/>
is on page 11, where he underlined “three years” and put a question mark<lb/>
in the margin.<lb/></p>

(pp. 123-46). London: Cassell &amp; Co., at La Belle Sauvage, 1932. xx,146 <lb/>
pp., with 30 collotype illustrations by Paul Nash (hand-colored by pochoir). <lb/>
Vellum binding inlaid with morocco, designed by Nash. Limited to 215 cop-<lb/>
ies, priced at 15 guineas. Printed at the Curwen Press, overseen by Oliver <lb/>
Simon. The four-page prospectus (including a specimen of page 26) states: <lb/>
“One copy consisting of two volumes, the first <hi rend="italic">Urne Buriall</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Garden <lb/>of Cyrus</hi>, the second a portfolio of all Mr. Nash’s original drawings, both <lb/>
specially bound, at 350 guineas.” An indication of Carter’s research for <lb/>
this edition is offered by his copy of Edward H. Marshall’s 1929 Macmillan <lb/>
edition, interleaved with his extensive notes and the results of his collations <lb/>
of earlier editions (described in G. F. Sims catalogue 102 [1979], item 85). <lb/>
There is a set of proofs at the Grolier Club and another in my collection, <lb/>
with material in both cases relating to the preparation of the 1958 revised <lb/>
edition. My set, which is the earlier of the two, is a bound one that Carter <lb/>
gave to John Sparrow (who wrote his name and “d.d.editor” on the front <lb/>
free endpaper). On the half-title, Carter noted, “2nd proof corrected”, and <lb/>
he wrote “final proof” on the divisional title for <hi rend="italic">The Garden of Cyrus</hi>; <lb/>
he entered fourteen marginal revisions on five pages of the introduction and <lb/>
27 corrections on fifteen pages of <hi rend="italic">Urne Buriall</hi>. Laid into the volume is <lb/>
a list of ten “proposals” for changes to be made in the text being prepared <lb/>
for the 1958 Cambridge edition—a list that was marked to be sent to Geof-<lb/>
frey Keynes, John Hayward, John Sparrow, and Jeremiah Finch (a Browne <lb/>
scholar at Princeton). The Grolier set (also bound, from Carter’s library) is <lb/>
designated as the final proofs on the spine and incorporates in the printed <lb/>
text all of the changes entered in the margins of my set. It does contain nu-<lb/>
merous marginal revisions and corrections, but they are for the 1958 edition, <lb/>
and they include all but one of the proposed changes on the list laid into my <lb/>
set. (The one not included consists of three alterations in the passage begin-<lb/>
ning at line 12 on page 74: “their” for “the” before “true”, “or” for “of” <lb/>
after “ours”, and “contrive” or “contain” for “continue”.) The fortunes of <lb/>
the 1932 edition after publication were partly told in a letter from Desmond <lb/>
Flower (of Cassell’s) to Geoffrey Keynes on 8 February 1965 (the copy sent <lb/>
to Carter is at the Grolier Club). Upon publication, only 29 copies were sold <lb/>
at the original price of fifteen guineas (owing to the Depression), and soon <lb/>
afterward 37 sets of sheets were sold to the Redfern Gallery. In 1941 Cas-<lb/>
sell’s premises at La Belle Sauvage, an old Ludgate Hill coaching inn, were <lb/>
destroyed by German bombs, and 20–30 bound copies were lost. But some <lb/>
sets of sheets (possibly close to a hundred), having been stored in a subsidiary <lb/>
warehouse, were spared. Many of these were made available to the Folio <lb/>
Society, which was licensed to sell them in a binding with Nash’s original <lb/>
designs. In an advertisement headed “Treasure Trove” in <hi rend="italic">The Book Handbook</hi> <lb/>
for June 1951 (2.2:x), the Folio Society announced the availability of cop-<lb/>
ies bound by Sangorski &amp; Sutcliffe, in a slip-case, for twenty guineas. The <lb/>
</p>
<pb n="45"/>
<p>price had gone up to £36 by 1965, when sets of sheets were still available<lb/>
for binding to order. The “Appendix” (pp. 141-46) was reprinted, with some<lb/>
added introductory paragraphs, as “The Iniquity of Oblivion Foil’d” in The<lb/>
Colophon (D:1933, February) and as a separate (A:1933); the last chapter was<lb/>
reprinted as a separate by the Rampant Lions Press (B:1946).</p>
<p>Revised edition: Edited by Carter, with a “Preface” (pp. vii–viii) and<lb/>
appendixes (pp. 115-20). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1958.<lb/>
viii,120 pp. Cloth, dust-jacket. 3000 copies. The copy that Carter inscribed<lb/>
to his aunt, Faith Compton Mackenzie (in my collection), is dated 28–29<lb/>
October 1958. In the copy that Carter labeled “working copy” on the dust-<lb/>
jacket and the front free endpaper (in my collection), he listed four page<lb/>
numbers (45, 48, 58, 89) on the front free endpaper and called them “Que-<lb/>
ries” (not corrections), but his annotations appear on other pages as well.<lb/>
Most of them contain references to “LCM”— that is, L. C. Martin’s 1964<lb/>
edition —but without any implication that the Martin readings should be<lb/>
accepted (and indeed those at 48.4 and 68.30 had already been rejected in<lb/>
his published notes). The LCM annotations are as follows: 30.5 “LCM”;<lb/>
37.24 “LCM unlike” [for “nor like”]; 48.4 “LCM contriving” [for “continu-<lb/>
ing”]; 48.22-26 “?see LCM”; 66.1 “LCM conjecture contained” [for “con-<lb/>
tinued”]; 68.30 “LCM conjecture containe” [for “continue”]; 69.6 “LCM<lb/>
[delete sign]” [deleting a comma after “divisions”]. There are three other<lb/>
annotations relating to Browne’s text. On page 45, Carter marked for possi-<lb/>
ble deletion (with a question mark) the comma after “hope” in line 18, add-<lb/>
ing the marginal note “(see Lytton Strachey)”—whose analysis of Browne’s<lb/>
style is referred to twice in Carter’s preface. And there are marginal notes<lb/>
on pages 58 (the insertion of “which” before “with” in line 14) and 89<lb/>
(“seases” for “creases” in line 24, with a question mark), both of which are<lb/>
marked out. In “A Note on the Text,” he changed “compositor” to “press-<lb/>
corrector” (117.27). Second impression: 1967. 2000 copies. The Grolier<lb/>
Club copy of the 1967 impression, which Carter labeled “working copy” on<lb/>
the dust-jacket, has, on the front free endpaper, the date 8 August 1967 and<lb/>
a list of nine page numbers headed “Correct” along with one page number<lb/>
labeled “Queries.” Two of the page numbers refer to editorial matter, but<lb/>
the other eight point to readings requiring correction in Browne’s text, and<lb/>
all eight had been reported to Carter by Geoffrey Keynes in a letter of 4<lb/>
June 1968 (laid into the Grolier Club copy). That letter was apparently<lb/>
occasioned by a letter from Carter following the publication of Keynes’s<lb/>
edition of Browne’s Selected Writings (Faber &amp; Faber, 1968), which includes<lb/>
Carter’s texts. Keynes begins, “I could have sworn I did send you a list of<lb/>
errors,” and the list is as follows (erroneous readings first): 33.16 body of ]<lb/>
body of the / 35.21 Ecclisiastes] Ecclesiastes / 36.6 acccount] account / 77.17<lb/>
pastick] plastick / 84.25 hioides of ] hioides or / 95.17 road and] and road<lb/>

Limited <lb/>to 100 numbered copies, two of them on blue paper. Carter-Sparrow-White <lb/>(A:1952) 1a. Housman wrote to Carter on 9 November 1933 saying that, <lb/>although he “was not a willing party to the original publication [in 1892] . . . <lb/>your flattering proposal, if carried out, will not make matters perceptibly <lb/>worse; so I offer no objection.” On 5 December 1933, he added, “I should <lb/>like to have it stated that the Council of University College, not I, had the <lb/>lecture printed [in 1892]. I consented, because it seemed churlish to refuse.” <lb/>The copy in my collection, which came from Carter’s library, has a pencil <lb/>line in the margin beside the bottom eleven lines of page 21 and the top five <lb/>of page 22 (on the importance of “the hunger and thirst for knowledge” in <lb/>human life), and another one beside the bottom five lines of page 22 and the <lb/>top ten of page 23 (on the value of knowledge), with lines 7-8 underlined <lb/>(“let us insist that the pursuit of knowledge, like the pursuit of righteousness, <lb/>is part of man’s duty to himself”).

Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1961. xv,204 pp. Hardback (with<lb/>
dust-jacket) and paperback. Carter-Sparrow-White (A:1952) 21. In the Eton<lb/>
copy of the Collamore exhibition catalogue (C:1961), Carter noted that his<lb/>
preface to the <hi rend="italic">Selected Prose</hi> incorporates most (except for the conclusion) of<lb/>
his address at that exhibition opening. In a note in <hi rend="italic">The Book Collector</hi> a year<lb/>
later (“Housmaniana,” D:1962, Spring), he explained the production history<lb/>
of the book: “The first impression (serving both the British and American<lb/>
markets) bears on the reverse of the title-leaf the legend ‘Reprinted in the<lb/>
United States of America’. The collector will naturally infer an earlier print-<lb/>
ing: he will be wrong. The bibliographer will wonder, reprinted from what?<lb/>
The explanation is that the book was set at Cambridge (the page-proofs, to<lb/>
which I happen to have access, carry the normal imprint of the University<lb/>
Printer); the edition was then produced in the United States by photo-offset<lb/>
from ‘reproduction proofs’; it was bound and jacketed (for the cloth issue)<lb/>
and wrappered (for the paperback) also in the United States; and the cop-<lb/>
ies for publication from Bentley House on 8 Nov. 1961 (20 Oct. from CUP<lb/>
New York) shipped across the Atlantic.” For Carter’s other editions of Hous-<lb/>

typography, book production and the graphic arts”; one of the “members”<lb/>
of the Foundation was Stanley Morison. The prospectus does not indicate<lb/>
<pb n="53"/>
<p>that the Foundation was financed by Mary Jean Kempner Thorne, primar-<lb/>

<p>Printing and the Mind of Man: A Descriptive Catalogue Illustrating the Impact of Print <lb/>
on the Evolution of Western Civilization during Five Centuries. Edited by Carter <lb/>
and Percy H. Muir. London: Cassell, [1966]. 16 pp. Wrappers. A “specimen” <lb/>
(so called in the introductory essay on the inside front wrapper) to advertise <lb/>
the full edition (B:1967), it consists of the first sixteen pages of the main text <lb/>
of the projected volume (a single sewn gathering) with added wrappers. The <lb/>
text is in a preliminary state—the major difference being that there is an <lb/>
illustration for the Thomas Littleton entry (no. 23) and none for Aesop (no. <lb/>
15), whereas the reverse is true in the published book. The recto of the front <lb/>
wrapper reproduces the title-page wording of the book but in a different set-<lb/>
ting. The essay on the verso of the front wrapper, entitled “The Impact of <lb/>
Print,” with Carter’s characteristic phrasing, was obviously written by him; <lb/>
it was later used (with the title and the last two sentences deleted, along with <lb/>
nine smaller revisions) on the book’s dust-jacket flaps. (It was also used in a <lb/>
four-page prospectus, where Carter is known to have changed by hand the <lb/>
phrase “full descriptions” to “in-depth descriptions” in the third sentence.) <lb/>
In the copy of the specimen in my collection, presented by Carter to Arthur <lb/>
Cohen on Michaelmas 1966, Carter wrote a note on the inside back wrapper <lb/>
regarding the price of “approximately” nine guineas listed among the statis-<lb/>
tics and specifications printed there: “this was figured before the September <lb/>
estimate reduction: should not therefore be exceeded.” The price when pub-<lb/>
lished was seven guineas.<lb/></p>

Carter wrote the annotations for entries 14 (Maimonides), 122 (Shakespeare<lb/>
Folio), 354 (Alice in Wonderland), and 424 (Churchill’s speech of 20 August<lb/>
1940) and that he collaborated with Muir on entries 302 (Murray’s Travel-<lb/>

an article by Carter and John Sparrow in the Times Literary Supplement<lb/>
(E2:1968, November). Published 11 November 1969. In the “Note on the<lb/>
Text,” Carter points out that Housman’s manuscript has no title other than<lb/>
“Cambridge inaugural.” The decision to supply a title, he says, was not his.<lb/>
“But,” he adds, “having deferred to the decision, I discovered in myself a<lb/>
disinclination to defer to anyone else’s preference in such presumption;<lb/>
so, for better or worse, the title here given to the Cambridge inaugural is<lb/>
mine.” Carter reported two errors in a letter published in the Times Literary<lb/>
Supplement on 27 November 1969, p. 1362: at 22.19, “preserved” should be<lb/>
“preserve”; at 23.11, “examples” should be “example”. Carter first pub-<lb/>

conclusion of his address at the opening of the exhibition (and the rest of the <lb/>
address was used in the preface to Selected Prose [B:1961]). He also states that <lb/>
the following sentence (on p. 36, lines 18-19) was written by David Randall: <lb/>
“The Sophocles and Plautus I managed to rescue must be among the few <lb/>
which survive today.” In my copy, in the blank space on p. 37, he adds: “this <lb/>
was not said by me, &amp; is not true. They came from some other, or through <lb/>

Eleventh International Printing Machinery and Allied Trades Exhibition . . . Assem-<lb/>
bled at the British Museum and at Earls Court, London, 16-27 July 1963 (London: <lb/>
F. W. Bridges &amp; Sons and the Association of British Manufacturers of Print-<lb/>
ers’ Machinery, 1963), pp. 7-9. (Cover subtitle: Catalogue of the Exhibitions at <lb/>
the British Museum and at Earls Court, London, 16-27 July 1963.) In a letter to <lb/>
David Randall on 18 December 1964 (at the Lilly Library), Carter says that <lb/>
the preface “was, as a matter of fact, written by the third of the signatories <lb/>
to it.” Carter was a member of the Supervisory Committee and would have <lb/>
been involved in various aspects of the preparation of this book, but he was <lb/>
not on the Editorial Board—nor on the British Museum Committee, which <lb/>
oversaw the historical exhibition of fine printing that was mounted in the <lb/>
British Museum (whereas the Earls Court exhibition displayed, along with <lb/>
printing equipment, books that were monuments of intellectual history). The <lb/>
catalogues of both exhibitions are included in this publication but are sepa-<lb/>
rately paginated. In the preface to the British Museum part, R. A. Wilson <lb/>
thanks Carter (along with Nicolas Barker and Percy Muir) for special help <lb/>
“in selecting the books and producing the following catalogue.” Carter’s <lb/>
Curwen Press edition of Browne (B:1932) is listed as item 177. Because the <lb/>
British Museum exhibition was to run two months longer than the one at <lb/>
Earls Court, its catalogue was made available separately, with the imprint of <lb/>
the British Museum and the title Printing and the Mind of Man: An Exhibition <lb/>
of Fine Printing in the King’s Library of the British Museum, July-September 1963. <lb/>
(There was also A Keepsake for Visitors of three pages). For the expanded work <lb/>

E. Contributions to the Times Literary Supplement, 1931-74<lb/>
Carter made almost a thousand contributions to the Times Literary Supplement<lb/>
from 26 March 1931 (a letter on “Original Boards”) through 3 May 1974 (a re-<lb/>
view of Sydney Roscoe’s book on John Newbery): about 700 were reviews, and<lb/>
the rest were letters and articles. Together they covered a remarkable number<lb/>
of the books, bibliographical periodicals, exhibitions, auctions, and other book-<lb/>
world events of their time. All the reviews were unsigned (following TLS policy<lb/>
until 1974), and all the letters were signed; some of the articles were signed, but<lb/>
<pb n="88"/>
most were not. It would be a pointless duplication to list all these contributions <lb/>
here because a nearly complete (and fully indexed) list is available to subscribers <lb/>
on the internet, in the TLS Historical Archive (at &lt;www.the-tls.co.uk>), which <lb/>
identifies the authorship of most unsigned pieces. It is easy to use: one simply <lb/>
enters Carter’s name and “Contributor” to see a nearly complete chronological <lb/>
list. In the list, every item has a citation (title, date, page); and for the pieces clas-<lb/>
sified as reviews, there are the names of the authors and the titles of the books and <lb/>
journals reviewed as well. Every item also has a link to a view of the original page.<lb/>
One can, if one wishes, limit the list to “Editorial” (which means articles and <lb/>
letters) or “Reviews.” Choosing “Reviews,” however, will not provide a list of <lb/>
all the reviews because some items are incorrectly classified in the Archive. For <lb/>
example, many short “articles,” and even some long ones, are actually reviews <lb/>
of books or journals but were not set up in the way reviews usually were, with <lb/>
details of the book or journal in the heading; as a result, they are not classified as <lb/>
reviews. (And occasionally the reverse is true.) Thus if one wishes to see whether <lb/>
Carter ever reviewed a particular book or journal in the TLS, one should (after <lb/>
entering Carter’s name as contributor) enter the name of the author or title of <lb/>
the book or journal as “Keyword” (rather than “Author” or “Book title”), and it <lb/>
will be located even if it does not appear in the heading of the piece. This search <lb/>
would then have to be supplemented by an examination of list E1 below.<lb/>
The Archive contains a few other errors, but they are normally obvious and <lb/>
pose no difficulty. For example, Carter’s second letter to the TLS, entitled “Sir <lb/>
Thomas Browne” on 16 July 1931, is listed twice because another letter on the <lb/>
same page, by three other writers, is entitled “Sir Thomas More,” and the entry <lb/>
mistakenly merges these two references and lists the merged entry twice. For a <lb/>
variety of reasons, many other duplicated entries exist, and the extra ones can be <lb/>
ignored, though they cause the stated total number of Carter’s contributions to <lb/>
be somewhat inflated—but see the first list below for items to be added, bringing <lb/>
the total back to nearly a thousand.<lb/>
There are two main sources for TLS authorship: the archival set of published <lb/>
issues (with the authors’ names written on them) and the “Stock Books” (showing <lb/>
the material available for use each week). Apparently the electronic Archive was <lb/>
based on the first, with occasional reference to the second when the first is unclear, <lb/>
as is implied in Derwent May’s 2001 book, Critical Times: The History of the “Times <lb/>
Literary Supplement” (p. xi). (This procedure is confirmed by the fact that in some <lb/>
instances the Archive fills the space for “Contributor” with the statement “can’t find <lb/>
in stock book.”) In 1977 and 1978, Arthur Crook (who had been editor of the TLS <lb/>
from 1959 to 1974 and was then hoping to write a history of the journal) kindly al-<lb/>
lowed me to examine the Stock Books, which I went through for the issues from 31 <lb/>
August 1940 to 5 November 1971 (but the bibliographical “back page” authors were <lb/>
not noted until 30 August 1941). I have checked my notes against the electronic <lb/>
Archive and have found that 59 items credited to Carter in the Stock Books are not <lb/>
assigned to him in the Archive. In all these cases except one, the Archive gives no <lb/>
contributor’s name, and many of them are classified as advertisements. (Perhaps the <lb/>
program called for a contributor’s name to be entered if “Review” were used; but <lb/>
“Editorial” did not, and it is not clear why “Advertisement” was sometimes chosen <lb/>
<pb n="89"/>
<p>when the contributor’s name was not indicated in the archival copies and could <lb/>
not be located in the Stock Books.) In the one instance where the Archive gives a <lb/>
contributor’s name for one of these items assigned to Carter in the Stock Books, the <lb/>
Archive is incorrect, as explained in the list below at 2 January 1953.<lb/></p>
<p>These pieces clearly are Carter’s work and should be added to the list of <lb/>
his contributions. Even with them added, some of Carter’s contributions are <lb/>
surely still not accounted for: anyone who attentively reads the <hi rend="smallcaps">TLS</hi> back page <lb/>
for this period will find elements of Carter’s style in other pieces, which is not <lb/>
surprising since he was in charge of the back page from 1946 to 1967 (except <lb/>
for 1953‒55, when he was in Washington). But I have not included <hi rend="smallcaps">TLS</hi> items <lb/>
solely on the basis of my judgment. It is perhaps unnecessary to tell future users <lb/>
of this handlist that the <hi rend="smallcaps">TLS</hi> Archive, like other electronic files, may at some <lb/>
point be revised—with the result that the errors and omissions noted here may <lb/>
be corrected.<lb/></p>
<p>In the first of two lists below, all the additions from the Stock Books (and four <lb/>
other additions) are recorded. The second list brings together Carter’s major <lb/>
contributions to the <hi rend="smallcaps">TLS</hi>, extracted from the full listing.<lb/></p>
<head>E1 Additions to the <hi rend="smallcaps">TLS</hi> Archive’s List of Carter’s Contributions</head>
<p>The items listed here, with four exceptions, are attributed to Carter in the Stock <lb/>
Books but are not credited to him (or anyone, except in one case) in the electronic <lb/>
Historical Archive. The four additions not from the Stock Books are a letter of <lb/>
12 August 1944, which is not credited to Carter in the Archive even though it <lb/>
is signed; an unsigned report on the Silver sale (2 December 1965), which is <lb/>
identified by a cutting at Eton; some paragraphs on the Maurice Pariser sale <lb/>
in a “Commentary” column (14 December 1967), which is identified by a type-<lb/>
script photocopy at the Harry Ransom Center; and some paragraphs on Stanley <lb/>
Morison in a “Commentary” column (19 December 1968), which is identified by <lb/>
a corrected proof at Eton. (These last two items raise the possibility, indeed the <lb/>
probability, that Carter made other contributions to the “Commentary” column, <lb/>
which began on 19 October 1967; the contributors to this column are usually not <lb/>
identified in the Archive.) All these pieces are unquestionably Carter’s work and <lb/>
should be added to the list in the Archive.<lb/></p>

<head>E2. Carter’s Major Contributions to the TLS</head>
<p>It may be useful to extract from the full list, for separate recording here, Carter’s major TLS pieces. The list below consists of (1) editorials (unsigned lead-<lb/>
ers), (2) signed pieces of any length (other than letters), and (3) unsigned pieces<lb/></p>
<pb n="93"/>
<p>and signed letters that are the equivalent of two full columns or more in length.<lb/>Reviews that are long simply because they take up a number of bibliographical<lb/>journals and discuss the contents of each are not included here; they amount to<lb/>a series of short reviews (and individual issues of journals often do receive inde-<lb/>pendent reviews). Five pieces in this list will not be found under Carter’s name<lb/>in the Historical Archive (those at 20 April 1946, 19 January 1951, 9 April 1964,<lb/>29 May 1964, and 17 December 1964). They are among the items assigned to<lb/>Carter only in the Stock Books and recorded in the list above; since they are long<lb/>enough to qualify for the present list, they are repeated here.</p>
<p>Eleven pieces in this list were later reprinted: those at 1 June 1946, 20 March<lb/>1948, 2 June 1950, 25 August 1950, 12 January 1951, 13 April 1951, 9 May 1952,<lb/>18 March 1955, 28 August 1959, 9 May 1968, and 30 October 1970. Twelve<lb/>pieces were signed: those at 27 April 1933, 22 August 1935, 30 May 1936, 5<lb/>June 1943, 1 June 1946, 12 July 1957, 6 September 1963, 14 March 1968, 9 May<lb/>1968, 21 November 1968, 27 February 1969, and 30 October 1970.

<head>APPENDIX</head>
<head>John Carter’s Supposed Novel</head>
<p>Those who are familiar with John Carter’s writings have long been aware of<lb/>
the 1934 novel called The Fall of the Titan, by “John Waynflete.” It has regularly<lb/>
been attributed to Carter, whose full name was John Waynflete Carter and who<lb/>
occasionally used “John Waynflete” (or “George Waynflete” or “Waynflete”) as<lb/>
a pseudonym, as on the second edition (1946) of the volume of clerihews that he<lb/>
edited for the Rampant Lions Press, the private press of his brother Will. But<lb/>
the novel has not been read by many people because of its rarity. As of August<lb/>
2020, WorldCat records only four copies worldwide: at the British Library, the<lb/>
National Library of Scotland, Oxford, and Yale (three of which—all but Ox-<lb/>
ford—attribute the authorship to Carter in their catalogues). There are also cop-<lb/>
ies at Trinity College Dublin and Swansea University, and there may of course be<lb/>
other institutional copies not reported to WorldCat. In addition, I am aware of a<lb/>
few individuals who possess a copy. Nevertheless, it is clearly a very scarce book.<lb/>
Because I recently acquired a copy (with the assistance of A. S. G. Edwards),<lb/>
I am now in a position to read it, which I have done. The experience, however,<lb/>
was not what I had expected. Carter’s writing is known for its elegance and wit,<lb/>
and this novel is written with ludicrous formality and is full of banal sentiments.<lb/>
One only has to read a few pages to begin wondering: did Carter really write this?<lb/>
The name “John Waynflete” is what has caused people to think that he did. But<lb/>
</p>
<pb n="99"/>
<p>if he did, the next question is: why would he have written it in that style? And if<lb/>that question can be answered, there is the question of when, in his pre-1934 life,<lb/>he would have been likely to have the time or inclination to write it.</p>
<p>Since so few people have read the novel, the best way to begin a discussion<lb/>of it is to describe its plot (which is relevant evidence in itself ). The story en-<lb/>compasses the rise and fall of Silas Burney, a depraved and unscrupulous man<lb/>who becomes a famous Labour leader. In Book I (of four Books, comprising 38<lb/>chapters), we learn that Silas has neglected his wife and four children, being more<lb/>dedicated to the Socialist Party. The next Book covers his becoming a member<lb/>of Parliament and a powerful and influential speaker (the titan of the Labour<lb/>movement); his being befriended by the daughter (named Miles) of Sir John<lb/>Walker, a “tolerant and kind” newspaper owner who treats his employees well;<lb/>and Miles’s asking Silas to help a housemaid (Flossie) whom (unknown to Miles)<lb/>he has seduced. At this point we are told that “there are always forces at work,<lb/>unseen forces, ever vigilant to bring to nought the evildoer wherever found, and<lb/>Silas Burney was now to see the first signs of his fall” (p. 147).</p>
<p>In Book III, Miles and Flossie gradually discover that they are in love with<lb/>the same man (Silas); and a Sir Jacob Randles promises Silas wealth and his<lb/>daughter’s hand in return for Silas’s arranging for Sir Jacob to be given a title.<lb/>Silas, in Book IV, vows to pay Flossie to be rid of her (and the child she had by<lb/>him) in order to accept Sir Jacob’s offer. Sir John, convinced of Flossie’s good-<lb/>ness and with evidence of Silas’s duplicity, manages to bring everyone together in<lb/>London, where Silas is confronted. Flossie makes an eloquent speech (including<lb/>poetry) at the end of which she dies, but not before Silas has wept and asked for<lb/>forgiveness. In a brief Epilogue, we learn that Silas and his daughter have moved<lb/>to Canada, where he says to her that the bright star they see in the sky “may be<lb/>your mother’s eyes looking down on you and me, and hoping and praying that<lb/>you will become like her—a woman who brought ‘the Titan’ down and made<lb/>him a MAN!”</p>
<p>There are a number of other characters that I have not mentioned; and<lb/>most of the characters, from time to time, engage in political discussion, often<lb/>uttering long statements on the dangers of socialism and the corruption of the<lb/>demagogues who attain office. One character wonders “if the rottenness and<lb/>canker had gone too far to save the nation” (p. 73). And not only the characters<lb/>but the narrative voice also raises this concern:</p>
<p>There has been working silently on the English Nation for many years, a spirit alien to<lb/>everything that makes for honesty of purpose, integrity of character and truthful speech.<lb/>Turn where we will, this insidious power is at work, ceaselessly, noiselessly, resolutely; bent<lb/>on undermining the British Character and the British Constitution. (p. 95)</p>
<p>From the opening chapter, the narrator’s views are clear: a minister’s strictures,<lb/>for instance, are said to have “aroused the bellicose propensities of a certain class<lb/>who alas! have assumed the reins of government,” and a footnote here states<lb/>“Labour Government in Office” (p. 11). The formality of expression is illustrated<lb/>on the previous page when two men conversing on a veranda say they should<lb/>move inside because of an approaching storm: by doing so, they were “suiting<lb/>the action to the word.” The style ranges from overly formal to melodramatic:</p>
<pb n="100"/>
<p>“Some women who love brush the stars with their shoulders, they bring a touch<lb/>
of Heaven into the dreariest life, they smooth life’s wrinkles and chase fear and<lb/>
doubt into night” (p. 83). These examples are perhaps sufficient to suggest the<lb/>
novel’s tone and point of view.<lb/></p>
<p>The book of 285 pages was published at 7s.6d. in early 1934 by Lincoln Wil-<lb/>
liams Ltd., a short-lived London publisher with offices at 19 Adam Street (and<lb/>
was printed by the Clock House Press of Hoddesdon). It may have been available<lb/>
in late 1933, for it is included in the publisher’s advertisement in <hi rend="italic">The Bookman</hi><lb/>
for December 1933. The Lincoln Williams firm was active for only three years,<lb/>
from 1932 to 1935, when financial problems brought about its end. It went into<lb/>
administration in July 1935, following a petition from Amy Gilmour, author of<lb/>
a novel called <hi rend="italic">The Lure of Islam</hi>, which the firm had published in 1933; and the<lb/>
winding-up order is dated 20 August 1935. I am aware of fifty titles with the<lb/>
Lincoln Williams imprint during those years, and they encompass a wide variety<lb/>
of books, ranging from reference books on cricket and books of practical advice<lb/>
to biographies, memoirs, travel writing, historical studies, poetry, and fiction. It<lb/>
seems likely that many of them were paid for by their authors.<lb/></p>
<p>The dust-jacket for <hi rend="italic">The Fall of the Titan</hi> (known from Richard Landon’s copy)<lb/>
lists twelve other novels, with titles like <hi rend="italic">The Seal of Love</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Hearts Adrift</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Noonday<lb/>
Devil</hi>. It carries on the front an illustration by H.&amp;nbsp;W.&amp;nbsp;Perl (1897–1952), the famous<lb/>
(and much collected) artist of pulp-fiction covers, who did other Lincoln Williams<lb/>
jackets as well. No information about the author is given, and the blurb consists<lb/>
of only two phrases: “A powerful story of ambition, intrigue, love and disaster.<lb/>
A novel to put into the hands of thinking young people.”<lb/></p>
<p>On 5 April 1934 the <hi rend="italic">Times Literary Supplement</hi> included the book in its section<lb/>
of brief notices of “New Books and Reprints” (pp. 245–46). The short review is<lb/>
worth quoting in full:<lb/></p>
<quote>In a style so stilted and sententious as to read almost like a parody, the author tells the<lb/>
story of one Silas Burney, a bold bad Labour leader, who, despite the fact he had robbed<lb/>
his employer, left his wife and children to starve, seduced a housemaid, and trifled with<lb/>
the affections of a baronet’s daughter, becomes a power in the land and is confidently<lb/>
spoken of as the coming Prime Minister. There is, however, as we are reminded in capital<lb/>
letters, “something in the world that works against a bad man.” The “Titan” crashes,<lb/>
and is made to see the error of his ways as the result of a remarkable dying speech by the<lb/>
housemaid which, starting with an impassioned eulogy of Cobden, Bright and free trade,<lb/>
ends up by warning him that “bankruptcy and death are the final heirs of imposture and<lb/>
make-belief.”<lb/></quote>
<p>This review is notable in two ways: the deftness of its plot summary and the per-<lb/>
ceptiveness of its suggestion that the book might be a parody. The <hi rend="italic">TLS</hi> historical<lb/>
archive does not give the names of the authors of brief reviews of this kind. But<lb/>
these two points invite the speculation that the review might have been written<lb/>
by Carter himself (if he wrote the book) as a way of instructing readers to treat<lb/>
the book as a parody. (Many years later he wrote a review of his <hi rend="italic">ABC for Book-<lb/>
Collectors</hi>.) Although he did not become a regular reviewer for the <hi rend="italic">TLS</hi> until 1936,<lb/>
he had already published a signed article there (on Byron in the 27 April and<lb/>
4 May 1933 issues) as well as a few letters, and he was already involved, with<lb/>
several others, in reinvigorating the <hi rend="italic">TLS</hi> back page as a bibliographical forum.<lb/></p>
<pb n="101"/>
<p>Conceivably the fact that the book was noticed at all shows Carter’s influence<lb/>
(of the twelve other novels listed on the dust-jacket for The Fall of the Titan, only<lb/>
five were given any notice in the TLS). In any case, whether or not Carter had<lb/>
anything to do with the review, the idea that the novel might be a parody is<lb/>
worth considering.<lb/>
</p>
<p>This idea would seem to be at odds with the dust-jacket recommendation<lb/>
that the book should be “put into the hands of thinking young people”—which<lb/>
implies that it should be taken at face value. On the other hand, of course, this<lb/>
blurb could be part of the parody. But if one wished to produce a parody of senti-<lb/>
mental fiction with an anti-Labour slant, it would take a remarkable commitment<lb/>
to devote about 90,000 words to the cause. And it is not clear what would be<lb/>
accomplished. Parodying the literary conventions and moralistic tone of popular<lb/>
fiction would affect the expression of political views on both sides. It would not,<lb/>
in other words, be a way of directing the reader’s sympathy to move from one<lb/>
side to the other—though possibly it could reveal shortcomings in the arguments<lb/>
on both sides. Or it could simply, through exaggeration, show the weaknesses of<lb/>
popular fiction. But it is not very effective as a parody, since it is tiresome rather<lb/>
than amusing. Viewing it as a parody, therefore, does not redeem it from being<lb/>
an unsatisfactory piece of writing, in contrast with everything known to be from<lb/>
Carter’s pen.<lb/>

<p>The novel does contain a few elements that would be compatible with Cart-<lb/>
er’s authorship, the first being its many classical references. Carter’s devotion to<lb/>
the classics, nourished at Eton and King’s Cambridge (where he took an honors<lb/>
degree in classics), was lifelong and was reflected in his collecting and editing<lb/>
of Catullus and his admiration for A. E. Housman. Although Catullus is not<lb/>
mentioned in the novel, there are references to Aristotle, Plutarch, Aristophanes,<lb/>
Tacitus, Cicero, Socrates, and Homer. There is even a conversation about re-<lb/>
membering classical texts from one’s college days (p. 132), and a Latin quotation<lb/>
from Augustine is the subject of another conversation (p. 33). Other literary allu-<lb/>
sions include Byron, Moliere, Lamartine, Clovis Hugues, and Shakespeare (one<lb/>
character uses the phrase “stale, flat, and unprofitable”). There are few biblio-<lb/>
philic touches, but a character introduced on the first page is “a lover of books”<lb/>
(p. 230), and another character visits a bookshop that had been Dodsley’s in the<lb/>
eighteenth century (pp. 51–52). These references do not, however, furnish strong<lb/>
enough evidence to outweigh the overall style and tone, for they are not beyond<lb/>
the competence of many people with a literary education.<lb/>

<p>If Carter wrote the novel, it is not credible that he wrote it in the years just<lb/>
prior to its publication. Immediately after he came down from Cambridge in<lb/>
1927, he was fully occupied with the book world, having been hired at once by<lb/>
Scribner’s London office to supply rare books to the New York shop. And his<lb/>
letters to the TLS beginning early in 1931 show that he was already immersed<lb/>
in the study of publishers’ bindings, Sir Thomas Browne, and the Wise-Forman<lb/>
forgeries—the subjects of his remarkable series of publications in 1932–34 (<lb/>
Binding Variants in English Publishing and an edition of Browne in 1932 and<lb/>
An Enquiry into the Nature of Certain Nineteenth Century Pamphlets in 1934). Also in these years he<lb/>
contributed introductions to two Elkin Mathews catalogues, searched for books<lb/>
</p>
<pb n="102"/>
<lb/>to send to Scribner’s, wrote four catalogues for Scribner’s, collaborated on other<lb/>
Scribner catalogues, and edited <hi rend="italic">Catullus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">New Paths in Book Collecting</hi>. It is<lb/>
hard to conceive of his writing <hi rend="italic">The Fall of the Titan</hi> at the same time. (The only<lb/>
periods when he might have had some free time on his hands would have been<lb/>
on shipboard when traveling to and from New&amp;nbsp;York in early&amp;nbsp;1929 and early<lb/>
1932; but it seems unlikely that he would have given priority to this novel over<lb/>
the bibliographical projects he had in progress.)<lb/>
So we are left with the possibility that he wrote it for amusement during his<lb/>
college years. But that, too, is hard to believe: why would he have chosen to de-<lb/>
vote so much time to a work of melodramatic political fiction (or a parody of one),<lb/>
when he was busy with his studies and with book-hunting? And if he had done<lb/>
so, everything we know about him suggests that he would have made a better job<lb/>
of it, even as an undergraduate. The novel as it stands would presumably have<lb/>
been an embarrassment to him by&amp;nbsp;1934. Why would he have wanted to resurrect<lb/>
it by giving it to a publisher? A possible reason could be that he thought it might<lb/>
bring in some money. But if he wanted to publish it and conceal his authorship,<lb/>
surely he would not have chosen a pseudonym that could so easily be identified<lb/>
with him.<lb/>
We thus come back to the name “John&amp;nbsp;Waynflete,” which remains, after all,<lb/>
the seemingly most persuasive link with Carter—and probably the only one<lb/>
considered by the collectors and library cataloguers who have made the connec-<lb/>
tion. But it is not as decisive as it may at first seem to be. Carter’s verifiable uses<lb/>
of the name “Waynflete” did not begin until after&amp;nbsp;1934: first as “George&amp;nbsp;Wayn-<lb/>
flete” in <hi rend="italic">Bibliographical Notes &amp; Queries</hi> in&amp;nbsp;1939, then as “Waynflete” in <hi rend="italic">Publishers’<lb/>
Weekly</hi> in&amp;nbsp;1940, and finally as “John&amp;nbsp;Waynflete” in <hi rend="italic">The Cornhill Magazine</hi> in&amp;nbsp;1944.<lb/>
Therefore if someone other than Carter were looking for a pseudonym, even<lb/>
someone attuned to the bibliophilic world, there would have been no reason to<lb/>
avoid “Waynflete” as a name already in use. And Carter was not well enough<lb/>
known (at least until the <hi rend="italic">Enquiry</hi> came out, a few months after the novel) for<lb/>
many people to have been aware of his middle name. (I realize that Carter’s use<lb/>
of “George&amp;nbsp;Waynflete” in&amp;nbsp;1939 could be seen as his way of distancing himself<lb/>
from the novel he had signed “John&amp;nbsp;Waynflete” five years earlier—though not a<lb/>
very great distancing. But this argument goes both ways: he could also have been<lb/>
distancing himself from the “John&amp;nbsp;Waynflete” someone else had used five years<lb/>
earlier—which he would probably have been aware of through the <hi rend="italic">TLS</hi> review.)<lb/>
If there was no reason for someone else to avoid using “Waynflete” in&amp;nbsp;1934,<lb/>
what reason would there have been for anyone else to choose it? Actually, there<lb/>
would have been many people to whom the name might have occurred as an<lb/>
appealing and appropriate pseudonym: anyone who had a connection with Eton,<lb/>
Winchester, or Magdalen College. Carter’s middle name results from a family<lb/>
connection with William&amp;nbsp;Waynflete, a fifteenth-century Provost of&amp;nbsp;Eton, who<lb/>
was also a Bishop of Winchester and the founder of Magdalen College Oxford.<lb/>
The name is well known to persons who have some association with any of these<lb/>
institutions. And, as Nicolas&amp;nbsp;Barker has pointed out to me, it further impinges on<lb/>
people’s consciousness through its use in place names, such as a road in Oxford,<lb/>
a street in London, and a close in Bishops&amp;nbsp;Waltham. The widespread knowledge<lb/>
of the Waynflete name is indicated by its presence even in America: in Portland,<lb/>
<p><pb n="103"/>Maine, for example, there is a Waynflete School, which was named for the same <lb/>
William Waynflete. It is not a rare name, in other words, and descendants of Wil-<lb/>
liam Waynflete survive on both sides of the Atlantic. Someone other than Carter <lb/>
could well have chosen to use “John Waynflete” in 1934. And it might not be a <lb/>
pseudonym at all.<lb/>
The collections of Carter’s papers in various libraries (Eton, King’s, Cam-<lb/>
bridge University Library, Bodleian, and Lilly among them) do not seem to con-<lb/>
tain anything relevant; Sebastian Carter, John’s nephew, knows nothing about <lb/>
the novel; and Michael Meredith tells me that it was not among Carter’s copies <lb/>
of his own books at the time of his death. Carter’s authorship of it has not been <lb/>
proved or disproved. The question comes down to how one evaluates the likeli-<lb/>
hood that anyone other than Carter could have used “John Waynflete” versus <lb/>
the likelihood that Carter could have written something, even as a parody, with <lb/>
the style and content of this novel. Unless there is evidence that I am not aware <lb/>
of, I think it seems reasonable to say that the arguments against John Carter’s <lb/>
authorship of The Fall of the Titan are stronger than those supporting it.</p>
