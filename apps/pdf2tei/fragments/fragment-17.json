(pp. 88-89)\n<lb/>\nThe rhythms of this paragraph, the placement of its pauses, leading to-\n<lb/>\nward the summarizing simile, make it a characteristic performance.\n<lb/>\nThe personality that comes through is learned and humane—to use\n<lb/>\nthe adjectives that Carter applied on the first page to A. W. Pollard’s\n<lb/>\ngreat essay on book collecting in the eleventh edition of the <hi>Encyclopaedia Britannica</hi>. Carter’s scholarly temperament, and his consequent concern\n<lb/>\nwith history, are evident throughout, epitomized perhaps in his insistence\n<lb/>\nthat any “restoration” of a book be accompanied by a statement in which\n<lb/>\n“the nature of the repairs made to it” are “recorded indelibly” (p. 185).\n<lb/>\nHe insisted that scholarly bibliographical analyses have “a strong claim\n<lb/>\non the attention of the average collector” (p. 114), and he recognized\n<lb/>\nthe role of collectors as scholars: “the ultimate value of the bibliophile\n<lb/>\nto pure scholarship depends on his recognition as an active entity, not\n<lb/>\na mere appendix” (p. 99). In his discussion of Sadleir’s <hi>Bibliographia</hi>\n<lb/>\nseries, Carter observed that it was “marked by a scholarly appreciation\n<lb/>\nof the importance of book-structure and publishing practice to the intel-\n<lb/>\nligent collector, whose acquiescence in this proposition was enlisted by\n<lb/>\nbeing taken for granted” (p. 61). There could be no better description of\n<lb/>\nCarter’s own book.\n<lb/>\nThe same mind is obviously at work in his journalism of the 1940s.\n<lb/>\nFor example, in reviewing J. D. Cowley’s <hi>Bibliographical Description and Cataloguing</hi>,\n<lb/>\nhe said, “The principles of bibliography are valid for books\n<lb/>\nof all periods, and even the chronicler of a living author is the better for\n<lb/>\nhaving learned how to collate an incunable” (<hi>Publishers’ Weekly</hi>, 16 March\n<lb/>\n1940). And after the war, when he described the great Yale convocation\n<lb/>\nof October 1946 to “mark the return of the University’s collections to\n<lb/>\npeacetime use” (<hi>Publishers’ Weekly</hi>, 23 November 1946), he concluded his\n<lb/>\nhighly laudatory account with these important reflections:\n<lb/>\nObjects—books, pictures, or bones—are part of the stuff of scholarship, of culture,\n<lb/>\nof ideas. It is axiomatic that it is the duty of institutions to acquire, preserve and\n<lb/>\ncatalog them; generally agreed, though not everywhere achieved, that they should\n<lb/>\nbe readily available to those who need to study them; but much less often recognized\n<lb/>\nthat they require to be actively injected into the thoughts and studies of the academic,\n<lb/>\nand also of the wider, world outside their glass cases. Every year museums and librar-\n<lb/>\nies get fuller and the problem of exploiting their resources more formidable. The\n<lb/>\nmethods by which this can best be done vary with the circumstances; but the amount\n<lb/>\nof imagination and enterprise being devoted in this country [the United States] to\n<lb/>\nmaking such collections as Yale’s not a mere adjunct but an integral and living part\n",
