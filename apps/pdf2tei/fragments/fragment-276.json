Supplies such as writing <lb/>\ninstruments, inks, and paper stocks, along with processes such as ruling, copying, <lb/>\nexcising and inserting, paginating, and binding, can usefully (and sometimes criti- <lb/>\ncally) inform our understanding of how writing is composed, revised, or otherwise <lb/>\naltered. Additional information, including how individuals other than authors <lb/>\n(e.g., printers, publishers, later owners, bookbinders, curators, and conservators) <lb/>\nhave altered manuscripts, is essential for understanding exactly whose “hands”— <lb/>\nand whose handiwork—we see when we ourselves handle and study these artifacts.</p>\n\n<p>It may surprise some readers that the Brontës’ literary manuscripts have not <lb/>\nyet received this kind of close codicological and bibliographical attention, given <lb/>\nthe sisters’ international fame and cultural stature. Scholars have tended to rely <lb/>\non biographical explanations for interpreting the Brontës’ manuscripts. Some of <lb/>\nthese assessments have focused on the patriarchal systems and cultural condi- <lb/>\ntions that challenged and limited the work of nineteenth-century women writers. <lb/>\nOther accounts have traced the Brontës’ writing practices to imaginative and <lb/>\neven unconscious, trance-like states.17 Few have attempted a more holistic and <lb/>\nmethodical examination of the documents’ material construction.</p>\n\n<p>In the case of <hi>Shirley</hi>, Charlotte Brontë made numerous partial-leaf excisions <lb/>\nto her fair-copy manuscript in the late spring and summer of 1849 as part of late- <lb/>\nstage revisions to its text before handing over the manuscript to her publisher in <lb/>\nSeptember of that year. These visible extractions have intrigued and puzzled the <lb/>\nhandful of scholars and editors who have worked closely with the novel’s three <lb/>\nmanuscript volumes.

The notable outlier is <hi>Manuscript Cultures</hi>, a periodical founded in 2008 that is published in both English and German by the University of Hamburg’s Centre for the Study of Manuscript Cultures. <hi>Manuscripta</hi>, founded in 1957 and currently edited by Gregory Pass, publishes research on medieval and Renaissance manuscripts, with a focus on “material aspects of the production, distribution, reception, and transmission of pre-modern manuscripts”; https://www.brepols.net/series/MSS, accessed August 19, 2022. <hi>Scripta: An International Journal of Codicology and Palaeography</hi>, started in 2008 and edited by Fabrizio Serra, publishes scholarship in English, French, and Italian that focuses on the intersection of ancient and medieval manuscripts, with an emphasis on “the history of written manuscripts in European and Mediterranean civilization”; http://www.libraweb.net/riviste.php?chiave=89, accessed August 19, 2022. The journal <hi>Manuscript Studies</hi>, recently launched in 2016 by the University of Pennsylvania’s Schoenberg Institute for Manuscript Studies, “embraces the full complexity of global manuscript studies in the digital age,” while maintaining a focus on “pre-modern” manuscript cultures; https://mss.pennpress.org/home/, accessed August 19, 2022. <hi>English Manuscript Studies, 1100–1700</hi>, which ran from 1989 to 2007, did not include research on modern manuscripts.</note>\n\n<note place=\"foot\" n=\"16\">Donald H.
