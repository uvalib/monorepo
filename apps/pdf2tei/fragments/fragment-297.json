Well might she call the first chapter<lb/>\nthat she wrote after this, <hi>“The Valley of the Shadow of Death.”</hi>98<lb/>\n“The Valley of the Shadow of Death” chapter mentioned by Gaskell is the first<lb/>\nof volume 3; thus, according to Gaskell, Brontë resumed writing volume 3 only<lb/>\nafter the death of her remaining sister. In her edition of Charlotte Brontë’s letters,<lb/>\nMargaret Smith disagrees with Gaskell, suggesting that, as late as February 1849,<lb/>\nBrontë “writes as if she had completed no more that the first volume rather than<lb/>\nthe greater part of two, as Mrs. Gaskell alleged.” Smith continues: “the second<lb/>\nvolume, if she had begun it, was perhaps still in the form of a preliminary pencil-<lb/>\ndraft— CB’s normal method of composition, according to the <hi>Life</hi>.”99</p>\n<p>On the contrary, the evidence found in the manuscript’s differing paper<lb/>\nstocks largely corroborates Gaskell’s claim, suggesting that Brontë had copied<lb/>\nout the majority of volume 2 by late September 1848. Toward the end of volume<lb/>\n2, the run of Cream Laid paper abruptly ends at f. A551.B551.C557.E273 —a<lb/>\nleaf that falls in that volume’s final chapter, “An Evening Out.” The remaining<lb/>\n16 leaves of volume 2 contain a mixture of paper stocks (Royal Superfine and<lb/>\nCream Laid) that do not correlate with any changes to their numbering—a fact<lb/>\nthat seems to confirm that Brontë attempted to work on the manuscript inter-<lb/>\nmittently. A letter written in September of 1850 also seems to confirm this. In it,<lb/>\nBrontë recounted to James Taylor of Smith, Elder how the “great part” of Shirley<lb/>\nwas “written under the shadow of impending calamity” and the “last volume . . .<lb/>\ncomposed in the eager, restless endeavor to combat mental sufferings that were<lb/>\nscarcely tolerable.”100</p>\n<p>Sickness had stalked the Brontë household ever since September of 1848 and<lb/>\nhad still not abated in January of 1849.101 After the death of her brother, Bran-<lb/>\nwell, on September 24, Charlotte Brontë had increasingly found herself perform-<lb/>\ning a different form of labor from that of writing: the caregiving duties of nursing<lb/>\nher own family members. Whether soliciting medical advice for Emily (who ada-<lb/>\nmantly refused it until her death in December), or attending to Anne and their</p>\n<div type=\"footnotes\">\n<p type=\"footnote\">97.

The situation was rather more<lb/>\ncomplex, unfolding over many prior months. Branwell’s dependence on alcohol and opium had<lb/>\ncontributed to the deterioration of his health and had even disguised the symptoms of tuber-<lb/>\nculosis. As Juliet Barker notes: “Branwell’s health had worsened so imperceptibly over the last<lb/>\neighteen months that no one had noticed how ill he had become. So often drunk or hung over,<lb/>\nit could only be expected that his constitution would be affected. . . . Any sympathy Charlotte<lb/>\nfelt for her brother had long evaporated; now he simply irritated her.” See <hi>The Brontës</hi> (London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1995), 564–65. Branwell’s father had primarily looked after<lb/>\nhim during his illness, although sometimes the sisters assisted in caring for him, particularly at<lb/>\nnight (see Letters, 2:93).<lb/>\n</p>\n</div>",
