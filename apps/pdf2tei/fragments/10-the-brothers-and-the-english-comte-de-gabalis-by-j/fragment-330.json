G. Nizet, 1963).</note><lb/>\nAnglophone readers are most likely to find it in a transla-<lb/>\ntion first published in 1913 and often reprinted.<note n=\"2\">The title page reads: Comte de Gabalis / by the/Abbé N. de Montfaucon de Villars / Rendered out of French into English / with a Commentary. / “When a thing is hidden away with so much pains, / merely to reveal it is to destroy it.” Tertullian / Published by The Brothers / [symbol] / and printed at The Old Bourne Press, / under the supervision of W.&amp;nbsp;H. Broome, / 15 Holborn, London, EC. / Copyright, The Brothers, 1913.</note><lb/>\nAttributed only to “The Broth-<lb/>\ners,” it carries a pseudo-scholarly commentary every verso page and on 145 pages <lb/>\nat the end, in which Villars’ lively and satirical text is treated as a solemn source <lb/>\nof esoteric teachings. Who were these Brothers? This article seeks to answer that <lb/>\nquestion and to illuminate an enigmatic episode in Gabalis’ reception history.</p>\n<p>Villars’ novel was an instant success. It was soon banned in France, reprinted <lb/>\nin Holland and Cologne, and supplied with spurious sequels. Two different Eng-<lb/>\nlish translations appeared in 1680, inspiring Alexander Pope in his Rape of the <lb/>\nLock (1712), and a third soon afterwards.<note n=\"3\">The Count of Gabalis: or Conferences about Secret Sciences (London: for Robert Harford, 1680); The Count of Gabalis, or, The Extravagant Mysteries of the Cabalists (London: for B.M., Printer to the Cabalistical Society of the Sages, at the Sign of the Rosy-Crucian, 1680); The Count of Gabalis, Being a Diverting History of the Rosicrucian Doctrine of Spirits (London: for B. Lintott &amp; E. Curll, 1714).</note><lb/>\nPope’s mock epic introduced English <lb/>\nreaders, as Villars had the French, to the picturesque realm of the elementals: <lb/>\nsylphs, salamanders, undines or nymphs, and gnomes. Gabalis, a German count, <lb/>\nclaims deep knowledge of them and their habits, as well as of Kabbalah, alchemy, <lb/>\nand occult mysteries. He urges the sceptical narrator to renounce human women <lb/>\nand to marry a sylph, adding that the greatest ones of the past were all the result <lb/>\nof such inter-species intercourse.</p>\n<p>The 1913 translation is accurate, if ponderous, and omits Villars’ more sala-<lb/>\ncious passages. The Brothers are named as publisher and copyright holder, and <lb/>\nleave us to draw our own conclusions from their oval emblem (figure1), which <lb/>\nappears insistently: twice on the dust jacket, twice embossed on the cover, and <lb/>\nfour more times inside the book.</p>",
