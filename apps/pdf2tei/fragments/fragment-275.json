Historical and textual evidence show, however, that the MS is almost certainly an early draft of <hi>The Professor</hi>. My research on this topic is forthcoming in an essay that will appear in a new scholarly edition of <hi>The Professor</hi>, edited by Sara L. Pearson, to be published by Cambridge University Press.<lb/></note>\n<note place=\"foot\" n=\"13\">Exact numbers are difficult to gauge, but the following data provides some sense of the numbers. A search conducted on October 24, 2020, for all records in WorldCat that include “manuscript” as part of the material description of holdings yielded 655,631 results for entries dating from year 1 to 1700, and 13,160,994 results for entries dating from 1701 to 2020. Of the 210,122 manuscripts and archives held by the British Library, 55,062 date before 1700, while 155,070 date from after 1700. The Morgan Library &amp; Museum owns 2,262 medieval and Renaissance manuscripts, as compared to 62,452 “literary and historical” manuscripts.<lb/></note>\n<note place=\"foot\" n=\"14\">Scholarship conducted on Emily Dickinson’s poetry manuscripts is well known, including R. W. Franklin’s foundational edition, <hi>The Manuscript Books of Emily Dickinson</hi> (Cambridge, MA: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1981) and Marta L. Werner’s <hi>Emily Dickinson’s Open Folios: Scenes of Reading, Surfaces of Writing</hi> (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1995), as well as more recent studies, such as Cristanne Miller’s <hi>Emily Dickinson’s Poems as She Preserved Them</hi> (Cambridge, MA: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 2016). Other notable and influential studies of manuscripts include: Charles Robinson’s study of Mary Shelley’s “Frankenstein notebooks,” which includes highly detailed information, such as beta-radiographs of the watermarks found in the notebooks; Fredson Bowers’ bibliographical scholarship on the manuscripts of Walt Whitman, including <hi>Whitman’s Manuscripts: Leaves of Grass (1860): A Parallel Text</hi> (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, [1955]); William M. Gibson’s study of Mark Twain’s <hi>The Mysterious Stranger Manuscripts</hi> (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1969); and Hans Walter Gabler’s work on James Joyce’s manuscripts. This is, of course, just a small sample of the important work that has been done on modern literary manuscripts. In addition, recent approaches, such as efforts in the so-called genetic editing of manuscripts, have brought increased attention to the study of modern literary manuscripts in Europe, particularly in France and Germany.<lb/></note>\n</p>",
