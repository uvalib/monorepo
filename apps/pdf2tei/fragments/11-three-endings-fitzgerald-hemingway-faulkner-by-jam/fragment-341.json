He is still fundamentally the <lb/>\nsame person—idle, romantic, inquisitive, skeptical, unwilling to conform. Per-<lb/>\nhaps there is a place in society for him, but this is far from certain. Only the first <lb/>\npart of Amory’s life has been completed. The dash dovetails with the title—This <lb/>\nSide of Paradise. The reader has followed Amory’s journey to the beginnings of <lb/>\nadulthood; what will come next we do not know.<lb/>\nThe 1995 Cambridge text, ending with the dash, was published with the ap-<lb/>\nproval of the F. Scott Fitzgerald Literary Trust. This text was adopted by Scrib-<lb/>\nner as its standard text and was first reprinted as a paperback by that publisher <lb/>\nin 1996. The text with the dash has appeared in all Scribner editions from that <lb/>\ndate to the present.<lb/>\n<head>The Sun Also Rises</head><lb/>\nErnest Hemingway began work on his first novel in mid-July&amp;nbsp;1925, shortly after <lb/>\nattending, for the third time, the annual bullfighting fiesta in the Spanish town of <lb/>\nPamplona. He worked steadily on the novel through July and August and finished <lb/>\nan autograph first draft on 21&amp;nbsp;September&amp;nbsp;1925. His working title was “Fiesta: A <lb/>\nNovel.” Hemingway (who, unlike Fitzgerald, could type) prepared a typescript <lb/>\nfrom his manuscript. This typescript does not survive, but it must have existed. <lb/>\nThe differences between the holograph and the setting-copy typescript, which is <lb/>\nextant, are so great that at least one revised typescript (and possibly more than one) <lb/>\nmust have intervened. Hemingway used a professional typing service for prepara-<lb/>\ntion of the setting copy. He made a very few emendations in his own hand on the <lb/>\nfinished sheets. The typescript, a fair copy bearing the title The Sun Also Rises, was <lb/>\nput into the transatlantic mail to Maxwell Perkins at Scribner on 24&amp;nbsp;April&amp;nbsp;1926.<note n=\"11\">The Letters of Ernest Hemingway, vol.&amp;nbsp;3, ed. Rena Sanderson, Sandra Spanier, and Robert W.&amp;nbsp;Trogdon (Cambridge and New&amp;nbsp;York: Cambridge University Press, 2015): 64–66. Hemingway was living in Paris during the proofing of the novel.</note> <lb/>\nThis is the document that served as setting copy for the first edition; it survives <lb/>\ntoday in the Papers of Ernest Hemingway at the Albert and Shirley Small Special <lb/>\nCollections Library, University of Virginia. (The manuscript is preserved in the <lb/>\nErnest Hemingway Collection, John&amp;nbsp;F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Muse-<lb/>\num.)<note n=\"12\">This manuscript has been published in facsimile: Ernest Hemingway, The Sun Also Rises: A Facsimile Edition, ed. Matthew&amp;nbsp;J. Bruccoli. Archive of Literary Documents&amp;nbsp;II. (Detroit: Omnigraphics, 1990).</note> The compositors at the Scribner Press added handwritten galley “takes” to <lb/>\nthe setting copy—markings that indicate where each galley begins and ends—<lb/>\nbut this typescript was not otherwise marked before the type was assembled. All <lb/>\nchanges between the setting copy and the first edition must therefore have taken <lb/>\nplace in proof. Neither galleys nor page proofs, however, are known to survive.<lb/>\nThe Sun Also Rises is the quintessential “lost generation” novel. It portrays the <lb/>\nenervation and nihilism of the generation that had lived through the Great War. <lb/>\nMuch of the novel is presented in dialogue; the exchanges between characters <lb/>\nare flat and unemotional, though a great deal is happening beneath the surface.<lb/>",
