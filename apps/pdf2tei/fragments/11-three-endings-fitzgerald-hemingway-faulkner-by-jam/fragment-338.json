As I finished each chapter I sent it to a<lb/>\ntypist in Princeton.<note n=\"1\">“Who’s Who—and Why,” <hi rend=\"italic\">Saturday Evening Post</hi> 193 (18 September 1920): 61; collected in <hi rend=\"italic\">My Lost City</hi>, ed.

There<lb/>\n the novel caught the attention of a young editor named Maxwell Perkins, who<lb/>\nrecognized the author’s inventiveness and talent. Perkins’ enthusiasm, however,<lb/>\nwas not enough to carry the day. The other editors at the firm were skeptical<lb/>\nabout Fitzgerald’s novel; they considered it to be garrulous and immature, poorly<lb/>\nstructured and overburdened with detail. The rejection letter to Fitzgerald, dated<lb/>\n19 August 1918, put special emphasis on the ending of “The Romantic Egotist.”<lb/>\nThe letter reads in part: “[T]he story does not seem to us to work up to a conclu-<lb/>\nsion;—neither the hero’s career nor his character are shown to be brought to any<lb/>\nstage which justifies an ending.” And the letter continues: “It seems to us in short<lb/>\nthat the story does not culminate in anything as it must to justify the reader’s<lb/>\ninterest as he follows it; and that it might be made to do so quite consistently with<lb/>\nthe characters and with its earlier stages.”<note n=\"3\"><hi rend=\"italic\">Correspondence of F.

The letter, signed “Charles Scribner’s Sons,” was probably written by Maxwell Perkins.</note> Fitzgerald, now stationed at Camp<lb/>\nSheridan, Alabama, was troubled by this letter. “How could I intrigue the hero<lb/>\ninto a ‘philosophy of life,’” he later wrote, “when my own ideas were in much<lb/>\n the state of Alice’s after the hatter’s tea-party?”<note n=\"4\">From Fitzgerald’s preface to <hi rend=\"italic\">This Side of Paradise</hi>, in <hi rend=\"italic\">This Side of Paradise</hi>, ed.

He took the best parts of “The Romantic Egotist” and added<lb/>\nfreshly composed material; he also incorporated the typescripts of a short story,<lb/>\na one-act play, and several poems into the narrative—most of this material orig-<lb/>\ninally written at Princeton. At Perkins’ suggestion he dropped the breathless<lb/>\nfirst-person narration of “The Romantic Egotist” and shifted to a more mature<lb/>\nthird-person voice.
