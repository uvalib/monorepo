Faulkner wrote the novel under the title If I Forget Thee, Je-\n<lb/>rusalem.<note n=\"18\">The title is an allusion to Psalms&amp;nbsp;137: “By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion.” Images and wording from this psalm, which concerns captivity and freedom, appear throughout Faulkner’s novel.</note> Random House, his publisher, changed the title to The Wild Palms.\n<lb/>The novel consists of two interwoven stories, in alternating chapters. The primary nar-\n<lb/>rative, entitled “The Wild Palms,” is tragic; the secondary narrative, “Old Man,” \n<lb/>is comic. “The Wild Palms” is set in 1937. It tells the story of a woman and a man, \n<lb/>Charlotte Rittenmeyer and Harry Wilbourne, who resolve to free themselves \n<lb/>from the burdens and constraints of society. Charlotte, a wife and mother, leaves \n<lb/>her husband and two children; Harry, an unmarried medical student, abandons \n<lb/>his studies and follows Charlotte in pursuit of what she conceives to be freedom. \n<lb/>Their first few months together go well, but their idyll cannot endure. Charlotte \n<lb/>becomes pregnant, and Harry (at her urging) performs an abortion. He botches \n<lb/>the operation; Charlotte dies of hemorrhaging; Harry is sentenced to fifty years in \n<lb/>prison. He refuses to commit suicide and decides to live out his years in captivity. \n<lb/>Harry resolves to keep Charlotte alive in memory. The final line of “The Wild \n<lb/>Palms,” in italicized interior monologue, gives his decision:\n<lb/>“Between grief and nothing I will take grief.”\n<lb/>The secondary story, “Old Man,” is a comic fable. The characters have no \n<lb/>names: the protagonist is called “the tall convict,” and the woman is simply “the \n<lb/>woman” or “she.” “Old Man” is set during the severe flooding of the Mississippi \n<lb/>River in 1927. The tall convict has been temporarily released from prison in or-\n<lb/>der to rescue people stranded by the flood. He takes a skiff and paddle and sets \n<lb/>out on the river. He finds a pregnant woman clinging to a tree and helps her into \n<lb/>the boat. For the remainder of “Old Man,” he and she are tossed about on the \n<lb/>powerful river, coming to rest briefly on a small island where, with his assistance, \n<lb/>she gives birth. The tall convict performs heroically during his period of freedom. \n<lb/>He saves the woman and brings her and the baby to dry land. Throughout the \n<lb/>narrative, however, he seems terrified of the woman and of what she represents. \n<lb/>His only desire is to return to captivity. He fears the disorder and messiness of \n<lb/>life and prefers the regularity of imprisonment; he has no desire to complicate \n<lb/>his existence with women, and certainly not with sex or childbirth. In Faulkner’s \n<lb/>manuscript and in the setting-copy typescript, which he typed, “Old Man” ends\n</p>",
