The<lb/>\npagination of the document confirms that Faulkner wrote the two stories in al-<lb/>\nternating chapters, composing a chapter of one and then a chapter of the other.<lb/>\nHe did not write “The Wild Palms” in its entirety, then write “Old Man,” and<lb/>\nthen shuffle the chapters. This structural experimentation was characteristic of<lb/>\nFaulkner’s work from the late 1920s until the early 1940s, a period that saw pub-<lb/>\nlication of <hi rend=\"italic\">The Sound and the Fury</hi> (1929), <hi rend=\"italic\">As I Lay Dying</hi> (1930),<lb/>\n<hi rend=\"italic\">Absalom, Absalom!</hi> (1936), <hi rend=\"italic\">The Hamlet</hi> (1940), and <hi rend=\"italic\">Go Down, Moses</hi><lb/>\n(1942)—all of which take liberties with conventional narrative structure.<lb/></p>\n<p>Faulkner’s publisher, however, seems not to have understood what he was<lb/>\ndoing. Saxe Commins, Faulkner’s editor at Random House, changed the title of<lb/>\nthe novel from <hi rend=\"italic\">If I Forget Thee, Jerusalem</hi>, an inclusive title, to <hi rend=\"italic\">The Wild<lb/>\nPalms</hi>, the title of the primary story. The change in title, made over Faulkner’s objec-<lb/>\ntions, caused confusion for many years after publication. Scholars and critics did<lb/>\nnot recognize <hi rend=\"italic\">The Wild Palms</hi> as a novel. The history of subsequent editions did<lb/>\nnot help matters. In 1948 both “The Wild Palms” and “Old Man” were issued<lb/>\nseparately, in individual paperback volumes.<note n=\"19\">The Wild Palms (New York:<lb/>\nNew American Library, 1948); <hi rend=\"italic\">The Old Man</hi> (New York: New American<lb/>\nLibrary, 1948). For these and later editions, the word “The” was added to the<lb/>\ntitle of “Old Man.”</note><lb/>\nIn a 1954 paperback the two nar-<lb/>\nratives were published together but one after the other, with the full text of “The<lb/>\nWild Palms” appearing first, followed by “Old Man” in its entirety.<note n=\"20\"><hi rend=\"italic\">The Wild<lb/>\nPalms and The Old Man</hi> (New York: New American Library, 1954).</note><lb/></p>\n<p>The novel was also bowdlerized. Faulkner objected to this sanitizing but was<lb/>\noverruled.<note n=\"21\">Faulkner had little leverage with his publisher in 1939. Random House was<lb/>\nthe fifth imprint to publish his work and was carrying him as a succès d’estime.<lb/>\nHis first book with Random House, <hi rend=\"italic\">Absalom, Absalom!</hi>, had not sold well;<lb/>\n<hi rend=\"italic\">If I Forget Thee, Jerusalem</hi>, with another biblical title, was not likely to do<lb/>\nbetter—hence, presumably, the change in title. In 1939 Faulkner was best known<lb/>\nas the author of <hi rend=\"italic\">Sanctuary</hi> (1931), a scandalous novel about a young woman<lb/>\nwho is raped with a corn cob. It is not surprising that the publisher bowdlerized<lb/>\n<hi rend=\"italic\">The Wild Palms</hi>. The sanitizing, however, was incomplete: the words “pricks”<lb/>\nand “cunts” appear on p. 52 of the first edition, and “Shit!” appears on p. 101.<lb/>\nLater, after he had won the Nobel Prize in 1949, Faulkner swung more weight at<lb/>\nRandom House, and the heavy editing of his texts ceased.</note> The setting-copy<lb/>\ntypescript, like the manuscript, is among Faulkner’s papers at the Small Special<lb/>\nCollections Library.<note n=\"22\">Both the manuscript and the setting-copy typescript of the<lb/>\nnovel have been published in facsimile in <hi rend=\"italic\">William Faulkner Manuscripts</hi>,<lb/>\nvol. 14, parts 1 and 2, ed. Thomas L. McHaney (New York and London: Garland<lb/>\nPublishing, Inc., 1986).</note> On the typescript Faulkner’s editor has marked out<lb/>\nthe word “shit.” He has preserved Faulkner’s comma and has substituted four<lb/>\nellipsis points for the profane word. Proofs for the book do not survive, but<lb/>\nfurther changes in the final line must have occurred there. On page 339 of the<lb/>\nfirst edition, the final page of “Old Man” and of the novel, the comma and the<lb/>\nellipsis points have been replaced by an open two-em dash and an exclamation<lb/>\npoint (see figure 8). The final line now reads:<lb/>\n“Women —— !” the tall convict said.<lb/></p>",
