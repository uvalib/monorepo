The New York lithographer committed mistakes not unlike<lb/>\nthose of the Sussex copyist: WITHERSPOART for Witherspoon, HOYG for<lb/>\nFloyd, PINN for Penn, and M KEAN for M: Kean. Both had to contend with<lb/>\nfacsimile signatures, but even an immigrant poorly schooled in English was able<lb/>\nto construe common names such as Harrison and Stockton.16</p>\n<p>The copyist’s mistakes are easier to explain if they can be imputed to the illegibility of his source and his failure to find a remedy. Some delegates scrawled<lb/>\ntheir signatures in such a way as to make them difficult to read even in a full-size<lb/>\nfacsimile. Bridgham’s miniature exacerbated the problem. Published sixty years<lb/>\nafter the fact, it was conceived as a novelty and was never intended to be an<lb/>\nauthoritative text, but it circulated widely and could easily come into the hands<lb/>\nof someone whose notions of the American Revolution were more sentimental<lb/>\nthan scholarly. The copyist transcribed it by rote and relied on his imagination<lb/>\nto interpret the parts he did not understand. He was unwilling or unable to find<lb/>\na better source for this display of penmanship and did not worry overmuch about<lb/>\nthe accuracy of his work.</p>\n<p>Complications. A line of reasoning should follow the shortest distance<lb/>\nbetween two points. That common-sense rule is a deciding factor for testing<lb/>\nhypotheses in bibliographical investigations—or any field of intellectual inquiry.<lb/>\nThe complications in Allen and Sneff’s arguments undercut their claims for the<lb/>\npriority of the Sussex Declaration. If it came first and served as a source for<lb/>\nthe Bridgham facsimile, we would have to believe that the Bostonians copied the<lb/>\nsame order of names while consulting another source to render them in facsimile.<lb/>\nWe would have to believe that they took the oversize words in that manuscript<lb/>\nas cues to execute the same words in ornamental penmanship even though they<lb/>\nhad the Boston Bewick edition easily at hand and could use that as a model for<lb/>\nthe <hi>“emphatical words.”</hi> We would have to accept the hypothesis that the Sussex<lb/>\nDeclaration or a derivative manuscript influenced Tyler’s choice of <hi>“emphatical<lb/>\nwords”</hi> sometime around 1818 and then resurfaced eighteen years later to guide<lb/>\nthe work of the Bostonians. If we follow that line of reasoning, we would have to<lb/>\nimagine that James Wilson was willing to overlook the atrocious spelling of the<lb/>\nnames even though he depended on them to affirm his position during the debates</p>\n<note place=\"foot\">16.
