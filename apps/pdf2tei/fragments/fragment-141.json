In a similar note on page 29A of the 1783 catalog, Jefferson wrote<lb/>that books on southern European subjects were to be arranged in the following<lb/>order, “General works, Italy, Rome, Florence, Naples, Venice, Spain, Portugal,<lb/>France.”31 Tellingly, Trist used this idiosyncratic geographical and national order<lb/>throughout the 1823 catalog when applicable, with books on Italian subjects preceding<lb/>titles on Spanish, Portuguese, and French subjects. A related note on page<lb/>31 of the 1783 catalog specifies the arrangement of books on Northern European<lb/>and non-European cultures. This arrangement proceeds from “general works,”<lb/>to works on Lapland, Russia, Poland, Hungary, Sweden, Denmark, Prussia, Germany,<lb/>Flanders, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Geneva, Turkey, Asia, and finally<lb/>Africa. This typical, if sometimes variable, progression from south to north, from<lb/>west to east, from general to particular, and from ancient to modern in Jefferson’s<lb/>historical chapters recurs in his literary and linguistic chapters and was often<lb/>adopted by Trist seemingly by default. With basic verbal or written instructions<lb/>from Jefferson, Trist would have been able to construct this geographical arrangement<lb/>unaided. No marked copy text would have been required to produce Trist’s<lb/>1823 entries that relate to these cultures, languages, or regions.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, there are many exceptions to the patterns and textual parallels we<lb/>describe here. Most entries in the 1783 catalog lack Jefferson’s clarifying<lb/>ordinal numbers or marginal comments, for instance. In these cases, Trist could<lb/>have departed from the verso-recto ordering of the 1783 catalog and instead<lb/>employed the order provided by Jefferson’s shelving numbers as they appear in<lb/>the 1815 printed catalog.32 As Gilreath and Wilson note, “the initial number as-<lb/>signed to each entry [in the 1815 catalog] refers not to its catalog order but to its<lb/>shelf position” on Jefferson’s shelves.33 Jefferson arranged books at Monticello by<lb/>size, and each chapter of the 1815 printed catalog numbers entries accordingly by<lb/>bibliographic format.34 In a way, then, an unannotated copy of the 1815 printed<lb/>catalog was already “annotated” with helpful ordinal guides. Trist could rely on<lb/>31. 1783 Catalog of Books, page 29A.<lb/>32. Watterston’s catalog records the shelf marks that Jefferson’s books bore upon arrival<lb/>at the Library of Congress. Judging by Jefferson’s 7 May 1815 letter to Watterston, the 1812<lb/>catalog also included shelving numbers: “on every book is a label, indicating the chapter of the<lb/>catalogue to which it belongs, and the order it holds among those of the same format. so that,<lb/>altho’ the Nos seem confused on the catalogue, they are consecutive on the volumes as they<lb/>stand on their shelves,” “Thomas Jefferson to George Watterston, 7 May 1815,” Founders Online,<lb/>National Archives, https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/03-08-02-0376.<lb/>33. Gilreath and Wilson, Thomas Jefferson’s Library, 7.<lb/>34. These shelving numbers, which precede each entry in the 1815 printed catalog and<lb/>are copied out by Trist in Trist’s 1823 manuscript, were devised and affixed to Jefferson’s books<lb/>during the production of the 1812 fair copy. The 1783 catalog only loosely reflects the order of<lb/>Jefferson’s shelves and none of the 1783 entries include shelf marks or numbers.</p>",
