What is more, the authors who penned these<lb/>\ndiverse works hailed from around the globe (England, France, Argentina, Italy,<lb/>\nChile, Russia, Spain, the United States,17 Ireland, and Germany). However, the<lb/>\nnames of virtually all the authors of these sample chapters would have been<lb/>\nknown to readers, especially for the educated and elite consumers of <hi>Sur</hi>. For<lb/>\ninstance, a few of the authors whose sampled works appeared in these issues<lb/>\nincluded James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, Aldous Huxley, George Orwell, Gabriela<lb/>\nMistral, Albert Camus, and T. E. Lawrence, as well as Victoria Ocampo herself.<lb/>\nWhen viewed in tandem with the numerous ads that filled the opening and clos-<lb/>\ning pages of each issue of the literary journal <hi>Sur</hi>, these teaser chapters reveal<lb/>\none potential way in which Ocampo might have marketed select works as a part<lb/>\nof her more general mission to promote certain authors for her Latin American<lb/>\nreaders.18</p>\n<p>While Ocampo’s literary journal tended to include only one pre-publication<lb/>\nchapter from each of these books, there were instances in which several chap-<lb/>\nters—or even entire works—appeared in <hi>Sur</hi> prior to the book publication with<lb/>\n<hi>Editorial Sur</hi>. Consider, for instance, the following titles that had at least two<lb/>\nchapters published in <hi>Sur</hi> prior to their releases as single-volume works with Edi-<lb/>\ntorial Sur: <hi>André Gide’s Perséphone</hi> (1936), Eduardo Mallea’s <hi>La ciudad junto al río<lb/>\ninmóvil</hi> (1936), <hi>Virginia Woolf’s Un cuarto propio</hi> (1936), <hi>Aldous Huxley’s Con los<lb/>\nesclavos en la noria</hi> (1937), <hi>Victoria Ocampo’s Virginia Woolf, Orlando y Cía</hi> (1938),<lb/>\nand <hi>Silvina Ocampo’s Autobiografía de Irene</hi> (1948).19 Multiple poems from Gabri-<lb/>\nela Mistral’s <hi>Tala</hi> (1938) as well as Eduardo González Lanuza’s <hi>La degollación de los<lb/>\ninocentes</hi> (1938) and <hi>Transitable cristal</hi> (1943) also appeared in the pages of <hi>Sur</hi> prior<lb/>\nto their official release with <hi>Editorial Sur</hi>. It is telling that early on multiple teaser<lb/>\nchapters from <hi>Editorial Sur</hi> books—if not the entire works—appeared in <hi>Sur</hi>. In<lb/>\nessence, these early pre-publication chapters highlight the residual influence of<lb/>\nserial publications. The only two books that were published in an entirely serial-<lb/>\nized format in <hi>Sur</hi> prior to their release with <hi>Editorial Sur</hi> were <hi>Woolf’s Un cuarto<lb/>\npropio</hi> and <hi>Gide’s Perséphone</hi>.20 These two works are the second and third <hi>Editorial<lb/>\nSur</hi> works that were pre-published in <hi>Sur</hi>, respectively, which further stresses the</p>\n<div type=\"footnotes\">\n  <note xml:id=\"fn17\" place=\"foot\">17.
