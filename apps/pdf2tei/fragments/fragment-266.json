So far, then, he had worked at<lb/>\na rate of approximately twenty pages per month of tour. By now allowing 123<lb/>\npages for the rest of the tour, he was apparently thinking it might continue to<lb/>\nJune, or, alternatively, planning a great deal more digression.<lb/>\nDibdin’s later working practice with his <hi>Table Entertainments</hi> was to write<lb/>\nout the text he intended to perform, but then to make numerous additions, de-<lb/>\nletions and rearrangements as he continued to refine and adapt his work.<note place=\"foot\" xml:id=\"n18\">There are three manuscript volumes of Dibdin’s performance texts for the <hi>Table Entertainments</hi> in the British Library (Add. Mss. 30,960–30,962). From these, notably, <hi>Retrospect Opera</hi> has recently been able to create a performance edition and recording of <hi>The Wags</hi> (1790), Dibdin’s biggest success in the genre (RO008).</note><lb/>\nAssuming that <hi>Readings and Music</hi> existed in some comparable form, Dibdin’s job in<lb/>\nLiverpool was indeed to “copy,” but also to tidy and regulate. Although the epistolary format made<lb/>\nlittle sense when it came to presenting a supposedly continuous dramatic text, he<lb/>\ncontinued to employ it. <hi>Readings and Music</hi> is thus divided into no less than 24 letters,<lb/>\neach one commencing on a new page: the headings, each occupying a third of the<lb/>\npage, the spaces at the ends of the letters, and some added footnotes, extend the text<lb/>\nto a remarkable 100 pages, not counting the unnumbered pages of score expanding<lb/>\nit still further. Even the casual reader can be in no doubt that Dibdin is seeking to fill<lb/>\nas many pages as possible. What he presents is not equivalent to any single performance<lb/>\nof the show, but a sort of aggregate of all the versions through which it had evolved.<lb/>\nThus the published version in the <hi>MT</hi> includes 50 songs, though Dibdin’s normal<lb/>\nperformance practice was to sing 24. As he notes in the passage quoted above, Dibdin<lb/>\nprepared a text of this “ideal,” extended version of the show between 6 and 22 March.<lb/>\nAfter a brief rest, on 25 March Dibdin began work on the 123-page missing section he<lb/>\nwould require to complete his volume, and that in the end needed to be 125 pages long.<lb/>\nWhat Dibdin and Gales had forgotten is that the nature of the printing process meant the<lb/>\ntotal number of pages prior to the new material (i.e., <hi>Readings and Music</hi>) needed to be divisible by four—to avoid a single leaf having to be inserted—which would have been the case had they started printing <hi>Readings and Music</hi> on page 305 or 309.<note place=\"foot\" xml:id=\"n19\">Strictly speaking, I believe Dibdin was wrong to say they were “entangled with an odd quarter of a sheet”: they were “entangled” with an odd eighth of a sheet, i.e., 2 pages.</note><lb/>\nDibdin did not find it as easy to fill the gap as he apparently expected. His account of the tour<lb/>\nproper was completed on 17 April, but this only brought him to page 249, leaving another 59<lb/>\npages of additional content urgently needing to be filled. Here Dibdin announces that he<lb/>\nwill “wind up” with a “running account of places, inns, &c. and a few more gleanings,” as<lb/>\nwell as more “remarks on the subject of music” and a catalogue “of my [theatrical] pieces,<lb/>\nand the profits which arose from them” (249). It was the catalogue that served Dibdin best,<lb/>\nfor, rather absurdly divided into letters like everything else, it filled 24 pages. His original<lb/>\nplans for the <hi>MT</hi> had mentioned “many theatrical transactions,” but it is hard to believe<lb/>\nthat he then imagined it encompassing this sort of career overview. Given that a persistent<lb/>\ntheme of the book is Dibdin’s not being properly appreciated in England—hence the intended<lb/>\n",
