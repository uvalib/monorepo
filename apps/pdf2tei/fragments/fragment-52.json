Carter-Sparrow-White (A:1952) 21. In the Eton<lb/>\ncopy of the Collamore exhibition catalogue (C:1961), Carter noted that his<lb/>\npreface to the <hi>Selected Prose</hi> incorporates most (except for the conclusion) of<lb/>\nhis address at that exhibition opening. In a note in <hi>The Book Collector</hi> a year<lb/>\nlater (“<hi>Housmaniana</hi>,” D:1962, Spring), he explained the production history<lb/>\nof the book: “The first impression (serving both the British and American<lb/>\nmarkets) bears on the reverse of the title-leaf the legend ‘Reprinted in the<lb/>\nUnited States of America’. The collector will naturally infer an earlier printing:<lb/>\nhe will be wrong. The bibliographer will wonder, reprinted from what?<lb/>\nThe explanation is that the book was set at Cambridge (the page-proofs, to<lb/>\nwhich I happen to have access, carry the normal imprint of the University<lb/>\nPrinter); the edition was then produced in the United States by photo-offset<lb/>\nfrom ‘reproduction proofs’; it was bound and jacketed (for the cloth issue)<lb/>\nand wrappered (for the paperback) also in the United States; and the copies for publication<lb/>\nfrom Bentley House on 8 Nov. 1961 (20 Oct. from CUP New York) shipped across the Atlantic.”<lb/>\nFor Carter’s other editions of Housman, see the references at <hi rend=\"bold\">B:1930</hi>.<lb/>\nCorrected impression: Cambridge and New York: Cambridge University Press, 1962.<lb/>\nxv,204 pp. Hardback and paperback.<lb/>\n<hi rend=\"bold\">New Amsterdam subedition.</hi> <hi>The Name and Nature of Poetry and Other<lb/>\nSelected Prose</hi>.
