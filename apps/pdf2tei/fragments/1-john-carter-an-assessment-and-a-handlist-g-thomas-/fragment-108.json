It is<lb/>\n hard to conceive of his writing <hi rend=\"italic\">The Fall of the Titan</hi> at the same time. (The only<lb/>\n periods when he might have had some free time on his hands would have been<lb/>\n on shipboard when traveling to and from New York in early 1929 and early<lb/>\n 1932; but it seems unlikely that he would have given priority to this novel over<lb/>\n the bibliographical projects he had in progress.)<lb/>\n So we are left with the possibility that he wrote it for amusement during his<lb/>\n college years. But that, too, is hard to believe: why would he have chosen to de-<lb/>\n vote so much time to a work of melodramatic political fiction (or a parody of one),<lb/>\n when he was busy with his studies and with book-hunting? And if he had done<lb/>\n so, everything we know about him suggests that he would have made a better job<lb/>\n of it, even as an undergraduate. The novel as it stands would presumably have<lb/>\n been an embarrassment to him by 1934. Why would he have wanted to resurrect<lb/>\n it by giving it to a publisher? A possible reason could be that he thought it might<lb/>\n bring in some money. But if he wanted to publish it and conceal his authorship,<lb/>\n surely he would not have chosen a pseudonym that could so easily be identified<lb/>\n with him.<lb/>\n We thus come back to the name “John Waynflete,” which remains, after all,<lb/>\n the seemingly most persuasive link with Carter—and probably the only one<lb/>\n considered by the collectors and library cataloguers who have made the connec-<lb/>\n tion. But it is not as decisive as it may at first seem to be. Carter’s verifiable uses<lb/>\n of the name “Waynflete” did not begin until after 1934: first as “George Wayn-<lb/>\n flete” in <hi rend=\"italic\">Bibliographical Notes &amp; Queries</hi> in 1939, then as “Waynflete” in <hi rend=\"italic\">Publishers’<lb/> Weekly</hi> in 1940, and finally as “John Waynflete” in <hi rend=\"italic\">The Cornhill Magazine</hi> in 1944.<lb/>\n Therefore if someone other than Carter were looking for a pseudonym, even<lb/>\n someone attuned to the bibliophilic world, there would have been no reason to<lb/>\n avoid “Waynflete” as a name already in use. And Carter was not well enough<lb/>\n known (at least until the <hi rend=\"italic\">Enquiry</hi> came out, a few months after the novel) for<lb/>\n many people to have been aware of his middle name. (I realize that Carter’s use<lb/>\n of “George Waynflete” in 1939 could be seen as his way of distancing himself<lb/>\n from the novel he had signed “John Waynflete” five years earlier—though not a<lb/>\n very great distancing. But this argument goes both ways: he could also have been<lb/>\n distancing himself from the “John Waynflete” someone else had used five years<lb/>\n earlier—which he would probably have been aware of through the <hi rend=\"italic\">TLS</hi> review.)<lb/>\n If there was no reason for someone else to avoid using “Waynflete” in 1934,<lb/>\n what reason would there have been for anyone else to choose it? Actually, there<lb/>\n would have been many people to whom the name might have occurred as an<lb/>\n appealing and appropriate pseudonym: anyone who had a connection with Eton,<lb/>\n Winchester, or Magdalen College. Carter’s middle name results from a family<lb/>\n connection with William Waynflete, a fifteenth-century Provost of Eton, who<lb/>\n was also a Bishop of Winchester and the founder of Magdalen College Oxford.<lb/>\n The name is well known to persons who have some association with any of these<lb/>\n institutions. And, as Nicolas Barker has pointed out to me, it further impinges on<lb/>\n people’s consciousness through its use in place names, such as a road in Oxford,<lb/>\n a street in London, and a close in Bishops Waltham. The widespread knowledge<lb/>\n of the Waynflete name is indicated by its presence even in America: in Portland,<lb/>",
