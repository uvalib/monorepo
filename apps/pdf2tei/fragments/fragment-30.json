A blanket entry for the delightful<lb/>\nmenus of this dining club of typophiles (of which Carter was president in 1946)<lb/>\nis included in section B because Carter (elected to the Club in 1932) was secretary<lb/>\nfrom 1933 to 1936 and can therefore be thought of as the editor of the menus<lb/>\nduring those years, each of which was designed by a different person (often a<lb/>\nprominent book designer or artist). He designed two himself, numbers 38 (May<lb/>\n1933) and 55 (April 1936); and he was the subject of a third, number 65 (February<lb/>\n1938), which was for the meeting at which he spoke on “<hi>Cheap Reprints</hi>” (a talk<lb/>\nprinted in <hi>Typography</hi> for Winter 1938). Forty-eight of the menus from Carter’s<lb/>\nown collection (ranging from 1924, when the Club began, to 1970, and including<lb/>\nthe two he designed) were listed in <hi>Potter Books</hi> catalogue 7 (May 1977). Carter<lb/>\nwas also one of the speakers who participated in the discussion of Stanley Mori<lb/>\nson at the November 1967 dinner, which resulted in a separate publication (see<lb/>\nC:1968). A biographical entry for Carter is included in <hi>The Double Crown Club:</hi><lb/>\nRegister of Past and Present Members (1949); and James Moran’s <hi>The Double Crown<lb/>\nClub: A History of Fifty Years</hi> (1974) quotes from Carter’s witty reports on the meet<lb/>\nings and is entered in section C.<lb/>\n\n(4) Pseudonymous and Unsigned Contributions to Bibliographical Notes & Que<lb/>\nries, 1935–39. This journal resulted from conversations among the members of<lb/>\nMichael Sadleir’s informal dining group (the “<hi>Biblio Boys</hi>”), who recognized the<lb/>\ndesirability of greater communication in the rare-book world. P. H. Muir (of El<lb/>\nkin Mathews Ltd.) was its editor from the start, in January 1935, with David A.<lb/>\nRandall (of Scribner’s) joining him as “American editor” in October. Although<lb/>\nmembers of the group did their best to support the journal through numerous<lb/>\ncontributions, many under pseudonyms, there was insufficient material for it to<lb/>\ncontinue after May 1939. (At that point fifteen issues—four for 1935 designated<lb/>\nas volume 1 and eleven, numbered as twelve, for 1936–39 as volume 2—had<lb/>\nbeen published, totaling 151 pages and containing 330 queries, with replies to<lb/>\nmany of them; Cordex “self-binding” cases, with gilt-lettered spines, for shelving<lb/>\neach of the two volumes were also available.) Carter contributed 39 items using<lb/>\nhis own name, and some of his comments were substantial: for example, his notes<lb/>\non Thomas Gray’s <hi>Odes</hi> (in May 1936 and April and November 1938) amount<lb/>\nto more than 2500 words, and those on Florence Nightingale’s <hi>Notes</hi> (October<lb/>\n1935), a 1684 edition of <hi>Catullus</hi> (May 1936), and Melville’s <hi>Typee</hi> (February<lb/>\n1937) are at least 750 words each. And the only two articles that appeared in the<lb/>\njournal, written to fill out the last two pages of the last two issues, were his. He<lb/>",
