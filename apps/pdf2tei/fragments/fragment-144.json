  "tei": "<pb n=\"144\"/>The epistolary record shows that Jefferson’s granddaughters worked regularly as<lb/>his amanuenses in 1823 and 1824.<lb/>But Trist was enlisted instead; and the project,<lb/>far from requiring days or weeks, was completed apparently over several months,<lb/>after Trist had left Monticello and taken his copy texts with him.<lb/>The timeline, as<lb/>well as Jefferson’s apologetic response to Trist seeking pardon for \"the difficulty\"<lb/>of the task, conspire to suggest that the textual history of the 1823 Trist catalog is<lb/>more complex than Gilreath and Wilson’s account allows.<lb/>It might be suggested<lb/>that Jefferson was here referring to the \"difficulty\" of Trist’s writing out the 114<lb/>pages of the 1823 catalog, but that ignores an alternate reading of Jefferson’s letter: the \"difficulty\" to which Jefferson \"subjected\" Trist was that of disentangling<lb/>his system of organization with recourse only to the 1783 catalog, its sporadic<lb/>notes and marginal instructions, and an unannotated 1815 printed catalog.<lb/>After recounting the evidence, our theory can now be laid out in full: our<lb/>account of the copy text(s) of the 1823 Trist catalog renders an annotated 1815<lb/>catalog unnecessary.<lb/>We might go even further: with only the 1783 catalog (and<lb/>its notes) and a copy of the 1815 catalog to hand, anyone well versed in Jefferson’s<lb/>shelving schema and his epistemological habits of thought could produce a document nearly equivalent in form and makeup to the Trist manuscript, though with<lb/>occasional variants resulting from ambiguities in the arrangement of entries in the<lb/>1783 catalog.<lb/>In Trist’s case, with the written instructions from Jefferson in the<lb/>1783 catalog and some verbal preparation—likely imparted while Trist was at<lb/>Monticello after June 1821, or when he began studying law with Jefferson at Monticello in spring of 1823—Jefferson’s desired order could have been reconstructed.<lb/>Where ambiguities arose or when a revised order was required, Jefferson’s<lb/>marginal instructions in the 1783 catalog guided Trist’s work; or alternatively,<lb/>Trist could fall back on his own knowledge of Jefferson’s \"sometimes chronological, sometimes analytical\" arrangement or the order of Jefferson’s shelving, as<lb/>recorded in the shelf mark numbers printed in the 1815 printed catalog.<lb/>Having introduced the first four catalogs relevant to our argument—the<lb/>1783 catalog, the 1812 fair copy, the 1815 printed catalog, and the 1823 Trist<lb/>catalog—we advance the pattern of filiation illustrated in the stemma in figure 7.<lb/>This stemma, and the bibliographical evidence enumerated above offer a new<lb/>textual account of the 1823 catalog, but leaves the reason for its production obscure: what was its purpose and the uses to which it was put?<lb/>Why would Jefferson want Trist to laboriously compile an eclectic catalog, reproducing the contents of the 1815 printed catalog and the arrangement of the annotated 1783 catalog,<lb/>as late as 1823?<lb/>Was it because Jefferson simply hoped to recover the extent and arrangement of his library before its sale to Congress in 1812?<lb/>Or was it because Jefferson was engaged in the most significant and demanding project he undertook in retirement: the formation and planning of the University of Virginia and its library?<lb/>Douglas Wilson allowed this point in his article announcing the rediscovery of the 1823 catalog.<lb/>Similarly, Endrina Tay has linked the 1823 Trist<lb/>catalog to Jefferson’s plan for the university’s library, noting that Trist’s copy was made \"so that [ Jefferson] would have on hand a reference list of the books in his previous library ordered by subject as he began to plan the library collection for<lb/>37.
