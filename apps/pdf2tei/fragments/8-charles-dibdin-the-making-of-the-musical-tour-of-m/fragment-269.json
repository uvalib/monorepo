  "tei": "<pb n=\"263\"/>\n<p><hi rend=\"dropcap\">F</hi>ive minutes before I sat down to this table where I am now writing, being at Beverly in<lb/>\nYorkshire, I dispatched to the printer at Hull a manuscript of the proposal for publishing<lb/>\nmy Musical Tour. (45)<lb/>\nHull was just nine miles by road from Beverly, and the printing was clearly done<lb/>\nquickly, so when Dibdin later came to his account of these days he could state<lb/>\n“At Beverly I first issued my proposals for printing this work” (139). Dibdin had<lb/>\nnow decided to make the <hi rend=\"italic\">MT</hi> a subscription volume and realized his tour offered<lb/>\nhim a wonderful opportunity for collecting subscribers. It may be just a coinci-<lb/>\ndence that he took his first steps toward this just after breaking with Swift, but<lb/>\nthe evidence suggests it was part of his larger rethinking of the book at this time.<lb/>\nSwift had recently published <hi rend=\"italic\">The Temple of Folly</hi> with the well-known London<lb/>\npublisher Joseph Johnson, and may have believed that he had the influence, and<lb/>\nperhaps the money, to ensure the acceptance of a completed manuscript volume<lb/>\nby an established publisher. Dibdin now concluded, probably correctly, that he<lb/>\nstood to make rather more money if he became his own publisher and used his<lb/>\nperformances as a way of advertising for subscriptions. In the future, he would<lb/>\nregularly be his own publisher.</p>\n<p>Dibdin provided a good deal of business for printers in the course of his tour.<lb/>\nOn arriving in a new area, he would employ the local printer to produce hand-<lb/>\nbills advertising his performances. We even know how much he expected to pay<lb/>\nfor these, for on his second visit to Derby he complained that the printer John<lb/>\nDrewry wanted “to charge half-a-crown [i.e., 30p] a hundred for the same sort of<lb/>\nbills which he had printed the first time I was there for eighteen-pence” (153–54).<lb/>\nFrom November 1787 onwards, these handbills probably routinely mentioned<lb/>\nthe planned subscription volume, and for anyone wanting to know more, Dibdin<lb/>\nhad his separate “proposal.” Working with Dibdin in this way, it would not be<lb/>\nsurprising if regional printers showed an interest in printing the <hi rend=\"italic\">MT</hi> itself, and<lb/>\nDibdin assures his readers that this was the case: “Before I ever saw Mr. Gales I<lb/>\nhad received numberless civilities at the hands of different printers, from many of<lb/>\nwhom I have had offers to print my Tour—after I knew Mr. Gales, I preferred<lb/>\nhim to all the printers I had seen” (207). Joseph Gales (1761–1841), remembered<lb/>\nmost of all for his radical views and later career in America, was a young printer<lb/>\nwho had set up business in Sheffield in 1784. Dibdin’s first visit to Sheffield took<lb/>\nplace in mid-October 1787, and lasted two or three days (129). He makes no<lb/>\nmention of having met Gales on that occasion, but he probably did so, for at the<lb/>\nend of the year he received a letter from the printer, seemingly inviting him to<lb/>\nreturn to Sheffield, which he promptly did, arriving on 31 December. Because<lb/>\nof this return, Dibdin later wrote, he “acquired the friendship of Mr. Gales, and<lb/>\nthe satisfaction of employing him to print this work” (208).</p>\n<p>Dibdin remained in Sheffield until 12 January 1788 (213) and in this period<lb/>\nmust have made definite plans with Gales for the printing of the volume, con-<lb/>\ntracting for 600 copies (Advertisement). Dibdin then took off to Manchester for<lb/>\nten days or so before returning to Sheffield; “on the following week,” he then<lb/>\nwrites, “this Tour was put to press” (242). Although Dibdin does not specify the<lb/>\ndate, these clues suggest that Gales and his apprentices probably started work<lb/>\non Dibdin’s incomplete manuscript on Monday 28 January. Dibdin was able to<lb/>\n</p>",
