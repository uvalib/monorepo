In the first <lb/>\nletter in the manuscript, Dibdin originally had the subtitle “To Theophilus Swift <lb/>\nEsq.” but the name was subsequently crossed out and replaced with “T. S. Esq.” <lb/>\nwhich is then consistently used in the Winchester volume and in the printed <hi rend=\"smallcaps\">MT</hi>.<lb/>\nDibdin clearly expected a reply to this first letter but did not get one. He then <lb/>\nwaited six weeks before writing to Swift again, this time from York, on 28 Septem-<lb/>\nber. At this juncture, it is clear, he had abandoned any hope of obtaining regular <lb/>\ncommentary from his friend, and quickly followed this with three more letters, <lb/>\non 30 September and 4 and 5 October. It is significant, I suggest, that the last of <lb/>\nthese, detailing Dibdin’s experiences in Bath the previous March, is mostly taken <lb/>\nup with a story about an Irishman (21–22). The Irishman had promised he would <lb/>\nensure a good audience at the Assembly Rooms if Dibdin could set to music a <lb/>\npoem written by a lady he was courting and allow him to claim the music as his <lb/>\nown. Dibdin set the song, but the “nefarious” Irishman did not keep his promise.<lb/>\nIn context, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that the story was pointed at Swift, <lb/>\nimplicitly accusing him of betrayal. Swift himself may have read it that way, for <lb/>\nhe now, at last replied. His letter was not published, but Dibdin’s brief reply to <lb/>\nit, dated 14 October, is included in the <hi rend=\"smallcaps\">MT</hi>.<note n=\"11\">In the Winchester manuscript, interestingly, Dibdin first dated the letter “Nov 14<hi rend=\"sup\">th</hi>” before correcting “Nov” to “Oct” (Letter 2). This suggests that it may have been written some time after its putative date, and for artistic purposes more than anything else. (The Winchester manuscript numbers the letters in their headings, rather than by pages or folios.)</note> Dibdin could now, at last, write:<lb/>\nI cannot have a stronger stimulative to proceed than your kindness. The praise you are <lb/>\npleased to afford my introductory letter—which cannot, from its nature, be so entertain-<lb/>\ning as those of which it is the harbinger—gives me very flattering hopes that this testimony <lb/>\nof public gratitude will hold some rank in the world’s estimation. (5)<lb/>\nDibdin gave this letter the title “Encouragement to Proceed” and rather mislead-<lb/>\ningly placed it second in the <hi rend=\"smallcaps\">MT</hi>, allowing the casual reader the impression that <lb/>\nSwift had responded reasonably promptly to the initial letter, though giving the <lb/>\ndate at the bottom to make clear to the careful reader that this was not the case.<lb/>\nBy this time, it must have been obvious to Dibdin that he was not going to <lb/>\nget Swift’s “sentiments on each separate letter,” but he felt encouraged enough <lb/>\nto go on, as the Irishman had clearly made some sort of assurance that he would <lb/>\ntry to do better. Dibdin despatched further letters on the 16, 17, 21 and 22 Oc-<lb/>\ntober, the last with a dramatic postscript which could have come straight from a <lb/>\nsentimental novel of the period: “Why have I not heard from you!” (39). The next <lb/>\nletter, the following day, similarly states: “’Tis hard you will not write to me” (41). <lb/>\nThese might be read as rhetorical flourishes, designed to make the published tour <lb/>\nmore readable, but it appears that frustration lay behind them, and Dibdin now <lb/>\nabruptly stopped directing his letters to Swift. His complex, hurt feelings regard-<lb/>",
