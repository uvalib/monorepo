Although from the<lb/>\nearly 1770s onwards his literary ambitions were steadily developing, there is no<lb/>\nevidence prior to 1787 of a serious interest in book production. He had published<lb/>\nlibrettos, a polemical pamphlet, The Royal Circus Epitomized (1784), and his own<lb/>\nperiodical, The Devil, which ran for 22 issues in 1786 and 1787. But after his<lb/>\n1787–88 tour produced the Musical Tour of Mr. Dibdin, a 450-page quarto far<lb/>\nbigger in size and scope than anything he had written before, he began think-<lb/>\ning on a different scale, publishing three three-volume novels between 1793 and<lb/>\n1807, a five-volume Complete History of the English Stage between 1797 and 1800,<lb/>\ntwo large volumes of Observations on a Tour Through Almost the Whole of England, and<lb/>\na Considerable Part of Scotland in 1801 and 1802, and four volumes of The Profes-<lb/>\nsional Life of Mr. Dibdin in 1803. The Musical Tour directly anticipates, in different<lb/>\nways, most of the major publications that followed. Dibdin discovered a taste for<lb/>\nautobiographical writing mixed with anecdotes, opinions and polemics; although<lb/>\nhe has, at most, appeared as a footnote in accounts of Romantic autobiography,<lb/>\nno British writer published more about themselves in the decades between 1780<lb/>\nand 1810.<lb/>\nDespite the great importance of the Musical Tour (hereafter MT) in Dibdin’s<lb/>\npolymathic career, it is as flawed as it is fascinating. It did not develop smoothly<lb/>\nand Dibdin had written much of it before deciding on the final shape and con-<lb/>\ntent of the volume. Moreover, he was often juggling the historical aspects of his<lb/>\naccount with a desire to comment on his present circumstances. When Dibdin<lb/>\nleft London, he had no idea of recording his experiences: “at my first setting out<lb/>\nI had not the smallest idea of writing any account of my Tour at all” (43–44).<lb/>\nNot until August did he lay plans for a book, and not until October did he begin<lb/>\nsystematically writing it. Given that the tour itself continued until March 1788,<lb/>\nthis meant that for a long time Dibdin was having to catch up with himself, and<lb/>\nhe recognized almost immediately the parallels with Laurence Sterne’s 1760s<lb/>\nnovel, Tristram Shandy (10). As the project developed, it came to unite the different<lb/>\nworlds of self-publishing, provincial printing, financing by subscription and—be-<lb/>\nlatedly—royal patronage. Scholars have paid some attention to the tour itself,<lb/>\nand to Readings and Music,<note n=\"5\">See, in particular, Elisabeth M. Lockwood, “Charles Dibdin’s Musical Tour,” Music and Letters 13, no. 2 (1932): 207–14; and Jeremy Barlow, “Dibdin on Tour: Performer or Sightseer?,” Early Music Performer 39 (October 2016): 3–8.</note> but there has been no separate analysis of the complex<lb/>\nvehicle through which Dibdin preserved a record of these things. The published<lb/>\nMT is the more interesting in that, uniquely among Dibdin’s major prose pub-<lb/>\nlications, a complete fair copy manuscript of the book has been preserved, held<lb/>\nin the Fellows’ Library at Winchester College (MS 61). Although there are few<lb/>\nsignificant departures from this bound manuscript volume in the printed text, the<lb/>\n</p>",
