  "tei": "<pb n=\"329\"/>\n<p>By a chance that could only have happened in the era of the Internet, I came<lb/>\nacross a joint application by Thurston and Dudley for a U.S. patent:<note n=\"23\"/><lb/>\nPatent application filed April 15, 1913. Serial no. 761,151. Book cover. Charles W.<lb/>\nThurston and Sarah Emery Dudley, United States Citizens residing at London. Patent<lb/>\nissued by the United States Patent Office, July 14, 1914, no. 1,103,102.<lb/>\nThe application is for a book cover incorporating a slot on the inside into<lb/>\nwhich a card can be inserted. The invention is trivial, but the technical drawing<lb/>\naccompanying it (figure 4) shows the unmistakable emblem of The Brothers, just<lb/>\nas it appears on the front paste-down of the 1913 edition of <hi>Comte de Gabalis</hi>.<lb/>\nAnd there are the signatures of Charles W. Thurston and Sarah Emery<lb/>\nDudley. Simultaneously with the first edition, they had planted this clue to The<lb/>\nBrothers’ identity where no one would think of looking for it. It also revealed<lb/>\nThurston’s first name, making it possible to track him down.<note n=\"24\"/> In 2021 I acquired sixteen letters written in the 1920s and 1930s to Hurwitz from Brunton,<lb/>\nThurston, and Thurston’s wife, which supplied further biographical information<lb/>\non all of them.<note n=\"25\"/></p>\n<p>Charles Willis Thurston (1872–1937) was born near Boston into an inventor’s<lb/>\nfamily. As a boy he <hi>“gathered mushrooms in Emerson’s front yard”</hi><note n=\"26\"/> and frequented the local Native Americans. He left a faint trail in the Boston art scene.<note n=\"27\"/><lb/>\nBy 1908 he was among the host of American artists exhibiting in Paris. Thus<lb/>\nhe was almost certainly the unnamed illustrator of our edition. I do not know<lb/>\nwhether there were any other Brothers, nor who was Thurston’s own master. His<lb/>\nteachings partly resemble those of Thomas Lake Harris (1823–1906), founder of<lb/>\nthe Brotherhood of the New Life, who consorted with fairies and claimed to be<lb/>\nmarried to a queen in their realm.</p>\n<p>A tentative conclusion emerges from this: that Sarah or Lotus Dudley met<lb/>\nThurston in London after her husband’s death. He instructed her in psychic and<lb/>\nesoteric matters, and they collaborated on the <hi>Comte de Gabalis</hi>. While the occult<lb/>\nmaterial was Thurston’s, by page-count it is in small proportion to the excerpts<lb/>\nfrom classical works, quotations, summaries, supplements, and comparisons that<lb/>\nfill out the 377 pages, not to mention the translation itself. Dudley, with her<lb/>\nBryn Mawr education and the British Museum at hand, was easily capable of<lb/>\nsuch work. She probably financed the 1913 London edition and the New York<lb/>\nedition of the following year. In 1922, with the earlier editions impossible to find,</p>\n<div type=\"footnotes\">\n  <note n=\"23\">The patent application was revealed in a YouTube talk of May 25, 2021, entitled <hi>“Who Wrote the Dayspring of Youth?”</hi> I am grateful to the presenter, identified only as “MtalksX,” for this vital piece of information.</note>\n  <note n=\"24\">On his ancestry, see the Frost Genealogy (https://archive.org/stream/frostgenealogyin00fros/frostgenealogyin00fros_djvu.txt) and Thurston Genealogies, compiled by Brown Thurston (Portland, Maine: Compiler, 1880), 232.</note>\n  <note n=\"25\">Charles Thurston married Aileen Winifred Cook (1889 or 1890–1953) on April 30, 1921.
