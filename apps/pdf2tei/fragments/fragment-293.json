Her younger sister,<lb/>\nAnne, was paid £40 a year (or £10 per quarter) for her work as a governess at<lb/>\nThorpe Green Hall—about 15 shillings per week.<sup>81</sup> That was considered to be<lb/>\na very favorable salary— one near the upper end of the range for what a governess<lb/>\ncould earn at that time. And so one ream of high-grade “post”— or the approximate<lb/>\namount of paper that Brontë required for copying out <hi>Shirley</hi>— could<lb/>\nhave easily cost a woman employed as a governess an entire week of her salary,<lb/>\nif not more. Although Brontë’s earning potential had significantly increased as of<lb/>\n1847 with the sale of <hi>Jane Eyre</hi>, the cost of paper was still not inconsequential.<sup>82</sup><lb/>\nIn <hi>Advice to Authors</hi>, Brontë would have read that it was “common practice . . .<lb/>\nto write only on one side of the leaf, and to leave the opposite, or under page,<lb/>\nblank.”<sup>83</sup> This is generally the practice she followed. But instead of ruling her<lb/>\nown paper or purchasing pre-ruled paper (as is suggested by <hi>Advice to Authors</hi>),<lb/>\nBrontë likely used a separate, heavily ruled leaf of paper, such as the one kept in<lb/>\nher writing desk, to slip under the surface of her letter paper.<sup>84</sup> When I placed<lb/>\nthe extant ruled leaf from Brontë’s desk under a leaf of London Superfine paper<lb/>\nstock, its dark lines showed through the writing paper, which suggests that the<lb/>\nleaf could have readily served as a guide for the copying of her manuscripts. The<lb/>\nuse of a ruled leaf would have allowed Brontë to regulate the number of lines per<lb/>\npage and thus systematize the pace and flow of her novels.<sup>85</sup><lb/>\nIf this were the case, the ruled leaf that Brontë used would have provided<lb/>\na margin of at least 2 cm on the left-hand side of each bifolium onto which she<lb/>\nwrote out the fair copies of her manuscripts—an inference supported by the<lb/>\nfairly uniform registration of the leaves in the manuscript of <hi>Shirley</hi>. Part of this<lb/>\nleft-hand margin could have been removed at the printing house if the bifolia<lb/>\nwere sliced instead of slit; the remaining margin was likely trimmed yet again as<lb/>\npart of the later binding process commissioned by George Smith. Brontë copied<lb/>\nout her novel nearly flush with the right-hand margin of the leaves; occasionally</p>\n<note place=\"foot\" n=\"81\">Juliet Barker, <hi>The Brontës</hi> (London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1994), 351.</note><lb/>\n<note place=\"foot\" n=\"82\">Brontë was paid £100 for the copyright of <hi>Jane Eyre</hi>, and received an additional £400 in payments for the novel.

The extant ruled leaf that I studied at the Brontë Parsonage Museum in 2019 is made of wove paper. It measures 19.25 cm wide (across the leaf); 23 cm long (top to bottom). The leaf was ruled in pencil first, then in ink. It was made of a thicker weight paper than the other writing papers I found in her desk. This example has a 1.1 cm margin on the left side of the template. The lines were ruled approximately 1 cm apart from one another, with 21 lines ruled on the leaf, allowing for 22 spaces for text. I identified two small holes punctured into the sheet above and below line 6 from the bottom of the device.</note><lb/>\n<note place=\"foot\" n=\"85\">Brontë came to adopt the use of a ruled leaf later in her process as a writer. The outset of her first manuscript intended for publication, <hi>The Professor</hi>, does not seem to follow any systematic ruling—nor do the earlier manuscripts generally referred to as the juvenilia. But she employed a ruled leaf consistently afterward in composing her manuscripts for <hi>Jane Eyre</hi>, <hi>Shirley</hi>, and <hi>Villette</hi>. See <hi>Authors and Bookmakers</hi>, 473. (In 2012, I detected the use of a ruled surface in the fair-copy manuscript of <hi>Jane Eyre</hi>, before locating an example of a ruled leaf, which I was able to do in 2019, during my research into the extant contents of the Brontës’ writing desks.)</note>",
