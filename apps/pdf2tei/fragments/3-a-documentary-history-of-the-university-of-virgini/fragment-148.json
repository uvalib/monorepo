  "tei": "<pb n=\"142\"/>\n<p>these printed shelving numbers to reconstruct Jefferson’s preferred order of books <lb/>\nwhen other forms of guidance (e.g., Jefferson’s marginal numbering) were lacking.<lb/>\nJefferson’s subject chapter on “Chemistry” shows how Trist might have occa-<lb/>\nsionally relied on shelving numbers printed in the 1815 catalog when ordering the <lb/>\nentries in his 1823 manuscript copy. In this chapter, the numbered series runs as <lb/>\nfollows: numbers 1-6 are duodecimos, numbers 7-29 are octavos, and number 30 <lb/>\nis a quarto. In copying the thirty titles that appear in this chapter from the 1815 <lb/>\nprinted catalog, Trist first transcribed the entries for the chapter’s first (and only) <lb/>\nquarto (“30. Neumann’s chemistry, by Lewis”), its first octavo (“7. McQueer’s <lb/>\nchemistry”), and the chapter’s first duodecimo (“1. Dictionnaire de Chimie de <lb/>\nMacquers”). In this case, Trist roughly followed the order of the 1783 catalog, <lb/>\nwhich lists these three titles at the head of the chapter, likely due to their general-<lb/>\nizing treatment of the subject. Following these three titles, however—perhaps due <lb/>\nto the ambiguous arrangement of the remaining books in this chapter in the 1783 <lb/>\ncatalog and the absence of Jefferson’s ordinal annotations— Trist deferred to the <lb/>\nshelf marks in the 1815 printed catalog to order the entries in his 1823 copy <hi rend=\"italic\">(fig.&amp;nbsp;6)</hi>.<lb/>\nThe sole exception—the appearance of a duodecimo, “6. Jacob’s Chemical pocket <lb/>\ncompanion,” among an uninterrupted sequence of octavos—is likely the result of <lb/>\nTrist returning to the order of the 1783 catalog, which collocates “Jacob’s chemical <lb/>\npocket companion” and “Jacob’s experiments on Urinary and Intestinal Calculi” <lb/>\n(an octavo).<hi rend=\"sup\">35</hi> This method of reordering books according to the sequence of Jeffer-<lb/>\n</p>\n<figure>\n  <head><hi rend=\"italic\">figure&amp;nbsp;6.</hi></head>\n  <figDesc>1823 Trist catalog, page&amp;nbsp;23, showing entries in Chapter&amp;nbsp;8, “Chemistry,” arranged according to Jefferson’s shelf mark numbers (here, 21-25, 6, and 26-29).
