  "tei": "<pb n=\"156\"/>\n<p>(“Modern History, Foreign”) of the 1823 and 1825 Trist catalogs. These respec-<lb/>\ntive sections list many of the same books in approximately the same order; and <lb/>\nthe arrangement of the entries’ content—title, format, and occasionally volume <lb/>\ncount—is roughly equivalent. The sole difference is the removal of Weeks’ Intro-<lb/>\nduction to Chronology, a 12mo, from the 1825 list. The simplest explanation for <lb/>\nthese points of similarity is that the 1823 and 1825 Trist documents share a textual <lb/>\nfiliation, with Jefferson’s lost 1824 desiderata occupying the intermediary place.<lb/>\nThe first entries in Jefferson’s chapter on British History offer more evidence <lb/>\n(figs. 13 and 14). Here again, the order of the entries in the 1823 Trist catalog <lb/>\nis replicated in the 1825 Trist catalog—a copy of the Domesday book opens <lb/>\nthe chapter, followed by Camden’s Britannia (the later list omits the Latin edi-<lb/>\ntion that appears in the 1823 Trist catalog, preferring Gibson’s English transla-<lb/>\ntion), and ending with Sheringham’s De Anglorum Gentis Origine [On the Origin of <lb/>\nthe English People]. There are discrepancies, however. To the later list, Jefferson <lb/>\nadded Thomas Hearne’s edition of Leland’s Itinerary and Collectanea and omitted <lb/>\nVerstegan’s [Restitution of Decayed Intelligence in] Antiquities. In the second case, <lb/>\nthe reasoning behind Jefferson’s omission is clear: a copy of Verstegan’s book <lb/>\nis listed in the 1825 John Vaughn Kean catalog, ordered from Bohn by Gilmer <lb/>\nand delivered the year before. Listing it again in the later catalog would have <lb/>\nauthorized Cummings &amp; Hilliard to purchase a duplicate copy. The addition of <lb/>\nthe two titles by Leland demonstrates another category of revision undertaken <lb/>\nby Jefferson as he prepared the university’s first library—that is, the addition of <lb/>\ntitles never owned by Jefferson and therefore not listed in the 1823 Trist catalog. <lb/>\nThis evidence of addition and omission encapsulates Jefferson’s scribal method <lb/>\nin compiling the lost 1824 catalog, which sits between the 1823 and 1825 Trist <lb/>\ncatalogs, both chronologically and textually. Working with Trist’s 1823 catalog as <lb/>\na basis-text, Jefferson copied out a more complete collection in the 1824 catalog, <lb/>\nadding titles or modifying editions to update his library for a modern university <lb/>\nand its students. Trist then copied this fuller list, omitting titles in Kean’s 1825 <lb/>\ncatalog, to form the final 1825 catalog sent to Cummings &amp; Hilliard.<lb/>\nPerhaps the strongest evidence for the 1825 Trist catalog’s systematic omis-<lb/>\nsion of books ordered from Bohn and listed in Kean’s catalog appears in its final <lb/>\nchapter. The last chapter of the 1823 Trist catalog, “Polygraphical,” lists copies <lb/>\nof Bacon’s Works and Advancement of Learning followed by copies of Locke’s <lb/>\nWorks and Familiar Letters (Locke’s Posthumous Works and “a collection of his pieces” are <lb/>\nnested below these titles, with a parenthetical note indicating that they appear <lb/>\n“in op.”: in operibus, or in the multivolume Works) (fig. 15). After Locke appears <lb/>\nMilton’s Prose Works in two volumes and a copy of King James’s Works. Collat-<lb/>\ning this section of the 1823 Trist catalog with the corresponding section of the <lb/>\n1825 Trist catalog, however, reveals that Jefferson ordered no works by Locke <lb/>\nor Bacon from Cummings &amp; Hilliard. Instead, in the 1825 Trist catalog Milton’s <lb/>\nProse Works and King James’s Works follow Cassiodori Op[era]. Omn[ia]., with no <lb/>\nintervening entries (the omission of Andrew Dalzel’s two Collectanea, listed above <lb/>\nBacon’s Works in the 1823 Trist catalog, is due apparently to Jefferson’s decision <lb/>\nnot to acquire it for the university’s library) (fig. 16). This would have amounted <lb/>\nto a significant oversight: Jefferson revered both Bacon and Locke—indeed, <lb/>\n</p>",
