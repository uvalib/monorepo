      "The differences observed are limited to header/footer markers (e.g. 'S', 'N', page numbers) and formatting/line-break variations in the figure captions. In one instance the figure label changes from 'figure 4b' to 'figure 4a.' due to the reordering of content across pages. These changes do not alter the informational content and are acceptable as minor transcription formatting differences."
