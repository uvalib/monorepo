  "tei": "<pb n=\"138\"/>\n<lb/>numerals from 1 to 41 is faintly penciled in the left margins. These numerals, all <lb/>in Jefferson’s handwriting, assign a revised sequence to the books listed on these <lb/>pages. Comparing the marginal numerals with the order of the corresponding en-<lb/>tries in the Trist manuscript (found on 109 verso and 110 recto, Chapter 43, “Criti-<lb/>cism, Languages”) reveals that Trist followed this later sequence in copying entries <lb/>from the 1815 printed catalog. Another example of Jefferson’s marginal ordering <lb/>guiding Trist’s own comes in Chapter&amp;nbsp;20, “Law Merchant.” In this brief chapter <lb/>(comprising only ten titles), each entry in the 1783 catalog is accompanied by a <lb/>numeral in the left margin, as above.<hi rend=\"sup\">26</hi> While the 1815 printed catalog arranges <lb/>the ten entries in this chapter alphabetically by author, Trist’s copy follows the <lb/>order set out by Jefferson’s annotations in the 1783 catalog (see figs.&amp;nbsp;4a-b and 5a-<lb/>b).<hi rend=\"sup\">27</hi> In other words, while the entries in the 1823 Trist catalog follow the format, <lb/>spelling, and syntax of those in the 1815 printed catalog (i.e., shelf number, author, <lb/>title, volume count, format, date), they are arranged according to the sequence <lb/>stipulated by these marginal ordinals found in the 1783 catalog.<hi rend=\"sup\">28</hi><lb/><lb/>In addition to these marginal numerals, the 1783 catalog contains discursive <lb/>notes in Jefferson’s handwriting, which may have served to augment or reiterate <lb/>points made verbally to Trist during one of Trist’s stays at Monticello.<hi rend=\"sup\">29</hi> These <lb/>cryptic marginal and interlinear instructions are almost always expressed in brief <lb/>imperatives, prescribing Jefferson’s desired arrangement of entries in the 1783 <lb/>catalog. One such note, on page&amp;nbsp;197 in Jefferson’s Chapter&amp;nbsp;24 on “Politics,” super-<lb/>scribes a list of eighteen books. The note reads, “this should follow Brady of bor-<lb/>oughs.” Of these eighteen books, sixteen appear in the 1815 printed catalog. While <lb/>Trist apparently failed to transcribe one of these sixteen—a copy of “Junius’s let-<lb/>ters, 2.v. 12mo”—the remaining fifteen titles appear in Trist’s 1823 catalog after <lb/>(as we might expect, and as Jefferson’s note stipulated) “Brady on Boroughs.”<hi rend=\"sup\">30</hi> We <lb/>might assume, for the sake of argument, that Jefferson’s instructions were meant <lb/>to guide the arrangement of his lost 1812 catalog, a fair copy of the 1783 catalog. <lb/><lb/>26.&amp;nbsp;An unnumbered eleventh title, “Cunningham’s Law of bills, 8vo” was not listed in the <lb/>1815 printed catalog and so was not included by Trist in his 1823 manuscript copy. <lb/><lb/>27.&amp;nbsp;Another series of marginal numbers in Jefferson’s hand appears on page&amp;nbsp;155 of the <lb/>1783 catalog. These numbers order books listed in “Chapter&amp;nbsp;27, Geometry” according to a <lb/>new sequence: Tacquet’s Euclid precedes Stone’s Euclid and Stone’s Euclid precedes Simpson’s. <lb/>Eventually, at the bottom of the list, De&amp;nbsp;Brahm’s tract on leveling tools is labeled “21.” Except-<lb/>ing the titles that do not appear in the 1815 catalog (and thus were not copied by Trist), Trist <lb/>follows the order provided by these marginal numbers without deviation in preparing this sec-<lb/>tion of the 1823 manuscript, again suggesting that Trist might have consulted these marginal <lb/>annotations when arranging entries in his copy. <lb/><lb/>28.&amp;nbsp;While Sowerby observed that changes in ordering made between the 1783 catalog <lb/>and the 1812 fair copy “were not confined to the chapter arrangement, but apply also to the <lb/>position of individual book entries,” she did not speculate on the purpose behind Jefferson’s <lb/>revised ordering of the entries in some subject chapters. Instead, Sowerby silently amended the <lb/>order of the entries to reflect Jefferson’s annotations. See Sowerby, “Foreword,” Catalogue of the <lb/>Library of Thomas Jefferson, 4:8. <lb/><lb/>29.&amp;nbsp;Trist and Jefferson’s correspondence confirms that Trist was at Monticello in 1817, <lb/>1821, and 1823. It was likely during this final stay that Jefferson enlisted Trist’s help on the Uni-<lb/>versity’s library catalogs.
