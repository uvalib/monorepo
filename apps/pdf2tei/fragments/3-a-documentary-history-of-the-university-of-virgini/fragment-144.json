  "tei": "<pb n=\"144\"/>\n<lb/>numerals from 1 to 41 is faintly penciled in the left margins. These numerals, all\n<lb/>in Jefferson’s handwriting, assign a revised sequence to the books listed on these\n<lb/>pages. Comparing the marginal numerals with the order of the corresponding en-\n<lb/>tries in the Trist manuscript (found on 109 verso and 110 recto, Chapter 43, “Criti-\n<lb/>cism, Languages”) reveals that Trist followed this later sequence in copying entries\n<lb/>from the 1815 printed catalog. Another example of Jefferson’s marginal ordering\n<lb/>guiding Trist’s own comes in Chapter 20, “Law Merchant.” In this brief chapter\n<lb/>(comprising only ten titles), each entry in the 1783 catalog is accompanied by a\n<lb/>numeral in the left margin, as above.<hi rend=\"sup\">26</hi> While the 1815 printed catalog arranges\n<lb/>the ten entries in this chapter alphabetically by author, Trist’s copy follows the\n<lb/>order set out by Jefferson’s annotations in the 1783 catalog (see figs. 4a-b and 5a-\n<lb/>b).<hi rend=\"sup\">27</hi> In other words, while the entries in the 1823 Trist catalog follow the format,\n<lb/>spelling, and syntax of those in the 1815 printed catalog (i.e., shelf number, author,\n<lb/>title, volume count, format, date), they are arranged according to the sequence\n<lb/>stipulated by these marginal ordinals found in the 1783 catalog.<hi rend=\"sup\">28</hi>\n<lb/>\n<lb/>In addition to these marginal numerals, the 1783 catalog contains discursive\n<lb/>notes in Jefferson’s handwriting, which may have served to augment or reiterate\n<lb/>points made verbally to Trist during one of Trist’s stays at Monticello.<hi rend=\"sup\">29</hi> These\n<lb/>cryptic marginal and interlinear instructions are almost always expressed in brief\n<lb/>imperatives, prescribing Jefferson’s desired arrangement of entries in the 1783\n<lb/>catalog. One such note, on page 197 in Jefferson’s Chapter 24 on “Politics,” super-\n<lb/>scribes a list of eighteen books. The note reads, “this should follow Brady of bor-\n<lb/>oughs.” Of these eighteen books, sixteen appear in the 1815 printed catalog. While\n<lb/>Trist apparently failed to transcribe one of these sixteen—a copy of “Junius’s let-\n<lb/>ters, 2.v. 12mo”—the remaining fifteen titles appear in Trist’s 1823 catalog after\n<lb/>(as we might expect, and as Jefferson’s note stipulated) “Brady on Boroughs.”<hi rend=\"sup\">30</hi> We\n<lb/>might assume, for the sake of argument, that Jefferson’s instructions were meant\n<lb/>to guide the arrangement of his lost 1812 catalog, a fair copy of the 1783 catalog.\n<lb/>\n<lb/><hi rend=\"sup\">26</hi>. An unnumbered eleventh title, “Cunningham’s Law of bills, 8vo” was not listed in the\n<lb/>1815 printed catalog and so was not included by Trist in his 1823 manuscript copy.\n<lb/><hi rend=\"sup\">27</hi>. Another series of marginal numbers in Jefferson’s hand appears on page 155 of the\n<lb/>1783 catalog. These numbers order books listed in “Chapter 27, Geometry” according to a\n<lb/>new sequence: Tacquet’s Euclid precedes Stone’s Euclid and Stone’s Euclid precedes Simpson’s.\n<lb/>Eventually, at the bottom of the list, De Brahm’s tract on leveling tools is labeled “21.” Except-\n<lb/>ing the titles that do not appear in the 1815 catalog (and thus were not copied by Trist), Trist\n<lb/>follows the order provided by these marginal numbers without deviation in preparing this sec-\n<lb/>tion of the 1823 manuscript, again suggesting that Trist might have consulted these marginal\n<lb/>annotations when arranging entries in his copy.\n<lb/><hi rend=\"sup\">28</hi>. While Sowerby observed that changes in ordering made between the 1783 catalog\n<lb/>and the 1812 fair copy “were not confined to the chapter arrangement, but apply also to the\n<lb/>position of individual book entries,” she did not speculate on the purpose behind Jefferson’s\n<lb/>revised ordering of the entries in some subject chapters. Instead, Sowerby silently amended the\n<lb/>order of the entries to reflect Jefferson’s annotations. See Sowerby, “Foreword,” Catalogue of the\n<lb/>Library of Thomas Jefferson, 4:8.\n<lb/><hi rend=\"sup\">29</hi>. Trist and Jefferson’s correspondence confirms that Trist was at Monticello in 1817,\n<lb/>1821, and 1823. It was likely during this final stay that Jefferson enlisted Trist’s help on the Uni-\n<lb/>versity’s library catalogs.
