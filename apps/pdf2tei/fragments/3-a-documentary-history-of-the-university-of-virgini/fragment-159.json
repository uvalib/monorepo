(In a June 19, 1825 letter, Kean goes<lb/>\nso far as to invite Jefferson’s help arranging the university’s first books in their<lb/>\nsubject classes. Kean adds that “Dr. Blaetterman has commenced &amp; will com-<lb/>\nplete it,” if Jefferson is unable to do the arranging himself.<hi rend=\"sup\">55</hi>) Ultimately, though,<lb/>\nthe question of who was responsible for categorizing the university’s books into<lb/>\nthe 42 chapters of Kean’s catalog is immaterial. Comparing the rediscovered<lb/>\nleaf of the 1824 catalog and Kean’s carefully copied table of classifications makes<lb/>\nclear that Kean’s catalog derived from Jefferson’s lost 1824 catalog.<lb/>\nThe occasion for creating the 1825 Kean catalog has already been stated: with<lb/>\nJefferson’s lost 1824 catalog to guide him, Kean listed the books that made up<lb/>\nGilmer’s order from Bohn and arranged them in their appointed places according<lb/>\nto the 42-chapter system devised by Jefferson—a task completed presumably when<lb/>\nKean dated the catalog’s cover on 16 May 1825.<hi rend=\"sup\">56</hi> But Kean’s catalog had another<lb/>\npurpose besides. As Jefferson finished work on his 1824 desiderata—copying from<lb/>\nthe 1823 Trist catalog and consulting his correspondence with friends, his retire-<lb/>\nment library catalog, and his collection of booksellers’ lists—he encountered a<lb/>\nproblem that only Kean and his catalog could solve. Because Gilmer had acquired<lb/>\nmost of the university’s first books without consulting any of Jefferson’s evolving<lb/>\nbooklists, Jefferson needed to ensure that duplicate titles weren’t ordered from<lb/>\nthe university’s newly appointed bookseller, Cummings &amp; Hilliard of Boston.<hi rend=\"sup\">57</hi><lb/>\nIn other words, Jefferson needed Kean’s catalog to determine which books in the<lb/>\n1824 catalog had been ordered and would need to be omitted from a final list.<lb/>\nJefferson had reason to hurry. By July 14, 1824, William Hilliard had written<lb/>\noffering to “supply your University with such Books as may be wanted for Your<lb/>\ncourse of studies.”<hi rend=\"sup\">58</hi> Jefferson replied on September 6, 1824, expressing his interest<lb/>\n</p>\n<p>55.

This later<lb/>\nshipment of books was part of a subsequent order of books placed with Boston booksellers,<lb/>\nCummings &amp; Hilliard, described below.<lb/>\n</p>\n<p>56. In a January 20, 1825, letter to Gilmer, Jefferson remarks, “Our books &amp;c (8.<lb/>\nboxes) are arrived. I have had the covers of the boxes taken off to admit dry air, but we cannot<lb/>\ntake them out for want of the catalogue; because if we do not assort them under their proper<lb/>\nheads of arrangement when first taken out, it would be infinitely difficult afterwards. will you<lb/>\nbe so good as to send me the catalogue by return of mail, for I think they are suffering from<lb/>\ndamp” (“Thomas Jefferson to Francis Walker Gilmer, 20 January 1825,” Founders Online,<lb/>\nNational Archives, https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/98-01-02-4890).<lb/>\nEvidently, no such catalog existed, nor was one forthcoming. This necessitated John Vaughn<lb/>\nKean’s catalog listing this first shipment of books. Kean’s catalog also contains entries for<lb/>\nbooks sent by Bohn’s successor as the University’s bookseller, Cummings &amp; Hilliard of<lb/>\nBoston. Most of these later arrivals are classed in a subsection of Kean’s catalog labeled,<lb/>\n“supplementary catalog”; these later arrivals, and Cumming &amp; Hilliard’s role in supplying<lb/>\nbooks is discussed below.<lb/>\n</p>\n<p>57. A letter dated April 8, 1825, survives that appoints “William Hilliard, Agent for the<lb/>\nsaid University, to procure the said books, and attend to their care, transportation and delivery,<lb/>\nat the said University” (“Thomas Jefferson to William Hilliard, 8 April 1825,” Founders Online,<lb/>\nNational Archives, https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/98-01-02-5121).<lb/>\n</p>\n<p>58. “William Hilliard to Thomas Jefferson, 16 July 1825,” Founders Early Access,<lb/>\nhttps://rotunda.upress.virginia.edu/founders/default.xqy?keys=FOEA-print-04-02-02-4400.<lb/>\nJefferson evidently jotted down several titles from this enclosed catalog, some of which were<lb/>\neventually acquired for the University’s library.
