  "tei": "<pb n=\"134\"/>\n<p>\nWriting to Jefferson from Louisiana on October 18, 1823, Trist says: “I avail myself of <lb/>\nthe first opportunity that offers to return your catalogue, the absence of which will have <lb/>\nproved, I fear, a greater inconvenience than can be compensated by the copy I have <lb/>\nmade.” Jefferson replied on his eighty-first birthday, April&amp;nbsp;13, 1824: “The catalogues, <lb/>\nprinted and ms. were safely received. The last has given you more trouble than I ought <lb/>\nto have subjected you to. It is very precious to me, and I am thankful to you for it.”<hi rend=\"sup\">21</hi><lb/>\nComparing the 1823 and 1815 catalogs reveals that their entries match exactly <lb/>\n(though in a different order), with no additions and only very few apparently ac-<lb/>\ncidental deletions. Accordingly, the Trist catalog could not have been produced <lb/>\nwithout a copy of the 1815 printed catalog on hand. But while Gilreath and Wil-<lb/>\nson interpret the “manuscript” catalog Jefferson cites here to be the manuscript <lb/>\ncopy that Trist made (i.e., the 1823 Trist catalog), we believe that Jefferson instead <lb/>\nrefers to his original 1783 manuscript catalog.<lb/>\nThe manuscript catalog returned by Trist was, Jefferson writes, “precious to <lb/>\nme.” It is unlikely that a manuscript copy of a printed catalog Jefferson owned in <lb/>\ntriplicate would qualify as precious, however significant its arrangement.<hi rend=\"sup\">22</hi> The <lb/>\n1783 catalog, on the other hand, was indeed precious, given its long tenure as <lb/>\nJefferson’s primary reference tool and bibliophilic companion at Monticello; this <lb/>\ncatalog was the only remaining record of a cherished collection of books that <lb/>\nJefferson no longer owned. Equally suggestive, Trist observes to Jefferson in his <lb/>\nletter of October&amp;nbsp;18 that he is returning “your catalogue” and worries apolo-<lb/>\ngetically that its “absence” had inconvenienced his soon-to-be grandfather-in-<lb/>\nlaw.<hi rend=\"sup\">23</hi> The 1783 catalog, a working document for Jefferson’s library at Monticello, <lb/>\nwould have been closely associated in Trist’s mind with Jefferson himself (hence <lb/>\n“your catalogue”), while the absence of a single copy of the 1815 printed catalog <lb/>\n(which reproduced Watterston’s alphabetical method of organization rather than <lb/>\nJefferson’s own) would not have inconvenienced Jefferson.<lb/>\nWe might follow Gilreath’s and Wilson’s line of reasoning and assume that <lb/>\nTrist’s “your catalogue” refers to a copy of the 1815 printed catalog that Jef-<lb/>\nferson annotated or “marked” for the purpose (and which, Gilreath and Wilson <lb/>\nwrite, “is presumed lost”). However, records at the Library of Congress show <lb/>\nthat the 1823 Trist catalog has always been bound with the same copy of the <lb/>\n1815 printed catalog it is bound with today, one completely devoid of annotation. <lb/>\nThe surviving physical evidence in the binding of the unannotated 1815 catalog <lb/>\nwith the 1823 catalog strongly suggests that Trist did not use a “marked” copy <lb/>\nof the 1815 printed catalog, but rather two catalogs: (1) Jefferson’s separately <lb/>\n</p>\n<note place=\"foot\">\n21.&amp;nbsp; Gilreath and Wilson, <hi rend=\"italic\">Thomas Jefferson’s Library</hi>, 6.<lb/>\n</note>\n<note place=\"foot\">\n22.&amp;nbsp; Jefferson’s correspondence reveals that he owned at least three copies of the 1815 <lb/>\nprinted catalog. See his letter to George Watterston on March&amp;nbsp;2, 1816: “I received three copies <lb/>\nof the Catalogue from mr&amp;nbsp;Millegan for which I thank you” (Founders Online, National Archives, <lb/>\nhttps://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/03-09-02-0366). One of these copies was <lb/>\nbound with the blank leaves that would become the 1823 Trist catalog, a second was likely <lb/>\nretained, and a third was sent to Joseph&amp;nbsp;C. Cabell with a letter from Jefferson in which he <lb/>\ncomplains about the 1815 catalog’s alphabetical reorganization (“Thomas Jefferson to Joseph <lb/>\nC.&amp;nbsp;Cabell, 2&amp;nbsp;February&amp;nbsp;1816,” Founders Online, National Archives, https://founders.archives.<lb/>\ngov/documents/Jefferson/03-09-02-0286).<lb/>\n</note>\n<note place=\"foot\">\n23.&amp;nbsp; “Nicholas Philip Trist to Thomas Jefferson, 18&amp;nbsp;October&amp;nbsp;1823,” Founders Online, Na-<lb/>\ntional Archives, https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/98-01-02-3820.<lb/>\n</note>",
