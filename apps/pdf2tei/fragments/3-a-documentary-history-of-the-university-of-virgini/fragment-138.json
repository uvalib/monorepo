It was of no use to him or to the Lib[rar]y &amp; I <lb/>\ntherefore claim it as my property.”<hi rend=\"sup\">14</hi> Its fate remains unknown.<lb/></p>\n<head>After 1815: Gilreath &amp; Wilson Revisited</head>\n<p>The rest, according to Gilreath and Wilson, is history: Watterston’s retaining the <lb/>\n1812 fair copy “has meant that the arrangement of individual books that was so <lb/>\nimportant to Jefferson has been lost.”<hi rend=\"sup\">15</hi> In other words, after the 1815 printed <lb/>\ncatalog imposed an alphabetical arrangement in place of Jefferson’s “chronolog-<lb/>\nical-analytical” system, the 1812 fair copy became the last surviving record of <lb/>\nJefferson’s intended ordering of his books. Taking this as its premise, Gilreath <lb/>\nand Wilson’s <hi rend=\"italic\">Thomas Jefferson’s Library</hi> announced that<lb/></p>\n<p>the restoration of Jefferson’s order has been made possible by the rediscovery of a manu-<lb/>\nscript [in the Rare Books Division of the Library of Congress] that was commissioned <lb/>\nand corrected by Jefferson for the purpose of reconstructing the original catalog order <lb/>\nthat had been obliterated in Watterston’s printed congressional catalog of 1815. For many <lb/>\nyears, [the rediscovered manuscript] was mistakenly labeled as a catalog of the library <lb/>\nat the University of Virginia and may have been intended for its collections. Bound with <lb/>\nthe manuscript catalog, which was clearly not in Jefferson’s hand, was a copy of the 1815 <lb/>\nprinted catalog…. A close comparison of the manuscript and the 1815 printed catalog <lb/>\nmakes clear … that the two contain the same entries, though each is arranged in a dif-<lb/>\nferent order.<hi rend=\"sup\">16</hi><lb/></p>\n<p>Gilreath and Wilson go on to observe that the rediscovered manuscript was cop-<lb/>\nied at Jefferson’s behest by Nicholas P. Trist in 1823, citing an exchange of letters <lb/>\nbetween Trist and Jefferson in evidence of the circumstances of the manuscript’s <lb/>\norigin.<hi rend=\"sup\">17</hi><lb/></p>\n<p>Since the publication of <hi rend=\"italic\">Thomas Jefferson’s Library</hi> in 1989, no one has signifi-<lb/>\ncantly modified or revisited Gilreath and Wilson’s account, and their assessment <lb/>\nof the provenance and production history of the 1823 catalog has remained <lb/></p>\n<p><hi rend=\"sup\">13.</hi> “Thomas Jefferson to George Watterston, 2 March 1816,” Founders Online, National <lb/>\nArchives, https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/03-09-02-0366. In an earlier <lb/>\nletter to Watterston, Jefferson observed that the alphabetical arrangement of libraries was <lb/>\n“very unsatisfactory” (“Thomas Jefferson to George Watterston, 7 May 1815,” Founders Online, <lb/>\nNational Archives, https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/03-08-02-0376).<lb/></p>\n<p><hi rend=\"sup\">14.</hi> Quoted in Sowerby, “Sources and Reference Books,” 216. It is possible that the 1812 <lb/>\nfair copy was kept by Watterston’s family and eventually lost, as it does not appear in any extant <lb/>\nrecords or collections.
