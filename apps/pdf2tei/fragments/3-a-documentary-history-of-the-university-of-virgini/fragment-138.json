It was of no use to him or to the Lib[rar]y &amp; I<lb/>therefore claim it as my property.”<hi rend=\"sup\">14</hi> Its fate remains unknown.</p>\n<head>After 1815:<lb/>Gilreath &amp; Wilson Revisited</head>\n<p>The rest, according to Gilreath and Wilson, is history: Watterston’s retaining the<lb/>1812 fair copy “has meant that the arrangement of individual books that was so<lb/>important to Jefferson has been lost.”<hi rend=\"sup\">15</hi> In other words, after the 1815 printed<lb/>catalog imposed an alphabetical arrangement in place of Jefferson’s “chronolog­<lb/>ical-analytical” system, the 1812 fair copy became the last surviving record of<lb/>Jefferson’s intended ordering of his books. Taking this as its premise, Gilreath<lb/>and Wilson’s <hi rend=\"italic\">Thomas Jefferson’s Library</hi> announced that<lb/>the restoration of Jefferson’s order has been made possible by the rediscovery of a manu­<lb/>script [in the Rare Books Division of the Library of Congress] that was commissioned<lb/>and corrected by Jefferson for the purpose of reconstructing the original catalog order<lb/>that had been obliterated in Watterston’s printed congressional catalog of 1815. For many<lb/>years, [the rediscovered manuscript] was mistakenly labeled as a catalog of the library<lb/>at the University of Virginia and may have been intended for its collections. Bound with<lb/>the manuscript catalog, which was clearly not in Jefferson’s hand, was a copy of the 1815<lb/>printed catalog…. A close comparison of the manuscript and the 1815 printed catalog<lb/>makes clear … that the two contain the same entries, though each is arranged in a dif­<lb/>ferent order.<hi rend=\"sup\">16</hi></p>\n<p>Gilreath and Wilson go on to observe that the rediscovered manuscript was cop­<lb/>ied at Jefferson’s behest by Nicholas P. Trist in 1823, citing an exchange of letters<lb/>between Trist and Jefferson in evidence of the circumstances of the manuscript’s<lb/>origin.<hi rend=\"sup\">17</hi></p>\n<note place=\"foot\"><hi rend=\"sup\">13</hi> “Thomas Jefferson to George Watterston, 2 March 1816,” Founders Online, National Archives, https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson /03-09-02-0366. In an earlier letter to Watterston, Jefferson observed that the alphabetical arrangement of libraries was “very unsatisfactory” (“Thomas Jefferson to George Watterston, 7 May 1815,” Founders Online, National Archives, https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/03-08-02-0376).</note>\n<note place=\"foot\"><hi rend=\"sup\">14</hi> Quoted in Sowerby, “Sources and Reference Books,” 216. It is possible that the 1812 fair copy was kept by Watterston’s family and eventually lost, as it does not appear in any extant records or collections. Watterston’s letter to Robbins is dated 30 February 1830.</note>\n<note place=\"foot\"><hi rend=\"sup\">15</hi> Gilreath and Wilson, <hi rend=\"italic\">Thomas Jefferson’s Library</hi>, 4.</note>\n<note place=\"foot\"><hi rend=\"sup\">16</hi> Gilreath and Wilson, <hi rend=\"italic\">Thomas Jefferson’s Library</hi>, 5.</note>\n<note place=\"foot\"><hi rend=\"sup\">17</hi> Gilreath and Wilson, <hi rend=\"italic\">Thomas Jefferson’s Library</hi>, 6.</note>",
