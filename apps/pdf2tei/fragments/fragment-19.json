(In her<lb/>entertaining and perceptive 1974 autobiography, <hi>With Tongue in Chic</hi>, she<lb/>says, “The Washington years were golden years.”) The flavor of their<lb/>Washington life is suggested by a thank-you note from T. S. Eliot written<lb/>on 22 May 1955, after a luncheon party at the Carters’ Georgetown house<lb/>(quoted from R. M. Smythe auction catalogue 157, 13 November 1996,<lb/>lot 412, with one correction):<lb/><lb/>Dear Ernestine<lb/>I can’t leave Washington without writing to thank you & John for your hospitality<lb/>- for a delicious lunch beautifully served in perfect surroundings and in a company<lb/>at once distinguished and sympathetic. And if you were leaving Washington in the<lb/>autumn for any other destination than London, I should say how sorry I was not to<lb/>able to look forward to a similar occasion next year.<lb/>Yours gratefully<lb/>Tom Eliot<lb/><lb/>The glamorous life implied here (or “glittering,” as Ernestine called it) was<lb/>not an unaccustomed one for the Carters: given the connections Carter<lb/>had made through the international world of collecting and the fact that<lb/>Ernestine had been, before the move to Washington, an influential fash-<lb/>ion journalist with the English Harper’s Bazaar (becoming Women’s Editor<lb/>of The Sunday Times on their return to London, and later Associate Editor),<lb/>their combined circle of celebrity acquaintances was impressive, as was<lb/>their entertaining. I have remarked in the past on the interdependence<lb/>of all parts of a person’s life and on how the scholarly (or bibliographical)<lb/>and the social nourish each other. One illustration of this point that I have<lb/>used is the life of Mary Hyde, and it happens that the Hydes were New<lb/>York friends of Carter. When Carter was setting up a New York office for<lb/>Sotheby’s, Donald Hyde provided space and secretarial help in his law<lb/>firm’s financial-district premises at 61 Broadway. Carter’s writings, no less<lb/>than his bookselling activities, benefited from the knowledge and contacts<lb/>furnished by his full social life.<lb/><lb/>Eighteen months before Carter began at the embassy in Washington,<lb/>he delivered one of the Windsor Lectures at the University of Illinois<lb/>and produced for that occasion a landmark essay, <hi>Some Bibliographical Agenda</hi>—agenda, that is, for the study of nineteenth-century English<lb/>books, which was the subject of this lecture series in October 1951. (The<lb/>essay was published the next year in a volume that included the essays<lb/>by the other two lecturers that year, Gordon N. Ray and Carl J. Weber;<lb/>Carter also selected it for his 1956 collection, <hi>Books and Book-Collectors</hi>.)<lb/>In his essay, Carter set the stage for future work: after summarizing the<lb/>revolutionary changes in book production in the nineteenth century that<lb/>",
