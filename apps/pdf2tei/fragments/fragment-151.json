  "tei": "<pb n=\"151\"/>\n<p>Jefferson’s earlier catalogs—including the 1783 catalog and his “retirement library” catalog (see footnote 48)—arrange their respective schemata in a dendritic, horizontal pattern that forms a series of interlinked and branching lines that terminate in the names of individual subject chapters (fig. 10).<lb/>\nKean’s catalog, by contrast, follows the unique columnar format found on the rediscovered leaf of the 1824 catalog with no apparent deviation. However, the most striking visual resemblance between Kean’s diagram and Jefferson’s 1824 original is the position and appearance of the final subject chapter’s title, “42. Polygraphical.”<lb/>\nThis chapter, which Jefferson devised to contain books that address all or several intellectual “faculties promiscuously,” held books on hybrid or various subjects.<sup>51</sup><lb/>\nBecause of its varied makeup, this final chapter is classed across all three of Jefferson’s Baconian faculties, involving “Reason,” “Memory,” and “Imagination.”<lb/>\nIn both Kean’s copy and on the rediscovered leaf of Jefferson’s 1824 catalog, this chapter stretches across the tables’ five columns, indicating its variety of subjects, languages, and disciplines.<lb/>\nSimilarly, both Kean’s diagram and Jefferson’s 1824 table assign the name “Technics” to chapter 14, a subject classification which Jefferson elsewhere termed “Technical Arts.”<sup>52</sup><lb/>\nWhile Jefferson’s so-called retirement library also assigned the name “Technics” to its eighth subject chapter, the retirement library comprised fewer chapters (33), and never employed the 42-chapter, columnar schema in use at the University of Virginia and represented in Kean’s 1825 catalog and on the rediscovered 1824 leaf.<sup>53</sup><lb/>\nJefferson’s 1824 catalog and its 42-chapter table of subject classifications thus offered Kean a model in preparing his own catalog.<lb/>\nWhether Kean was solely responsible for arranging the university’s first books in these 42 chapters is doubtful, however; it is more likely that Jefferson somehow indicated their place in Kean’s list by marking their respective classifications in the 1824 catalog before sending it to Kean, or by annotating another list that no longer survives.<sup>54</sup><lb/>\nWithout such a guide, the chronological-analytical way in which Jefferson ordered books within the chapters of the 1824 catalog would have been inscrutable to Kean, who (unlike Trist) was unversed in Jefferson’s system.<lb/>\nIt is safe to assume, then, that the catalog “made for” Kean and referenced in Kean’s 22 April letter provided some welcome guidance—much like, for instance, Jefferson’s annota-</p>\n<p>51. Volume 7: Jefferson’s Second Library, 1829, Manuscript/Mixed Material, Library of Congress; leaf 2 recto. https://www.loc.gov/item/mtjbib026579/.<lb/>\n52. In the 1783 catalog and the 1815 printed catalog, this subject appears as “Technical Arts” and is assigned to Chapter 15.<lb/>\n53. A manuscript diagram of the schema used by Jefferson to organize his retirement library survives at the Library of Congress: Volume 7: Jefferson’s Second Library (see note 52). The revised terminology (from “Technical Arts” to “Technics”) is also evidence of the LoC leaf’s late composition, as Jefferson apparently only began to use the term “Technics” in retirement and after the sale of his Monticello library to Congress in 1815.<lb/>\n54. It is probable that Jefferson added entries for books ordered by Gilmer to the 1824 catalog after receiving Gilmer’s invoices or report. While the 1824 catalog mainly listed books that were on order and not yet received, it would in time become a complete record of the University’s library. Presumably, Gilmer had ordered books that Jefferson never owned, and therefore were not listed in the 1823 Trist catalog that formed the basis of the lost 1824 catalog. Kean could have consulted these added entries, arranged in their appointed subject chapters, in determining how to shelve and classify books shipped from Bohn. While some itemized invoices from Bohn, apparently incomplete, survive in the Albert & Shirley Small Special Collections Library (MSS 11902), no full enumeration of Gilmer’s order placed with Bohn survives.</p>",
