He is still fundamentally the<lb/>\nsame person—idle, romantic, inquisitive, skeptical, unwilling to conform. Perhaps<lb/>\nthere is a place in society for him, but this is far from certain. Only the first<lb/>\npart of Amory’s life has been completed. The dash dovetails with the title—<hi>This Side of Paradise</hi>.<lb/>\nThe reader has followed Amory’s journey to the beginnings of<lb/>\nadulthood; what will come next we do not know.</p>\n<p>The 1995 Cambridge text, ending with the dash, was published with the approval of the F. Scott Fitzgerald Literary Trust.<lb/>\nThis text was adopted by Scribner as its standard text and was first reprinted as a paperback by that publisher in 1996.<lb/>\nThe text with the dash has appeared in all Scribner editions from that date to the present.</p>\n<p><hi>The Sun Also Rises</hi></p>\n<p>Ernest Hemingway began work on his first novel in mid-July 1925, shortly after<lb/>\nattending, for the third time, the annual bullfighting fiesta in the Spanish town of<lb/>\nPamplona. He worked steadily on the novel through July and August and finished<lb/>\nan autograph first draft on 21 September 1925. His working title was <hi>Fiesta: A Novel</hi>.<lb/>\nHemingway (who, unlike Fitzgerald, could type) prepared a typescript<lb/>\nfrom his manuscript. This typescript does not survive, but it must have existed.<lb/>\nThe differences between the holograph and the setting-copy typescript, which is<lb/>\nextant, are so great that at least one revised typescript (and possibly more than one)<lb/>\nmust have intervened. Hemingway used a professional typing service for preparation<lb/>\nof the setting copy. He made a very few emendations in his own hand on the<lb/>\nfinished sheets. The typescript, a fair copy bearing the title <hi>The Sun Also Rises</hi>, was<lb/>\nput into the transatlantic mail to Maxwell Perkins at Scribner on 24 April 1926.<lb/>\nThis is the document that served as setting copy for the first edition; it survives<lb/>\ntoday in the Papers of Ernest Hemingway at the Albert and Shirley Small Special<lb/>\nCollections Library, University of Virginia. (The manuscript is preserved in the<lb/>\nErnest Hemingway Collection, John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum.)<lb/>\nThe compositors at the Scribner Press added handwritten galley “takes” to<lb/>\nthe setting copy—markings that indicate where each galley begins and ends—<lb/>\nbut this typescript was not otherwise marked before the type was assembled. All<lb/>\nchanges between the setting copy and the first edition must therefore have taken<lb/>\nplace in proof. Neither galleys nor page proofs, however, are known to survive.</p>\n<p>11.
