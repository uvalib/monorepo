  "tei": "<pb n=\"126\"/>\n<p>It is, however, an enumerative bibliography with minimal descriptions mainly<lb/>\nbased on secondary sources. It covers only the first fifty years of the Declaration,<lb/>\nnot long enough to account for the surge of patriotic publications in the<lb/>\nnineteenth century.17<lb/></p>\n<p>If it had gone on for ten more years it would have brought Allen and Sneff<lb/>\nup to the Bridgham miniature. But even then a brief listing of this kind would<lb/>\nnot show the facsimile’s relevance to their concerns or its relationship to the<lb/>\nother Boston editions. Worthy in other ways, an enumerative bibliography is not<lb/>\nintended to answer questions about form and content. It does not describe physical<lb/>\nobjects with the details that might disclose the influence of one artifact on<lb/>\nanother, the information that might reveal resemblances in production methods,<lb/>\ntextual elements, and stylistic motifs. To make their claims for the Sussex Declaration,<lb/>\nAllen and Sneff looked hard for this kind of information but only looked<lb/>\nin one place and did not consider the commercial context. The manuscript they<lb/>\nfound deserves bibliographical scrutiny, but if I am correct about its sources, it<lb/>\nhas nothing to do with James Wilson and the Constitution. Rather, it should be<lb/>\ndated at least fifty years later, when someone copied Bridgham’s engraving in an<lb/>\nattempt to emulate the engrossed Declaration. If not an entirely successful effort,<lb/>\nit is an interesting byproduct of the trade in patriotic prints and a good example<lb/>\nof a text entangled in transcriptions large and small.<lb/></p>\n<note place=\"foot\">17.
