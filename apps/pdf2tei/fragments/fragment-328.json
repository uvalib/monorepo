Michael Juste was a pseudonym of Michael<lb/>\n  Hurwitz (1897–1961), author, poet, playwright, and, under the name of Michael<lb/>\n  Houghton, founder and proprietor of the Atlantis Bookshop, which still exists<lb/>\n  (as of 2024) near the British Museum. His nephew, the eminent English violinist<lb/>\n  Emanuel Hurwitz, remembered him as “a benevolent white magician.”18<lb/>\n  Michael’s friend, called “David” in the book, is securely identified as Raphael Hurst<lb/>\n  (1898–1981), who would become a best-selling author on spirituality under the<lb/>\n  name of Paul Brunton.19 Brunton’s son, Kenneth Thurston Hurst (1923–2009),<lb/>\n  has confirmed that Brother M was a family friend and his own godfather (witness<lb/>\n  Kenneth’s middle name). But he only knew him as Mr. Thurston, an American<lb/>\n  painter living in London and specializing in lacquer work for upscale department<lb/>\n  stores. No one hitherto had been able to identify him.<lb/>\n</p>\n<p>\n  There are two further books authored simply by M and bearing The Brothers’ emblem.<lb/>\n  The first was <hi>The Dayspring of Youth</hi> (1933), advertised by the publisher as<lb/>\n  “By One of the Brothers.”20 The reviewer in <hi>Psychic Science</hi> speculated<lb/>\n  that M “seems to be identical with Michael Juste, author of <hi>White Brother</hi>.”21<lb/>\n  It was a good guess, but missed the mark.<lb/>\n</p>\n<p>\n  A second book by M, <hi>The Lord God of Truth Within</hi>, was compiled by Hurwitz<lb/>\n  and published in 1941 by the press of the esoteric entrepreneur Manly Palmer<lb/>\n  Hall.22 It is subtitled <hi>A Posthumous Sequel to The Dayspring of Youth</hi>, and includes<lb/>\n  anecdotes about sylphs and gnomes who are M’s personal friends.<lb/>\n</p>\n<p>\n  M mentions <hi>Comte de Gabalis</hi> in both books. In <hi>Dayspring</hi> he prefaces a long<lb/>\n  quotation with the words: “In a book previously mentioned by us, <hi>The Comte<lb/>\n  de Gabalis</hi>, we have written this passage about prayer . . .” (p. 326). In <hi>The Lord<lb/>\n  God of Truth Within</hi>, M writes: “we have spoken about [Merlin] in a former book<lb/>\n  [footnote] <hi>Comte de Gabalis</hi>.” (p. 159) The three books form a coherent, if idiosyncratic,<lb/>\n  body of doctrine.<lb/>\n</p>\n<p>\n  Yet the 1922 edition loudly claimed to be the work of Lotus Dudley. My<lb/>\n  first unpleasant suspicion was that she had appropriated Thurston’s work and<lb/>\n  republished it under her own name(s). He could have been referring to this when<lb/>\n  he wrote, in the Preface to <hi>The Dayspring of Youth</hi>, “as certain people in the past<lb/>\n  have assumed authorship of some of my writings, all publications of the Brothers<lb/>\n  will be issued in future under their seal and copyrighted” (p. 7). But this does<lb/>\n  not accord with what is known of Dudley’s character. The references to <hi>Comte de<lb/>\n  Gabalis</hi> in Thurston’s later books, carefully read, do not claim authorship: they<lb/>\n  merely say that his words have appeared in it.<lb/>\n</p>\n<p>\n  18.
