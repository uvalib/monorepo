  "tei": "<pb n=\"240\"/>\n<p>anonymous compiler of the Huntington volume had to be content with the print.<lb/>\nBut he was also able to obtain a copy of Walpole’s printed “Rules for obtaining<lb/>\na Ticket to see Strawberry Hill” of 1784, and six drawings and six watercolors,<lb/>\nquite possibly all of them by the Hardings, including Charlotte de Tremouille,<lb/>\nCountess of Derby, the defender of Latham Castle in the Civil War, from the<lb/>\npainting in the Tribune, a highly finished portrait in court dress, and Sir Chris-<lb/>\ntopher Wray, Queen Elizabeth’s Lord Chief Justice, and Sir Robert Walpole in<lb/>\nthe robes of the Order of the Bath, from the Great North Bedchamber. The<lb/>\nprints underline the strength of Walpole’s holdings of 16th- and 17th-century<lb/>\nportraits, though there is a real contrast between the quality of the Hardings’<lb/>\nfinished watercolors, which have been commended as painstaking in their detail<lb/>\nand accuracy, and their stipple engravings, which when seen en masse can appear<lb/>\nrepetitive and somewhat mechanical.<lb/>\n</p>\n<p>The six watercolors and six drawings enliven the volume, as does Walpole’s<lb/>\n“Rules for obtaining a Ticket” from the Strawberry Hill Press. But this is Straw-<lb/>\nberry Hill at one remove, the images taken in the very last years of Walpole’s life,<lb/>\nor after his death. There is no involvement whatever by Walpole, and also none<lb/>\nby that central figure in the dissemination of Strawberry Hill Press in the years<lb/>\nafter Walpole’s death, Thomas Kirgate.<lb/>\n</p>\n<head>V</head>\n<p>What our second copy of an extra-illustrated Description shows is what Kirgate<lb/>\ncould offer from his stock to a favored customer. The copy does not provide any<lb/>\nevidence as to its original purchaser, but it was subsequently acquired by Henry<lb/>\nProbasco (1820–1902), a Cincinnati hardware magnate, and was listed in the<lb/>\ncatalogue of his collection that he had printed in 1873—with the result that it is<lb/>\nin turn listed by A. T. Hazen in his Bibliography of the Strawberry Hill Press, where<lb/>\nhe describes it from Probasco’s catalogue entry, and suggests that it may have<lb/>\nbeen the copy which was lot&amp;nbsp;411 on the second day of Kirgate’s sale.<note n=\"14\">Catalogue of the Collection of Books, Manuscripts, and Works of Art, belonging to Mr. Henry Probasco, Cincinnati, Ohio (Privately printed, 1873), 354; A.&amp;nbsp;T. Hazen, Bibliography of the Strawberry Hill Press, 127, item&amp;nbsp;3.</note> This seems<lb/>\nunlikely, as lot&amp;nbsp;411 is simply described as being the 1784 edition with plates, with<lb/>\nno suggestion that it was extra-illustrated over and above the standard plates<lb/>\nwith which it was issued (none of the copies of the Description in Kirgate’s sale<lb/>\nare described as extra-illustrated), and it is more likely that Kirgate sold the copy<lb/>\nbefore his death. Curiously, what both Hazen and Lewis appear not to have real-<lb/>\nized was that in 1889 Probasco, who had suffered financial losses, sold his collec-<lb/>\ntion to the Newberry Library, Chicago, which is where the book remains.<note n=\"15\">Newberry Library Folio Case W&amp;nbsp;3945&amp;nbsp;95.</note> Had<lb/>\nLewis, that most resourceful and imaginative of collectors, become aware that an<lb/>\nuntraced extra-illustrated Description with unknown original drawings was resting<lb/>\nundisturbed in the stacks of the Newberry, the Director would no doubt have<lb/>\nreceived a visit with an irresistible offer to purchase alternative volumes more<lb/>\ncentral to the Newberry’s core collection, in return for Probasco’s copy joining<lb/>\n</p>",
