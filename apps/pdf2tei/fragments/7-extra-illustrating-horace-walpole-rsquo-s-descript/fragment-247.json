  "tei": "<pb n=\"241\"/>\n<p>the wealth of extra-illustrated examples of the Description at Farmington. But<lb/>\nProbasco’s copy has stayed at the Newberry and has never been fully described.<lb/>\nThe book is half-bound in mid nineteenth-century red morocco, with the<lb/>\nNewberry’s label dated 1890 identifying it as part of Probasco’s collection. Many<lb/>\nof the illustrations are annotated by Kirgate, but none of his notes are on the<lb/>\nsheets of the bound volume, which would have been bound up after his death.<lb/>\nThe annotations consist of two notes in ink by Walpole, one recording the price<lb/>\nhe paid for Reynolds’s painting of the Ladies Waldegrave in the Refectory, the<lb/>\nother mentioned below; twenty-two notes in ink on the prints and drawings by<lb/>\nKirgate; two images inscribed by G. P. Harding; pencil numbers by an unidenti-<lb/>\nfied hand, giving the page numbers of the text in which the items illustrated are<lb/>\ndescribed; and a few pencil notes in an unidentified hand, identifying the illus-<lb/>\ntrations, and in one case mentioning the 1842 sale of the collection, so possibly<lb/>\nmade by whoever is responsible for the present binding.</p>\n<p>As for the illustrations, these break down as thirty-four miscellaneous engrav-<lb/>\nings; twenty-five portrait prints in stipple after drawings by Silvester Harding and<lb/>\npublished by the Hardings, nine of which also appear in the Huntington copy;<lb/>\nthree portrait prints by the Hardings but published by others; four watercolors<lb/>\nby George Harding of items at Strawberry Hill, including two drawings of chim-<lb/>\nney pieces at the house; eight drawings unsigned but I believe by the Hardings,<lb/>\nmostly of seals, but including a watercolor of the oaken Gothic bench in the<lb/>\nChapel in the Woods mentioned on page 81 of the Description; five signed colored<lb/>\ndrawings by or prints colored by Kirgate; seven unsigned drawings by Kirgate;<lb/>\nand twelve other drawings.</p>\n<p>The combination of prints, of drawings by Kirgate and the Hardings, and<lb/>\nof Kirgate’s notes on them, make this a volume of real interest: but the excite-<lb/>\nment lies in the last group, the twelve other drawings, as this is where the book<lb/>\nhas most to tell us about the creation of Strawberry Hill, displaying the potential<lb/>\nfor extra-illustrated copies to illuminate their subjects. Some are alternative ver-<lb/>\nsions of known images, such as a watercolor by Edwards of the south front of<lb/>\nthe house that was subsequently engraved in etching and aquatint by Jukes, and<lb/>\na copy colored by Edwards of the etching by Jukes of the Printing House; there<lb/>\nis an unsigned pencil sketch of the Gothic lantern in the hall, similar to the fin-<lb/>\nished watercolor in Bawtree’s copy of the Description; an unsigned wash drawing,<lb/>\nperhaps by Kirgate or one of the Hardings, of the couvre-feu in the library, of<lb/>\nwhich Carter’s drawing is in Bull’s copy; and a finished wash drawing, perhaps<lb/>\nby George Harding, of the urn erected by Walpole to commemorate the actress<lb/>\nKitty Clive, related to the drawing in Walpole’s own copy of the Description.<note n=\"16\">For the two Edwards views see Clarke, The Strawberry Hill Press &amp; its Printing House, plates 28 and 25; for the urn to Mrs. Clive, see the frontispiece to Horace Walpole’s Fugitive Verses, ed. W. S. Lewis (New York and London: Oxford University Press and Humphrey Milford, 1931).</note></p>\n<p>Of the seven other images, two (facing page 32) are drawings of a previously<lb/>\nunrecorded design by Carter of a series of shields each impaled over a trefoil so as<lb/>\nto form an inverted triangle that would have provided a series of inverted triangles<lb/>\nto fill the areas above the Gothic arched arcading over the bookshelves in the Li-<lb/>\nbrary. One of these drawings, with the shield blank, is inscribed by Kirgate “Sketch<lb/>\n…”.</p>",
