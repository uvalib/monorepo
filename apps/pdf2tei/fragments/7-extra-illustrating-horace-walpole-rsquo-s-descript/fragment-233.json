We now see that it had been sold as from Charles Chauncy’s library in <lb/>\n1887, but not to Thompson, and had therefore not passed to Nassau Lees. The <lb/>\n1887 and 1911 catalogue entries both appear to refer to the same manuscript, an <lb/>\nautograph of the Epistle to Burlington with a Chauncy provenance. Smith (‘Alex-<lb/>\nander Pope’, 2 –3 and PoA 76) discusses the likelihood of its identification with <lb/>\nMorgan Library MA 352, in which one leaf of the Epistle to Burlington is followed <lb/>\nby eight leaves of the Epistle to Dr. Arbuthnot. The Morgan fragment was indeed <lb/>\ncollated by Jonathan Richardson<note n=\"19\">See Mack, ed., Last and Greatest Art, 159 n 2.</note>. And, as we shall see below, its readings cor-<lb/>\nrespond to those transcribed by Whitwell Elwin from a manuscript which, when <lb/>\nhe saw it, was in the possession of the Chauncy family.<lb/>\n486 Ethic Epistles I to III, Autograph MS. of Pope, with numerous alterations <lb/>\nand corrections by himself | 4to.<lb/>\n£20 to Thompson. This fair copy — ‘a superb example of [Pope’s] calligraphy’ as <lb/>\nPeter Croft called it — must be what Richardson meant by ‘the several finished <lb/>\ncopies, (of his own neat and elegant writing)’ which he possessed, ‘several’ refer-<lb/>\nring to the different ‘books’ of the Essay on Man identified in the previous clause <lb/>\nin Richardson’s memoir<note n=\"20\">P.&amp;nbsp;J. Croft, Autograph Poetry in the English Language (London: Cassell, 1973), I. 70.</note>.<lb/>\nThe two manuscripts of the Essay on Man in the 1887 sale both passed from <lb/>\nthe Chauncy family via Thompson to Nassau Lees. One of the Nassau Lees cop-<lb/>\nies (484 above) is, as we have just seen, at the Morgan Library; the other, Lot 80 <lb/>\nat the Nassau Lees sale, was catalogued as ‘Ethic Epistles I–III’, and can surely <lb/>\nbe identified both with the present copy and with the manuscript of the Essay on <lb/>\nMan now at Harvard, which bears the same title (Smith, ‘Alexander Pope’, 2 – 4 <lb/>\nand PoA 165). The Harvard manuscript was offered for sale by Dodd, Mead and <lb/>\nCo. of New York in 1910<note n=\"21\">Alexander Pope: Notes Towards a Bibliography of Early Editions of his Writings: A Catalogue of Marshall C. Lefferts’s Great Collection of First and Later Editions of the Works of Alexander Pope, with the Autograph Manuscript of an Essay on Man (New York: Dodd, Mead and Company, [1910]), 49–50; identified with the Harvard manuscript in Smith, ‘Alexander Pope’, 3.</note>.<lb/>\nA manuscript sold as Lot 112 in the Stuart M. Samuel sale in 1907 also bore <lb/>\nthe title ‘Ethic Epistles’. There are two ways to explain this. The first is that two <lb/>\nmanuscripts bore this title: the one now at Harvard, and the one in the Samuel <lb/>\nsale. In that case, there were three manuscripts of the Essay on Man in all: the <lb/>\none now at the Morgan, the one now at Harvard, and a third, now unlocated, <lb/>\nknown only from its appearance in the Samuel sale catalogue. Smith proposes, <lb/>\non several grounds, that this was the case, and if she is right, the chronology of <lb/>\nsales must have been as follows: 1887, the present Harvard MS is sold to Nas-<lb/>\nsau Lees; 1889, the present Harvard MS is sold at Nassau Lees’ sale; 1907, a <lb/>\npreviously unknown MS with the same title appears at Samuel’s sale, is sold to <lb/>\nSabin, and is never seen again; 1910, the present Harvard MS is offered for sale <lb/>\nby Dodd, Mead and Co. An alternative explanation is that there were only two<lb/>",
