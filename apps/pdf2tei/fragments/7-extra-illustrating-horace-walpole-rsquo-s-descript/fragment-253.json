The design consists of a projecting arched and pierced canopy<lb/>over a mirror of quatrefoil shape with pointed projections, and the pierced canopy<lb/>closely relates to the pierced canopy of the chimney piece in the Refectory as<lb/>designed by Bentley. It seems most likely that the drawing, whoever it is by, is of<lb/>an unrealized Bentley design, and I am indebted to Michael Snodin for the sug-<lb/>gestion that it may have been an early design for the mirrors on either side of the<lb/>window in the Refectory. The proportions of the sections of wall on either side of<lb/>the Refectory window are consistent with the area of wall shown in the drawing,<lb/>and the overall size of the mirror as shown in the drawing is broadly similar to<lb/>that of the mirrors actually commissioned for these positions, which are arched<lb/>and with Gothic moldings and a portrait roundel beneath the top of the arch.<note n=\"21\">Snodin, <hi rend=\"italic\">Horace Walpole’s Strawberry Hill</hi>, 36, figure 51.</note>\n<lb/>The Newberry volume shows how a selection of the Hardings’ prints and<lb/>drawings could be supplemented and enhanced from Kirgate’s extensive stock,<lb/>and enriched by drawings of unexecuted designs so as to convert that extra-<lb/>illustrated copy into a living part of the unfolding story of the development of<lb/>Walpole’s house and collection. But that sense of immediacy with the creation of<lb/>the house and its collection is, if anything, only strengthened with the last of our<lb/>three copies of the <hi rend=\"italic\">Description</hi>.\n</p>\n<head>VI</head>\n<p>\n<lb/>The third copy of the <hi rend=\"italic\">Description</hi> differs most immediately from the other two in<lb/>that with the exception of two unsigned drawings, and six small pencil sketches<lb/>probably by Kirgate, it has no illustrations—not even the twenty-eight plates<lb/>that Walpole commissioned for the 1784 edition. It is a proof copy, interleaved,<lb/>and bound in early nineteenth-century half calf. Now in the collection of Charles<lb/>Sebag-Montefiore, it more than makes up for its lack of plates by its wealth of ad-<lb/>ditional material and annotation. It opens with a transcription dated 6 February<lb/>1780 by Kirgate on one folded leaf of the sixth and last of Walpole’s fantastical<lb/><hi rend=\"italic\">Hieroglyphic Tales</hi>, “A True Love Story,” tipped into the front endpapers. Wal-<lb/>pole had written the <hi rend=\"italic\">Tales</hi> by 1772, but they were not printed by Kirgate at the<lb/>Strawberry Hill Press until 1785, and then in only seven copies. This holograph<lb/>therefore pre-dates the first printing and was presumably copied from Walpole’s<lb/>manuscript. A comparison with the text as first printed five years later shows that<lb/>the printed text did not follow Kirgate’s capitalization or repeat one spelling er-<lb/>ror, and it expanded some abbreviations (presumably it would have been taken<lb/>from Walpole’s manuscript), but the differences are not significant.<note n=\"22\">See <hi rend=\"italic\">Hieroglyphic Tales</hi>, Kenneth W.
