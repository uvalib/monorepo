  "tei": "<pb n=\"9\"/>\n<p>A collection of “high spots” may sound the chord of C major, which is indeed a fine <lb/>\nand resounding noise; yet there are other and more subtle harmonies, the pleasantest <lb/>\nof which are those which we evolve for ourselves. These are composed of notes which <lb/>\nanyone can use and many have used, but by our own arrangement of them we can <lb/>\nachieve a sound never heard before. (p. 11)<lb/>\nEarlier, in a visual metaphor, he says that the coherence of such a collec-<lb/>\ntion can reveal a “beautiful pattern” (p. 4). This newly revealed pattern, <lb/>\nlike the “sound never heard before,” makes a “contribution to knowl-<lb/>\nedge” (a phrase used on the first page). Implicit in all the essays that <lb/>\nfollow (“essays in method,” he calls them), and often explicit as well, is a <lb/>\nrecognition that collecting is a form of historical study and that follow-<lb/>\ning new paths increases our understanding of the past. With this kind of <lb/>\ngrounding, New Paths remains one of the most perceptive and inspiring <lb/>\nof introductory guides.<lb/></p>\n<p>Carter followed up on this book in two ways the same year. With <lb/>\nSadleir, he organized an exhibition “arranged to illustrate” New Paths at J. <lb/>\n&amp; E. Bumpus, accompanied by a substantial annotated catalogue; and for <lb/>\nthe Scribner Book Store he put together a catalogue on detective fiction <lb/>\n(largely from his own collection). (In the next few years, he and David A. <lb/>\nRandall, head of Scribner’s Rare Book Department in New York as of <lb/>\nMarch 1935, publicized many more new paths in their catalogues.) His <lb/>\ninterest in publishers’ bindings also led to further contributions to their <lb/>\nhistory in the form of two introductions to Elkin Mathews catalogues <lb/>\n(1932) and two small books, Publishers’ Cloth (1935, in connection with <lb/>\nan exhibition at the New York Public Library) and More Binding Variants <lb/>\n(1938, a supplement to his 1932 book).<lb/></p>\n<p>His editorial work also continued with editions of Housman’s <lb/>\nIntroductory Lecture (1933) and The Collected Poems (1939) and an incomplete <lb/>\nedition of Catullus (two fascicles only, 1934-35). (The Collected Poems was <lb/>\npublished without an editor’s name; but four years later, in the course of <lb/>\nan article in the Times Literary Supplement on 5 and 12 June 1943, Carter <lb/>\nrevealed his editorship publicly.) These efforts, however, did not have the <lb/>\nscholarly merit of the Browne edition. The Housman Collected Poems, to <lb/>\ntake the primary example, could have been a triumph; but it was hastily <lb/>\nproduced and involved faulty editorial judgments. Housman’s will autho-<lb/>\nrized his brother Laurence to destroy some manuscripts and to oversee <lb/>\nthe use of the others; and Laurence in turn asked Carter (who had helped <lb/>\norganize the manuscripts) to produce an edition of the poetry. The result <lb/>\nwas criticized, beginning in the autumn of 1952 (when the book was in <lb/>\nits thirteenth impression), by two American scholars, Tom Burns Haber <lb/>\n(Ohio State) and William White (Wayne State), leading to an acrimonious <lb/>\nfeud that erupted periodically in the pages of the Times Literary Supplement <lb/>\n(and, to a lesser extent, The Book Collector) over the next sixteen years.<lb/></p>",
