Edited by Carter, with a “Preface” (pp. 7–12) and a “Note<lb/>\non the Text” (p. 13). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1969. 54<lb/>\npp. Cloth, dust-jacket. Carter-Sparrow-White (A:1952) 23. Includes an ap-<lb/>\npendix (pp. 47–54), “Shelley, Swinburne and Housman,” condensed from<lb/>\nan article by Carter and John Sparrow in the Times Literary Supplement<lb/>\n(E2:1968, November). Published 11 November 1969. In the “Note on the<lb/>\nText,” Carter points out that Housman’s manuscript has no title other than<lb/>\n“Cambridge inaugural.” The decision to supply a title, he says, was not his.<lb/>\n“But,” he adds, “having deferred to the decision, I discovered in myself a<lb/>\ndisinclination to defer to anyone else’s preference in such presumption;<lb/>\nso, for better or worse, the title here given to the Cambridge inaugural is<lb/>\nmine.” Carter reported two errors in a letter published in the Times Literary<lb/>\nSupplement on 27 November 1969, p. 1362: at 22.19, “preserved” should be<lb/>\n“preserve”; at 23.11, “examples” should be “example”. Carter first pub-<lb/>\nlished the lecture, omitting a short paragraph on Shelley and Swinburne,<lb/>\nin the Times Literary Supplement of 9 May 1968, with an appended “Note”<lb/>\n(E2:1968); and he had the TLS text reprinted “for private circulation” (see<lb/>\nthe preceding entry).
