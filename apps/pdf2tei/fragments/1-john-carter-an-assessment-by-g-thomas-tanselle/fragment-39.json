  "tei": "<pb n=\"33\"/>\n<p>work has often been attributed to John Carter by collectors and library cata<lb/>loguers because his middle name was Waynflete and because he occasionally <lb/>used “John Waynflete” as a pseudonym beginning in 1944 (having used “George <lb/>Waynflete” from 1939 and “Waynflete” from 1940). Neither the content nor the <lb/>stilted style of this sentimental anti-Labour novel suggests Carter’s authorship; <lb/>but the idea has been proposed that it might have been written as a parody. The <lb/>question is fully discussed in the appendix below. Since Carter’s authorship has <lb/>never been proved or disproved (but seems unlikely), I am mentioning the book <lb/>here rather than including it in the handlist.<lb/></p>\n<p>Second, during the time (April 1953 to October 1955) when Carter was the <lb/>personal assistant to Sir Roger Makins, the British ambassador to the United <lb/>States, he wrote some speeches and articles for Makins. A few of them, in the <lb/>form of carbon-copy typescripts (annotated by Carter) and in published form <lb/>(no doubt revised by Makins), are in the Carter collection at Eton. The extent to <lb/>which Makins’s published articles reflect Carter’s ghostwriting is uncertain, and <lb/>I have not included any of them in the handlist.<lb/></p>\n<p>I have collected Carter’s publications for many years, and that process has <lb/>brought numerous items to my attention that I would not otherwise have known <lb/>about. I have also drawn on the collections of Carter material at Eton College, <lb/>King’s College Cambridge, the Cambridge University Library, the Bodleian Li-<lb/>brary, the Library of Congress, the Lilly Library, the Grolier Club, the Harry <lb/>Ransom Center, and the R. R. Bowker Company. There are many people to <lb/>whom I owe a debt of gratitude. I wish first to acknowledge the generosity of A. <lb/>S. G. Edwards, who has repeatedly alerted me to (and even provided copies of ) <lb/>many obscure items over the past forty years. He also read a draft of this essay <lb/>and handlist, as did Nicolas Barker (who made helpful comments) and Michael <lb/>Meredith (whose help included checking some material at Eton that I might not <lb/>have seen on my visit there). In addition, I wish to record my indebtedness to <lb/>the following individuals (many of them now deceased): Richard Bucci, Ernes-<lb/>tine Carter, Sebastian Carter, Meghan Constantinou, P. J. Croft, Arthur Crook, <lb/>Brooke Crutchley, Scott Ellwood, Basie Bales Gitlin, Harrison Hayford, Richard <lb/>Colles Johnson, John Kerr, Marie Korey, Richard Landon, Elizabeth Lynch, <lb/>Charles W.

Todd, David L. Vander Meulen, <lb/>James M. Wells, and David Whitesell. For permission to quote from Carter’s <lb/>unpublished annotations, I am grateful to Michael Meredith, acting on behalf of <lb/>Eton College Library.<lb/></p>\n<head>A.
