But<lb/>\nthe novel has not been read by many people because of its rarity. As of August<lb/>\n2020, WorldCat records only four copies worldwide: at the British Library, the<lb/>\nNational Library of Scotland, Oxford, and Yale (three of which—all but Ox-<lb/>\nford—attribute the authorship to Carter in their catalogues). There are also cop-<lb/>\nies at Trinity College Dublin and Swansea University, and there may of course be<lb/>\nother institutional copies not reported to WorldCat. In addition, I am aware of a<lb/>\nfew individuals who possess a copy. Nevertheless, it is clearly a very scarce book.<lb/>\nBecause I recently acquired a copy (with the assistance of A. S. G. Edwards),<lb/>\nI am now in a position to read it, which I have done. The experience, however,<lb/>\nwas not what I had expected. Carter’s writing is known for its elegance and wit,<lb/>\nand this novel is written with ludicrous formality and is full of banal sentiments.<lb/>\nOne only has to read a few pages to begin wondering: did Carter really write this?<lb/>\nThe name “John Waynflete” is what has caused people to think that he did. But<lb/>\n</p>",
