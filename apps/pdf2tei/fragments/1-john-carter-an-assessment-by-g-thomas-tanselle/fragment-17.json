Mr. Haber, as students of his writings must by now be well<lb/>aware, is afflicted with no such humility. This puts him at an advantage in the pro-<lb/>tracted controversy into which I have been, most reluctantly, drawn. But I am not<lb/>sure that the advantage is shared by the poet and his readers, whom each of us is<lb/>trying in his own way to serve.<lb/></p>\n<p>Haber’s <hi rend=\"italic\">Complete Poems</hi> was withdrawn after several impressions (follow-<lb/>ing the English publisher’s insistence that it was unauthorized), and the<lb/>debate over <hi rend=\"italic\">The Collected Poems</hi> finally ended almost a decade later, when<lb/>White reported (11 January 1968) only three “trifling errors” in the latest<lb/>impression (the correction of which he acknowledged on 1 October 1971).<lb/>But since in the same issue (11 January 1968) Haber pursued his feud<lb/>with Sparrow, Carter could not resist one more sarcastic retort (14 March<lb/>1968). Reacting to Haber’s account of first looking into the manuscripts,<lb/>Carter says, “It is as if stout Cortes had beheld the Pacific for the first<lb/>time (except that Cortes, if Keats is to be believed, was silent).” And in the<lb/>same letter Carter calls White “that indefatigable vigilante of Housman’s<lb/>text.” The condescending tone was inappropriate, for Carter should him-<lb/>self have been such a vigilante, having accepted the task of editing these<lb/>poems. Nevertheless, his 1939 edition gave readers convenient access to<lb/>the body of Housman’s poetry for the first time; and, in its successive revi-<lb/>sions, it remained the standard text for many decades.<lb/></p>\n<p>Aside from his various book publications of the 1930s, Carter made<lb/>important contributions to the book world during these years through his<lb/>journalism and his participation in other activities that promoted com-<lb/>munication among members of that world. His first book-related jour-<lb/>nalism appeared in <hi rend=\"italic\">Publishers’ Weekly</hi>, as a result of his having become<lb/>acquainted with its editor, Frederick G. Melcher, during his first trip to<lb/>New York in 1929. At that time <hi rend=\"italic\">Publishers’ Weekly</hi> was a crucial journal<lb/>for the antiquarian-book world as well as the new-book world through its<lb/>inclusion of a department called “Old and Rare Books,” which provided<lb/>substantial articles and reviews along with columns by Frederick M. Hop-<lb/>kins (“Rare Book Notes”) and Jacob Blanck (“News from the Rare Book<lb/>Shops”). Carter became a regular contributor, producing nearly seventy<lb/>pieces (articles, reviews, letters) from 1930 through 1947, at which time<lb/>the function of the rare-book section was taken over by a new periodical,<lb/><hi rend=\"italic\">Antiquarian Bookman</hi>. (<hi rend=\"italic\">Publishers’ Weekly</hi> did not forget its role in Carter’s<lb/>)</p>",
