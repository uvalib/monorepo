  "tei": "<pb n=\"22\"/>\n<lb/>great essays as “the perfected products of his maturity,” Carter displayed <lb/>the maturity of his own prose:<lb/>in <hi rend=\"italic\">Urne Buriall</hi>, the curious lore, the strange fantasies, the whimsical speculations, <lb/>the extraordinary conceits, the relish for picturesque legend and equally picturesque <lb/>reality, the fascination exerted on the author by bizarre historical and mythical fig-<lb/>ures—all these jewelled elements, like the thousand small pieces of stained glass in <lb/>a great rose window, are harmonised by Browne’s deeply reflective imagination, and <lb/>patterned, with the most polished and elaborate artistry, into paragraph after para-<lb/>graph of baroque magnificence.<lb/>Carter was able to emend Browne’s text with a few further authorial <lb/>corrections, drawn from six additional author-corrected copies that had <lb/>become known since 1932 (bringing the total to twelve), as well as several <lb/>other justifiable emendations.<lb/>Otherwise, however, this edition is less desirable in three ways. First, <lb/>Browne’s marginal references are omitted. Second, Carter reports that <lb/>“a quarter of a century’s reflection has convinced me of the over-severity <lb/>of my earlier reaction” against the modernizing of previous editors, and <lb/>he therefore modernizes spelling and punctuation in a few places—in <lb/>only a very few, fortunately, or so it seems (though one cannot be sure <lb/>without a full collation, since these changes are not listed). Third, the <lb/>short list of “Emendations in the Present Text” records only the emenda-<lb/>tions to his 1932 text (except, that is, for the occasional modernizing of <lb/>accidentals), and thus one does not have a complete list of emendations <lb/>to the first edition, such as the one in his 1932 edition—“which,” he says, <lb/>“was too elaborate to repeat in a reading edition and to which readers <lb/>concerned with such things are referred.” But that earlier edition can be <lb/>consulted only in rare-book rooms. And in any case, the idea of a “read-<lb/>ing edition”—“for the general reader, not for the antiquarian or for the <lb/>specialist”—is suspect. Ordinary readers are often interested in textual <lb/>alterations; and when they are not, the presence of the information does <lb/>not deter them from reading. That Carter continued to be concerned with <lb/>Browne’s text is shown by his “working copies” of the two impressions of <lb/>this edition, in which he marked eleven possible revisions in the first and <lb/>eight corrections in the second.<lb/>Carter’s other publications of the 1950s were mostly useful contin-<lb/>uations of his long-standing enthusiasms: handlists of A. E. Housman, <lb/>Stanley Morison, and William Johnson Cory (plus an edition of Cory), <lb/>showing how valuable the handlist genre can be; and essays on book col-<lb/>lecting, Wise, and publishers’ bindings, some of them in the new journal <lb/><hi rend=\"italic\">The Book Collector</hi>. He also continued to produce reviews steadily and to <lb/>write occasional biographical accounts and obituaries, primarily (but not <lb/>exclusively) of book-world figures.
