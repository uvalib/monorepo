The edition includes 100 copies on special paper, 50 of <lb/>\nwhich were for private distribution. Lists 95 items, based on an exhibition <lb/>\nheld 12-22 April 1961.<lb/>\n“A Footnote,” in A. E. Housman: A Collection of Manuscripts, Letters, Proofs, First <lb/>\nEditions, Etc., Formed by H. B. Collamore of West Hartford, Connecticut, and Pre-<lb/>\nsented to the Lilly Library, Indiana University (Bloomington: Lilly Library, 1961), <lb/>\npp. 33-37. Carter-Sparrow-White (A:1952) 63. Based on an exhibition held <lb/>\n1-30 April, 1961. In the Eton copy, Carter says that this “Footnote” was the <lb/>\nconclusion of his address at the opening of the exhibition (and the rest of the <lb/>\naddress was used in the preface to Selected Prose [B:1961]). He also states that <lb/>\nthe following sentence (on p. 36, lines 18-19) was written by David Randall: <lb/>\n“The Sophocles and Plautus I managed to rescue must be among the few <lb/>\nwhich survive today.” In my copy, in the blank space on p. 37, he adds: “this <lb/>\nwas not said by me, &amp; is not true. They came from some other, or through <lb/>\nsome other, source.”<lb/>\n<head>C:1963</head><lb/>\n“Preface” by Frank Francis, Stanley Morison, and Carter, in Printing and the <lb/>\nMind of Man: Catalogue of a Display of Printing Mechanisms and Printed Materials, <lb/>\nArranged to Illustrate the History of Western Civilization and the Means of the Mul-<lb/>\ntiplication of Literary Texts since the XV Century, Organized in Connexion with the <lb/>\nEleventh International Printing Machinery and Allied Trades Exhibition . . . Assem-<lb/>\nbled at the British Museum and at Earls Court, London, 16-27 July 1963 (London: <lb/>\nF. W. Bridges &amp; Sons and the Association of British Manufacturers of Print-<lb/>\ners’ Machinery, 1963), pp. 7-9. (Cover subtitle: Catalogue of the Exhibitions at <lb/>\nthe British Museum and at Earls Court, London, 16-27 July 1963.) In a letter to <lb/>\nDavid Randall on 18 December 1964 (at the Lilly Library), Carter says that <lb/>\nthe preface “was, as a matter of fact, written by the third of the signatories <lb/>\nto it.” Carter was a member of the Supervisory Committee and would have <lb/>\nbeen involved in various aspects of the preparation of this book, but he was <lb/>\nnot on the Editorial Board—nor on the British Museum Committee, which <lb/>\noversaw the historical exhibition of fine printing that was mounted in the <lb/>\nBritish Museum (whereas the Earls Court exhibition displayed, along with <lb/>\nprinting equipment, books that were monuments of intellectual history). The <lb/>\ncatalogues of both exhibitions are included in this publication but are sepa-<lb/>\nrately paginated. In the preface to the British Museum part, R. A. Wilson <lb/>\nthanks Carter (along with Nicolas Barker and Percy Muir) for special help <lb/>\n“in selecting the books and producing the following catalogue.” Carter’s <lb/>\nCurwen Press edition of Browne (B:1932) is listed as item 177. Because the <lb/>\nBritish Museum exhibition was to run two months longer than the one at <lb/>\nEarls Court, its catalogue was made available separately, with the imprint of <lb/>\nthe British Museum and the title Printing and the Mind of Man: An Exhibition <lb/>\nof Fine Printing in the King’s Library of the British Museum, July-September 1963. <lb/>\n(There was also A Keepsake for Visitors of three pages). For the expanded work <lb/>\n(of which Carter was co-editor) that grew out of the Earls Court exhibition,<lb/>",
