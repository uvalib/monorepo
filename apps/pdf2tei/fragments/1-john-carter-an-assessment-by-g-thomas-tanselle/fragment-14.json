In November 1934, four months after the<lb/>\nEnquiry appeared, Constable (in London) and Scribner’s (in New York)<lb/>\nbrought out a volume of essays (planned by him and Michael Sadleir)<lb/>\nthat he edited, entitled New Paths in Book Collecting. There had of course<lb/>\nbeen a number of books about book collecting during the previous forty<lb/>\nyears, but what made this one distinctive was that it consisted of essays<lb/>\nby different writers, each taking up an appealing direction for collecting.<lb/>\nThe authors were drawn primarily from his and Sadleir’s circle of book-<lb/>\nworld friends, half of them dealers and half collectors: Carter (on “Detec-<lb/>\ntive Fiction”), Sadleir (“Yellow-Backs”), P. H. Muir (“Ignoring the Flag”<lb/>\nand “War Books”), Graham Pollard (“Serial Fiction”), David A. Randall<lb/>\n(“American First Editions, 1900-1933”), Thomas Balston (“English Book<lb/>\nIllustration, 1880-1900”), C. B. Oldman (“Musical First Editions”), and<lb/>\nJohn T. Winterich (“The Expansion of an Author Collection”). When<lb/>\nCarter commented on this book in 1948 (in Taste and Technique in Book-<lb/>\nCollecting), he called it “only one instance of the responsible part taken in<lb/>\nrecent years by professional booksellers, not merely through their practi-<lb/>\ncal influence exerted in the course of business but also by their contribu-<lb/>\ntions to bibliophilic literature and propaganda, in the formulation and<lb/>\nthe exposition of theory, of policy and of practice in the book-collecting<lb/>\nworld” (Cambridge edition, p. 84). Here he was not only observing a de-<lb/>\nvelopment but also describing the path he saw for himself as a bookseller,<lb/>\none he faithfully followed.</p>\n<p>The title of the volume was not meant to suggest that the subjects<lb/>\ndiscussed were entirely new, for some collectors were already focusing<lb/>\non them; but they were new in the sense that they were not traditional,<lb/>\nand the purpose of the book was to call attention to, and encourage,<lb/>\nthe approach to collecting represented by these trends. It was the paths<lb/>\nthat were new, not necessarily the subjects: the book aimed not to “dic-<lb/>\ntate” but “to suggest by means of examples” (p. 7). As Carter remarked<lb/>\nin Taste and Technique, the volume was “one gambit” in the “general<lb/>\npropagandist movement towards diversity of method” (p. 84). Through-<lb/>\nout his career, Carter argued that collectors should think on their own<lb/>\nand not simply repeat what earlier collectors had done. In the intro-<lb/>\nduction to this volume, for example, he says that collectors should have<lb/>\n“enough independence to dislike joining the herd movements which<lb/>\nare always ploughing their way across the book market” (p. 6). The<lb/>\npoint is made several times in the opening pages through metaphor.<lb/>\nFor example:</p>",
