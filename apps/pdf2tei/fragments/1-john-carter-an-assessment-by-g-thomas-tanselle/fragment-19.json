His own efforts—in reviews, notes, catalogue en-<lb/>\ntries, talks, and conversations—took up a lot of his time, but they played <lb/>\na major role, through their ubiquity and style, in educating all kinds of <lb/>\nparticipants in the book world. And they did not prevent his producing <lb/>\nsubstantial scholarly work. In May of 1939, when BN&amp;Q ended and he <lb/>\nmarked his thirty-fourth birthday, he could look back on a decade of im-<lb/>\npressive accomplishment, rarely equaled in bibliographical history.<lb/>\n</p>\n<head>The 1940s</head><lb/>\n<p>Carter’s role in the war effort began in September 1939, when he be-<lb/>\ncame a press censor for the Ministry of Information, serving as informa-<lb/>\ntion secretary to the Minister, Brendan Bracken. His duties there allowed <lb/>\nhim to continue his work at Scribner’s (whose office at 23 Bedford Square <lb/>\nwas around the corner); but four years later, in November 1943, he was <lb/>\nnamed director of the General Division of the Ministry’s New York office, <lb/>\ncalled British Information Services, which necessitated his taking a leave <lb/>\nof absence from Scribner’s. (In his New York position, which involved <lb/>\nbeing supervisor of publications, he wrote in 1945 an anonymous and <lb/>\nwidely circulated pamphlet, Victory in Burma, intended to show, as he says <lb/>\nat the outset, that Britain’s Burma campaigns “have been an integral and <lb/>\na vital part of the over-all Allied strategy in the war against Japan.”) His <lb/>\ngovernment service ended in October 1945; and at the beginning of 1946 <lb/>\nhe was named managing director of Scribner’s London office, with new <lb/>\nresponsibilities added to his previous ones. It is understandable, therefore, <lb/>\nthat the pace of his writing in the 1930s could not be maintained in the <lb/>\n1940s. But he did produce a major book and kept up his journalistic pres-<lb/>\nence, even adding two mass-circulation magazines, The Atlantic Monthly <lb/>\nand The Cornhill Magazine, to his outlets (having written some theater <lb/>\nreviews for The Spectator in 1940).<lb/>\n</p>\n<p>His reviews and reports for Publishers’ Weekly in the late 1930s and <lb/>\nearly 1940s contain many moving references to the war. He begins his <lb/>\ncomment on the first volume of W. W. Greg’s drama bibliography this <lb/>\nway: “This is the week of Hitler’s invasion of Holland, Belgium, Luxem-<lb/>\nbourg and France. It is, therefore, a week in which the words ‘important’ <lb/>\nand ‘a major event’ sound a little odd when applied to a book.” Later in <lb/>\nthe same column, he notes the ending of Bibliographical Notes &amp; Queries and <lb/>\nadds, “Let us hope that it may revive, with other humane activities, when <lb/>\nwe reach that post-war world which now looks so much like a mirage” <lb/>\n(15 June 1940). The title of another piece, “Bomb-Proof Bibliography” <lb/>\n(21 October 1939), is explained at the outset: “When the newspapers <lb/>\nare full of the war, and our sleep is constantly interrupted by air-raid <lb/>\n</p>",
