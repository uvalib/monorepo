  "tei": "<pb n=\"25\"/>\n<p><lb/>The majestic volume that appeared in 1967 was designed by John Dreyfus (with title-page lettering engraved by Reynolds Stone) and printed<lb/>at Cambridge University Press for publication by Cassell. The writing was equal to the design, with substantial commentaries produced by (in ad-<lb/>dition to Carter and Muir) Nicolas Barker, H. A. Feisenberger, Howard Nixon, and S. H. Steinberg. Carter’s hand is evident throughout, though<lb/>he was the sole author of only a few entries. (The entries are unsigned, but Muir indicated the authorship in a set of proofs, now at Cambridge<lb/>University Library.) Carter wrote the commentaries on Maimonides, Shakespeare, Lewis Carroll, and Churchill and was the co-author (with<lb/>Muir) of four others. The Churchill item (his speech of 20 August 1940) is the last of the 424 entries in the book. It is not surprising that Carter<lb/>wrote this entry, given his admiration for Churchill (as shown by his 1941 account of meeting him, mentioned above). In the entry, having cited<lb/>the Gettysburg Address, he says, “Lincoln and Churchill were far more than a century apart in temperament, but they shared a genius for<lb/>language.” He ends his commentary by noting that Churchill had “an eloquence that matched the hour.”</p>\n<p><lb/>The volume can be seen as an elaborate presentation of one of Carter’s “new paths”—not one taken up in New Paths but one that he and Randall<lb/>had promoted at Scribner’s, as reflected in Carter’s 1938 catalogue on Science and Thought in the Nineteenth Century. But new paths can evolve<lb/>into established paths, and Printing and the Mind of Man became a signpost for collectors, with “PMM” being cited in dealers’ descriptions, and<lb/>it thus turned into the kind of list that Carter always advised collectors not to follow. And, like any selection, its choices were subjective,<lb/>reflecting in this case an English-language bias. How comprehensive it is as a record of the writings that in printed form have affected Western<lb/>civilization can be debated. But it remains a readable and well-informed guide to some of the monuments (many of them undebatable) of<lb/>intellectual history.</p>\n<p><lb/>Aside from Printing and the Mind of Man, Carter’s principal publications of the 1960s came at the beginning and end of the decade. First, in<lb/>1961, was a useful edition (with a graceful and informative preface) of Housman’s Selected Prose, which made more widely available some pas-<lb/>sages from Housman’s celebrated prefaces to his Latin editions, as well as some of his other writings on textual criticism. (One may object to the<lb/>way the prefaces were cut and also to two of Carter’s editorial practices: after reporting Housman’s concern for accuracy, he says that “minor vari-<lb/>ations of typographical details [unspecified] have been accommodated to the style in current use at Cambridge”; and he also inserts six com-<lb/>mas without noting precisely where these “temerities” occur.) Then in 1968-70 a series of four “Working Papers” for a revised edition of the<lb/>Enquiry were published as pamphlets in limited editions to be distributed<lb/></p>",
