Carter’s admiration for Sadleir<lb/>is suggested by a letter he wrote to The Times on 20 December 1957 to<lb/>supplement The Times’s obituary of Sadleir: “None of those who moved<lb/>in his orbit . . . was ever made to feel a satellite. But in our corner of the<lb/>sky a star has fallen.” An “avowed disciple” of Sadleir (as he called himself<lb/>in a 1970 article), Carter had been following Sadleir’s lead in investigat-<lb/>ing edition binding; and he had published articles on the subject in 1931<lb/>and 1932 that he was able to incorporate into his 1932 book. In the first<lb/>chapter of that book, he modestly called it “a rather swollen appendix” to<lb/>Sadleir’s book, but it is much more than that in several ways.<lb/>First, the chapter called “Historical,” though it is a condensed ac-<lb/>count of the beginnings and early use of cloth for bindings, draws on his<lb/>own original research in publishers’ catalogues and trade journals. Sec-<lb/>ond, the bulk of the first half is a detailed account of how to go about in-<lb/>vestigating the bindings of nineteenth-century books and determining the<lb/>order of variant bindings. He touches on the use of publishers’ records<lb/>and catalogues, review copies, inscriptions, inserted advertisements, end-<lb/>papers, and edge treatments, among much else, and he deals with such<lb/>topics as special bindings, series variants, and bindings-up of parts, along<lb/>with the description of cloth grains. The first half of the book (“General”),<lb/>which also includes a “specimen investigation,” provides a “method of<lb/>attack” that is then applied in the second half (“Particular”) to numerous<lb/>books by some five dozen authors. This extensive survey of examples,<lb/>based on the examination of an impressive number of copies, is yet an-<lb/>other contribution of the book, making it useful for reference—and in<lb/>the process displaying Carter’s cautious and undogmatic way of reaching<lb/>conclusions.<lb/>The book is addressed to “students and amateurs of book-structure”<lb/>(p. xi), and Carter is concerned throughout to advance bibliographical<lb/>study. He hopes to show “what an immensely important part of bibliog-<lb/>raphy they [binding variants] become when they are taken seriously,” and<lb/>he wants to help “develop a scientific method on general lines for dealing<lb/>with so frequent a phenomenon” (p. 6). He makes clear that “the attitude<lb/>of mind most desirable in a bibliographer is suspicion” (p. 39), and he<lb/>stresses the necessity for examining multiple copies. His more specific<lb/>observations on analyzing bindings form a perfect set of instructions for<lb/>the beginner on how best to approach a nineteenth-century book: they<lb/>have not been superseded, nor have they been stated in more attractive<lb/>prose. Of the several pioneer studies of publishers’ bindings by Carter and<lb/>Sadleir, this one is the most continuingly useful, still valuable as a guide.<lb/>A few months after Binding Variants, another of Carter’s major pub-<lb/>lications came out: his edition of Sir Thomas Browne’s Urne Buriall and<lb/>",
