In an undated letter to Michael Sadleir, <lb/>Carter (referring to this catalogue) said, “I am rather proud of the Ballantynes <lb/>&amp; Mayne Reid &amp; Verne, and you are about the only person, outside the trade <lb/>anyway, who has any idea how hard they are” (quoted from Rota catalogue <lb/>290 [1999], item 41). Cf. C:1967.<lb/></p>\n<head>B:1933-36</head>\n<p>[Double Crown Club menus.] London: Double Crown Club, 1933-36. These <lb/>menus are included here because Carter, as the Club’s secretary from 1933 <lb/>to 1936, would have overseen (or “edited”) the Club’s printed menus, each <lb/>designed by a different person. Carter designed two of them: numbers 38, The <lb/>Printing of Menus (May 1933), and 55, German Book Printing since 1900 (April <lb/>1936). For further comment, see the headnote to the handlist, above.<lb/></p>\n<head>B:1933</head>\n<p>A. E. Housman, Introductory Lecture, Delivered before the Faculties of Arts and Law and <lb/>of Science in University College, London, October 3, 1892. Printed for (edited by) <lb/>Carter and John Sparrow, with an unsigned prefatory note (p. [5]) by Carter. <lb/>Cambridge: Printed at the University Press, 1933. 26 pp. Wrappers. Limited <lb/>to 100 numbered copies, two of them on blue paper. Carter-Sparrow-White <lb/>(A:1952) 1a. Housman wrote to Carter on 9 November 1933 saying that, <lb/>although he “was not a willing party to the original publication [in 1892] . . . <lb/>your flattering proposal, if carried out, will not make matters perceptibly <lb/>worse; so I offer no objection.” On 5 December 1933, he added, “I should <lb/>like to have it stated that the Council of University College, not I, had the <lb/>lecture printed [in 1892]. I consented, because it seemed churlish to refuse.” <lb/>The copy in my collection, which came from Carter’s library, has a pencil <lb/>line in the margin beside the bottom eleven lines of page 21 and the top five <lb/>of page 22 (on the importance of “the hunger and thirst for knowledge” in <lb/>human life), and another one beside the bottom five lines of page 22 and the <lb/>top ten of page 23 (on the value of knowledge), with lines 7-8 underlined <lb/>(“let us insist that the pursuit of knowledge, like the pursuit of righteousness, <lb/>is part of man’s duty to himself”).
