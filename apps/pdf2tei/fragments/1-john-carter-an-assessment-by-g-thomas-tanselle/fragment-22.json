For this period, in other<lb/>words, original condition could refer to any of the forms that might have<lb/>been encountered in a bookseller’s shop.<lb/>His position is indeed reasonable, but when he writes on this subject,<lb/>he is inclined to take one false step: to use, as a support for his point of<lb/>view, the idea that boards or wrappers were “by intention ephemeral” (p.<lb/>178), representing “the chrysalis stage of production” (p. 180). The print-<lb/>er’s or publisher’s assumption that wrappers or boards would be replaced<lb/>does not alter the historical fact that such a stage existed and is therefore<lb/>worthy of attention. Carter does recognize the value of the bibliographi-<lb/>cal evidence (as he always does), but there was no need to introduce, as<lb/>if it were relevant, the presumed expectations of the producers of the<lb/>books. To do so may be a consolation for collectors, but it is a rare lapse<lb/>in logic for Carter.<lb/>As usual, his prose is a delight (even though in the 1970 reprint he<lb/>claimed to detect “a certain stylistic dandyism” in it). The book should be<lb/>read slowly, so that each paragraph (and most of its constituent sentences)<lb/>can be savored. The richness of the texture is created by—to name some<lb/>of its elements—balanced syntax, precise but often surprising diction,<lb/>striking metaphors, a profusion of proper names and italicized titles, a<lb/>judicious sprinkling of foreign words (including untransliterated Greek),<lb/>and an affinity for colons. One cannot help but think that his love of<lb/>seventeenth-century prose, especially Thomas Browne’s, played its part.<lb/>Dipping into the book anywhere is likely to pull up a memorable, and of-<lb/>ten aphoristic, sentence, such as: “whenever expertise becomes an end in<lb/>itself instead of the means to an end, it results in empty virtuosity” (p. 81).<lb/>Or, on the fondness some collectors feel for books of their youth: this at-<lb/>traction “often reflects the unpredictable influence of some miscellaneous<lb/>shelf which the mere accident of propinquity at a receptive period has<lb/>endowed with an unforgotten magic” (p. 72). Or, for a more extended ex-<lb/>ample, dealing with one of Carter’s favorite, and most important, topics:<lb/>And if I return now to individuality of taste and the variety of approach involved<lb/>in breaking new ground—both healthy signs of originality, enterprise and intelli-<lb/>gence—it is for the purpose of emphasising the importance of a sense of balance in<lb/>the general structure. For although I have been, and remain, a proponent of idiosyn-<lb/>crasy, a warm supporter of the unusual approach in book-collecting, I have detected<lb/>in myself and have sometimes suspected among my book-collecting friends a ten-<lb/>dency to a certain esotericism of taste which is analogous to, and is indeed sometimes<lb/>allied with, that conscious virtuosity in technique to which I referred earlier. It is,<lb/>equally with the other, a perfectly legitimate tendency in the sophisticated collector,<lb/>as long as it is clearly recognised as such. But since it is the sophisticated collectors<lb/></p>",
