  "tei": "<pb n=\"101\"/>\n<p>Conceivably the fact that the book was noticed at all shows Carter’s influence<lb/>\n(of the twelve other novels listed on the dust-jacket for The Fall of the Titan, only<lb/>\nfive were given any notice in the TLS). In any case, whether or not Carter had<lb/>\nanything to do with the review, the idea that the novel might be a parody is<lb/>\nworth considering.<lb/>\n</p>\n<p>This idea would seem to be at odds with the dust-jacket recommendation<lb/>\nthat the book should be “put into the hands of thinking young people”—which<lb/>\nimplies that it should be taken at face value. On the other hand, of course, this<lb/>\nblurb could be part of the parody. But if one wished to produce a parody of senti-<lb/>\nmental fiction with an anti-Labour slant, it would take a remarkable commitment<lb/>\nto devote about 90,000 words to the cause. And it is not clear what would be<lb/>\naccomplished. Parodying the literary conventions and moralistic tone of popular<lb/>\nfiction would affect the expression of political views on both sides. It would not,<lb/>\nin other words, be a way of directing the reader’s sympathy to move from one<lb/>\nside to the other—though possibly it could reveal shortcomings in the arguments<lb/>\non both sides. Or it could simply, through exaggeration, show the weaknesses of<lb/>\npopular fiction. But it is not very effective as a parody, since it is tiresome rather<lb/>\nthan amusing. Viewing it as a parody, therefore, does not redeem it from being<lb/>\nan unsatisfactory piece of writing, in contrast with everything known to be from<lb/>\nCarter’s pen.<lb/>\n</p>\n<p>The novel does contain a few elements that would be compatible with Cart-<lb/>\ner’s authorship, the first being its many classical references. Carter’s devotion to<lb/>\nthe classics, nourished at Eton and King’s Cambridge (where he took an honors<lb/>\ndegree in classics), was lifelong and was reflected in his collecting and editing<lb/>\nof Catullus and his admiration for A. E. Housman. Although Catullus is not<lb/>\nmentioned in the novel, there are references to Aristotle, Plutarch, Aristophanes,<lb/>\nTacitus, Cicero, Socrates, and Homer. There is even a conversation about re-<lb/>\nmembering classical texts from one’s college days (p. 132), and a Latin quotation<lb/>\nfrom Augustine is the subject of another conversation (p. 33). Other literary allu-<lb/>\nsions include Byron, Moliere, Lamartine, Clovis Hugues, and Shakespeare (one<lb/>\ncharacter uses the phrase “stale, flat, and unprofitable”). There are few biblio-<lb/>\nphilic touches, but a character introduced on the first page is “a lover of books”<lb/>\n(p. 230), and another character visits a bookshop that had been Dodsley’s in the<lb/>\neighteenth century (pp. 51–52). These references do not, however, furnish strong<lb/>\nenough evidence to outweigh the overall style and tone, for they are not beyond<lb/>\nthe competence of many people with a literary education.<lb/>\n</p>\n<p>If Carter wrote the novel, it is not credible that he wrote it in the years just<lb/>\nprior to its publication. Immediately after he came down from Cambridge in<lb/>\n1927, he was fully occupied with the book world, having been hired at once by<lb/>\nScribner’s London office to supply rare books to the New York shop. And his<lb/>\nletters to the TLS beginning early in 1931 show that he was already immersed<lb/>\nin the study of publishers’ bindings, Sir Thomas Browne, and the Wise-Forman<lb/>\nforgeries—the subjects of his remarkable series of publications in 1932–34 (<lb/>\nBinding Variants in English Publishing and an edition of Browne in 1932 and<lb/>\nAn Enquiry into the Nature of Certain Nineteenth Century Pamphlets in 1934). Also in these years he<lb/>\ncontributed introductions to two Elkin Mathews catalogues, searched for books<lb/>\n</p>",
