We know that Brontë’s publishers had asked her to<lb/>\nrevise chapter one in February, as is documented in her correspondence.130 But,<lb/>\nto date, scholars have assumed that Brontë refused to edit the opening of her<lb/>\nnovel, based on her responses to W. S. Williams and James Taylor of Smith,<lb/>\nElder.131</p>\n<p>The leaves in chapter one do not reflect any apparent change to their inked<lb/>\nnumbering (see table 4) as we have seen in volume 2 in conjunction with changes<lb/>\nin paper stocks. But there is a marked gap where f. 22 should appear that sepa­<lb/>\nrates the wove leaves of chapter one, which concludes on f. 21, from the laid<lb/>\npaper used for chapter two, which begins on f. 23.132 This omission carries with<lb/>\nit no apparent loss of text, as we learn when collating the manuscript with the<lb/>\nfirst edition—a fact that strongly suggests that Brontë removed f. 22 herself as<lb/>\npart of an editorial process.133 Furthermore, f. 21 (the last leaf of chapter one) is<lb/>\nwritten on a recycled leaf whose verso bears the title <hi>Shirley</hi>—another clue that<lb/>\nthe chapter was revised and recopied only at a later stage, as Brontë did not<lb/>\nentirely decide on the title <hi>Shirley</hi> until August 24, 1849—long after she had<lb/>\nfirst sent the manuscript volume 1 to her publisher in February; before that, the<lb/>\nnovel had been tentatively referred to as <hi>Hollow’s Mill</hi>, a title that was ultimately<lb/>\n</p>\n<p>130. Brontë’s correspondence, identified as likely being written on February 20, 1849,<lb/>\nreads as follows: “I sincerely thank you both for the candid expression of your objections—what<lb/>\nyou say with reference to the first chapter shall be duly weighed—At present I feel reluctant to<lb/>\nwithdraw it—because as I formerly said of the Lowood-part of <hi>‘Jane Eyre’</hi>—it is true— The<lb/>\ncurates and their ongoings are merely photographed from the life.” <hi>Letters</hi>, 2:181.</p>\n<p>131. For example, Jacob Korg writes: “Although Smith and Elder asked her to cut the<lb/>\nfirst chapter, a satiric description of the curates at dinner, Charlotte Brontë refused, argu­<lb/>\ning that the scene was authentic.” See “The Problem of Unity in Shirley,” <hi>Nineteenth-Century<lb/>\nFiction</hi> 12, no. 2 (1957): 125–36 (126). doi:10.2307/3044150, accessed August 19, 2020. The<lb/>\ngeneral view is reflected by Rosengarten and Smith, who do not document or consider any<lb/>\nof the bibliographical or codicological evidence presented here, and who write as follows:<lb/>\n“Charlotte would not withdraw the offending chapter, telling James Taylor that she could not<lb/>\n‘<hi rend=\"bold\">sacrifice truth to the fear of blame</hi>’; but she accepted his strictures on ‘the bad taste of the<lb/>\nopening apostrophe—that I had already condemned in my own mind.’” <hi>Shirley</hi>, xix. Further<lb/>\non, Rosengarten and Smith write: “most of the alterations are slight” in volume 1. Their<lb/>\nfootnotes and apparatus make no mention of the manuscript evidence that I discuss. In her<lb/>\narticle, Marin maintains this position: “she did not comply with her publishers’ suggestion<lb/>\nto drop the first chapter because it might have offended religious readers and it might have<lb/>\ndestroyed the aesthetic unity of the composition.” See Marin, “Charlotte Brontë’s Heron<lb/>\nScissors,” 24.</p>\n<p>132. As I mentioned earlier, the BL conservators inserted a replacement leaf as part of the<lb/>\n1976 rebind—but the leaf is not clearly marked as such.</p>\n<p>133. My opinion here is different from that of Smith and Rosengarten, who note: “there<lb/>\nis no f. 22, but this seems to be an error: no matter is omitted at this point.” See <hi>Shirley</hi>, Clar­<lb/>\nendon edition, xxiv. While Smith and Rosengarten see this as a numbering error, it is worth<lb/>\nobserving that Brontë was not prone to making mistakes of this kind. Indeed, there are no other<lb/>\ndetectable numbering errors of this sort in the entire manuscript. Also, when drawing this con­<lb/>\nclusion, Smith and Rosengarten did not take into consideration the difference in paper stocks,<lb/>\nthe differences in leaf numbering made in pencil, or the recycled title page leaf—evidence that<lb/>\nclearly suggests a revision was made.</p>",
