(In her<lb/>\nentertaining and perceptive 1974 autobiography, <hi rend=\"italic\">With Tongue in Chic</hi>, she<lb/>\nsays, “The Washington years were golden years.”) The flavor of their<lb/>\nWashington life is suggested by a thank-you note from T. S. Eliot written<lb/>\non 22 May 1955, after a luncheon party at the Carters’ Georgetown house<lb/>\n(quoted from R. M. Smythe auction catalogue 157, 13 November 1996,<lb/>\nlot 412, with one correction):<lb/>\n</p>\n<p>Dear Ernestine<lb/>\nI can’t leave Washington without writing to thank you &amp; John for your hospitality<lb/>\n- for a delicious lunch beautifully served in perfect surroundings and in a company<lb/>\nat once distinguished and sympathetic. And if you were leaving Washington in the<lb/>\nautumn for any other destination than London, I should say how sorry I was not to<lb/>\nbe able to look forward to a similar occasion next year.<lb/>\nYours gratefully<lb/>\nTom Eliot<lb/>\n</p>\n<p>The glamorous life implied here (or “glittering,” as Ernestine called it) was<lb/>\nnot an unaccustomed one for the Carters: given the connections Carter<lb/>\nhad made through the international world of collecting and the fact that<lb/>\nErnestine had been, before the move to Washington, an influential fash-<lb/>\nion journalist with the English <hi rend=\"italic\">Harper’s Bazaar</hi> (becoming Women’s Editor<lb/>\nof <hi rend=\"italic\">The Sunday Times</hi> on their return to London, and later Associate Editor),<lb/>\ntheir combined circle of celebrity acquaintances was impressive, as was<lb/>\ntheir entertaining. I have remarked in the past on the interdependence<lb/>\nof all parts of a person’s life and on how the scholarly (or bibliographical)<lb/>\nand the social nourish each other. One illustration of this point that I have<lb/>\nused is the life of Mary Hyde, and it happens that the Hydes were New<lb/>\nYork friends of Carter. When Carter was setting up a New York office for<lb/>\nSotheby’s, Donald Hyde provided space and secretarial help in his law<lb/>\nfirm’s financial-district premises at 61 Broadway. Carter’s writings, no less<lb/>\nthan his bookselling activities, benefited from the knowledge and contacts<lb/>\nfurnished by his full social life.<lb/>\n</p>\n<p>Eighteen months before Carter began at the embassy in Washington,<lb/>\nhe delivered one of the Windsor Lectures at the University of Illinois<lb/>\nand produced for that occasion a landmark essay, “Some Bibliographical<lb/>\nAgenda”—agenda, that is, for the study of nineteenth-century English<lb/>\nbooks, which was the subject of this lecture series in October 1951. (The<lb/>\nessay was published the next year in a volume that included the essays<lb/>\nby the other two lecturers that year, Gordon N. Ray and Carl J. Weber;<lb/>\nCarter also selected it for his 1956 collection, <hi rend=\"italic\">Books and Book-Collectors</hi>.)<lb/>\nIn his essay, Carter set the stage for future work: after summarizing the<lb/>\nrevolutionary changes in book production in the nineteenth century that<lb/>\n</p>",
