Chief Baron of<lb/>\nhis Majesty’s Court of Exchequer’. Sir Bernard Burke in the General Armory has<lb/>\nsimilar arms for the Turnor family of Stoke Rochford in Lincolnshire but has five<lb/>\nfers-de-molines for the Turner family of York. Again, Pope and Kent may not<lb/>\nhave been concerned for details; no crest has been supplied for the coat of arms.57<lb/>\nKent has supplied his design with the usual foliage, but the putti are absent.<lb/>\nThis is a memorial to Pope’s parents and to right and left are what I take to be<lb/>\ntorches, signifying Pope’s devotion to his family home and values, flames that he<lb/>\nkeeps alive. The motto, ‘<hi>HEU PIETAS HEU PRISCA FIDES</hi>’, is a quotation<lb/>\nfrom Book VI of the <hi>Aeneid</hi> (line 878) where Anchises laments the early death of<lb/>\nMarcellus, ‘a youth of passing beauty in resplendent arms’. The Loeb translation<lb/>\nis ‘Alas for his goodness! alas for his chivalrous honour’, but in this context it<lb/>\nmight be ‘Alas for faithfulness to natural ties and duty! Alas for old faith!’58<lb/>\nThe engraving unquestionably represents Pope’s commitment to his family, its<lb/>\nvalues, and its religion, even though he and his friends find themselves in a form of<lb/>\ninternal exile. The original context of the quotation gives it a curious doubleness:<lb/>\nthe lament is for Pope’s parents but also, through the allusion to Marcellus, for<lb/>\ntheir love of him. The motto and the grandeur of the engraving counterbalance<lb/>\nthe simple ‘<hi>Et Sibi</hi>’ designed for Pope’s own place on his parents’ monument in<lb/>\nTwickenham church. Ironically, in a poem famous for its condemnation of Ad-<lb/>\ndison, the words had been used as the epigraph for the Spectator paper recording<lb/>\nthe death of Sir Roger de Coverly.59<lb/>\nThe two Horatian satires that follow <hi>To Arbuthnot</hi> have the same illustrations<lb/>\nas in the separate quarto, Satire II.i bringing its picture of Pope’s life to a close<lb/>\nwith the ‘<hi>UNI ÆQVVS VIRTVTI ATQ. EIVS AMICI</hi>’ vignette. The Donne<lb/>\nsatires that follow have simply two closing tailpieces from the <hi>Odyssey</hi>, Proteus<lb/>\nfrom Book IV, here half a boar (lines 617–18), and the familiar siren. The section<lb/>\nEpitaphs that comes between the epistles and satires and the Dunciad, however,<lb/>\nhas an appropriate headpiece from the <hi>Odyssey</hi>, that from Book I (the initial from<lb/>\nBook IV) where Phemius is depicted singing ‘the direful woes Which voyaging<lb/>\nfrom Troy the Victors bore’ and is rebuked by Penelope, ‘ev’ry piercing note<lb/>\ninflicts a wound’ (Twickenham, 9:53, lines I.422–3, 440). It now has on it<lb/>\n‘<hi>DIS MANIBUS</hi>’, short for ‘dis manibus sacrum’, meaning ‘sacred to the ghost gods’<lb/>\nor ‘in memory of’. This is a case of skilful appropriation. Two pages later a tailpiece<lb/>\nof an altar with a bucranium and trident evokes ‘King Nestor’s sacrifice of a heifer<lb/>\nto Pallas Athene’60 and reinforces the sombre mood.<lb/>\nThe Dunciad that begins the fourth and final main section of <hi>Works II</hi> quarto<lb/>\nprovides new illustrations developing the motifs found in the Variorum edition of<lb/>\n57. Sir Bernard Burke has a crest with a lion holding a fer-de-moline, s.n.<lb/>\n58. <hi>Virgil</hi>, trans. H. Rushton Fairclough, rev. G. P. Goold, 2 vols (Cambridge, MA: Harvard<lb/>\nUniversity Press, 1999), 1:594, lines VI.861 and 878. Unfortunately the engraver for the<lb/>\nWorks has misunderstood his instructions: all the copies seen read ‘PLETAS’.<lb/>\n59. The <hi>Spectator</hi>, ed. D. F.
