Aside from providing a brief biography of<lb/>\nConnolly and details on his other works, Baeza mentions that the complete trans-<lb/>\nlation of his most recent novel (<hi>La tumba sin sosiego</hi>) “publicará en breve la <hi>Editorial Sur</hi>”<lb/>\n[will be published soon by Editorial Sur] (95). These two examples point to<lb/>\nOcampo’s meticulous attention to the promotion and marketing of her books.<lb/>\nFor most of these titles, the pre-publication chapters appeared in <hi>Sur</hi> at least<lb/>\none to two months before their release as books by <hi>Editorial Sur</hi>. In this way,<lb/>\nreaders were made aware of forthcoming titles and given a preview of com-<lb/>\ning attractions with the hopes of building anticipation for the entire book. This<lb/>\nmarketing strategy makes sense given that over half of these works were the<lb/>\nfirst authorized translations of foreign works available to readers in Latin America,<lb/>\nwhich also aligned with Ocampo’s overarching mission and, given their unique<lb/>\nstatus in the Spanish-language book industry, made their availability more de-<lb/>\nsirable. That said, there are a few outliers (nine in total) whose teaser chapters<lb/>\nappeared in <hi>Sur</hi> in the same month as their full-length book publication. The<lb/>\nvast majority of titles that fall into this camp of simultaneous publication are<lb/>\nthose by authors whose works appeared in Spanish and, as a result, did not re-<lb/>\nquire translation, namely Conrado Nalé Roxlo, Gabriela Mistral, José Bianco,<lb/>\nJuan Goyanarte, H. A. Murena, and Victoria Ocampo.27 The only exceptions<lb/>\nare Alexandre Arnoux’s <hi>La cifra</hi>, which was published as a book with <hi>Editorial Sur</hi><lb/>\nin November 1955 and then excerpted in the January/February 1956 issue<lb/>\nof <hi>Sur</hi> (238: 87–90), and T. E. Lawrence’s <hi>Siete pilares de la sabiduría</hi>, which was<lb/>\npublished as a book with <hi>Editorial Sur</hi> in September 1944 and then excerpted in<lb/>\nthe October 1944 issue of <hi>Sur</hi> (120: 35–54).
