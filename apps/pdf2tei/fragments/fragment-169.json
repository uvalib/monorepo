  "tei": "<pb n=\"169\"/>\n<p>century the use of this print format declined alongside the advent of new forms<lb/>\nof media, namely radio and television.<sup>9</sup><lb/>\nWith this background of serialized publications in mind, I argue that Ocampo’s literary journal <hi>Sur</hi> in the late 1930s presented a new form that borrowed<lb/>\ncertain aspects of serialized publications with an eye toward marketing. While<lb/>\nthe teaser chapters that Ocampo presented to readers have their roots in earlier<lb/>\nserial publications, her excerpts were slightly different. Unlike serialized publica-<lb/>\ntions that printed an entire work in installments, or fascicles, the teaser chapter<lb/>\nis exactly what its name describes: a single chapter (or, at times, two) that aimed<lb/>\nto excite readers about a forthcoming book and, by proxy, encouraged them to<lb/>\nbuy the book once it was released. In a sense, these teaser chapters throughout<lb/>\nthe pages of <hi>Sur</hi> are a type of predecessor for the sample chapters— or “sneak<lb/>\npeaks” of forthcoming works—that appear at the end of many of today’s popular<lb/>\nnovels.<sup>10</sup> That is to say, these teaser chapters are a hybrid of a serialized install-<lb/>\nment publication and a sample of forthcoming works. Readers can get a taste for<lb/>\ncertain books through a periodical publication (like serial publications), but they<lb/>\nmust purchase the book to read it in its entirety (like sample chapters at the end of<lb/>\ncontemporary novels). As I will show in the following sections, the teaser chapters<lb/>\nthat Ocampo appears to have included strategically in her literary journal from<lb/>\na variety of forthcoming Editorial <hi>Sur</hi> works align with her mission to encourage<lb/>\na broader readership while also boosting sales.<lb/>\n</p>\n<div type=\"section\">\n<head>Sampling Editorial Sur</head>\n<p>Before diving into the teaser chapters in <hi>Sur</hi> I want to reflect briefly on the dif-<lb/>\nferences between marketing and propaganda. Both seek to persuade people, but<lb/>\nwhereas marketing attempts to sell goods or services, propaganda tries to pro-<lb/>\nmote a political cause or point of view. Ocampo certainly was concerned with<lb/>\nthe marketing strategies of <hi>Sur</hi> and Editorial <hi>Sur</hi>. The impetus behind those<lb/>\nprojects was her drive to promote important works of literature. In a footnote to<lb/>\nthe introduction of a special quadruple issue of <hi>Sur</hi> dedicated to English litera-<lb/>\nture she made clear how she had helped to bring this about: “En 1933, antes de<lb/>\nla fiebre editorial argentina, <hi rend=\"bold\">SUR</hi> publicó las primeras traducciones de Aldous<lb/>\nHuxley (<hi>Contrapunto</hi>), D. H. Lawrence (<hi>Canguro</hi>), Virginia Woolf (<hi>Un Cuarto Propio</hi>)<lb/>\n</p>\n<p>Fitzgerald’s <hi>This Side of Paradise</hi> (1920) and <hi>The Beautiful and Damned</hi> (1922) present an-<lb/>\nother kind of serialization, yet this example is that in which the periodical publication in install-<lb/>\nments comes after the publication of the work as a single volume (Chicago <hi>Herald and Examiner</hi> &<lb/>\n<hi>Atlanta Georgian</hi>, 1921; <hi>The Washington Herald</hi>, 1922), which suggests an even greater marketing<lb/>\nstrategy since these second serializations tend to appear after large sales of the single-volume<lb/>\nwork (<hi>West</hi> III).<lb/>\n</p>\n<p>A number of recent publishing manuals encourage authors to include sample chapters<lb/>\nfor their forthcoming or already published books in their back matter, especially if the book is<lb/>\npart of a larger series (<hi>Coker</hi>; <hi>Crayton</hi>; <hi>Lynch</hi>). I should note, however,<lb/>\nthat I have yet to see an example of this publishing phenomenon in Spanish-language books.</p>\n</div>",
