Sometime before<lb/>\n1798 the partnership dissolved, Silvester moving along the street to 127, while<lb/>\nEdward moved to 98 Pall Mall until in 1803 he was appointed librarian to<lb/>\nQueen Charlotte, for whose amusement he grangerized a number of historical<lb/>\nworks.</p>\n\n<p>Silvester Harding had two artist sons; Edward, who died young, and George<lb/>\nPerfect Harding (1779/80–1853). George exhibited as a miniaturist at the Royal<lb/>\nAcademy from 1802 until 1840—in 1839 submitting <hi>The Library at Strawberry<lb/>\nHill, Seat of the Earl of Waldegrave</hi>, current whereabouts unknown. For about<lb/>\nforty years, from 1804, he travelled the country copying portraits, carefully re‐<lb/>\ncording dates and signatures. His watercolors are precise, finished, and compact,<lb/>\nwith sparing use of gold for rules and signatures. His notebooks of these travels<lb/>\nsurvive at the National Portrait Gallery, four bound volumes of his <hi>List of Por‐<lb/>\ntraits, Pictures, in Various Mansions of the United Kingdom</hi>, the fourth volume<lb/>\ncontaining a list of manuscripts and printed books illustrated by him, with a list of<lb/>\npictures in the possession of the Crown. The second volume, a 358-page manu‐<lb/>\nscript to which a table of contents and index are added, records the pictures he<lb/>\ninspected at 141 properties, mostly country houses, but also universities, livery<lb/>\ncompanies, and Inns of Court. At the foot of the title page is the note “Those<lb/>\nthat are mark’d thus X, have been copyed by G. P. Harding.” In that volume as<lb/>\nin the others, most entries are of one page per property, a few extending to four<lb/>\nor even five pages: for Tottenham Park in Wiltshire, for example, the seat of the<lb/>\nMarquis of Ailesbury, Harding listed 101 portraits over five pages, of which six<lb/>\nwere marked with a cross as having been copied by him. But this, and all the<lb/>\nother properties in the volume, is eclipsed by Strawberry Hill. In a list extend‐<lb/>\ning over twenty pages, with headings for the different rooms, Harding lists 433<lb/>\nportraits, of which he notes with his cross that he had copied sixty-four. Where<lb/>\nhe adds commentary to the name of the sitter, he takes or adapts the text from<lb/>\nthe Description. And this wealth of images is in addition to the numerous portraits<lb/>\nthat his father had copied there.<note place=\"foot\">9. NPG MS47. George Perfect Harding was the subject of a display at the National Por‐<lb/>\ntrait Gallery, “The Tudors Reimagined: George Perfect Harding c. 1779–1853” (2015). See<lb/>\nalso W. S. Lewis, <hi>The Forlorn Printer: Being Notes on Horace Walpole’s Alleged Neglect of Thomas Kirgate</hi> (Farmington: Privately printed, 1931), and Stephen Clarke, <hi>The Strawberry Hill Press & its Printing House: An Account and an Iconography</hi> (New Haven: Lewis Walpole Library, Yale University, 2011), 51 and 86–91.</note></p>\n\n<p>The watercolors and prints by the Hardings of portraits and other items from<lb/>\nthe collection at Strawberry Hill run from Silvester Harding’s introduction to the<lb/>\nhouse in the early 1780s to George’s watercolor of the library, noted above, of<lb/>\n1839. Of their published works, twenty-three of the 151 plates in the <hi>Biographical Mirrour</hi> are from portraits at Strawberry Hill, while in 1803 Silvester Harding<lb/>\npublished <hi>A Series of Portraits, to Illustrate the Earl of Orford’s Catalogue, of Royal and</hi><lb/>\n</p>",
