The design consists of a projecting arched and pierced canopy<lb/>\nover a mirror of quatrefoil shape with pointed projections, and the pierced canopy<lb/>\nclosely relates to the pierced canopy of the chimney piece in the Refectory as<lb/>\ndesigned by Bentley. It seems most likely that the drawing, whoever it is by, is of<lb/>\nan unrealized Bentley design, and I am indebted to Michael Snodin for the suggestion that it may have been an early design for the mirrors on either side of the<lb/>\nwindow in the Refectory. The proportions of the sections of wall on either side of<lb/>\nthe Refectory window are consistent with the area of wall shown in the drawing,<lb/>\nand the overall size of the mirror as shown in the drawing is broadly similar to<lb/>\nthat of the mirrors actually commissioned for these positions, which are arched<lb/>\nand with Gothic moldings and a portrait roundel beneath the top of the arch.21</p>\n<p>The Newberry volume shows how a selection of the Hardings’ prints and<lb/>\ndrawings could be supplemented and enhanced from Kirgate’s extensive stock,<lb/>\nand enriched by drawings of unexecuted designs so as to convert that extra-illustrated copy into a living part of the unfolding story of the development of<lb/>\nWalpole’s house and collection. But that sense of immediacy with the creation of<lb/>\nthe house and its collection is, if anything, only strengthened with the last of our<lb/>\nthree copies of the Description.</p>\n<head>VI</head>\n<p>The third copy of the Description differs most immediately from the other two in<lb/>\nthat with the exception of two unsigned drawings, and six small pencil sketches<lb/>\nprobably by Kirgate, it has no illustrations—not even the twenty-eight plates<lb/>\nthat Walpole commissioned for the 1784 edition. It is a proof copy, interleaved,<lb/>\nand bound in early nineteenth-century half calf. Now in the collection of Charles<lb/>\nSebag-Montefiore, it more than makes up for its lack of plates by its wealth of ad-<lb/>\nditional material and annotation. It opens with a transcription dated 6 February<lb/>\n1780 by Kirgate on one folded leaf of the sixth and last of Walpole’s fantastical<lb/>\n<hi>Hieroglyphic Tales</hi>, <hi>“A True Love Story,”</hi> tipped into the front endpapers. Walpole had written the Tales by 1772, but they were not printed by Kirgate at the<lb/>\nStrawberry Hill Press until 1785, and then in only seven copies. This holograph<lb/>\ntherefore pre-dates the first printing and was presumably copied from Walpole’s<lb/>\nmanuscript. A comparison with the text as first printed five years later shows that<lb/>\nthe printed text did not follow Kirgate’s capitalization or repeat one spelling er-<lb/>\nror, and it expanded some abbreviations (presumably it would have been taken<lb/>\nfrom Walpole’s manuscript), but the differences are not significant.22</p>\n<p>Also among the preliminary pages at the front are a drawing pasted down<lb/>\nof Walpole’s coat of arms resting on three of the books he had written, with<lb/>\nStrawberry Hill in the distance; and a pencil drawing of an ossuarium from the<lb/>\nArmoury. There are in addition two separate lists compiled by Kirgate both",
