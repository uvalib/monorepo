Printed by Alco Gravure (Hoboken, N.J.). Unsigned. In the<lb/>\nEton copy, Carter wrote: “The facts and figures came of course from the<lb/>\nInformation Division of BIS; but this booklet was written single-handed during three or four days’ solitary confinement in our apartment in New York.<lb/>\nI also selected the photographs, which I still think first-rate.” For Carter’s<lb/>\naccount of the publication program of British Information Services in New<lb/>\nYork (where he was in charge of publications from November 1943 through<lb/>\nOctober 1945), see his <hi>Publishing—But for Free</hi> (D:1945, November). In<lb/>\nthat article he refers to Victory in Burma as one of the “popular pamphlets”<lb/>\ndealing with the war but does not reveal his authorship of it. Given the huge<lb/>\nnumbers of these pamphlets that were printed, Victory in Burma must have<lb/>\nbeen the most widely circulated of all Carter’s writings, with the possible<lb/>\nexception of his <hi>ABC for Book-Collectors</hi> (A:1952).
