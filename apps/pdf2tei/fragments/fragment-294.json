Whether or not Brontë<lb/>\ndid this is unclear; I have noted the presence of needle marks and holes in the<lb/>\nleft margins of the leaves, but those holes appear in the first and third volumes<lb/>\nof the manuscript, and could have resulted from its nineteenth-century binding,<lb/>\nbefore the leaves were individually mounted and rebound by the British Library.<lb/>\nAt the same time, any leaves bearing partial excisions would have been extremely<lb/>\nfrail and liable to tearing before they were repaired as part of the binding pro-<lb/>\ncess; for this reason, it is quite possible that Brontë lightly bound her volumes<lb/>\nin some fashion.</p>\n      <head>4. Correlation of Paper Stocks and Variant Leaf Numbering</head>\n      <p>As Brontë copied out her novel in ink onto high-grade writing paper from her<lb/>\nsmaller-sized penciled drafts, she first numbered the leaves of the fair copy in<lb/>\npencil before inking over the numbers at a later state of the manuscript’s prepa-<lb/>\nration.86 This underlying numbering in pencil, previously unnoted by scholars<lb/>\nas far as I can tell, may have correlated to how she initially paginated her pen-<lb/>\ncil drafts, which no longer survive.87 By the same token, the absence of these</p>\n      <note place=\"foot\" n=\"86\">Brontë tended to foliate instead of paginate her fair-copy MSS. I used the term<lb/>\n“numbering” to avoid any confusion with respect to this process, as well as to distinguish her<lb/>\nnumbering process from the BM’s own foliation of the manuscript. Brontë did paginate the<lb/>\nverso of one leaf where she added writing intended for publication: BM f. 267 in volume 3,<lb/>\nAdd MS 43479, which she numbered as 834 and 835 in the C state of her numbering system<lb/>\n(outlined in more detail below). Notably, the BM only foliated the leaf on its recto. The only<lb/>\nother instance in which Brontë added content to a verso intended for publication in Shirley can<lb/>\nbe found on BM f. 236 in volume 2, Add MS 43478. This addendum, which was marked by an<lb/>\nasterisk, makes a sarcastic reference to how Currer Bell was “charmed to meet with a complete<lb/>\nexposition” on governesses in the January 1849 issue of The Quarterly—a not-so-veiled riposte<lb/>\nto Elizabeth Rigby’s severe critique of Jane Eyre in the December 1848 issue of The Quarterly.<lb/>\nThis wording was intended to replace a portion of canceled text on BM f. 237, vol. 2; in the<lb/>\nend, Brontë decided to cancel both, likely in light of her publisher’s express wish to exclude the<lb/>\ndefensive preface in response to The Quarterly from the published book.</note>\n      <note place=\"foot\" n=\"87\">Because no working drafts for Shirley survive, this interpretation must remain specu-<lb/>\nlative. Yet extant working drafts for other writings shed some light on her process. Although<lb/>\nBrontë used smaller-sized paper and formats to draft her novels, she foliated just the rectos,<lb/>\nnot the versos, of her late pencil drafts; because both sides of the leaves bore writing, it seems<lb/>\nthat one recto and verso combined essentially worked out to the same approximate length of<lb/>\nwriting appearing on the recto of the larger-sized writing paper. We see this system at work with<lb/>\nBrontë’s last draft for a novel, “Emma” (RTC01 no. 196 in the Robert H. Taylor Collection of<lb/>\nPrinceton University): the leaves measure 11.5 cm wide by 17.8 cm tall—approximately half<lb/>\nthe size of the full letter papers that Brontë used for making her fair copies—and she foliated<lb/>\nher writing by the leaf, not by the page.</note>\n    </body>\n  </text>\n</TEI>",
