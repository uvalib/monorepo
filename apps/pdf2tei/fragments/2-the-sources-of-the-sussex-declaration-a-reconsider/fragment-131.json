A few loose ends may be permissible when plying disparate strands <lb/>of evidence, but these are too many to be believed.\n<p>We do not have to work so hard if we allow the Bridgham miniature to be the <lb/>source of the Sussex Declaration. If we accept that hypothesis, we do not have <lb/>to explain away the damage in the title, the errors in the text, the absence of the <lb/>long s, and the profusion of misspelled names. We do not need a secret code to <lb/>understand the reordering of the signatures. We are not obliged to excuse the <lb/>poor quality of parchment, the marks of neglect, and the amateurish work of the <lb/>copyist if he was engaged in a penmanship exercise rather than a “ceremonial” <lb/>commission. We can even dispense with the provenance research if the manu-<lb/>script came to the West Sussex Record Office by way of a local history collector <lb/>who had only a tangential relationship with the Richmond family. At this point <lb/>we can only guess where the collector obtained it, but we could consider the <lb/>possibility that Bridgham brought copies of the miniature to England and that <lb/>one of them piqued the curiosity of the copyist. After the novelty wore off, the <lb/>parchment was folded up and filed away until it was retrieved by the collector. <lb/>Speculation along those lines may be tempting but is not necessary to vouch for <lb/>the priority of the miniature.</p>\n<p>Allen and Sneff published their findings in a bibliographical journal and then <lb/>used that publication as the premise for their account of the Constitutional Con-<lb/>vention. They are political historians who want to get the dating questions out <lb/>of the way so they can do what they do best, a study of James Wilson’s political <lb/>philosophy. Allen is James Bryant Conant University Professor at Harvard Uni-<lb/>versity, director of the Allen Lab for Democracy Renovation, and author of Our <lb/>Declaration: A Reading of the Declaration of Independence in Defense of Equality (2014). <lb/>Sneff worked at the Declaration Resources Project before completing a doctor-<lb/>ate in American history with an emphasis on material culture and history of the <lb/>book. By no means are they the first to use bibliographical analysis as an avenue <lb/>for research in other fields, but this approach has obstacles and limitations that <lb/>can be overcome only by observing its rules and regulations. Every field has its <lb/>own methodology and this one is no exception: a rigorous routine is needed to <lb/>ensure the orderly analysis of texts produced in quantity.</p>\n<p>Bibliographers have learned the hard way about the dangers of examining <lb/>documents in isolation. High spots deserve extra effort, but it is not enough to <lb/>focus on milestones of history, landmarks in philosophy, breakthroughs in sci-<lb/>ence, and canonical works of literature. The context is important too if only <lb/>as a gauge of value and a basis for comparison. In fact, Allen and Sneff do <lb/>have a bibliographical context for their work. Along with the documentation <lb/>about the Sussex manuscript, the Declaration Resources Project website offers <lb/>a pdf catalogue of Declaration editions and manuscripts listing 747 items from <lb/>1776 through 1826, plus an additional manuscript appended in June 2023. The <lb/>catalogue tracks the dissemination of this text in different formats—books, peri-<lb/>odicals, prints, and broadsides—a commendable attempt to be comprehensive. <lb/>It helps, for example, to explain the patriotic mindset of the printmaker John <lb/>Binns, who featured the text in his newspaper long before he produced the print.</p>",
