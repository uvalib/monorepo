Andrea L. Immel, the<lb/>late William L. Joyce, Elizabeth K. Lynch, Philip S. Palmer, David L. Vander Meulen, Ted<lb/>Widmer, and Michael Winship very kindly provided advice and assistance while I was prepar-<lb/>ing the first drafts of this essay.</note><lb/>\nAfter this preliminary overview, the authors explore the historical context in<lb/>\na second article published in the Georgetown Journal of Law &amp; Public Policy (GJLPP).<lb/>\nHere they narrow down its dates to 1785–1787 and discuss how it figured in<lb/>\nthe deliberations of the Constitutional Convention. They note the possibility<lb/>\nthat it had belonged to Charles Lennox, third duke of Richmond (1735–1806),<lb/>\nwhose family seat was not far from Chichester. Richmond was an advocate of the<lb/>\nAmerican cause, a proponent of parliamentary reform, and a tenacious member<lb/>\nof the opposition sympathetic to the ideals enunciated in the Declaration. Allen<lb/>\nand Sneff make other conjectures in those two articles and expand on them in<lb/>\nstatements to the press. They refer to the manuscript as the Sussex Declaration<lb/>\nand I will too, although I disagree with them about its origins and significance.<note n=\"2\">Danielle Allen and Emily Sneff, “Golden Letters: James Wilson, the Declaration of<lb/>Independence, and the Sussex Declaration,” Georgetown Journal of Law &amp; Public Policy 17 (2019),<lb/>193–230. This issue contains the proceedings of a symposium on the life and career of James<lb/>Wilson.</note><lb/>\nWhile the PBSA article was being prepared for publication, they issued a press<lb/>\nrelease on 20 April 2017 in collaboration with a Communications Officer at Har-<lb/>\nvard University. Within days, articles about the Sussex Declaration appeared in<lb/>\nthe New York Times, the Guardian, and the Washington Post. A CBS television crew<lb/>\nshowed up at the West Sussex Record Office to film the document on site. A<lb/>\nWikipedia article about the “physical history” of the Declaration cites two of the<lb/>\nnewspaper reports as well as the press release, which can still be found online in<lb/>\nDanielle Allen’s Declaration Resources Project website. They elaborate on their<lb/>\nhypotheses in a lecture at the National Archives broadcast by C-SPAN on 6 July<lb/>\n2017 and recapitulated in the online National Archives News with a link to a You-<lb/>\nTube version of the lecture. There and in other media appearances they speculate<lb/>\nthat Thomas Paine may have been an intermediary responsible for bringing the<lb/>\nSussex Declaration to the duke of Richmond. Their claims are less explicit in the<lb/>\nNew York Times article, which only queries the connection with Paine and Rich-<lb/>\nmond. Performing due diligence, however, the reporter consulted outside experts<lb/>\nsuch as a legal historian who observed that even if their attribution to Wilson is<lb/>\nwrong, an early manuscript of the Declaration is still “the discovery of a lifetime.”<note n=\"3\">Kerri Lawrence, “Historians Discuss Their Discovery of ‘Sussex Declaration,’” National<lb/>Archives News (10 July 2017), https://www.archives.gov/news/topics/sussex-declaration (ac-<lb/>cessed 20 March 2023); Jennifer Schuessler, “Discovered: An Unknown Declaration,” New<lb/>York Times (22 April 2017), C1 and C4; Declaration Resources Project, https://declaration.fas.<lb/>harvard.edu (accessed 20 March 2023).</note><lb/>\nAt the end of the PBSA article Allen and Sneff consider an alternative<lb/>\nhypothesis: their document was based on a miniature facsimile Declaration<lb/>\nprinted in Boston in or after 1836 (figure 2). I brought that facsimile to their<lb/>\n</p>",
