It is the definitive record of the original, which suffered so much mis-<lb/>\ntreatment and neglect that it is now barely legible. Printed on parchment in a<lb/>\nlimited edition, the Stone facsimile did not circulate as widely as the Binns and<lb/>\nTyler facsimiles, which were copied, imitated, and adapted well into the 1890s.<lb/>\nEven a restrike on imitation parchment could not compete with prints deco-<lb/>\nrated with allegorical vignettes, patriotic emblems, and portraits of Founding<lb/>\nFathers. As much as one would expect these decorations to defeat the function<lb/>\nof a facsimile, this style did not go out of fashion until the end of the century.<lb/>\nThen, finally, the unadorned Stone facsimile came into its own and became the<lb/>\nstandard visualization of the document, the source of reproductions published<lb/>\nby the government, expounded in textbooks, sold as souvenirs, and printed on<lb/>\nIndependence Day in the New&amp;nbsp;York&amp;nbsp;Times.<hi rend=\"sup\">6</hi></p>\n\n<p>Facsimile signatures derived either from Binns or Tyler appear in more than<lb/>\nninety prints during the nineteenth century. The chain of transmission can be<lb/>\ncomplicated, a multistage process with some prints acting as intermediaries, oth-<lb/>\ners deriving the signatures from reproductions in illustrated books. Nonetheless,<lb/>\nthey all belong to those two families. With one exception, publishers paid no<lb/>\nattention to the Stone signatures until just before the Centennial. At least eighty<lb/>\nprints have an ornamental border of state seals directly or indirectly based on<lb/>\nBinns’s “cordon of honor,” a versatile design motif easily adapted to include<lb/>\nadditional pictorial matter. No less popular, Tyler’s “emphatical” rendition of<lb/>\nthe text inspired at least twenty-seven imitations in letterpress, intaglio, and<lb/>\nlithography. The New&amp;nbsp;York map and print publisher Horace Thayer incorpo-<lb/>\nrated Tyler’s lettering in lithographs ca.&amp;nbsp;1859–1863, large allegorical composi-<lb/>\ntions including state seals, the American eagle, and a miniature reproduction<lb/>\nof John Trumbull’s painting <hi rend=\"italic\">The Declaration of Independence</hi>. W.&amp;nbsp;Duke Sons&amp;nbsp;&amp;&amp;nbsp;Co.</p>\n\n<note n=\"6\" place=\"foot\">Printed in or after 1833, the restrike was issued as a folding plate in Peter Force’s<lb/>\n<hi rend=\"italic\">American&amp;nbsp;Archives</hi>, 5th&amp;nbsp;ser., vol.&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;(1848). Force approved a payment to Stone for this printing job in<lb/>\n1839. Most surviving copies are on folded imitation parchment, although some are unfolded,<lb/>\npossibly because Stone or Force sold them separately. The American Antiquarian Society has a<lb/>\ncopy on paper watermarked J&amp;nbsp;WHATMAN&amp;nbsp;TURKEY&amp;nbsp;MILL&amp;nbsp;1850. The Department of State<lb/>\nhad a stock of restrikes on hand in 1893, one of which is at the Massachusetts Historical Society.<lb/>\nElectrotype reprints could have been made during the nineteenth century—but probably not<lb/>\nuntil 1894 or 1895, when the United&amp;nbsp;States Coast and Geodetic Survey produced electrotype<lb/>\nplates for that purpose.

Full-size reproductions were<lb/>\npriced at thirty cents and forty-five cents in the <hi rend=\"italic\">Catalog of U.S. Government Publications</hi> during<lb/>\nthe 1950s. At the other end of the scale, a copy of the original limited edition Stone facsimile<lb/>\nrecently sold for $4,420,000 (Freeman’s, Philadelphia, 1 July 2021, lot 1), a record-breaking<lb/>\nprice due to the provenance of that copy, formerly owned by the Signer Charles Carroll.</note>",
