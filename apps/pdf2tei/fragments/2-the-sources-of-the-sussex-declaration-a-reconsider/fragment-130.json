The Binns signatures, however, mystified<lb/>\n<lb/>the lithographer who misspelled fourteen of the fifty-six names, mainly those that<lb/>\n<lb/>were hard to read. The New York lithographer committed mistakes not unlike<lb/>\n<lb/>those of the Sussex copyist: WITHERSPOART for Witherspoon, HOYG for<lb/>\n<lb/>Floyd, PINN for Penn, and M KEAN for M: Kean. Both had to contend with<lb/>\n<lb/>facsimile signatures, but even an immigrant poorly schooled in English was able<lb/>\n<lb/>to construe common names such as Harrison and Stockton.<hi rend=\"sup\">16</hi><lb/>\n<lb/>The copyist’s mistakes are easier to explain if they can be imputed to the il-<lb/>\n<lb/>legibility of his source and his failure to find a remedy. Some delegates scrawled<lb/>\n<lb/>their signatures in such a way as to make them difficult to read even in a full-size<lb/>\n<lb/>facsimile. Bridgham’s miniature exacerbated the problem. Published sixty years<lb/>\n<lb/>after the fact, it was conceived as a novelty and was never intended to be an<lb/>\n<lb/>authoritative text, but it circulated widely and could easily come into the hands<lb/>\n<lb/>of someone whose notions of the American Revolution were more sentimental<lb/>\n<lb/>than scholarly. The copyist transcribed it by rote and relied on his imagination<lb/>\n<lb/>to interpret the parts he did not understand. He was unwilling or unable to find<lb/>\n<lb/>a better source for this display of penmanship and did not worry overmuch about<lb/>\n<lb/>the accuracy of his work.<lb/>\n<head>Complications.</head><lb/>\n<lb/>A line of reasoning should follow the shortest distance<lb/>\n<lb/>between two points. That common-sense rule is a deciding factor for testing<lb/>\n<lb/>hypotheses in bibliographical investigations—or any field of intellectual inquiry.<lb/>\n<lb/>The complications in Allen and Sneff’s arguments undercut their claims for the<lb/>\n<lb/>priority of the Sussex Declaration. If it came first and served as a source for<lb/>\n<lb/>the Bridgham facsimile, we would have to believe that the Bostonians copied the<lb/>\n<lb/>same order of names while consulting another source to render them in facsimile.<lb/>\n<lb/>We would have to believe that they took the oversize words in that manuscript<lb/>\n<lb/>as cues to execute the same words in ornamental penmanship even though they<lb/>\n<lb/>had the Boston Bewick edition easily at hand and could use that as a model for<lb/>\n<lb/>the “emphatical words.” We would have to accept the hypothesis that the Sussex<lb/>\n<lb/>Declaration or a derivative manuscript influenced Tyler’s choice of “emphatical<lb/>\n<lb/>words” sometime around 1818 and then resurfaced eighteen years later to guide<lb/>\n<lb/>the work of the Bostonians. If we follow that line of reasoning, we would have to<lb/>\n<lb/>imagine that James Wilson was willing to overlook the atrocious spelling of the<lb/>\n<lb/>names even though he depended on them to affirm his position during the de-<lb/>\n<lb/>bates on the Constitution and could have corrected them on the basis of personal<lb/>\n<lb/>16.
