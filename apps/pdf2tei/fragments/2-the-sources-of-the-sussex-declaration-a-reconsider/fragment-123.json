Conceivably Bolton<lb/>\nwrote the text for Bridgham, but he does not appear in Boston city directories<lb/>\nuntil 1838, and I have not found other examples of his calligraphic writing that<lb/>\nmight confirm this supposition. By trade, however, he was an engraver, perhaps<lb/>\na specialist in script. He arrived in Boston in 1831 age twenty after emigrating<lb/>\nfrom Halifax, Nova Scotia, and started to make his living from engraving in 1836,<lb/>\nwhen Bridgham’s print was published. Whatever his connection with Bridgham<lb/>\nand the Franklin firm, both prints were successful, and both were reworked for<lb/>\nreprint editions. The latter reappeared with additional illustrations and furnished<lb/>\nDeclaration lettering reduced to Bridgham dimensions in maps with patriotic<lb/>\nmotifs published by the New York print dealers who had reprinted the Boston<lb/>\nBewick facsimile.<hi rend=\"sup\">12</hi></p>\n<p>Broadening his horizons, Bridgham may have brought copies of the miniature to<lb/>\nEngland. My sole evidence for this conjecture is a passenger list of the <hi rend=\"italic\">Great<lb/>\nWestern</hi> steamship arriving in New York from Bristol in August 1838. His<lb/>\nname is on the list along with merchants, men of the cloth, New York notables,<lb/>\nwives, children, and servants. What business he might have had in England is<lb/>\nimpossible to ascertain, but he managed to travel in style on a recently launched<lb/>\nAtlantic liner renowned for its size and speed. Perhaps his trip had something<lb/>\nto do with a change in career during the late 1830s when he dropped out of the<lb/>\nBoston directories. While exploring opportunities abroad, he could use his miniature<lb/>\nas a means of self-promotion, a calling card that could be carried about in<lb/>\nquantity and presented as an example of American achievements in the graphic<lb/>\narts. With that in mind, Binns had already sent copies of his print to friends and<lb/>\ncustomers in England, where it made “a highly favorable impression.”<hi rend=\"sup\">13</hi></p>\n<head>IV</head>\n<p>Someone was sufficiently impressed by the Bridgham print to try to copy it on<lb/>\nparchment. I will call that person a copyist rather than a clerk, for I doubt that a<lb/>\nprofessional could have been responsible for the layout and script of the Sussex<lb/>\nDeclaration. I have already mentioned the amateurish mistakes the copyist made<lb/>\nin the transcription of the title.
