It covers only the first fifty years of the Declara-<lb/>\ntion, not long enough to account for the surge of patriotic publications in the<lb/>\nnineteenth century.<hi rend=\"sup\">17</hi><lb/>\n</p>\n<p>\nIf it had gone on for ten more years it would have brought Allen and Sneff<lb/>\nup to the Bridgham miniature. But even then a brief listing of this kind would<lb/>\nnot show the facsimile’s relevance to their concerns or its relationship to the<lb/>\nother Boston editions. Worthy in other ways, an enumerative bibliography is not<lb/>\nintended to answer questions about form and content. It does not describe physi-<lb/>\ncal objects with the details that might disclose the influence of one artifact on<lb/>\nanother, the information that might reveal resemblances in production methods,<lb/>\ntextual elements, and stylistic motifs. To make their claims for the Sussex Decla-<lb/>\nration, Allen and Sneff looked hard for this kind of information but only looked<lb/>\nin one place and did not consider the commercial context. The manuscript they<lb/>\nfound deserves bibliographical scrutiny, but if I am correct about its sources, it<lb/>\nhas nothing to do with James Wilson and the Constitution. Rather, it should be<lb/>\ndated at least fifty years later, when someone copied Bridgham’s engraving in an<lb/>\nattempt to emulate the engrossed Declaration. If not an entirely successful effort,<lb/>\nit is an interesting byproduct of the trade in patriotic prints and a good example<lb/>\nof a text entangled in transcriptions large and small.<lb/>\n</p>\n<p>\n17. Many of the catalogue entries are derived from Stephen M. Matyas, Jr.’s<lb/>\nDeclaration of<lb/>\nIndependence: A Checklist of Books, Pamphlets, and Periodicals Printing the U.S. Declaration of Indepen-<lb/>\ndence, 1776–1825 (2009). The Matyas checklist has transcriptions of titles, collation statements,<lb/>\ncontents notes, and locations of copies examined but does not include prints and broadsides.<lb/>\nA pdf version can be downloaded at http://usdeclarationofindependence.com (accessed 20<lb/>\nMarch 2023).<lb/>\n</p>",
