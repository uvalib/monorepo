  "tei": "<pb n=\"326\"/>\n<p>/ W. H. Broome, 15 Holborn, E. C. / Copyright, The Brothers, 1914.” On the title<lb/>\npage: “Published by The Brothers,” and on the obverse: “Copyright 1914,<lb/>\n/ By The Brothers. / [symbol] / the news printing company / paterson<lb/>\nn.j.” Harry B. Haines (1882-1972) was editor and publisher of the Morning/<lb/>\nEvening News of Paterson, New Jersey. Evidently this edition was another private<lb/>\ncommission, executed by Haines’s printer.</p>\n<p>The third edition (New York, 1922) contains a real surprise. It was issued by<lb/>\na commercial house, the well-known Masonic publisher Macoy. The dust jacket<lb/>\ncarries advertisements for books by Theosophical authors (William Q. Judge,<lb/>\nAnna Kingsford, Mabel Collins, Franz Hartmann), and the spine shows the Ma-<lb/>\nsonic square and compass in place of The Brothers’ emblem, which now occurs<lb/>\nonly on the copyright page. The quality of production is hardly inferior to the<lb/>\npreceding editions, except that the photographs and half-tone illustrations are in<lb/>\ngray, not sepia, and without tissue guards. The text has again been reset and the<lb/>\nfootnotes numbered, rather than identified by symbols. The portrait by “R” is no<lb/>\nlonger said to be owned by The Brothers. The surprise is that the translation is<lb/>\nnow described as “Rendered out of French into English with a Commentary by<lb/>\nLotus Dudley,” and “Copyright 1914, 1922 Sarah Emery Dudley.” Lotus Dudley<lb/>\nalso signs a new Foreword, inserted on a formerly blank page. All this is con-<lb/>\nfirmed in the U.S. Catalogue of Copyright Entries.5</p>\n<p>Lotus and Sarah Dudley were in fact the same person, and quite conspicu-<lb/>\nlar in certain circles. Sarah Lotta Emery Dudley (1878-1954) was a daughter of<lb/>\nGeorge Daniel Emery (1833-1909), a wealthy industrialist in Buffalo, New York.6<lb/>\nShe was educated at the Cambridge School for Girls and at Bryn Mawr College.7<lb/>\nIn 1904 she married Charles Tarbell Dudley, a Harvard graduate and mining<lb/>\nengineer. They settled in San Francisco and had two children, but their marriage<lb/>\nwas short-lived, for in 1908 Charles died of tuberculosis.8 According to the Bryn<lb/>\nMawr alumnae newsletter, Sarah went to England the following year, 1909.9</p>\n<p>The same newsletter announces in June 1914 that “Lotta Emery Dudley<lb/>\n(Mrs. Charles Tarbell Dudley), has been spending several months in America.<lb/>\nShe came over to supervise the publication of her book [my italics].”10 This ex-<lb/>\nplains how the second edition of Comte de Gabalis appeared from its American</p>\n<p>5. Catalogue of Copyright Entries, New Series, 1922, entry no. 8317 for Comte de Gabalis is<lb/>\ndated May 3, 1922, under the number A 674197 and the name of “Sarah Emery Dudley, c/o<lb/>\nMacoy Publishing & Masonic Supply Co.” It adds “Copyright is claimed on the foreword, by<lb/>\nLotus Dudley.”</p>\n<p>6. The career of George Emery, known as the “Mahogany King,” is documented in<lb/>\nSamuel A. Eliot, Biographical History of Massachusetts, vol. 4 (Boston: Massachusetts Biographical<lb/>\nSociety, 1913), 114-17.</p>\n<p>7. Information from ancestry.com.</p>\n<p>8.
