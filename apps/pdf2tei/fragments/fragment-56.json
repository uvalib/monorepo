Carter identified the dedication as his composition in “Clough to Churchill” (D:1941, August). It reads, “Dedicated to / The Right Honourable / MR. WINSTON CHURCHILL / Prime Minister of Great Britain / the embodiment and the inspiration / of the indomitable spirit / of the common people / to which this book / pays tribute”. Carter may also have contributed to the captions; for example, one of them states, “Since Waterloo, of course, the playing-fields of Eton have been a legitimate military objective.” A further account of the book </p>\n</div>",
