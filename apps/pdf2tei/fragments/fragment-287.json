  "tei": "<pb n=\"287\"/>\n<p>the manuscript of Shirley has been bound and rebound, its paper stocks can offer<lb/>\nsubstantial information about its production and Brontë’s own writing practice.<lb/>\nCharlotte Brontë used four different varieties of high-grade stationery to<lb/>\ncopy out her manuscript. As described in more detail below, the writing paper<lb/>\nshe used was sold in quires or partial quires of nested bifolia. Each bifolium<lb/>\nconsisted of two leaves or four pages. Although the leaves in the manuscript<lb/>\nare not uniform in height, at 18.3 cm wide they are now all uniform in width,<lb/>\nsuggesting that the manuscript was trimmed for the purposes of binding. These<lb/>\nbifolia would have measured 38 cm wide or thereabouts when opened, but the<lb/>\nsize would have slightly varied among manufacturers. The four paper stocks<lb/>\nincluded in the manuscript are:<lb/>\n(1) London Superfine, a high-quality wove paper measuring 23.2 cm tall, with a<lb/>\nblind-embossed stationer’s crest often appearing, when visible, in the upper<lb/>\nleft-hand corners of the rectos of both leaves of the bifolium (though often<lb/>\nmuch fainter, if present, on the second leaf ) and containing the (embossed)<lb/>\nlettering “LONDON | SUPERFINE” inside a circle; the crest features an<lb/>\nembossed crown in its center;<lb/>\n(2) Cream Laid, another high-quality paper of approximately the same height<lb/>\nas London Superfine, and exhibiting chain lines and wirelines that appear<lb/>\nto be real, as opposed to being made with a dandy roll; here, when visible,<lb/>\nthe embossed stationer’s crest features the words “CREAM | LAID” within<lb/>\nan oblong octagon, positioned as described above;<lb/>\n(3) Royal Superfine, a smooth-surface (possibly glazed) laid paper that is notice­ably shorter, measuring 22.65 cm; when visible, the stationer’s crest contains<lb/>\nthe words “ROYAL | SUPERFINE”, again inside a circle, featuring an<lb/>\nembossed crown in its center, positioned as described above; and<lb/>\n(4) A laid paper, likely made by the Whatman firm, with a crown, shield, and<lb/>\nposthorn with a pendant cursive “W” watermark; its watermark is posi­tioned as when appearing in a quarto format (i.e., across the fold and run­ning parallel to the top and bottom edges of the bifolium);59 a very small,<lb/>\nround watermark crest frequently appears in the position where stationers’<lb/>\ncrests usually are embossed (i.e., the upper left-hand corner of the recto of<lb/>\nthe closed bifolium— or the crown side of the sheet), though not on second<lb/>\nleaf of the bifolium (i.e., the “W” side); this paper measures 22.6 cm in<lb/>\nheight.<lb/>\nThe average dimension of a leaf from the manuscript in its present state is about<lb/>\n18 cm wide by 23 cm tall— or about 7 by 9 inches. Using a dip pen, Brontë<lb/>\ncopied out her novels onto the rectos of these leaves when creating her fair copy<lb/>\nmanuscripts.<lb/>\nPrior to making her fair copies, Brontë’s drafting process was quite different.<lb/>\nShe tended to use both sides of the leaf while initially composing her writing—<lb/>\nsometimes drafting her manuscripts on smaller (and likely less expensive) pa­pers and writing in pencil, as we can see in the portions of the manuscript for<lb/>\n</p>\n<note place=\"foot\">59.
