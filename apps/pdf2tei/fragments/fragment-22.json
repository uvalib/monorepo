  "tei": "<pb n=\"22\"/>\n<p>great essays as “the perfected products of his maturity,” Carter displayed<lb/>\nthe maturity of his own prose:<lb/>\nin <hi>Urne Buriall</hi>, the curious lore, the strange fantasies, the whimsical speculations,<lb/>\nthe extraordinary conceits, the relish for picturesque legend and equally picturesque<lb/>\nreality, the fascination exerted on the author by bizarre historical and mythical fig-<lb/>\nures—all these jewelled elements, like the thousand small pieces of stained glass in<lb/>\na great rose window, are harmonised by Browne’s deeply reflective imagination, and<lb/>\npatterned, with the most polished and elaborate artistry, into paragraph after para-<lb/>\ngraph of baroque magnificence.</p>\n<p>Carter was able to emend Browne’s text with a few further authorial<lb/>\ncorrections, drawn from six additional author-corrected copies that had<lb/>\nbecome known since 1932 (bringing the total to twelve), as well as several<lb/>\nother justifiable emendations.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, however, this edition is less desirable in three ways. First,<lb/>\nBrowne’s marginal references are omitted. Second, Carter reports that<lb/>\n“a quarter of a century’s reflection has convinced me of the over-severity<lb/>\nof my earlier reaction” against the modernizing of previous editors, and<lb/>\nhe therefore modernizes spelling and punctuation in a few places—in<lb/>\nonly a very few, fortunately, or so it seems (though one cannot be sure<lb/>\nwithout a full collation, since these changes are not listed). Third, the<lb/>\nshort list of “Emendations in the Present Text” records only the emendations to his 1932 text (except, that is, for the occasional modernizing of<lb/>\naccidentals), and thus one does not have a complete list of emendations<lb/>\nto the first edition, such as the one in his 1932 edition—“which,” he says,<lb/>\n“was too elaborate to repeat in a reading edition and to which readers<lb/>\nconcerned with such things are referred.” But that earlier edition can be<lb/>\nconsulted only in rare-book rooms. And in any case, the idea of a “reading edition”—“for the general reader, not for the antiquarian or for the<lb/>\nspecialist”—is suspect. Ordinary readers are often interested in textual<lb/>\nalterations; and when they are not, the presence of the information does<lb/>\nnot deter them from reading. That Carter continued to be concerned with<lb/>\nBrowne’s text is shown by his “working copies” of the two impressions of<lb/>\nthis edition, in which he marked eleven possible revisions in the first and<lb/>\neight corrections in the second.</p>\n<p>Carter’s other publications of the 1950s were mostly useful continu-<lb/>\nations of his long-standing enthusiasms: handlists of A. E. Housman,<lb/>\nStanley Morison, and William Johnson Cory (plus an edition of Cory),<lb/>\nshowing how valuable the handlist genre can be; and essays on book col-<lb/>\nlecting, Wise, and publishers’ bindings, some of them in the new journal<lb/>\n<hi>The Book Collector</hi>. He also continued to produce reviews steadily and to<lb/>\nwrite occasional biographical accounts and obituaries, primarily (but not<lb/>\nexclusively) of book-world figures.
