The BM, how-<lb/>ever, routinely tooled information onto non-institutional bindings during that time<lb/>period—a fact worth noting, given that this alteration was not documented in<lb/>writing. I am grateful to Karen Limper-Herz both for confirming that this was a<lb/>practice of the BM, and for sharing her opinion about the date of the original bind-<lb/>ings. We both independently determined that they dated from the last quarter of<lb/>the nineteenth century.</note></p>\n<p>Although such information may seem peripheral to the study of Brontë’s own<lb/>document, it is crucial for any editor or critic to note. Any time a book is rebound,<lb/>additional materials can be introduced into its structure; the leaves of a manuscript<lb/>can be removed or added to— or reorganized and joined in various ways—par-<lb/>ticularly in this case, in which they have been supplemented and altered. Often<lb/>binders and conservators will make repairs to paper leaves as part of the rebind-<lb/>ing process. Such alterations can materially influence the shape of a work. (I once<lb/>discovered, for instance, that one of Brontë’s early manuscripts, held in a leading<lb/>research library, had been rearranged and digitized out of order after it had been<lb/>treated by a conservator, who was presumably well intentioned but apparently<lb/>unfamiliar with the manuscript’s textual contents.) Today, professional conserva-<lb/>tors routinely and very carefully document their alterations to books, a trend that<lb/>started in the 1970s according to Cathleen Baker.<note place=\"foot\" n=\"32\">Cathleen Baker addressed this issue as part of a discussion she led on RBS Online in<lb/>October 28, 2020: “How Making Paper by Hand and by Machine Impacts Its<lb/>Characteristics.”</note> In the nineteenth century,<lb/>however, bookbinders who performed restoration work did not usually note their<lb/>modifications. Even with respect to changes made in the twentieth century, one<lb/>cannot rely on accurate recordkeeping. For example, the BL has no documenta-<lb/>tion available outlining any former alterations made to the paper leaves of the<lb/>manuscript volumes of <hi>Shirley</hi>—a troubling oversight, as this valuable<lb/>manuscript bears many excisions and repairs, as well as additions and rearrange-<lb/>ments.</p>\n<p>To undertake my study, I created a table to document the manuscript’s paper<lb/>stocks, its multiple forms of leaf and page numbering, its writing media (i.e., dif-<lb/>ferent colored inks and pencil), its excisions, the compositors’ markup, and other<lb/>notable features (e.g., paper repairs, sewing holes, &c.). Using a light sheet, I<lb/>moved through the manuscript, page by page, recording this information for all<lb/>of its 896 leaves; I performed this work at the BL twice, first in 2017, and then<lb/>again in 2019 to check my earlier work and to record additional details about the<lb/>manuscript’s leaf and page numbering, which turned out to be more complicated<lb/>than expected.</p>\n<p>Paper-based evidence confirms that one full wove leaf (vol. 1, BM f. 215) was added<lb/>to the manuscript as part of its nineteenth-century binding—an alteration that was<lb/>also documented by the British Museum staff when they officially acces-<lb/>sioned the manuscript in 1949.<note place=\"foot\" n=\"33\">The note reads: “the blank leaf between ff. 214 & 216, inserted in place of the original<lb/>f. 215, was in its present position when the MS. was received in the B.M.” The note is<lb/>written in blue pen on the label appearing on the verso of the first of three endpapers<lb/>at the back of volume 1, Add MS 43477.</note> This full leaf apparently replaced a fragment<lb/>of a leaf that had been so heavily excised by Brontë and, consequently, so small,<lb/>",
