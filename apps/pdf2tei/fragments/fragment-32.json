Carter’s set of <hi>The <lb/>Book Collector</hi> is at the Library of Congress. <lb/>\nThere are well over a hundred places <lb/>\nwhere Carter made some kind of marginal note (or put a question mark or exclamation point in the margin), often for the purpose of questioning a statement or <lb/>\nits wording; and there are about sixty places where he simply put a line or a check <lb/>\nmark or an X in the margin. In only fourteen places did he indicate his authorship of unsigned paragraphs in the \"Commentary\" (or \"News and Comment\") <lb/>\nsection by writing his initials or \"I drafted this\" in the margin. There may be no <lb/>\ndistinction between these two kinds of annotation; but it is possible that \"I drafted <lb/>\nthis\" indicates later revision by someone else (though the result would probably <lb/>\nstill be primarily his writing). All fourteen are given entries in section D below. <lb/>\nIt seems very likely that he wrote still other unsigned paragraphs as well, and <lb/>\nthey are represented by a blanket entry for 1952-75. As for his pseudonymous <lb/>\ncontributions of notes and queries to <hi>The <lb/>Book Collector</hi>, see the discussion above <lb/>\nfor <hi>Bibliographical Notes &amp; Queries</hi>, since he continued to use the same pseudonyms <lb/>\nin this revival of the function of the old journal.<lb/>\n</p>\n<p>(7) Sotheby Catalogues, 1955-72. From October 1955, when Carter became an <lb/>\nassociate in the book department at Sotheby’s, until July 1972, when he retired, <lb/>\nhe was in a position to write up entries for inclusion in Sotheby auction catalogues, and he occasionally did so. For example, Anthony Hobson told me that <lb/>\nCarter gave him a hand in cataloguing Sydney Cockerell’s collection in 1956. <lb/>\nAnd John Kerr and P. J. Croft identified for me several lots that were described <lb/>\nby Carter: in the 1 December 1964 sale, lots 526 and 528; 6-7 December 1966, <lb/>\nlot 611; 8-9 July 1968, lots 782-827 and 840; and 9-10 December 1968, lots 756-<lb/>\n57a. He also catalogued the manuscript of Evelyn Waugh’s <hi>Scoop</hi> for the sale <lb/>\nof 7-8 July 1969 and Lear’s <hi>A Book of Nonsense</hi> for the sale of 22 June 1970, and <lb/>\nany lot of Housman material was probably catalogued by him. But according <lb/>\nto Hobson and Kerr, he did not otherwise write many catalogue entries. I have <lb/>\nincluded a blanket entry in section C for all the Sotheby catalogues from 1955 <lb/>\nto 1972, as a way of representing the scattered entries that he wrote over the <lb/>\nyears. Also entered in section C are a preface, an introduction, and a note of <lb/>\nacknowledgment that have been identified as his in the catalogues for the Sadleir <lb/>\n(1958), Silver (1965), and Diaghilev (1968) sales. There are two catalogues that <lb/>\nhave so far been identified as ones that Carter was entirely responsible for: those <lb/>\nfor the Pariser sale of Wiseiana on 4-5 December 1967 and for the Ewing sale <lb/>\nof Victorian fiction on 12-13 October 1970; these catalogues are given entries in <lb/>\nsection B, as books edited by Carter.<lb/>\n</p>\n<p>The basis for the attribution of other unsigned or pseudonymous publications, <lb/>\nexcept for those in the <hi>Times Literary Supplement</hi>, is sometimes explained within the <lb/>\nentries themselves and otherwise can normally be assumed to be the collections of <lb/>\npress cuttings in the Eton and Cambridge University libraries. For the unsigned <lb/>\ncontributions to the <hi>Times Literary Supplement</hi>, see section E below.<lb/>\n</p>\n<p>Finally, there are two other matters I must comment on. First is the question <lb/>\nwhether Carter wrote <hi>The Fall of the Titan</hi> (London: Lincoln Williams, 1934), a <lb/>\nnovel by \"John Waynflete,\" according to the title page. The authorship of this<lb/>\n</p>",
