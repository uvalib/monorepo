This explains the interruption to her red-ink numbering, as well as<lb/>\nits disuse afterward.<lb/>\nThe substance of the expansion has to do with Eva, “<hi>La Première Femme Savante</hi>”—the subject of a school essay, we are told, that was written by Shirley<lb/>\nin her youth and that was subsequently memorized by her teacher, Louis Moore<lb/>\n(Robert Moore’s brother). Louis, as portrayed within the action of the novel, recites<lb/>\nthe essay aloud, in its entirety, from memory.128 Eva is Shirley’s vision of an<lb/>\nearly woman, living at the dawn of time—an alternative, we intuit, to Milton’s<lb/>\nEve, as mentioned in volume 2. Indeed, the name “Eva” appropriately carries a<lb/>\nfeminine ending, as if to demarcate the difference—reminding us that Shirley,<lb/>\nnot Milton, is the author of this particular narrative.<lb/>\nThis dialectic is emphasized by the two sections, which cross-inform one<lb/>\nanother. Because the meditation on Eva comes later in the novel, it serves both<lb/>\nas a corrective to the Eve of Paradise Lost and as a more complete re-imagining<lb/>\nof Eve as she might have been. Yet, in the chronology of Shirley’s own life,<lb/>\nShirley writes her essay on Eva before she delivers her diatribe against Milton to<lb/>\nCaroline Helstone. As a result, when we read the novel’s last volume, we recall<lb/>\nShirley’s prior criticism, and we realize that Shirley, as a schoolgirl, had already<lb/>\nsupplied a vision of her own to challenge the Miltonic Eve that she later disputes<lb/>\nas a grown woman. Indeed, it is Shirley who seems most befitting of the title<lb/>\n“<hi>femme savante</hi>”— a heroine also worthy of carrying the title of this particular<lb/>\nnovel.<lb/>\nBecause these two episodes appear within different volumes—and across the<lb/>\ngap of time when Brontë “laid aside” her work—an intervention was likely<lb/>\nnecessary in order to tighten the parallel between the sections. As with the prior<lb/>\nexamples of “<hi>Shirley and Caroline</hi>” and also “<hi>Further Communications on Business</hi>,” the insertion in volume 2 lays the groundwork for a later passage in<lb/>\nvolume 3.129 Here it is certain, however, that the revision to volume 2 preceded<lb/>\nthat to volume 3, as we know that the addition of the long “Eva” text was intro-<lb/>\nduced extremely late in the process.<lb/>\n6. <hi>Analysis of Missing and Recycled Leaves</hi><lb/>\nWith each of the prior three examples, changes in foliation and page number-<lb/>\ning correlate to the use of different paper stocks, and so help to establish the<lb/>\nscope and approximate order in which Brontë modified her manuscript. How<lb/>\nthen do we approach the question of the first chapter, “<hi>Levitical</hi>,” which is not<lb/>\nonly written on London Superfine wove stock but, notably, is also the only part<lb/>\nof volume 1 not written on Cream Laid paper? This is surely significant when<lb/>\nwe recall that London Superfine wove paper stock appears in volume 2 only in<lb/>\n128. The narrator “translates” Louis Moore’s recitation of the essay “on pain of<lb/>\nbeing unintelligible to some readers.” See f. D664.E91.<lb/>\n129. At the time the insertion was made to volume 2, the passage it corresponded with<lb/>\nwould have the short essay in French, probably titled “<hi>La Première Femme Savante</hi>” and most likely focusing on Eve/Eva, in accord with the subject of the<lb/>\nlater expansion.<lb/>\n</p>",
