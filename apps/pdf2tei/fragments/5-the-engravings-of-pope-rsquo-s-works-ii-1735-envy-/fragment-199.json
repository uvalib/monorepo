To either side of the circle are placed objects that evoke the world<lb/>\nof the epic, either symbols of war (spears, shields, helmets) or of peace (lyres, goblets,<lb/>\nbowls), often enwrapped by fertile vegetation. The whole is contained in a decorative<lb/>\nframe. Usually the initials ‘W.K. inv.’ and ‘P.F. sc.’ appear on opposite sides of the foot<lb/>\nof the plate.
