  "tei": "<pb n=\"216\"/>\n<p><lb/>Horace Imitated but before the Preface to the 1737 Letters.<note n=\"65\">David Foxon thinks it was intended with other prose pieces for the 1735 Works (Pope and the Early Eighteenth-Century Book Trade, 133), but that now seems unlikely. The First Epistle of the First Book of Horace would not have been ready in 1735.</note><lb/>But by far the most surprising appearance of this Mercury engraving is in its original unribboned<lb/>and unlettered state at the beginning of the letters in the 1741 volume, The Works<lb/>of Mr. Alexander Pope in Prose, Volume II (Griffith 530–1) (figure 13). It would be<lb/>expected to appear in the same revised state as it had at the beginning of the<lb/>1737 Letters. It forms the headpiece to a letter from Pope to Swift of 18 June 1714.<lb/>Lord Orrery had left Dublin on 5 July 1737, according to Sherburn, bringing<lb/>with him Pope’s letters to Swift. He wrote to Swift saying Pope had the letters on<lb/>23 July 1737.<note n=\"66\">Correspondence, 4:81.</note> But this evidence of the plain engraving suggests that Pope had<lb/>already started printing his letters to Swift before the engraving appeared in its<lb/>enhanced form in the Letters on 19 May 1737. In a case like this, the engraving<lb/>affords valuable bibliographical evidence. Examination on the Traherne collator<lb/>does not suggest there were two engravings, and such duplication would in any<lb/>case be most unlikely. The whole affair of the publication of the Pope and Swift<lb/>letters clearly invites further investigation, as does the rest of Pope’s printing in<lb/>quarto and folio in the summer of 1737, but it is difficult to avoid the conclusion<lb/>that Pope had printed some of his letters to Swift before July 1737; perhaps he<lb/>had saved copies of them; perhaps he made them up.</p>",
