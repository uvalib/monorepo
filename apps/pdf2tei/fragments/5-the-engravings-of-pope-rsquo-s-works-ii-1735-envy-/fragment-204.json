The collections seem to have been planned <lb/>together, with some <hi rend=\"italic\">Odyssey</hi> engravings being retouched to suit their new role <lb/>and some left unchanged. Both collections were printed with reissue in the <lb/><hi rend=\"italic\">Works</hi> in mind, and, though in some cases that plan did not come to fruition, the en-<lb/>gravings did reappear when <hi rend=\"italic\">Works</hi> II was published a year later. Although the <lb/>two Satires were published over two months later than <hi rend=\"italic\">An Essay on Man</hi>, it was <lb/>one of their engravings that proved most significant for the <hi rend=\"italic\">Works</hi> the following <lb/>year.<note n=\"29\">Foxon, <hi rend=\"italic\">English Verse</hi>, P893 – 5, gives the date of publication as 4 July 1734. Although the collected <hi rend=\"italic\">Essay on Man</hi> was issued in the usual three formats, I suspect there were no large-paper folios of the <hi rend=\"italic\">Satires</hi> issued. The ESTC does not record one and Foxon’s possible example, P895, has no engravings.</note> There are no headpieces to the Satires, only tailpieces to mark the ends of <lb/>the parallel Latin and English texts, and there is no room for a tailpiece at the <lb/>end of the Latin of Satire II.ii. Of the three illustrations, two were simply taken <lb/>from the <hi rend=\"italic\">Odyssey</hi>: the Latin of Satire II.i closes on p. 18 with an altar adorned <lb/>with the image of the helmeted Minerva,<note n=\"30\">I have followed Pope’s practice, using the Latin names in his Index.</note> an ornament that originally appeared <lb/>at the end of <hi rend=\"italic\">Odyssey</hi> Book XVII; the English of Satire II.ii closes on p. 40, with <lb/>the goblet Mulius ‘crown’d / With purple juice’ at the end of <hi rend=\"italic\">Odyssey</hi> Book XVIII. <lb/>Neither engraving seems particularly appropriate to its poem, though they are <lb/>concerned with wisdom and feasting. But the vignette at the end of the English <lb/>of Satire II.i (p. 19) — the one that was to find its way to the <hi rend=\"italic\">Works</hi> title page <lb/>— is appropriate and changes had been made to enforce its significance (figure <lb/>4). It had originally appeared at the end of the last book of the <hi rend=\"italic\">Odyssey</hi>, where <lb/>Kent abandoned the usual task of illustrating the poem in order to symbolize <lb/>his friendship and collaboration with Pope. Two putti, representing poetry and <lb/>painting, embrace above a medallion of Pope’s head. One putto holds a lyre, and <lb/>a sheet of text and a palette lie below the medallion. The paper is marked ‘W. <lb/>Kent inv.’ while below it is ‘P. Fourdrinier sc.’<note n=\"31\">The engraving is No. 17 in William Kurtz Wimsatt, <hi rend=\"italic\">The Portraits of Alexander Pope</hi> (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1965), 125 – 6. Wimsatt traces Pope’s subsequent use of the image.</note> For the collected edition of the <lb/>Satires the symbolism of the vignette was broadened to include all Pope’s friends. <lb/>Added to the medallion is a quotation from the poem, ‘<hi rend=\"smallcaps\">UNI ÆQVVS VIRTVTI ATQ. EIVS AMICI</hi>’, the words Pope had capitalized in the text since its first <lb/>publication on 15 February 1733, and imitated as ‘to Virtue only and her friends <lb/>a friend’. Pope had found in Kent’s affectionate commemoration a visual rep-<lb/>resentation of friendship founded on virtue. This symbolism proved of growing <lb/>importance in shaping the illustration of Pope’s books in the next few years. We <lb/></p>",
