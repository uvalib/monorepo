But what is stranger, a Nobleman (if such a Reflection can be thought to come from a Nobleman) has dropt an Allusion to this pitiful Untruth, in his Epistle to a Doctor of Divinity: And the following Line,<lb/>\nHard as thy Heart, and as thy Birth Obscure,<lb/>\nhas fallen from a like Courtly pen, in the Verses to the Imitator of Horace. Mr. Pope’s Father was of a Gentleman’s Family in Oxfordshire, the Head of which was the Earl of Downe, whose sole Heiress married the Earl of Lindsey—His Mother was the Daughter of William Turnor, Esq; of York: she had three Brothers, one of whom was kill’d, another died in the Service of King Charles; the eldest following his Fortunes, and becoming a General Officer in Spain, left her what Estate remain’d after the Sequestrations and Forfeitures of her Family. —Mr. Pope died in 1717, aged 75; She in 1733, aged 93, a very few Weeks after this Poem was finished. The following Inscription was placed by their Son on their Monument, in the Parish of Twickenham, in Middlesex.<lb/>\nD. O. M.<lb/>\nAlexandro Pope Viro Innocuo,<lb/>\nProbo, Pio, Qui vixit annos Lxxv, ob. Mdccvii.<lb/>\nEt EdithÆ Conjungi Inculpabili, PientissimÆ,<lb/>\nQuÆ vixit annos Xciii, ob. Mdccxxxiii.<lb/>\nParentibus Benemerentibus Filius Fecit, et Sibi.<lb/>\n(<hi rend=\"italic\">Works</hi> II, 214)<lb/>\nThe impression given by Pope’s note is reinforced by the engraving. The central shield is quite a small part of the design. On it the arms of his father’s family are impaled with those of his mother’s, as those families are identified in the note to the poem. The dextra has the arms of the Oxfordshire Pope family to which the Earl of Downe belonged. In Guillim’s <hi rend=\"italic\">A Display of Heraldry</hi> (1724), 183, they appear under Baronets: ‘Sir William Pope of Wilcot in Oxfordshire, Kt. since an Irish Earl, viz. Earl of Downe. Parted per Pale [halved vertically], Or and Azure [gold and blue], on a Chevron between three Griffins Heads erased [torn off], four Fleurs de Lys, all Counterchanged [reversing colours]’. The engraving has only three fleurs-de-lis, but Kent probably felt pressed for space.<note n=\"56\">Sir Bernard Burke, <hi rend=\"italic\">The General Armory of England, Scotland, Ireland, and Wales</hi> (London, 1884), s.n. agrees about the four fleurs-de-lis and adds a crest of griffins’ heads.</note><lb/>\nThe sinister has the arms of the Turnor or Turner family. They are illustrated and described<lb/>\n</p>",
