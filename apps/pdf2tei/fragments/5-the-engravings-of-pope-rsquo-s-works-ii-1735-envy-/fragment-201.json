  "tei": "<pb n=\"195\"/>\n<p>In this context ‘Sculpture’ means engraving, and, contrary to the ridicule implicit <lb/>in these lines, Pope had a childhood love for John Ogilby’s translation of Homer <lb/>– ‘It was that great edition with pictures’ – even though he did not admire the <lb/>translation.<note n=\"22\">Spence, 1:14. Pope’s reading was ‘at eight or nine years old’.</note> David Foxon has argued that Ogilby’s illustrations even helped <lb/>shape those of Pope’s <hi rend=\"italic\">Iliad</hi>.<note n=\"23\">Foxon, Pope and the Early Eighteenth-Century Book Trade, 76–81.</note> I suspect Pope had a similar ambivalent relationship <lb/>to the stamping of arms by Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle, referred <lb/>to in the next line. Pope added a note to the <hi rend=\"italic\">Variorum</hi> edition explaining, ‘Lang-<lb/>baine reckons up eight Folio’s of her Grace’s; which were usually adorn’d with <lb/>gilded Covers, and had her Coat of Arms upon them’ (<hi rend=\"italic\">Dunciad</hi> 1728 &amp; 1729, <lb/>193). The covers of her books are regularly stamped with gold fleurons in the <lb/>corners just like the book in Pope’s owl frontispiece, but I have not found a cover <lb/>stamped with her arms.<note n=\"24\">Her arms are not found in Liza Blake, ‘Margaret Cavendish’s University Years: Batch Bindings and Trade Bindings in Cambridge and Oxford’, PBSA, 111:1 (2022), 21–91. They are discussed in relation to her monument in Westminster Abbey: http://westminster-abbey.org/our-history/people/william-and-margaret-cavendish (22 March 2024). Those on Pope’s frontispiece (a chevron with three martlets) are not hers.</note><lb/></p>\n<p>What the Duchess of Newcastle does do, and in this she was followed in <lb/>1735 by Pope, is use coats of arms in headpieces. Ogilby in his <hi rend=\"italic\">Homer</hi> (1660) <lb/>and Tonson in the subscription edition of Dryden’s <hi rend=\"italic\">Virgil</hi> (1697) included plates <lb/>that at their foot contained the coat of arms of a subscriber. The coat of arms <lb/>proclaimed the aristocratic patronage of the volume. But in the Duchess’s books <lb/>the arms in the headpieces advertised not the patron’s but the author’s status. In <lb/><hi rend=\"italic\">Philosophical Letters: or, Modest Reflections upon Some Opinions in Natural Philosophy</hi> <lb/>(London, 1664), a woodblock headpiece of the royal arms of England appears <lb/>above the first poem, ‘To Her Excellency The Lady Marchioness of Newcastle, <lb/>on her Book of <hi rend=\"italic\">Philosophical Letters</hi>’ and is then used several more times. The <lb/>deployment of heraldry is more sophisticated in the Latin translation of her life <lb/>of her husband, <hi rend=\"italic\">De Vita et Rebus Gestis Nobilissimi Ilustrissimique Principis, Guilielmi,</hi> <lb/><hi rend=\"italic\">Ducis Novo-Castrensis</hi> (London, 1668), where elements of the Ogle (a star and cres-<lb/>cent) and Cavendish (simplified bucks’ heads caboshed [without neck]) arms are <lb/>combined with differing supporters to represent different aspects of his career. <lb/>How far this practice may have influenced Kent in preparing Pope’s headpieces <lb/>(they similarly deploy central arms with putti supporters) it is difficult to deter-<lb/>mine, but the illustrations in the <hi rend=\"italic\">Dunciad Variorum</hi> and <hi rend=\"italic\">Works</hi> (1735) show a similar <lb/>complexity, exploring the ways heraldry might be used not only to decorate a <lb/>book but to reinforce its themes.<lb/></p>\n<p>When it came to designing the <hi rend=\"italic\">Dunciad Variorum</hi>, the splendid engraving <lb/>on the title page – an ass carrying a burden of books – was supplemented by <lb/>a headpiece for Book I modelled on the <hi rend=\"italic\">Odyssey</hi> headpieces and later used in <lb/>the <hi rend=\"italic\">Works</hi> (figure 3). I agree with Savage that this headpiece, like the owl, it <lb/>is likely to be Kent’s work (‘Kent as Book Illustrator’, 427). Such engagement <lb/>is very much in keeping with his patron Burlington’s support for the publica-<lb/>tion of the <hi rend=\"italic\">Variorum</hi>. In a letter George Sherburn dates 23 December 1728, <lb/>Pope reveals that Burlington has acted for him by showing some papers to the <lb/></p>",
