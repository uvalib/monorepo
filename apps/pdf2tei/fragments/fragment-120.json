Nowhere do they explain why the code was predicated on<lb/>columns rather than some other ordering principle, an alphabetical system for example, or a geographical progression from state to state, which might at least<lb/>have some regional significance. Nowhere do they define the purpose of the code unless it was a means of randomizing the names while ensuring that none of them<lb/>would be omitted. One would expect a code to contain a confidential message in danger of falling into the wrong hands, but it is unclear what needed to be kept<lb/>secret on this occasion. The names were not protecting classified information.<lb/>Instead of making complications, it is better to look for precedents and similar examples, a simple comparison of layout techniques and production methods.<lb/>Design considerations often dictated the sequence of signatures. Allen and Sneff are not correct in saying that the Sussex Declaration was the only one to<lb/>interfere with the state groupings before the publication of the Bridgham print in 1836. The printers of the Boston Bewick facsimile rearranged the states to<lb/>save on space and make room for the oak and olive frame. A Philadelphia printer moved the signatures out of order in an 1832 broadside reconfigured in a<lb/>three-column format. After 1836 the signatures frequently appear in random order for no other reason than to fill an area predetermined by the decorative<lb/>apparatus and the proportions of the page. Just to take one example, an 1845 letterpress broadside starts out with the state groupings but then switches out the<lb/>signatures to rank them in a five-column format within a border of state seals. The printers disbanded the Maryland delegation and put each of the signatures in a<lb/>different column.15<lb/>Like others who made those design decisions, Bridgham’s artist sought to<lb/>achieve a harmonious balance between image and text, a pleasing composition<lb/>comprising the border of state seals, the calligraphic lettering, and the facsimile<lb/>signatures. The lettering above and the signatures below were aligned to form two<lb/>rectangular blocks, each even in weight, each fitting neatly inside the border.<lb/>The artist allowed a tendril to extend beyond the border to complete the last<lb/>line of text, a grace note following the phrase “our LIVES, our FORTUNES,<lb/>and our sacred HONOR.” Likewise, the signatures were spaced out to make the<lb/>line endings flush with the text, even though the emblematic John Hancock had<lb/>to be compressed, and some signatures lost their final flourishes. Signatures at<lb/>the beginning and the end of the last line retained their flourishes for a decorative tone.<note place=\"foot\" n=\"15\">15.
