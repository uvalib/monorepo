As we have seen, it was Brontë’s practice to edit<lb/>\nand tighten such parallels across the novel’s three volumes. Given the material<lb/>\nevidence presented here, it is reasonable to suppose that she modified her opening<lb/>\nchapter in concert with the composition of the novel’s conclusion.<lb/>\n</p>\n<p>7. <hi>The Role of Interpretation</hi><lb/>\nThis article has attempted to call attention to the kinds of rich bibliographical<lb/>\nand codicological evidence found in a modern literary manuscript. It has largely<lb/>\nfocused on demonstrating the utility of correlating variations in the substrates of the<lb/>\nmanuscript with differences in its numbering. It cannot offer a close analysis of all<lb/>\nof the changes made by Brontë, which is better handled in the form of a critical<lb/>\nedition. At the same time, it is important to acknowledge that the manuscript contains<lb/>\nsome significant expansions that entail no apparent changes to its paper stocks.<lb/>\n</p>\n<p>One notable example, already discussed, is Brontë’s revision to her chapter<lb/>\n“<hi>The First Blue-Stocking</hi>”—the “translation” of the French passage that was<lb/>\nmade in September 1849 per the advice of her publishers. Another even larger<lb/>\nexpansion preceding that one seems to have gone undetected to date. “<hi>Written in<lb/>\nthe Schoolroom</hi>” was copied out by Brontë in the summer of 1849. The<lb/>\nchapter, which falls toward the very end of volume 3, describes Louis Moore’s<lb/>\nproposal to Shirley Keeldar. Ending with f. A851.B851.C858.[D864].E290, the<lb/>\nchapter was followed by “<hi>The Winding-up.</hi>” Then, as table 5 shows, a series of<lb/>\nten leaves was inserted as part of stage C of the composition process, as is evident<lb/>\nby the changes to the manuscript’s red-ink and B-series brown-ink numbering.<lb/>\nThis new section, demarcated by a double rule of two short pen strokes in the<lb/>\nmanuscript, begins on the very bottom of f. A851.B851.C858.[D864].E290. Nine<lb/>\nleaves later, we find A852.B852.C869.[D875].E301 and its ensuing sequence.<lb/>\nWhat had been a difference in seven leaves between the numbering of states B<lb/>\nand C later increased to a difference of 17 leaves.<lb/>\n</p>\n<p>This newly added section is conveniently framed as an interpolated narrative<lb/>\nfrom Louis Moore’s blank book—a narrative device that Brontë uses earlier on<lb/>\nin the third volume of the novel in the chapter, “<hi>Louis Moore</hi>,” and later again,<lb/>\nat the beginning of “<hi>Written in the Schoolroom</hi>.” Critics such as Lewes found<lb/>\nthis tactic rather clumsy, as his following critique makes evident:<lb/>\n</p>\n<quote>\n<p>There, again, there is Louis Moore writing long narratives in his note-book. What he<lb/>\nwrites is often striking; and had the authoress only thought of making him keep a journal,<lb/>\nprobability would have been sufficiently saved. But, instead of that, she obliges him to sit<lb/>\ndown in Shirley’s room, draw out a note-book, and proceed to write very circumstantially,<lb/>\nfor our benefit, what everyone feels he would never have written at all. And while writing<lb/>\nhe is so intensely conscious of being read, that he says, “I confess it—to this mute page, I<lb/>\nmay confess it” . . . . All that Louis Moore writes might have been told by the authoress,<lb/>\nwithout subterfuge.<lb/>\n</p>\n</quote>\n<p>150. Lewes, “<hi rend=\"bold\">Shirley: a Tale. By Currer Bell, Author of ‘Jane Eyre,’</hi>” <hi>The Edinburgh Review</hi>, no. 183 (January 1850): 168.<lb/>\n</p>",
