It turns out that the<lb/>\npresence of esparto in the paper of some of the pamphlets that Carter and<lb/>\nPollard were investigating was the basis for proving them to be forgeries.<lb/>\n(Although Dr. Thorndyke is not referred to, another fictional detective,<lb/>\nEdgar Allan Poe’s Auguste Dupin, is cited as a precursor in a later chapter<lb/>\n[p. 87].) Whether or not there was any connection with Dr. Thorndyke,<lb/>\nCarter and Pollard used the same procedure: after having the papers of<lb/>\nthe pamphlets tested and determining the dates when esparto and chemi-<lb/>\ncal wood-pulp were introduced into papermaking, they found that twenty-<lb/>\ntwo of the pamphlets had printed dates that preceded the dates when their<lb/>\npaper would have been available, and thus they were fraudulent.<lb/>\nThe authors were aware that their use of paper evidence was more<lb/>\ngroundbreaking than that of typographical evidence. The paper test, they<lb/>\nsaid, “has not hitherto been applied to bibliographical purposes” (p. 42),<lb/>\nwhereas, in the opening sentence of the chapter on type, they call atten-<lb/>\ntion to Robert Proctor’s work, decades earlier, identifying the printers<lb/>\nof incunabula through the type designs. They also note that Proctor, a<lb/>\nfriend of William Morris, had in 1898 questioned (on the basis of its type)<lb/>\nthe Morris pamphlet that Carter and Pollard proved to be a forgery.<lb/>\nThe typographical tests they used throughout were proposed by Stanley<lb/>\nMorison (they could hardly have had a greater typographical adviser).<lb/>\nHe noticed the kernless “f” and “j” and the tilted question mark used<lb/>\nin many of the pamphlets; and these characteristics not only provided<lb/>\nanother dating test (based on the earliest use of a kernless font) but also<lb/>\nled to the identification of the printer as Richard Clay &amp; Sons (Clay had<lb/>\nadded that question mark to the font). The Clay firm was not involved in<lb/>\nthe deception: having been commissioned by Wise to print many facsimi-<lb/>\nles for the Browning and Shelley societies, they had no reason to question<lb/>\nthe imprints and dates being placed on these other pamphlets. Carter and<lb/>\nPollard concluded that sixteen of the fraudulent pamphlets were definitely<lb/>\nprinted by Clay &amp; Sons and that all the rest probably were.<lb/>\nThe analysis of paper and type is set out in chapters 4 and 5 with<lb/>\nmeticulous care and exemplary thoroughness. These chapters are part<lb/>\nof the six that constitute part I, “Deduction,” tracing the story from the<lb/>\ninitial suspicion to the “proved conclusion.” In the last chapter of part I,<lb/>\nthe authors say, “With all its drudgery, detective work has a great intel-<lb/>\nlectual fascination” (p. 93)—and this fascination has been conveyed to<lb/>\nthe reader. With the “machinery of detection” having been set forth, the<lb/>\nauthors move in part II, “Reconstruction,” to a description of the forger’s<lb/>\nmotivation, methods, and marketing strategies. Then comes the largest<lb/>\nsection of the book, part III, “Dossiers,” in which each of forty-six pam-<lb/>",
