  "tei": "<pb n=\"14\"/>\n<p>The <hi rend=\"italic\">Enquiry</hi> is a landmark of bibliographical analysis and the presentation <lb/>\nof bibliographical evidence, and it is written in such a way that it is an <lb/>\nenduringly readable story of detection.<lb/>\nThe three major books of 1932-34 were not Carter&#8217;s only significant <lb/>\npublications of the early 1930s. In November 1934, four months after the <lb/>\n<hi rend=\"italic\">Enquiry</hi> appeared, Constable (in London) and Scribner&#8217;s (in New York) <lb/>\nbrought out a volume of essays (planned by him and Michael Sadleir) <lb/>\nthat he edited, entitled <hi rend=\"italic\">New Paths in Book Collecting</hi>. There had of course <lb/>\nbeen a number of books about book collecting during the previous forty <lb/>\nyears, but what made this one distinctive was that it consisted of essays <lb/>\nby different writers, each taking up an appealing direction for collecting. <lb/>\nThe authors were drawn primarily from his and Sadleir&#8217;s circle of book-<lb/>\nworld friends, half of them dealers and half collectors: Carter (on &#8220;Detec-<lb/>\ntive Fiction&#8221;), Sadleir (&#8220;Yellow-Backs&#8221;), P. H. Muir (&#8220;Ignoring the Flag&#8221; <lb/>\nand &#8220;War Books&#8221;), Graham Pollard (&#8220;Serial Fiction&#8221;), David A. Randall <lb/>\n(&#8220;American First Editions, 1900-1933&#8221;), Thomas Balston (&#8220;English Book <lb/>\nIllustration, 1880-1900&#8221;), C. B. Oldman (&#8220;Musical First Editions&#8221;), and <lb/>\nJohn T. Winterich (&#8220;The Expansion of an Author Collection&#8221;). When <lb/>\nCarter commented on this book in 1948 (in <hi rend=\"italic\">Taste and Technique in Book-</hi><lb/>\n<hi rend=\"italic\">Collecting</hi>), he called it &#8220;only one instance of the responsible part taken in <lb/>\nrecent years by professional booksellers, not merely through their practi-<lb/>\ncal influence exerted in the course of business but also by their contribu-<lb/>\ntions to bibliophilic literature and propaganda, in the formulation and <lb/>\nthe exposition of theory, of policy and of practice in the book-collecting <lb/>\nworld&#8221; (Cambridge edition, p. 84). Here he was not only observing a de-<lb/>\nvelopment but also describing the path he saw for himself as a bookseller, <lb/>\none he faithfully followed.<lb/>\nThe title of the volume was not meant to suggest that the subjects <lb/>\ndiscussed were entirely new, for some collectors were already focusing <lb/>\non them; but they were new in the sense that they were not traditional, <lb/>\nand the purpose of the book was to call attention to, and encourage, <lb/>\nthe approach to collecting represented by these trends. It was the paths <lb/>\nthat were new, not necessarily the subjects: the book aimed not to &#8220;dic-<lb/>\ntate&#8221; but &#8220;to suggest by means of examples&#8221; (p. 7). As Carter remarked <lb/>\nin <hi rend=\"italic\">Taste and Technique</hi>, the volume was &#8220;one gambit&#8221; in the &#8220;general <lb/>\npropagandist movement towards diversity of method&#8221; (p. 84). Through-<lb/>\nout his career, Carter argued that collectors should think on their own <lb/>\nand not simply repeat what earlier collectors had done. In the intro-<lb/>\nduction to this volume, for example, he says that collectors should have <lb/>\n&#8220;enough independence to dislike joining the herd movements which <lb/>\nare always ploughing their way across the book market&#8221; (p. 6). The <lb/>\npoint is made several times in the opening pages through metaphor. <lb/>\nFor example:<lb/></p>",
