It turns out that the\n<lb/>presence of esparto in the paper of some of the pamphlets that Carter and\n<lb/>Pollard were investigating was the basis for proving them to be forgeries.\n<lb/>(Although Dr. Thorndyke is not referred to, another fictional detective,\n<lb/>Edgar Allan Poe’s Auguste Dupin, is cited as a precursor in a later chapter\n<lb/>[p. 87].) Whether or not there was any connection with Dr. Thorndyke,\n<lb/>Carter and Pollard used the same procedure: after having the papers of\n<lb/>the pamphlets tested and determining the dates when esparto and chemi-\n<lb/>cal wood-pulp were introduced into papermaking, they found that twenty-\n<lb/>two of the pamphlets had printed dates that preceded the dates when their\n<lb/>paper would have been available, and thus they were fraudulent.\n<lb/>The authors were aware that their use of paper evidence was more\n<lb/>groundbreaking than that of typographical evidence. The paper test, they\n<lb/>said, “has not hitherto been applied to bibliographical purposes” (p. 42),\n<lb/>whereas, in the opening sentence of the chapter on type, they call atten-\n<lb/>tion to Robert Proctor’s work, decades earlier, identifying the printers\n<lb/>of incunabula through the type designs. They also note that Proctor, a\n<lb/>friend of William Morris, had in 1898 questioned (on the basis of its type)\n<lb/>the Morris pamphlet that Carter and Pollard proved to be a forgery.\n<lb/>The typographical tests they used throughout were proposed by Stanley\n<lb/>Morison (they could hardly have had a greater typographical adviser).\n<lb/>He noticed the kernless “f” and “j” and the tilted question mark used\n<lb/>in many of the pamphlets; and these characteristics not only provided\n<lb/>another dating test (based on the earliest use of a kernless font) but also\n<lb/>led to the identification of the printer as Richard Clay &amp; Sons (Clay had\n<lb/>added that question mark to the font). The Clay firm was not involved in\n<lb/>the deception: having been commissioned by Wise to print many facsimi-\n<lb/>les for the Browning and Shelley societies, they had no reason to question\n<lb/>the imprints and dates being placed on these other pamphlets. Carter and\n<lb/>Pollard concluded that sixteen of the fraudulent pamphlets were definitely\n<lb/>printed by Clay &amp; Sons and that all the rest probably were.\n<lb/>The analysis of paper and type is set out in chapters 4 and 5 with\n<lb/>meticulous care and exemplary thoroughness. These chapters are part\n<lb/>of the six that constitute part I, “Deduction,” tracing the story from the\n<lb/>initial suspicion to the “proved conclusion.” In the last chapter of part I,\n<lb/>the authors say, “With all its drudgery, detective work has a great intel-\n<lb/>lectual fascination” (p. 93)—and this fascination has been conveyed to\n<lb/>the reader. With the “machinery of detection” having been set forth, the\n<lb/>authors move in part II, “Reconstruction,” to a description of the forger’s\n<lb/>motivation, methods, and marketing strategies. Then comes the largest\n<lb/>section of the book, part III, “Dossiers,” in which each of forty-six pam-\n</p>",
