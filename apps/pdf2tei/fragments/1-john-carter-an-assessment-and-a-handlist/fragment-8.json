  "tei": "<pb n=\"8\"/>\n<p>\n a Bookman (2004). The biographical details selected for mention here and<lb/>\n in the handlist (many of which do not appear in the Dickinson book) are<lb/>\n those that seem to me most relevant for understanding the background<lb/>\n and context of his writings and his wide influence. I knew John Carter for<lb/>\n only the last ten years of his life: some of my recollections were written<lb/>\n up in section 36 of my memoir, “The Living Room” (published in vol-<lb/>\n ume 59 of <hi rend=\"italic\">Studies in Bibliography</hi> and then in <hi rend=\"italic\">Books in My Life</hi>, 2021), and<lb/>\n I dedicated my book about book-jackets to his memory. I shall not forget<lb/>\n the many kindnesses he showed me and the important favors he did for<lb/>\n me, and the present offering is a reflection of my gratitude.<lb/>\n</p>\n<head>ASSESSMENT</head><lb/>\n<head>The 1930s</head>\n<p>\n John Carter&#8217;s first post-collegiate publication on a bookish subject, an<lb/>\n article on “Original Condition” in the 15 November 1930 issue of<lb/>\n <hi rend=\"italic\">Publishers&#8217; Weekly</hi>, came only three years after college and inaugurated an amaz-<lb/>\n ing four-year period of brilliant productivity. Born John Waynflete Carter<lb/>\n at Eton on 10 May 1905, he was educated at Eton and King&#8217;s College<lb/>\n Cambridge, where he achieved a double first in the classical tripos and<lb/>\n an honors degree in 1927. By that time he was already collecting Catullus<lb/>\n and had become interested in textual criticism through the influence of A.<lb/>\n E. Housman&#8217;s lectures. Almost immediately after leaving Cambridge he<lb/>\n was hired (in September 1927) by the London office of Charles Scribner&#8217;s<lb/>\n Sons to locate rare books to be sold in their New York shop. In the three<lb/>\n years between then and that 1930 article, he was becoming acquainted<lb/>\n with the book dealers and collectors both in Britain and in America (his<lb/>\n first visit to New York being January to April 1929). But he was clearly do-<lb/>\n ing more, for his first three letters to the <hi rend=\"italic\">Times Literary Supplement</hi> (in 1931-<lb/>\n 33) show that by then he was already immersed in research on Sir Thomas<lb/>\n Browne, publishers&#8217; bindings, and the pamphlets that became known as<lb/>\n the Wise-Forman forgeries — the subjects of his first major publications<lb/>\n (and of his early articles for the main book-collecting journals of the time,<lb/>\n <hi rend=\"italic\">The Book Collector&#8217;s Quarterly</hi> in England and <hi rend=\"italic\">The Colophon</hi> in America).<lb/>\n</p>\n<p>\n In May 1932 he published <hi rend=\"italic\">Binding Variants in English Publishing, 1820-1900</hi><lb/>\n as the sixth volume in Michael Sadleir&#8217;s important <hi rend=\"italic\">Bibliographia</hi> se-<lb/>\n ries, which had the significant subtitle “Studies in Book History and Book<lb/>\n Structure” (where “structure” makes clear the interest in bibliographical<lb/>\n analysis). Sadleir, a publisher (Constable was his firm), novelist, and col-<lb/>\n lector, had already established himself (he was sixteen and a half years<lb/>\n older than Carter) as a bibliographical scholar and a pioneer historian<lb/>\n of publishers&#8217; bindings. He had published a bibliography of Trollope in<lb/>\n 1928 (a landmark through its explicit demonstration that an author bibli-<lb/>\n ography could be scholarly as well as useful).<lb/>\n</p>",
