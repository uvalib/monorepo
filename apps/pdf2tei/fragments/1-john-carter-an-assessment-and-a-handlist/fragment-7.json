Indeed, he held a unique position, for he distinguished<lb/>himself as a bookseller, a collector, a scholar, and a writer, equally<lb/>at home and equally recognized on both sides of the Atlantic.<lb/>He created innovative rare-book catalogues for the Scribner Book Store;<lb/>formed several notable collections, especially of Catullus and Housman;<lb/>was a pioneer investigator of the bibliographical problems of nineteenth-<lb/>century publishers’ bindings; performed (with Graham Pollard) a classic<lb/>piece of bibliographical detection in uncovering the Wise-Forman forger-<lb/>ies; produced a scholarly edition of Sir Thomas Browne’s <hi rend=\"italic\">Urne Buriall</hi> and<lb/>the <hi rend=\"italic\">Garden of Cyrus</hi>; and wrote (or co-wrote or co-edited) several celebrated<lb/>works—<hi rend=\"italic\">An Enquiry into the Nature of Certain Nineteenth Century Pamphlets</hi><lb/>(1934), <hi rend=\"italic\">Taste and Technique in Book-Collecting</hi> (1948), <hi rend=\"italic\">ABC for Book-Collectors</hi><lb/>(1952), and <hi rend=\"italic\">Printing and the Mind of Man</hi> (1967).<lb/>\nA record of his published writings is obviously a basic guide to his ac-<lb/>complishment. But such a record is also desirable for another reason that<lb/>would not apply to many people: nearly every piece he wrote, no matter<lb/>how small (including brief reviews and letters to editors), is worth reading<lb/>for its style and wit. I am therefore presenting here a handlist (following in<lb/>Carter’s tradition of handlist-writing) that will enable readers to find these<lb/>pieces. Carter published so prolifically (some 1500 items are known) in such<lb/>a wide array of venues that there are bound to be many items I have missed,<lb/>especially among his letters to editors. But what is here is a comprehensive<lb/>nucleus to which additions can be made. As Carter said in his handlist of<lb/>Stanley Morison, it is “intended to serve as a series of signposts now and as<lb/>a basis for amplification, correction and addition in the future.”<lb/>\nAs an introduction to the handlist, I shall attempt a brief assessment of<lb/>Carter’s achievement, which is a by-product of the overview provided by<lb/>the handlist. It is inevitably biographical to some extent; but the empha-<lb/>sis is on Carter’s writings, not his life, because a book-length biography<lb/>already exists: Donald C. Dickinson’s <hi rend=\"italic\">John Carter: The Taste and Technique of</hi><lb/></p>",
