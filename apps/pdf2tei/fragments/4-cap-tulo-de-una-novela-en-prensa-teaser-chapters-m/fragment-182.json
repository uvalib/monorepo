  "tei": "<pb n=\"176\"/>\n<p>tion of Huxley’s novel with Editorial Sur, it conveyed the unique opportunity<lb/>\nthat readers had to acquire “una obra de gran importancia” [a work of great<lb/>\nimportance].<sup>24</sup> The editors of <hi rend=\"italic\">Sur</hi> also stressed that this was the “primera traduc­<lb/>\nción [española] que aparece, pues el público no conoce aún más que la edición<lb/>\ninglesa” [first Spanish translation to appear since the public does not know any­<lb/>\nthing other than the English edition].<sup>25</sup> This particular tactic of emphasizing the<lb/>\nfact that no other Spanish-language version of a given work exists is one that<lb/>\nEditorial Sur employed frequently throughout the 1930s with great success.<sup>26</sup><lb/>\nSimilar to Huxley’s teaser chapters, the pre-publication chapter from Connolly’s<lb/>\n<hi rend=\"italic\">La tumba sin sosiego</hi> was prefaced by a lengthy two-page parenthetical note by<lb/>\nRicardo Baeza, the novel’s translator. Aside from providing a brief biography of<lb/>\nConnolly and details on his other works, Baeza mentions that the complete trans­<lb/>\nlation of his most recent novel (<hi rend=\"italic\">La tumba sin sosiego</hi>) “publicará en breve la<lb/>\nEditorial Sur” [will be published soon by Editorial Sur] (95). These two examples<lb/>\npoint to Ocampo’s meticulous attention to the promotion and marketing of her<lb/>\nbooks.<lb/>\nFor most of these titles, the pre-publication chapters appeared in <hi rend=\"italic\">Sur</hi> at least<lb/>\none to two months before their release as books by Editorial Sur. In this way,<lb/>\nreaders were made aware of forthcoming titles and given a preview of com­<lb/>\ning attractions with the hopes of building anticipation for the entire book. This<lb/>\nmarketing strategy makes sense given that over half of these works were the first<lb/>\nauthorized translations of foreign works available to readers in Latin America,<lb/>\nwhich also aligned with Ocampo’s overarching mission and, given their unique<lb/>\nstatus in the Spanish-language book industry, made their availability more de­<lb/>\nsirable. That said, there are a few outliers (nine in total) whose teaser chapters<lb/>\nappeared in <hi rend=\"italic\">Sur</hi> in the same month as their full-length book publication. The<lb/>\nvast majority of titles that fall into this camp of simultaneous publication are<lb/>\nthose by authors whose works appeared in Spanish and, as a result, did not re­<lb/>\nquire translation, namely Conrado Nalé Roxlo, Gabriela Mistral, José Bianco,<lb/>\nJuan Goyanarte, H. A. Murena, and Victoria Ocampo.<sup>27</sup> The only exceptions<lb/>\nare Alexandre Arnoux’s <hi rend=\"italic\">La cifra</hi>, which was published as a book with Editorial<lb/>\nSur in November 1955 and then excerpted in the January/February 1956 issue<lb/>\nof <hi rend=\"italic\">Sur</hi> (238: 87–90), and T. E. Lawrence’s <hi rend=\"italic\">Siete pilares de la sabiduría</hi>, which was<lb/>\npublished as a book with Editorial Sur in September 1944 and then excerpted in<lb/>\nthe October 1944 issue of <hi rend=\"italic\">Sur</hi> (120: 35–54). Given Ocampo’s interest in promot­<lb/>\n<lb/>\n<sup>24.</sup> “Un capítulo de <hi rend=\"italic\">Eyeless in Gaza</hi>,” <hi rend=\"italic\">Sur</hi> 29 (1937): 47.<lb/>\n<sup>25.</sup> “Un capítulo de <hi rend=\"italic\">Eyeless in Gaza</hi>,” 48.<lb/>\n<sup>26.</sup> The colophons for many international works produced by Editorial Sur during these<lb/>\nyears highlight the status of these books as the first Spanish-language translation authorized by<lb/>\nthe author (e.g., Aldous Huxley, <hi rend=\"italic\">Contrapunto</hi> [1933], <hi rend=\"italic\">Con los esclavos en la noria</hi> [1937]; D. H.<lb/>\nLaw­rence, <hi rend=\"italic\">Canguro</hi> [1933], <hi rend=\"italic\">La virgin y el gitano</hi> [1934]; André Malraux, <hi rend=\"italic\">La condición humana</hi><lb/>\n[1936]; Virginia Woolf, <hi rend=\"italic\">Un cuarto propio</hi> [1936], <hi rend=\"italic\">Orlando</hi> [1937], <hi rend=\"italic\">Al faro</hi> [1938]; James Joyce,<lb/>\n<hi rend=\"italic\">Desterrados</hi> [1937]; etc.). The advertising flyers inserted in <hi rend=\"italic\">Sur</hi> to announce forthcoming<lb/>\nworks from Editorial Sur praised the novelty of their Spanish-language translations. Take, for<lb/>\ninstance, the flyer for Joyce’s <hi rend=\"italic\">Desterrados</hi> that boldly states that “DESTERRADOS no ha sido traducido aún a<lb/>\nningún otro idioma; es por lo tanto una primicia más de SUR” [EXILES has not been trans­<lb/>\nlated into any other language; it is therefore another first for SUR].<lb/>\n<sup>27.</sup> Aside from these authors, the works of León Chestov, Ramón Fernández, and Joseph<lb/>\nJean Lanza del Vasto also appeared with simultaneous publications in <hi rend=\"italic\">Sur</hi> and Editorial Sur.<lb/>\n</p>",
