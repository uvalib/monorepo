The <lb/>\ncorrection to page 103 made in the first Cambridge impression evidently did <lb/>\nnot seem adequate to Carter, for in the second impression he deleted the <lb/>\nBoswell reference entirely (shortening the page by one line, accommodated <lb/>\nby a larger space in the mid-page section division).<lb/>\nPrivate Libraries Association subedition, with an epilogue:<lb/>\nLondon: Private Libraries Association, 1970. xiv,242 pp. Cloth, dust-jacket.<lb/>\nAdditional dedication to S.

Dedicated to “S.M.” and “M.S.”<lb/>\n(Stanley Morison and Michael Sadleir). In an inscribed copy (listed in Ulysses<lb/>\nBookshop catalogue 13 [1992], item 104), Carter wrote below the eight-line<lb/>\nLatin dedication, “The only work in Latin of John Carter.” (But he also wrote<lb/>\na Latin dedication for his Morison handlist, A:1950.)

On a letter of thanks from Morison to Carter, 15 June 1950<lb/>\n(laid in), Carter noted: “a longer and more specific dedication was provided<lb/>\n(at the printer’s request) for the majority of copies.” In a fuller account for<lb/>\n<hi>The Book Collector</hi> (<hi>Morisonianum</hi>, D:1965, Autumn), Carter gave the text<lb/>\nof the longer dedication: “EDVARDO / HVNC PATRINI SVI / SCRIPTORIVM CATALOGVM / A PATRE EXCVSVM / DICAT EDITOR”.<lb/>\nHe also explained that the shorter dedication was his original and preferred<lb/>\none and that he asked the printer to use it for a few copies after the main<lb/>\n",
