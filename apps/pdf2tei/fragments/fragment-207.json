New tailpiece to <hi>To Burlington</hi>, <hi>Works II</hi> folio.</head>\n  <figDesc>An engraving of the ornamental tailpiece used in Pope’s <hi>Works II</hi> folio edition of <hi>To Burlington</hi>, showing two lines of verse above a central cartouche bearing the Burlington arms, flanked by wreathed roundels containing heads in profile, surmounted by the Garter motto.</figDesc>\n  <!-- Image link to be added during image export workflow -->\n</figure>\n<p>\nto prepare for the presentation of his father’s arms at the end of <hi>To Arbuthnot</hi>,<lb/>\nwhere it constitutes a conclusion to his argument and self-presentation. Although<lb/>\nthe Burlington ornament lacks the putti as supporters, Kent has again substituted<lb/>\nhis own ideas. Burlington’s funerary monument at Londesborough church shows<lb/>\nthe same shield but the supporters are a rampant lion and a dog.45 Here in the<lb/>\n<hi>Works</hi>, where the supporters should be, are wreathed roundels containing heads<lb/>\nin profile. Pope’s poem celebrates Burlington’s publication of <hi>Palladio’s Designs of</hi><lb/>\nthe Baths, Arches, Theatres, &amp;c. of <hi>Ancient Rome</hi>, that is, <hi>Fabbriche antiche disegnate da Andrea Palladio Vicentino</hi> (1730), and Kent balances Andrea Palladio on the left<lb/>\nwith Inigo Jones on the right, just as the outer staircase at <hi>Chiswick House</hi> does,<lb/>\nwith statues.46 Burlington, very much the aristocrat, takes his place at the centre<lb/>\nof a trio of architects, their status as artists balanced by his authority as a scholar.<lb/>\nAlthough the image of Jones bears some resemblance to the much-copied portrait by Van Dyck in the Hermitage, that of Palladio bears closer resemblance<lb/>\nto Kent himself.47<lb/>\n45. There is a good image (accessed 22 March 2024) at http://www.britainexpress.com/<lb/>\nattractions.htm?attraction=4631<lb/>\nThe Burlington arms are illustrated in simplified form in Guillim, <hi>Art of Heraldry</hi>, after p.<lb/>\n104, no. 32. Kent includes the motto of the <hi>Order of the Garter</hi> (<hi>Honi soit qui mal y pense</hi>)<lb/>\nto reflect Burlington’s knighthood in the order (June 1730).<lb/>\n46. Toby Barnard and Jane Clark (eds.), <hi>Lord Burlington: Architecture, Art and Life</hi> (London:<lb/>\nHambledon Press, 1995), figs. 1a and 1b.<lb/>\n47. The National Portrait Gallery has many engravings based on Van Dyck, of which<lb/>\nNPG D28334 is typical, while Kent is in his familiar turban in NPG 1557.<lb/>\n",
