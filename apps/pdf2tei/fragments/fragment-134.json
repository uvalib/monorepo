The last has given you more trouble than I ought<lb/>to have subjected you to. It is very precious to me, and I am thankful to you for it.”21<lb/>Comparing the 1823 and 1815 catalogs reveals that their entries match exactly<lb/>(though in a different order), with no additions and only very few apparently ac-<lb/>cidental deletions. Accordingly, the Trist catalog could not have been produced<lb/>without a copy of the 1815 printed catalog on hand. But while Gilreath and Wil-<lb/>son interpret the “manuscript” catalog Jefferson cites here to be the manuscript<lb/>copy that Trist made (i.e., the 1823 Trist catalog), we believe that Jefferson instead<lb/>refers to his original 1783 manuscript catalog.</p>\n\n<p>The manuscript catalog returned by Trist was, Jefferson writes, “precious to<lb/>me.” It is unlikely that a manuscript copy of a printed catalog Jefferson owned in<lb/>triplicate would qualify as precious, however significant its arrangement.22 The<lb/>1783 catalog, on the other hand, was indeed precious, given its long tenure as<lb/>Jefferson’s primary reference tool and bibliophilic companion at Monticello; this<lb/>catalog was the only remaining record of a cherished collection of books that<lb/>Jefferson no longer owned. Equally suggestive, Trist observes to Jefferson in his<lb/>letter of October 18 that he is returning “your catalogue” and worries apolo-<lb/>getically that its “absence” had inconvenienced his soon-to-be grandfather-in-<lb/>law.23 The 1783 catalog, a working document for Jefferson’s library at Monticello,<lb/>would have been closely associated in Trist’s mind with Jefferson himself (hence<lb/>“your catalogue”), while the absence of a single copy of the 1815 printed catalog<lb/>(which reproduced Watterston’s alphabetical method of organization rather than<lb/>Jefferson’s own) would not have inconvenienced Jefferson.</p>\n\n<p>21.

See his letter to George Watterston on March 2, 1816: “I received three copies<lb/>of the Catalogue from mr Millegan for which I thank you” (Founders Online, National Archives,<lb/>https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/03-09-02-0366). One of these copies was<lb/>bound with the blank leaves that would become the 1823 Trist catalog, a second was likely<lb/>retained, and a third was sent to Joseph C. Cabell with a letter from Jefferson in which he<lb/>complains about the 1815 catalog’s alphabetical reorganization (“Thomas Jefferson to<lb/>Joseph C. Cabell, 2 February 1816,” Founders Online, National Archives,<lb/>https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/03-09-02-0286).</p>\n<p>23. “Nicholas Philip Trist to Thomas Jefferson, 18 October 1823,” Founders Online, National Archives, https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/98-01-02-3820.</p>",
