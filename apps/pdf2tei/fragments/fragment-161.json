The idea that Trist’s and Jefferson’s work on the 1823 catalog was\n<lb/>intended only to reconstruct a lost order for Jefferson’s books is not supported by\n<lb/>the catalogs that Jefferson penned or planned subsequently. Each of these later\n<lb/>lists is textually and formally related to Trist’s 1823 manuscript, tracing a line\n<lb/>of filiation from Jefferson’s original 1783 manuscript catalog through to the final\n<lb/>list sent to Cummings & Hilliard in June 1825. The newly uncovered evidence\n<lb/>supporting this filiation is not only textual, however. In a letter sent to Trist on\n<lb/>October 4, 1826, James Madison—then Rector of the University— offered\n<lb/>Trist the job of Secretary to the Board of Visitors and an additional $50 “in\n<lb/>consideration of yr. service in relation to the Catalogue for the Library.”<lb/>67\n<lb/>\n<note place=\"foot\" n=\"67\">“James Madison to Nicholas P.
