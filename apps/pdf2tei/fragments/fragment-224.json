She in turn left her books to her daughter<lb/>\nCharlotte Chauncy by her will, proved in 1841 (PROB 11/1940/325), but Charlotte<lb/>\nappears to have predeceased her, and the movement of the books within the<lb/>\nChauncy family for the next 46 years is unclear. In 1887, however, the barrister<lb/>\nand antiquary William Thorpe wrote a letter to the <hi>The Times</hi> about a completely<lb/>\ndifferent manuscript with a Chauncy provenance, in which he stated that ‘I am<lb/>\ninformed by the family solicitor, Mr. Teesdale ... that when the Chauncy collections<lb/>\nwere disposed of by ... Sotheby in 1790, the autographs were retained by<lb/>\nthe family, who have now sent them to the hammer’ (Times, 17 September 1887,<lb/>\n7; repeated in essentials <hi>The Times</hi>, 4 October 1887, 3). The solicitor in question, John<lb/>\nMarmaduke Teesdale, had married a Chauncy (see his obituary in <hi>Law Times</hi>, 16<lb/>\nJune 1888, 128), so he was in a good position to know the family history.</p>\n<head>II</head>\n<p>The catalogue of Sotheby’s sale of July 1887, to which Mack alludes so briefly,<lb/>\nincluded a series of lots headed ‘Pope (Alexander) Autograph Manuscripts, From<lb/>\nthe Library of the late Dr. Charles Chauncy’, and this series provides the fullest<lb/>\naccount of the set of manuscripts which had passed by inheritance through the<lb/>\ngenerations of the Chauncy family in the 111 years since Charles’s purchase in<lb/>\nApril 1776.12 The catalogue entries are transcribed here<lb/>\n(text to the right of the vertical line is right-aligned in the original) with notes<lb/>\non how each adds to our knowledge of the Richardson–Chauncy manuscripts of Pope;<lb/>\nprices realized and buyers are from the microfilm reproduction of the auctioneer’s<lb/>\ncopy in the British Library.13</p>\n<p>477 The <hi>The Essay on Man</hi>, with numerous MS.

The report of prices realized in <hi>The Athenaeum</hi>, no. 3120 (13 August 1887), 215, ‘omitted the odd shillings’ but otherwise agrees with the auctioneer’s copy. The <hi>The Times</hi>, no. 32139 (1 August 1887), 4, stated that the manuscripts ‘were catalogued separately, but it was agreed to sell them as one lot, and they were accordingly so put up and sold for ₤220 5s.’; this was indeed the total sum realized, and seven of the eleven lots did go to a single purchaser, but the account is obviously garbled.</p>",
