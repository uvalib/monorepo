  <head>John Carter: An Assessment<lb/>and a Handlist</head>
  <byline>
    <hi rend="italic">by</hi> <name type="pname">G. Thomas Tanselle</name>
  </byline>
  <p>
    John Carter was one of the most prominent and significant<lb/>
    figures in the Anglo-American book world in the twentieth<lb/>
    century. Indeed, he held a unique position, for he distinguished<lb/>
    himself as a bookseller, a collector, a scholar, and a writer, equally<lb/>
    at home and equally recognized on both sides of the Atlantic.<lb/>
    He created innovative rare-book catalogues for the Scribner Book Store;<lb/>
    formed several notable collections, especially of Catullus and Housman;<lb/>
    was a pioneer investigator of the bibliographical problems of nineteenth-<lb/>
    century publishers’ bindings; performed (with Graham Pollard) a classic<lb/>
    piece of bibliographical detection in uncovering the Wise-Forman forger-<lb/>
    ies; produced a scholarly edition of Sir Thomas Browne’s <title>Urne Buriall and<lb/>
    the Garden of Cyrus</title>; and wrote (or co-wrote or co-edited) several celebrated<lb/>
    works—<title>An Enquiry into the Nature of Certain Nineteenth Century Pamphlets</title><lb/>
    (1934), <title>Taste and Technique in Book-Collecting</title> (1948), <title>ABC for Book-Collectors</title><lb/>
    (1952), and <title>Printing and the Mind of Man</title> (1967).
  </p>
  <p>
    A record of his published writings is obviously a basic guide to his ac-<lb/>
    complishment. But such a record is also desirable for another reason that<lb/>
    would not apply to many people: nearly every piece he wrote, no matter<lb/>
    how small (including brief reviews and letters to editors), is worth reading<lb/>
    for its style and wit. I am therefore presenting here a handlist (following in<lb/>
    Carter’s tradition of handlist-writing) that will enable readers to find these<lb/>
    pieces. Carter published so prolifically (some 1500 items are known) in such<lb/>
    a wide array of venues that there are bound to be many items I have missed,<lb/>
    especially among his letters to editors. But what is here is a comprehensive<lb/>
    nucleus to which additions can be made. As Carter said in his handlist of<lb/>
    Stanley Morison, it is “intended to serve as a series of signposts now and as<lb/>
    a basis for amplification, correction and addition in the future.”
  </p>
  <p>
    As an introduction to the handlist, I shall attempt a brief assessment of<lb/>
    Carter’s achievement, which is a by-product of the overview provided by<lb/>
    the handlist. It is inevitably biographical to some extent; but the empha-<lb/>
    sis is on Carter’s writings, not his life, because a book-length biography<lb/>
    already exists: Donald C. Dickinson’s <title>John Carter: The Taste and Technique of
<pb n="2"/>
a Bookman</title> (2004). The biographical details selected for mention here and<lb/>
in the handlist (many of which do not appear in the Dickinson book) are<lb/>
those that seem to me most relevant for understanding the background<lb/>
and context of his writings and his wide influence. I knew John Carter for<lb/>
only the last ten years of his life: some of my recollections were written<lb/>
up in section 36 of my memoir, “The Living Room” (published in vol-<lb/>
ume 59 of <title>Studies in Bibliography</title> and then in <title>Books in My Life</title>, 2021), and<lb/>
I dedicated my book about book-jackets to his memory. I shall not forget<lb/>
the many kindnesses he showed me and the important favors he did for<lb/>
me, and the present offering is a reflection of my gratitude.<lb/>
<hi rend="smallcaps">ASSESSMENT</hi><lb/>
<hi rend="smallcaps">The 1930s</hi><lb/>
John Carter’s first post-collegiate publication on a bookish subject, an<lb/>
article on “Original Condition” in the 15 November 1930 issue of <title>Publishers’ Weekly</title>,<lb/>
came only three years after college and inaugurated an amaz-<lb/>
ing four-year period of brilliant productivity. Born John Waynflete Carter<lb/>
at Eton on 10 May 1905, he was educated at Eton and King’s College<lb/>
Cambridge, where he achieved a double first in the classical tripos and<lb/>
an honors degree in 1927. By that time he was already collecting Catullus<lb/>
and had become interested in textual criticism through the influence of A.<lb/>
E. Housman’s lectures. Almost immediately after leaving Cambridge he<lb/>
was hired (in September 1927) by the London office of Charles Scribner’s<lb/>
Sons to locate rare books to be sold in their New York shop. In the three<lb/>
years between then and that 1930 article, he was becoming acquainted<lb/>
with the book dealers and collectors both in Britain and in America (his<lb/>
first visit to New York being January to April 1929). But he was clearly do-<lb/>
ing more, for his first three letters to the <title>Times Literary Supplement</title> (in 1931-<lb/>
33) show that by then he was already immersed in research on Sir Thomas<lb/>
Browne, publishers’ bindings, and the pamphlets that became known as<lb/>
the Wise-Forman forgeries—the subjects of his first major publications<lb/>
(and of his early articles for the main book-collecting journals of the time,<lb/>
<title>The Book Collector’s Quarterly</title> in England and <title>The Colophon</title> in America).<lb/>
In May 1932 he published <title>Binding Variants in English Publishing, 1820-1900</title> as the sixth volume in Michael Sadleir’s important Bibliographia se-<lb/>
ries, which had the significant subtitle “Studies in Book History and Book<lb/>
Structure” (where “structure” makes clear the interest in bibliographical<lb/>
analysis). Sadleir, a publisher (Constable was his firm), novelist, and col-<lb/>
lector, had already established himself (he was sixteen and a half years<lb/>
older than Carter) as a bibliographical scholar and a pioneer historian<lb/>
of publishers’ bindings. He had published a bibliography of Trollope in<lb/>
1928 (a landmark through its explicit demonstration that an author bibli-<lb/>
<pb n="3"/>
ography can be a contribution to the history of publishing); and two years<lb/>
later <title>The Evolution of Publishers’ Bindings Styles, 1770-1900</title> came out as the<lb/>
first volume in his Bibliographia series. Carter’s admiration for Sadleir<lb/>
is suggested by a letter he wrote to <title>The Times</title> on 20 December 1957 to<lb/>
supplement <title>The Times</title>’s obituary of Sadleir: “None of those who moved<lb/>
in his orbit . . . was ever made to feel a satellite. But in our corner of the<lb/>
sky a star has fallen.” An “avowed disciple” of Sadleir (as he called himself<lb/>
in a 1970 article), Carter had been following Sadleir’s lead in investigat-<lb/>
ing edition binding; and he had published articles on the subject in 1931<lb/>
and 1932 that he was able to incorporate into his 1932 book. In the first<lb/>
chapter of that book, he modestly called it “a rather swollen appendix” to<lb/>
Sadleir’s book, but it is much more than that in several ways.<lb/>
First, the chapter called “Historical,” though it is a condensed ac-<lb/>
count of the beginnings and early use of cloth for bindings, draws on his<lb/>
own original research in publishers’ catalogues and trade journals. Sec-<lb/>
ond, the bulk of the first half is a detailed account of how to go about in-<lb/>
vestigating the bindings of nineteenth-century books and determining the<lb/>
order of variant bindings. He touches on the use of publishers’ records<lb/>
and catalogues, review copies, inscriptions, inserted advertisements, end-<lb/>
papers, and edge treatments, among much else, and he deals with such<lb/>
topics as special bindings, series variants, and bindings-up of parts, along<lb/>
with the description of cloth grains. The first half of the book (“General”),<lb/>
which also includes a “specimen investigation,” provides a “method of<lb/>
attack” that is then applied in the second half (“Particular”) to numerous<lb/>
books by some five dozen authors. This extensive survey of examples,<lb/>
based on the examination of an impressive number of copies, is yet an-<lb/>
other contribution of the book, making it useful for reference—and in<lb/>
the process displaying Carter’s cautious and undogmatic way of reaching<lb/>
conclusions.<lb/>
The book is addressed to “students and amateurs of book-structure”<lb/>
(p. xi), and Carter is concerned throughout to advance bibliographical<lb/>
study. He hopes to show “what an immensely important part of bibliog-<lb/>
raphy they [binding variants] become when they are taken seriously,” and<lb/>
he wants to help “develop a scientific method on general lines for dealing<lb/>
with so frequent a phenomenon” (p. 6). He makes clear that “the attitude<lb/>
of mind most desirable in a bibliographer is suspicion” (p. 39), and he<lb/>
stresses the necessity for examining multiple copies. His more specific<lb/>
observations on analyzing bindings form a perfect set of instructions for<lb/>
the beginner on how best to approach a nineteenth-century book: they<lb/>
have not been superseded, nor have they been stated in more attractive<lb/>
prose. Of the several pioneer studies of publishers’ bindings by Carter and<lb/>
Sadleir, this one is the most continuingly useful, still valuable as a guide.<lb/>
A few months after <title>Binding Variants</title>, another of Carter’s major pub-<lb/>
lications came out: his edition of Sir Thomas Browne’s <title>Urne Buriall and
<pb n="4"/>
the Garden of Cyrus</title> (originally published in 1658, with “Urne Buriall” as a<lb/>
subtitle to “Hydriotaphia”). It was a lavish production, elegantly printed<lb/>
by the Curwen Press and published (in an edition of 215 copies) by Cassell<lb/>
& Company with thirty drawings by Paul Nash (printed by collotype and<lb/>
colored by pochoir) and a morocco and vellum binding designed by him.<lb/>
This handsome book is regularly regarded as one of the masterpieces of<lb/>
twentieth-century book production—as, for example, in Martin Hutner<lb/>
and Jerry Kelly’s <title>A Century for a Century</title> (Grolier Club, 1999). But the work<lb/>
also makes a scholarly contribution to the study of Browne. Carter had<lb/>
been reading Browne since his Eton days, and by the early 1930s he was<lb/>
on the trail of author-corrected copies of the first edition (as his letter to<lb/>
the <title>Times Literary Supplement</title> on 16 July 1931 shows), while he was working<lb/>
on a new edition, at the request of Desmond Flower (of Cassell’s). He was<lb/>
able to locate and use six such copies before his edition came out, only<lb/>
two of which had previously been known. The thoroughness of his work<lb/>
is symbolized by his annotated copy of Edward H. Marshall’s 1929 Mac-<lb/>
millan edition: its leaves, mounted on larger paper, were interleaved with<lb/>
blanks, which were covered with his notes reporting collations, references,<lb/>
and critical observations (described in G. F. Sims catalogue 102 [1979],<lb/>
item 85). As he noted in his introduction, he had collated all editions be-<lb/>
fore 1800 and all published in Great Britain since then (though he does<lb/>
not mention collating multiple copies of the early editions).<lb/>
Carter’s editorial approach was admirable. Because the successive<lb/>
lifetime editions were unreliable, he based his text on the first edition<lb/>
and reported all his departures from it (except the correction of turned,<lb/>
dropped, or transposed letters), as well as the results of his collations.<lb/>
Aside from the adoption of Browne’s own corrections, the departures<lb/>
were few because he retained the punctuation and spelling of the first<lb/>
edition (except the long <hi>ss</hi> and the “sporadic” use of <hi>vv</hi> for <hi>uu</hi>). He correctly<lb/>
recognized that Browne’s “use of commas and semicolons, like his use of<lb/>
initial capitals and italics is too much a part of himself and his period to<lb/>
submit to this wholesale modernization [of earlier editors].” Nevertheless<lb/>
he did make an “irreducible minimum of corrections where the com-<lb/>
positor’s carelessness has produced intolerable obscurity.” Clearly there<lb/>
is room for disagreement here, for some of the obscurity may not have<lb/>
been caused by the compositor, and in any case what is intolerable is a<lb/>
subjective matter. But critical editing necessarily entails judgment, and<lb/>
these alterations are all recorded in the notes. The introduction ends with<lb/>
a gracious point not often made: although he has criticized earlier edi-<lb/>
tions, he says, “one cannot begin to criticize an edition until one has used<lb/>
it thoroughly, so that criticism becomes almost a proof of obligation.”<lb/>
On 2 July 1934, less than two years after the Browne edition, Carter’s<lb/>
third major publication appeared—the one that made him a book-world<lb/>
<pb n="5"/>
celebrity: <title>An Enquiry into the Nature of Certain Nineteenth Century Pamphlets</title>,<lb/>
written in collaboration with Graham Pollard, a bookseller with the firm<lb/>
of Birrell & Garnett. The story of how Carter and Pollard uncovered the<lb/>
Wise-Forman forgeries has been told often; indeed, it is one of the best-<lb/>
known episodes in bibliographical history, familiar to many people out-<lb/>
side the book world (as a result of such treatments as Richard D. Altick’s,<lb/>
in his 1950 book <title>The Scholar Adventurers</title>, and Dwight Macdonald’s, in a<lb/>
1962 <title>New Yorker</title> article, as well as Carter’s own accounts). Its wide appeal<lb/>
is understandable, as the story of two young booksellers who, through<lb/>
persistent research, were able to bring down a dominant and respected<lb/>
figure (for Thomas J. Wise was a distinguished collector and widely known<lb/>
book-world symbol, the author of many bibliographies, and a former<lb/>
president of the Bibliographical Society). It also has the elements of a de-<lb/>
tective story, with parts of a puzzle gradually, but inexorably, falling into<lb/>
place. And in the <title>Enquiry</title>, given the panache of Carter’s prose, the story<lb/>
was given a presentation that increased its appeal.<lb/>
Many of the people who are attracted to the story for all these reasons,<lb/>
however, do not recognize its important contribution to bibliographical<lb/>
scholarship. Identifying the perpetrators (which the book did not explic-<lb/>
itly do) is a different activity from proving that the pamphlets are indeed<lb/>
fraudulent. In the absence of explicit documents, the former involves<lb/>
circumstantial evidence, such as the fact that the suspected pamphlets<lb/>
entered the market from the stock of a single dealer (Herbert E. Gorfin).<lb/>
But the latter requires physical evidence from the items themselves. The<lb/>
use of such evidence for investigating books of earlier periods was well es-<lb/>
tablished by this time, but the bibliographical analysis of nineteenth- and<lb/>
twentieth-century books was in its infancy. The attention paid to “points”<lb/>
in modern books by collectors, dealers, and the writers of author bibliog-<lb/>
raphies was a form of physical examination, but it was often undisciplined<lb/>
and lacking in a concern for uncovering book-production history. Pub-<lb/>
lishers’ bindings, however, were beginning to be seriously studied, under<lb/>
the leadership of Sadleir and Carter. And the <title>Enquiry</title> took a major step<lb/>
forward in demonstrating ways in which the analysis of paper and type<lb/>
could also be applied to post-1800 books.<lb/>
It is possible that Carter’s collecting of detective fiction played a role<lb/>
in inspiring the analysis of paper reported in the <title>Enquiry</title>. He was certainly<lb/>
aware of the detective stories of R. Austin Freeman (discussed in his es-<lb/>
say in <title>New Paths in Book Collecting</title> as reaching “a new level in scientific<lb/>
detection”), and it is not unlikely that he knew “The Apparition of Burl-<lb/>
ing Court” (1923; collected in <title>The Puzzle Lock</title>, 1925). In that story, the<lb/>
detective, Dr. Thorndyke, proves a book to be fraudulent through several<lb/>
physical tests, the decisive one being a laboratory examination of the pa-<lb/>
per, which showed that the paper contained mechanical wood-pulp and<lb/>
<pb n="6"/>
esparto. Thorndyke stated that “esparto was not used until 1860,” which<lb/>
was twenty years after the purported date of the book. It turns out that the<lb/>
presence of esparto in the paper of some of the pamphlets that Carter and<lb/>
Pollard were investigating was the basis for proving them to be forgeries.<lb/>
(Although Dr. Thorndyke is not referred to, another fictional detective,<lb/>
Edgar Allan Poe’s Auguste Dupin, is cited as a precursor in a later chapter<lb/>
[p. 87].) Whether or not there was any connection with Dr. Thorndyke,<lb/>
Carter and Pollard used the same procedure: after having the papers of<lb/>
the pamphlets tested and determining the dates when esparto and chemi-<lb/>
cal wood-pulp were introduced into papermaking, they found that twenty-<lb/>
two of the pamphlets had printed dates that preceded the dates when their<lb/>
paper would have been available, and thus they were fraudulent.<lb/>
The authors were aware that their use of paper evidence was more<lb/>
groundbreaking than that of typographical evidence. The paper test, they<lb/>
said, “has not hitherto been applied to bibliographical purposes” (p. 42),<lb/>
whereas, in the opening sentence of the chapter on type, they call atten-<lb/>
tion to Robert Proctor’s work, decades earlier, identifying the printers<lb/>
of incunabula through the type designs. They also note that Proctor, a<lb/>
friend of William Morris, had in 1898 questioned (on the basis of its type)<lb/>
the Morris pamphlet that Carter and Pollard proved to be a forgery.<lb/>
The typographical tests they used throughout were proposed by Stanley<lb/>
Morison (they could hardly have had a greater typographical adviser).<lb/>
He noticed the kernless “f” and “j” and the tilted question mark used<lb/>
in many of the pamphlets; and these characteristics not only provided<lb/>
another dating test (based on the earliest use of a kernless font) but also<lb/>
led to the identification of the printer as Richard Clay & Sons (Clay had<lb/>
added that question mark to the font). The Clay firm was not involved in<lb/>
the deception: having been commissioned by Wise to print many facsimi-<lb/>
les for the Browning and Shelley societies, they had no reason to question<lb/>
the imprints and dates being placed on these other pamphlets. Carter and<lb/>
Pollard concluded that sixteen of the fraudulent pamphlets were definitely<lb/>
printed by Clay & Sons and that all the rest probably were.<lb/>
The analysis of paper and type is set out in chapters 4 and 5 with<lb/>
meticulous care and exemplary thoroughness. These chapters are part<lb/>
of the six that constitute part I, “Deduction,” tracing the story from the<lb/>
initial suspicion to the “proved conclusion.” In the last chapter of part I,<lb/>
the authors say, “With all its drudgery, detective work has a great intel-<lb/>
lectual fascination” (p. 93)—and this fascination has been conveyed to<lb/>
the reader. With the “machinery of detection” having been set forth, the<lb/>
authors move in part II, “Reconstruction,” to a description of the forger’s<lb/>
motivation, methods, and marketing strategies. Then comes the largest<lb/>
section of the book, part III, “Dossiers,” in which each of forty-six pam-<lb/>
<pb n="7"/>
phlets (by fifteen authors) is given a thorough account, reporting (among<lb/>
other things) the history of references to it, the location of known cop-<lb/>
ies, the results of tests, and a conclusion. The book as a whole not only<lb/>
demonstrates the use of certain paper and typographical tests in biblio-<lb/>
graphical analysis but also provides a model of how to draw conclusions<lb/>
cautiously and present the results responsibly.<lb/>
Another attraction of the book is its prose style. Although the book was<lb/>
a true collaboration between Carter and Pollard, Carter’s voice emerges<lb/>
plainly at many points, and some chapters are clearly his work, especially<lb/>
those in part II. The opening one, “The Modern First Edition Market,<lb/>
1885-1895,” is an expert survey of the development of interest in literary<lb/>
first editions (a preview of the more detailed account in <title>Taste and Tech-<lb/>
nique in Book-Collecting</title>), providing the necessary context for understand-<lb/>
ing why the kinds of pamphlets that Wise produced were sought after. It<lb/>
has many characteristic touches, such as this: “New vistas were opening<lb/>
before the collectors’ eyes, each with a glint of Eldorado at the end” (p.<lb/>
107). In “these feverish and speculative conditions,” Carter added, “it<lb/>
would have been almost surprising if there had not been some collateral<lb/>
descendant of Annius to perceive this golden opportunity. . . . At this time,<lb/>
the thing was, comparatively, easy money: the fish were rising, he [the<lb/>
forger] found (after a few experiments) the right fly, and they swallowed it<lb/>
with a regularity and unanimity which must have been to him exceedingly<lb/>
satisfactory” (pp. 108-09).<lb/>
The chapter on “Establishing the Pedigrees” shows Carter at his most<lb/>
skillful, for he convincingly points the finger at Wise without saying out-<lb/>
right that Wise created the forgeries (which could not be said, since the<lb/>
documentary evidence that later turned up—incriminating Harry Buxton<lb/>
Forman as well as Wise—was not known at that time). Wise could be<lb/>
criticized in other ways, however, especially for his supposed failure to be<lb/>
suspicious of the pamphlets, given the circumstances of their appearance<lb/>
and his bibliographical expertise. His behavior, Carter suggests, “savoured<lb/>
of Nelson with the telescope to his blind eye” (p. 134). Carter was unspar-<lb/>
ing in his condemnation of the “shocking negligence” of Wise (even though<lb/>
he had to call the forger “anonymous”) and of the resulting damage:<lb/>
Mr. Wise, by his credulity, by his vanity in his own possessions, by his dogmatism, by<lb/>
abuse of his eminence in the bibliographical world, has dealt a blow to the prestige<lb/>
of an honourable science, the repercussions of which will be long and widely felt. . . .<lb/>
Like the thirteenth stroke of a faulty clock, which discredits the accuracy of the hours<lb/>
which have gone before, the spuriousness of these books must inevitably cast asper-<lb/>
sions on many similar books which are, in fact, genuine. . . . If Mr. Wise, one of the<lb/>
most eminent bibliographers of our time, can be so extensively wrong, who can we<lb/>
be sure is right? (pp. 141–42)<lb/>
<pb n="8"/>
The <title>Enquiry</title> is a landmark of bibliographical analysis and the presentation<lb/>
of bibliographical evidence, and it is written in such a way that it is an<lb/>
enduringly readable story of detection.<lb/>
The three major books of 1932-34 were not Carter’s only significant<lb/>
publications of the early 1930s. In November 1934, four months after the<lb/>
<title>Enquiry</title> appeared, Constable (in London) and Scribner’s (in New York)<lb/>
brought out a volume of essays (planned by him and Michael Sadleir)<lb/>
that he edited, entitled <title>New Paths in Book Collecting</title>. There had of course<lb/>
been a number of books about book collecting during the previous forty<lb/>
years, but what made this one distinctive was that it consisted of essays<lb/>
by different writers, each taking up an appealing direction for collecting.<lb/>
The authors were drawn primarily from his and Sadleir’s circle of book-<lb/>
world friends, half of them dealers and half collectors: Carter (on “Detec-<lb/>
tive Fiction”), Sadleir (“Yellow-Backs”), P. H. Muir (“Ignoring the Flag”<lb/>
and “War Books”), Graham Pollard (“Serial Fiction”), David A. Randall<lb/>
(“American First Editions, 1900-1933”), Thomas Balston (“English Book<lb/>
Illustration, 1880-1900”), C. B. Oldman (“Musical First Editions”), and<lb/>
John T. Winterich (“The Expansion of an Author Collection”). When<lb/>
Carter commented on this book in 1948 (in <title>Taste and Technique in Book-<lb/>
Collecting</title>), he called it “only one instance of the responsible part taken in<lb/>
recent years by professional booksellers, not merely through their practi-<lb/>
cal influence exerted in the course of business but also by their contribu-<lb/>
tions to bibliophilic literature and propaganda, in the formulation and<lb/>
the exposition of theory, of policy and of practice in the book-collecting<lb/>
world” (Cambridge edition, p. 84). Here he was not only observing a de-<lb/>
velopment but also describing the path he saw for himself as a bookseller,<lb/>
one he faithfully followed.<lb/>
The title of the volume was not meant to suggest that the subjects<lb/>
discussed were entirely new, for some collectors were already focusing<lb/>
on them; but they were new in the sense that they were not traditional,<lb/>
and the purpose of the book was to call attention to, and encourage,<lb/>
the approach to collecting represented by these trends. It was the paths<lb/>
that were new, not necessarily the subjects: the book aimed not to “dic-<lb/>
tate” but “to suggest by means of examples” (p. 7). As Carter remarked<lb/>
in <title>Taste and Technique</title>, the volume was “one gambit” in the “general<lb/>
propagandist movement towards diversity of method” (p. 84). Through-<lb/>
out his career, Carter argued that collectors should think on their own<lb/>
and not simply repeat what earlier collectors had done. In the intro-<lb/>
duction to this volume, for example, he says that collectors should have<lb/>
“enough independence to dislike joining the herd movements which<lb/>
are always ploughing their way across the book market” (p. 6). The<lb/>
point is made several times in the opening pages through metaphor.<lb/>
For example:<lb/>
<pb n="9"/>
A collection of “high spots” may sound the chord of C major, which is indeed a fine<lb/>
and resounding noise; yet there are other and more subtle harmonies, the pleasantest<lb/>
of which are those which we evolve for ourselves. These are composed of notes which<lb/>
anyone can use and many have used, but by our own arrangement of them we can<lb/>
achieve a sound never heard before. (p. 11)<lb/>
Earlier, in a visual metaphor, he says that the coherence of such a collec-<lb/>
tion can reveal a “beautiful pattern” (p. 4). This newly revealed pattern,<lb/>
like the “sound never heard before,” makes a “contribution to knowl-<lb/>
edge” (a phrase used on the first page). Implicit in all the essays that<lb/>
follow (“essays in method,” he calls them), and often explicit as well, is a<lb/>
recognition that collecting is a form of historical study and that follow-<lb/>
ing new paths increases our understanding of the past. With this kind of<lb/>
grounding, <title>New Paths</title> remains one of the most perceptive and inspiring<lb/>
of introductory guides.<lb/>
Carter followed up on this book in two ways the same year. With<lb/>
Sadleir, he organized an exhibition “arranged to illustrate” <title>New Paths</title> at J.<lb/>
& E. Bumpus, accompanied by a substantial annotated catalogue; and for<lb/>
the Scribner Book Store he put together a catalogue on detective fiction<lb/>
(largely from his own collection). (In the next few years, he and David A.<lb/>
Randall, head of Scribner’s Rare Book Department in New York as of<lb/>
March 1935, publicized many more new paths in their catalogues.) His<lb/>
interest in publishers’ bindings also led to further contributions to their<lb/>
history in the form of two introductions to Elkin Mathews catalogues<lb/>
(1932) and two small books, <title>Publishers’ Cloth</title> (1935, in connection with<lb/>
an exhibition at the New York Public Library) and <title>More Binding Variants</title><lb/>
(1938, a supplement to his 1932 book).<lb/>
His editorial work also continued with editions of Housman’s <title>Intro-<lb/>
ductory Lecture</title> (1933) and <title>The Collected Poems</title> (1939) and an incomplete<lb/>
edition of Catullus (two fascicles only, 1934-35). (The <title>Collected Poems</title> was<lb/>
published without an editor’s name; but four years later, in the course of<lb/>
an article in the <title>Times Literary Supplement</title> on 5 and 12 June 1943, Carter<lb/>
revealed his editorship publicly.) These efforts, however, did not have the<lb/>
scholarly merit of the Browne edition. The Housman <title>Collected Poems</title>, to<lb/>
take the primary example, could have been a triumph; but it was hastily<lb/>
produced and involved faulty editorial judgments. Housman’s will autho-<lb/>
rized his brother Laurence to destroy some manuscripts and to oversee<lb/>
the use of the others; and Laurence in turn asked Carter (who had helped<lb/>
organize the manuscripts) to produce an edition of the poetry. The result<lb/>
was criticized, beginning in the autumn of 1952 (when the book was in<lb/>
its thirteenth impression), by two American scholars, Tom Burns Haber<lb/>
(Ohio State) and William White (Wayne State), leading to an acrimonious<lb/>
feud that erupted periodically in the pages of the <title>Times Literary Supplement</title><lb/>
(and, to a lesser extent, <title>The Book Collector</title>) over the next sixteen years.<lb/>
<pb n="10"/>
It started on 26 September 1952 in the <hi rend="smallcaps">TLS</hi> with a letter from White,<lb/>
using information from Haber, who had studied the Housman manu-<lb/>
scripts, beginning in 1950, much more thoroughly than Carter had.<lb/>
White’s letter, referring to Carter’s “slip-shod editing,” alludes to the<lb/>
two concerns that were the basis of their criticism: the outright errors<lb/>
in the text and the questionable judgment underlying the handling of<lb/>
uncanceled manuscript alternatives, where Carter followed the choices<lb/>
made by Laurence Housman in the poems included in his posthumous<lb/>
editions. Carter’s response (24 October 1952) was weak on both counts.<lb/>
Regarding the first, he said he had only claimed “a <hi rend="italic">more</hi> correct text.” As<lb/>
for the second, he asserted that “the person authorized to perform this<lb/>
[choice among variants] . . . was the author’s brother, whose judgment<lb/>
they [White and Haber] are not entitled to challenge.” Haber’s long letter<lb/>
on 7 November mainly described the history of the manuscripts and his<lb/>
work with them; and it was not until a year later (2 October 1953) that<lb/>
Haber, in a good letter summarizing the situation, made a proper reply<lb/>
to Carter’s second point. Carter, he said, “is speaking wildly when he<lb/>
says (of the poet’s brother) that consanguinity endows an editor with om-<lb/>
niscience when choosing between alternative readings in a manuscript.”<lb/>
Haber ends by regretting that the text “should be toyed with once again,”<lb/>
since the fourteenth impression, about to appear, was not to be a thor-<lb/>
ough revision.<lb/>
That fourteenth impression, “freshly corrected” according to Carter<lb/>
(23 October 1953), still contained errors that were noted by White (12<lb/>
February 1954), who also questioned Carter’s assertion that Housman’s<lb/>
will gave his brother the right to choose between variants. Despite Carter’s<lb/>
assurance (5 March 1954), White’s quotation from the will (14 May 1954)<lb/>
suggests that Carter was incorrect. But this point, of course, is a legal one<lb/>
and is irrelevant to a scholarly editor’s obligation to think through textual<lb/>
decisions independently. The debate was quiescent for the next five years;<lb/>
but during that time Haber’s <title>The Manuscript Poems of A. E. Housman</title> (1955)<lb/>
appeared, and it produced discussion in the <hi rend="smallcaps">TLS</hi> (1 July 1955; 15 June, 20,<lb/>
27 July 1956) and <title>The Book Collector</title> (4:110-14) that intensified the lack of<lb/>
civility between Carter and Haber—though the anonymous front-page<lb/>
<hi rend="smallcaps">TLS</hi> review of Haber’s book on 29 April 1955, one of the most severe at-<lb/>
tacks the <hi rend="smallcaps">TLS</hi> has ever published, was not by Carter but by his friend and<lb/>
occasional collaborator John Sparrow.<lb/>
The controversy over <title>The Collected Poems</title> revived again when Haber<lb/>
brought out a volume in 1959 called <title>Complete Poems: Centennial Edition</title> (from<lb/>
the same American publisher as <title>The Collected Poems</title>), which contained the<lb/>
same poems as Carter’s edition but with different texts. Carter asked (29<lb/>
May 1959) whether Haber had received authorization from the Housman<lb/>
estate, questioned a number of readings, and said that Haber’s textual es-<lb/>
<pb n="11"/>
say “follows the expectable line of quiet superiority.” After Haber replied<lb/>
(24 July 1959), Carter maintained that only his edition was authorized and<lb/>
that Haber was not qualified to “tamper” with the text; and he concluded<lb/>
his letter (14 August 1959) as follows:<lb/>
I am if anything more conscious to-day of the fallibility of my eyes and of my<lb/>
judgment than I was, thirty-odd years ago, when Housman lectured to us on textual<lb/>
criticism at Cambridge. Mr. Haber, as students of his writings must by now be well<lb/>
aware, is afflicted with no such humility. This puts him at an advantage in the pro-<lb/>
tracted controversy into which I have been, most reluctantly, drawn. But I am not<lb/>
sure that the advantage is shared by the poet and his readers, whom each of us is<lb/>
trying in his own way to serve.<lb/>
Haber’s <title>Complete Poems</title> was withdrawn after several impressions (follow-<lb/>
ing the English publisher’s insistence that it was unauthorized), and the<lb/>
debate over <title>The Collected Poems</title> finally ended almost a decade later, when<lb/>
White reported (11 January 1968) only three “trifling errors” in the latest<lb/>
impression (the correction of which he acknowledged on 1 October 1971).<lb/>
But since in the same issue (11 January 1968) Haber pursued his feud<lb/>
with Sparrow, Carter could not resist one more sarcastic retort (14 March<lb/>
1968). Reacting to Haber’s account of first looking into the manuscripts,<lb/>
Carter says, “It is as if stout Cortes had beheld the Pacific for the first<lb/>
time (except that Cortes, if Keats is to be believed, was silent).” And in the<lb/>
same letter Carter calls White “that indefatigable vigilante of Housman’s<lb/>
text.” The condescending tone was inappropriate, for Carter should him-<lb/>
self have been such a vigilante, having accepted the task of editing these<lb/>
poems. Nevertheless, his 1939 edition gave readers convenient access to<lb/>
the body of Housman’s poetry for the first time; and, in its successive revi-<lb/>
sions, it remained the standard text for many decades.<lb/>
Aside from his various book publications of the 1930s, Carter made<lb/>
important contributions to the book world during these years through his<lb/>
journalism and his participation in other activities that promoted com-<lb/>
munication among members of that world. His first book-related jour-<lb/>
nalism appeared in <title>Publishers’ Weekly</title>, as a result of his having become<lb/>
acquainted with its editor, Frederick G. Melcher, during his first trip to<lb/>
New York in 1929. At that time <title>Publishers’ Weekly</title> was a crucial journal<lb/>
for the antiquarian-book world as well as the new-book world through its<lb/>
inclusion of a department called “Old and Rare Books,” which provided<lb/>
substantial articles and reviews along with columns by Frederick M. Hop-<lb/>
kins (“Rare Book Notes”) and Jacob Blanck (“News from the Rare Book<lb/>
Shops”). Carter became a regular contributor, producing nearly seventy<lb/>
pieces (articles, reviews, letters) from 1930 through 1947, at which time<lb/>
the function of the rare-book section was taken over by a new periodical,<lb/>
<title>Antiquarian Bookman</title>. (<title>Publishers’ Weekly</title> did not forget its role in Carter’s<lb/>
<pb n="12"/>
career and offered one of the most informative biographical articles about<lb/>
him in its issue of 3 January 1953.) When, in the issue of 20 December<lb/>
1941, he looked back on his <hi rend="smallcaps">PW</hi> writings, he found “some couched in<lb/>
the intolerant language of youth, others in the autocratic style of middle<lb/>
age, but none of them expressing sentiments to which their writer would<lb/>
not still subscribe.” They include some of the best articles he ever wrote.<lb/>
At the same time Carter was playing a role in the creation of another<lb/>
outlet for book-world news, the back page of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Times Literary Supplement</hi>.<lb/>
Michael Sadleir was the prime mover in this endeavor: in early 1931 he<lb/>
convened a group of friends (including Carter, Pollard, Percy Muir, John<lb/>
Hayward, and Dudley Massey) to discuss with Simon Nowell-Smith, a<lb/>
new member of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Times</hi> staff, the possibility of expanding the cover-<lb/>
age of the book world on the <hi rend="smallcaps">TLS</hi> back page from the limited “Notes<lb/>
on Sales” it presently carried. This group, which became known as the<lb/>
“Biblio Boys,” continued (with an evolving membership) to have monthly<lb/>
dinners for many decades; it stands as a major example of the role that<lb/>
social connections and personal communication can play in the respon-<lb/>
sible development of a field (as glimpsed in Bertram Rota catalogue 290,<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">The Biblio-Boys</hi>, 1999). The earliest instance of the group’s influence was<lb/>
the invigoration of the <hi rend="smallcaps">TLS</hi> back page, which did become a widely fol-<lb/>
lowed forum for the antiquarian-book world. Carter was by far its most<lb/>
prolific contributor—and, beginning in 1946 during Stanley Morison’s<lb/>
editorship, its formally appointed supervisor, a position he kept (except<lb/>
during his Washington years, 1953-55) until 1967, when the bibliographi-<lb/>
cal page ceased to be a regular feature. He wrote about 700 reviews for<lb/>
the <hi rend="smallcaps">TLS</hi> between 1931 and the end of his life, along with some 300 other<lb/>
pieces (letters, articles, and notes, many of them amounting to additional<lb/>
reviews). His sensible and well-expressed views (which had a scholarly<lb/>
underpinning) were thereby given wide circulation. But the<lb/>
<hi rend="smallcaps">TLS</hi> policy of<lb/>
anonymity meant that most readers (those not privy to book-world gos-<lb/>
sip) were not aware that Carter’s was the dominant voice through which<lb/>
they were being provided with remarkably thorough coverage from the<lb/>
antiquarian-book world, including reports of auctions and exhibitions as<lb/>
well as reviews of bibliographical journals and books.<lb/>
Another product of the Biblio Boys’ conversations, though of much<lb/>
shorter duration, was <hi rend="italic">Bibliographical Notes & Queries</hi>, a periodical that<lb/>
Muir undertook to edit from the Elkin Mathews shop, beginning in Janu-<lb/>
ary of 1935. Carter did his part to make the journal succeed by furnishing<lb/>
a large number of queries and replies (many under pseudonyms), covering<lb/>
a wide range of topics, from publishing practices to specific books (often<lb/>
with substantial discussions). But the services to scholarship provided by<lb/>
the journal were not sufficiently used to allow it to continue past the May<lb/>
1939 issue. It was nevertheless a valiant attempt to promote the inter-<lb/>
<pb n="13"/>
change of ideas and information, a perennial concern of Carter’s circle<lb/>
of book-world friends. His own efforts—in reviews, notes, catalogue en-<lb/>
tries, talks, and conversations—took up a lot of his time, but they played<lb/>
a major role, through their ubiquity and style, in educating all kinds of<lb/>
participants in the book world. And they did not prevent his producing<lb/>
substantial scholarly work. In May of 1939, when <hi rend="smallcaps">BN&Q</hi> ended and he<lb/>
marked his thirty-fourth birthday, he could look back on a decade of im-<lb/>
pressive accomplishment, rarely equaled in bibliographical history.<lb/>
<hi rend="smallcaps">The 1940s</hi><lb/>
Carter’s role in the war effort began in September 1939, when he be-<lb/>
came a press censor for the Ministry of Information, serving as informa-<lb/>
tion secretary to the Minister, Brendan Bracken. His duties there allowed<lb/>
him to continue his work at Scribner’s (whose office at 23 Bedford Square<lb/>
was around the corner); but four years later, in November 1943, he was<lb/>
named director of the General Division of the Ministry’s New York office,<lb/>
called British Information Services, which necessitated his taking a leave<lb/>
of absence from Scribner’s. (In his New York position, which involved<lb/>
being supervisor of publications, he wrote in 1945 an anonymous and<lb/>
widely circulated pamphlet, <title>Victory in Burma</title>, intended to show, as he says<lb/>
at the outset, that Britain’s Burma campaigns “have been an integral and<lb/>
a vital part of the over-all Allied strategy in the war against Japan.”) His<lb/>
government service ended in October 1945; and at the beginning of 1946<lb/>
he was named managing director of Scribner’s London office, with new<lb/>
responsibilities added to his previous ones. It is understandable, therefore,<lb/>
that the pace of his writing in the 1930s could not be maintained in the<lb/>
1940s. But he did produce a major book and kept up his journalistic pres-<lb/>
ence, even adding two mass-circulation magazines, <hi rend="italic">The Atlantic Monthly</hi><lb/>
and <hi rend="italic">The Cornhill Magazine</hi>, to his outlets (having written some theater<lb/>
reviews for <hi rend="italic">The Spectator</hi> in 1940).<lb/>
His reviews and reports for <hi rend="smallcaps">Publishers’ Weekly</hi> in the late 1930s and<lb/>
early 1940s contain many moving references to the war. He begins his<lb/>
comment on the first volume of W. W. Greg’s drama bibliography this<lb/>
way: “This is the week of Hitler’s invasion of Holland, Belgium, Luxem-<lb/>
bourg and France. It is, therefore, a week in which the words ‘important’<lb/>
and ‘a major event’ sound a little odd when applied to a book.” Later in<lb/>
the same column, he notes the ending of <hi rend="smallcaps">Bibliographical Notes & Queries</hi> and<lb/>
adds, “Let us hope that it may revive, with other humane activities, when<lb/>
we reach that post-war world which now looks so much like a mirage”<lb/>
(15 June 1940). The title of another piece, “Bomb-Proof Bibliography”<lb/>
(21 October 1939), is explained at the outset: “When the newspapers<lb/>
are full of the war, and our sleep is constantly interrupted by air-raid<lb/>
<pb n="14"/>
warnings, it is comforting to turn, for a change of air, to these scholarly<lb/>
pages” (referring to Dorothy Blakey’s Minerva Press bibliography). In the<lb/>
spring of 1941 he could report, in reference to the Maggs shop, that “the<lb/>
nightingale is still singing in Berkeley Square—this year in the key of B<lb/>
minor” (19 April 1941).<lb/>
One of the high points of the war years for him, and one of the most<lb/>
emotional, was the occasion (7 July 1941) when he presented to Churchill<lb/>
the manuscript of Clough’s poem that Churchill had read in a radio broad-<lb/>
cast two months earlier; his charming account, in the issue of 2 August<lb/>
1941, is “Clough to Churchill.” On that occasion he also gave Churchill<lb/>
a copy of <title>Grim Glory</title>, the 1941 book of wartime photographs edited by his<lb/>
wife, for which he had composed the dedication to Churchill. (Five years<lb/>
earlier, on 26 December 1936, he had married Ernestine Fantl, a native<lb/>
of Savannah, Georgia, who was then the curator of architecture at the<lb/>
Museum of Modern Art.) The most memorable of all these pieces, “A<lb/>
Bookseller’s Day in London” (2 November 1940), reports that “it’s three<lb/>
weeks now since I went to sleep not hearing a German bomber some-<lb/>
where overhead”; and he wakes up to “the now all too familiar sound of<lb/>
the demolition squads shovelling piles of broken glass into trucks.” Instead<lb/>
of reading the morning papers he turns to a favorite essay by his great-<lb/>
great-uncle William Johnson Cory, “which makes me think of sanity and<lb/>
the classics and all the things I was brought up to respect.” His account of<lb/>
his day’s routine under wartime conditions is journalism at its best, vividly<lb/>
conveying the atmosphere of a particular time and place.<lb/>
Carter’s major book of the 1940s resulted from his being asked to de-<lb/>
liver the Sandars Lectures in Bibliography at Cambridge in 1947. Entitled<lb/>
<title>Taste and Technique in Book-Collecting</title>, the book was published on 26 July<lb/>
1948 by R. R. Bowker in New York (the publisher of <title>Publishers’ Weekly</title>)<lb/>
and, three months later (on 29 October), by Cambridge University Press<lb/>
in England. (The Cambridge edition is preferable, with its wonderful<lb/>
typography, its comfortable feel in the hand, and its old-fashioned use<lb/>
of recto running-titles, obviously written by Carter, that summarize the<lb/>
content of each two-page spread—this last a feature of the <title>Enquiry</title> also.<lb/>
For typographic excellence, the book was named one of the “Fifty Books<lb/>
of the Year” by the National Book League.) It is, in my opinion, Carter’s<lb/>
best book, and the best book about book collecting ever written. Although<lb/>
it has many devotees, it has nevertheless been overshadowed by several<lb/>
of his other books. The reason may be its title, which sounds like a how-<lb/>
to manual. But the book is actually a perceptive historical study of book<lb/>
collecting, along with an account of the role of taste and technique (that<lb/>
is, connoisseurship) in making it a serious scholarly pursuit. He states in<lb/>
the preface that it is “not a primer or a text-book or a manual for begin-<lb/>
ners” but rather “a somewhat ruminative treatise”— or, as he later says,<lb/>
<pb n="15"/>
an “advanced treatise of a general kind” (Cambridge edition, p. 107). And<lb/>
he begins the second part by describing what is to follow as “reflexions,<lb/>
not advice.” No one, he believes, “can learn how to collect from manuals<lb/>
or at second hand” (p. 91). Nevertheless, the book is full of well-reasoned<lb/>
observations, and anyone who takes them to heart will have acquired the<lb/>
best kind of preparation—not conveyed by instructions but by penetrat-<lb/>
ing insights born of wide experience and learning.<lb/>
The book is a <hi rend="italic">tour de force</hi>, or a series of such <hi rend="italic">tours</hi>, for each chapter<lb/>
is a showpiece. Elegant in structure, as in all other aspects, it is divided<lb/>
into two parts of six chapters each: the first part is called “Evolution”<lb/>
and the second “Method.” This pairing is not to be equated with “taste”<lb/>
and “technique,” because the latter two (for which we could substitute<lb/>
“temperament” and “approach”) run throughout the book as a unifying<lb/>
thread. The “Evolution” section is a marvelously rich account of nine-<lb/>
teenth-century British and American collecting (with a few glimpses of<lb/>
earlier centuries and the European continent)—rich both in the number<lb/>
of individuals cited and in the analyses of the patterns and motives they<lb/>
display (not forgetting the role of literary criticism). The second part,<lb/>
“Method,” includes chapters on “Tools and Terminology,” “Bookshop<lb/>
and Auction Room,” “Rarity” (the longest chapter and a particularly<lb/>
impressive one), and “Condition.” Even the discussion of reference books<lb/>
(in the first of these), is enjoyable; and although it is inevitably dated in its<lb/>
citations, it is still worth reading for its astute comments on categories of<lb/>
reference works. In the same way, the fact that the examples drawn on in<lb/>
every chapter have to be from before 1949 does not make the book seem<lb/>
dated, for they so thoroughly document a wide range of situations that<lb/>
one can see their applicability to any period. And the awesome profusion<lb/>
of examples, one of the hallmarks of the book, is an extreme demonstra-<lb/>
tion of the feats of memory attainable by attentive booksellers.<lb/>
The final chapter is appropriately on “Condition,” for a subcategory<lb/>
of that topic, “original condition,” turns up throughout the book: the pri-<lb/>
mary movement, after all, in the story that Carter tells of the evolution<lb/>
of book collecting is the growing concern with preserving books in their<lb/>
original condition. The earlier interest in possessing books in fine bindings<lb/>
began changing in the late nineteenth century, with Wise as a principal<lb/>
instigator, to an emphasis on the historical significance of original condi-<lb/>
tion. Carter’s investigations of nineteenth-century publishers’ bindings is<lb/>
an indication of his firm belief in the importance of such condition. If the<lb/>
published forms of books are relatively easy to define after the introduc-<lb/>
tion of edition-binding, they are not obvious for earlier books. From his<lb/>
first article, entitled “Original Condition: An Appeal to Reason” (1930),<lb/>
Carter continually argued for a “reasonable” approach to this question.<lb/>
By that he meant that a collector should not hold out for a copy in the un-<lb/>
<pb n="16"/>
bound or temporarily bound condition that occasionally survives; instead,<lb/>
one should be satisfied with a contemporary bound copy (which could be<lb/>
one of the copies originally offered for retail sale). For this period, in other<lb/>
words, original condition could refer to any of the forms that might have<lb/>
been encountered in a bookseller’s shop.<lb/>
His position is indeed reasonable, but when he writes on this subject,<lb/>
he is inclined to take one false step: to use, as a support for his point of<lb/>
view, the idea that boards or wrappers were “by intention ephemeral” (p.<lb/>
178), representing “the chrysalis stage of production” (p. 180). The print-<lb/>
er’s or publisher’s assumption that wrappers or boards would be replaced<lb/>
does not alter the historical fact that such a stage existed and is therefore<lb/>
worthy of attention. Carter does recognize the value of the bibliographi-<lb/>
cal evidence (as he always does), but there was no need to introduce, as<lb/>
if it were relevant, the presumed expectations of the producers of the<lb/>
books. To do so may be a consolation for collectors, but it is a rare lapse<lb/>
in logic for Carter.<lb/>
As usual, his prose is a delight (even though in the 1970 reprint he<lb/>
claimed to detect “a certain stylistic dandyism” in it). The book should be<lb/>
read slowly, so that each paragraph (and most of its constituent sentences)<lb/>
can be savored. The richness of the texture is created by—to name some<lb/>
of its elements—balanced syntax, precise but often surprising diction,<lb/>
striking metaphors, a profusion of proper names and italicized titles, a<lb/>
judicious sprinkling of foreign words (including untransliterated Greek),<lb/>
and an affinity for colons. One cannot help but think that his love of<lb/>
seventeenth-century prose, especially Thomas Browne’s, played its part.<lb/>
Dipping into the book anywhere is likely to pull up a memorable, and of-<lb/>
ten aphoristic, sentence, such as: “whenever expertise becomes an end in<lb/>
itself instead of the means to an end, it results in empty virtuosity” (p. 81).<lb/>
Or, on the fondness some collectors feel for books of their youth: this at-<lb/>
traction “often reflects the unpredictable influence of some miscellaneous<lb/>
shelf which the mere accident of propinquity at a receptive period has<lb/>
endowed with an unforgotten magic” (p. 72). Or, for a more extended ex-<lb/>
ample, dealing with one of Carter’s favorite, and most important, topics:<lb/>
And if I return now to individuality of taste and the variety of approach involved<lb/>
in breaking new ground—both healthy signs of originality, enterprise and intelli-<lb/>
gence—it is for the purpose of emphasising the importance of a sense of balance in<lb/>
the general structure. For although I have been, and remain, a proponent of idiosyn-<lb/>
crasy, a warm supporter of the unusual approach in book-collecting, I have detected<lb/>
in myself and have sometimes suspected among my book-collecting friends a ten-<lb/>
dency to a certain esotericism of taste which is analogous to, and is indeed sometimes<lb/>
allied with, that conscious virtuosity in technique to which I referred earlier. It is,<lb/>
equally with the other, a perfectly legitimate tendency in the sophisticated collector,<lb/>
as long as it is clearly recognised as such. But since it is the sophisticated collectors<lb/>
<pb n="17"/>
who most influence the unsophisticated, there is always a danger that their manner-<lb/>
isms, whether of taste or method, will be imitated (and usually exaggerated) while<lb/>
their underlying purpose remains unrecognised: just as many an architect who slaps<lb/>
on a swag here or a cupola there fondly supposes himself to be thereby qualifying for<lb/>
comparison with Wren or Brunelleschi. (pp. 88-89)<lb/>
The rhythms of this paragraph, the placement of its pauses, leading to-<lb/>
ward the summarizing simile, make it a characteristic performance.<lb/>
The personality that comes through is learned and humane—to use<lb/>
the adjectives that Carter applied on the first page to A. W. Pollard’s<lb/>
great essay on book collecting in the eleventh edition of the<lb/>
Encyclopaedia Britannica</title>. Carter’s scholarly temperament, and his consequent concern<lb/>
with history, are evident throughout, epitomized perhaps in his insistence<lb/>
that any “restoration” of a book be accompanied by a statement in which<lb/>
“the nature of the repairs made to it” are “recorded indelibly” (p. 185).<lb/>
He insisted that scholarly bibliographical analyses have “a strong claim<lb/>
on the attention of the average collector” (p. 114), and he recognized<lb/>
the role of collectors as scholars: “the ultimate value of the bibliophile<lb/>
to pure scholarship depends on his recognition as an active entity, not<lb/>
a mere appendix” (p. 99). In his discussion of Sadleir’s Bibliographia<lb/>
series, Carter observed that it was “marked by a scholarly appreciation<lb/>
of the importance of book-structure and publishing practice to the intel-<lb/>
ligent collector, whose acquiescence in this proposition was enlisted by<lb/>
being taken for granted” (p. 61). There could be no better description of<lb/>
Carter’s own book.<lb/>
The same mind is obviously at work in his journalism of the 1940s.<lb/>
For example, in reviewing J. D. Cowley’s <title>Bibliographical Description and<lb/>
Cataloguing</title>, he said, “The principles of bibliography are valid for books<lb/>
of all periods, and even the chronicler of a living author is the better for<lb/>
having learned how to collate an incunable” (<title>Publishers’ Weekly</title>, 16 March<lb/>
1940). And after the war, when he described the great Yale convocation<lb/>
of October 1946 to “mark the return of the University’s collections to<lb/>
peacetime use” (<title>Publishers’ Weekly</title>, 23 November 1946), he concluded his<lb/>
highly laudatory account with these important reflections:<lb/>
Objects—books, pictures, or bones—are part of the stuff of scholarship, of culture,<lb/>
of ideas. It is axiomatic that it is the duty of institutions to acquire, preserve and<lb/>
catalog them; generally agreed, though not everywhere achieved, that they should<lb/>
be readily available to those who need to study them; but much less often recognized<lb/>
that they require to be actively injected into the thoughts and studies of the academic,<lb/>
and also of the wider, world outside their glass cases. Every year museums and librar-<lb/>
ies get fuller and the problem of exploiting their resources more formidable. The<lb/>
methods by which this can best be done vary with the circumstances; but the amount<lb/>
of imagination and enterprise being devoted in this country [the United States] to<lb/>
making such collections as Yale’s not a mere adjunct but an integral and living part<lb/>
<pb n="18"/>
of the world of taste and scholarship is something of which Americans may rightly<lb/>
be proud.<lb/>
That these enlightened ideas, and others like them, were expressed in a<lb/>
journal with the wide readership (mostly nonbibliographical) of <title>Publishers’<lb/>
Weekly</title> was fortunate; and one cannot help regretting that Carter’s voice<lb/>
was not much heard there after the rare-book department was ceded to<lb/>
the <title>Antiquarian Bookman</title> in 1948.<lb/>
Two other publications of the 1940s deserve mention. In 1941, Carter<lb/>
and Brooke Crutchley (of Cambridge University Press) produced a re-<lb/>
vised edition of Harry G. Aldis’s 1916 <title>The Printed Book</title>. Although their<lb/>
edition is now superseded, it is significant for the role it played for a<lb/>
decade or two. Their contribution was to provide up-to-date coverage<lb/>
of the nineteenth-century revolution in book production, especially the<lb/>
introduction of publishers’ binding and new methods of printing and il-<lb/>
lustration. The book was one more element in Carter’s ongoing effort to<lb/>
promote the study of nineteenth-century books. And since it sold well<lb/>
(with reprintings occurring in 1947 and 1951), it served that purpose ef-<lb/>
fectively. At the other end of the decade, in 1948, another of Carter’s<lb/>
perennial concerns was represented in <title>The Firm of Charles Ottley, Landon &<lb/>
Co.</title> (the title-page authorship credited to Carter “with Graham Pollard”).<lb/>
As the subtitle indicated, it was a “footnote to <title>An Enquiry</title>,” proving four<lb/>
more pamphlets fraudulent and serving as the first interim report on the<lb/>
continuing investigation of the Wise-Forman forgeries.<lb/>
<hi rend="smallcaps">The 1950s</hi><lb/>
The next decade was one of dramatic change in Carter’s life. In early<lb/>
1953 Scribner’s closed most of its London operations, thus ending Cart-<lb/>
er’s quarter-century association with the firm (during which time he had<lb/>
made thirty-six Atlantic crossings). And in October of 1955 he happily<lb/>
joined Sotheby’s book department as a half-time associate, with special<lb/>
responsibility for being the American representative (a particularly appro-<lb/>
priate appointment since he already knew the American scene so well);<lb/>
this arrangement left him free to engage at the same time in independent<lb/>
consulting for collectors and librarians, an activity that extended the in-<lb/>
fluence of his ideas.<lb/>
During the two and a half years in between (from April 1953 to Oc-<lb/>
tober 1955), he was based at the British Embassy in Washington as the<lb/>
personal assistant (with the rank of Counsellor) to the British ambassador,<lb/>
Sir Roger Makins (a service for which he was later named Commander of<lb/>
the Order of the British Empire). He was a perfect choice, with his wide<lb/>
knowledge of the United States and his elegance in manner and dress as<lb/>
<pb n="19"/>
well as in speaking and writing. The job had a large social component,<lb/>
and Carter and his wife greatly enjoyed this period of their lives. (In her<lb/>
entertaining and perceptive 1974 autobiography, <title>With Tongue in Chic</title>, she<lb/>
says, “The Washington years were golden years.”) The flavor of their<lb/>
Washington life is suggested by a thank-you note from T. S. Eliot written<lb/>
on 22 May 1955, after a luncheon party at the Carters’ Georgetown house<lb/>
(quoted from R. M. Smythe auction catalogue 157, 13 November 1996,<lb/>
lot 412, with one correction):<lb/>
Dear Ernestine<lb/>
I can’t leave Washington without writing to thank you & John for your hospitality<lb/>
- for a delicious lunch beautifully served in perfect surroundings and in a company<lb/>
at once distinguished and sympathetic. And if you were leaving Washington in the<lb/>
autumn for any other destination than London, I should say how sorry I was not to<lb/>
be able to look forward to a similar occasion next year.<lb/>
Yours gratefully<lb/>
Tom Eliot<lb/>
The glamorous life implied here (or “glittering,” as Ernestine called it) was<lb/>
not an unaccustomed one for the Carters: given the connections Carter<lb/>
had made through the international world of collecting and the fact that<lb/>
Ernestine had been, before the move to Washington, an influential fash-<lb/>
ion journalist with the English <title>Harper’s Bazaar</title> (becoming Women’s Editor<lb/>
of <title>The Sunday Times</title> on their return to London, and later Associate Editor),<lb/>
their combined circle of celebrity acquaintances was impressive, as was<lb/>
their entertaining. I have remarked in the past on the interdependence<lb/>
of all parts of a person’s life and on how the scholarly (or bibliographical)<lb/>
and the social nourish each other. One illustration of this point that I have<lb/>
used is the life of Mary Hyde, and it happens that the Hydes were New<lb/>
York friends of Carter. When Carter was setting up a New York office for<lb/>
Sotheby’s, Donald Hyde provided space and secretarial help in his law<lb/>
firm’s financial-district premises at 61 Broadway. Carter’s writings, no less<lb/>
than his bookselling activities, benefited from the knowledge and contacts<lb/>
furnished by his full social life.<lb/>
Eighteen months before Carter began at the embassy in Washington,<lb/>
he delivered one of the Windsor Lectures at the University of Illinois<lb/>
and produced for that occasion a landmark essay, “Some Bibliographical<lb/>
Agenda”—agenda, that is, for the study of nineteenth-century English<lb/>
books, which was the subject of this lecture series in October 1951. (The<lb/>
essay was published the next year in a volume that included the essays<lb/>
by the other two lecturers that year, Gordon N. Ray and Carl J. Weber;<lb/>
Carter also selected it for his 1956 collection, <title>Books and Book-Collectors</title>.)<lb/>
In his essay, Carter set the stage for future work: after summarizing the<lb/>
revolutionary changes in book production in the nineteenth century that<lb/>
<pb n="20"/>
complicate bibliographical research on books of that period and after<lb/>
outlining what little work had been done, he focused on a few of the<lb/>
complicating features, such as cancels, binding variants, and inserted ad-<lb/>
vertisements. His comments, as always, are grounded in an understanding<lb/>
of the importance of printing and publishing history for bibliographical<lb/>
analysis and description.<lb/>
At the time, Fredson Bowers’s <title>Principles of Bibliographical Description</title><lb/>
was a relatively new book, having been published at the very end of<lb/>
1949; but Carter had absorbed it, and he ended his essay with a gener-<lb/>
ally shrewd assessment. He was sympathetic, of course, with Bowers’s<lb/>
conception of bibliography as historical scholarship, and he welcomed<lb/>
Bowers’s efforts to systematize work on modern books. But he correctly<lb/>
noted that Bowers’s lack of experience (at that time) with nineteenth- and<lb/>
twentieth-century books weakened his treatment of them, which showed<lb/>
“signs of the rigidity natural to a cautious man operating in comparatively<lb/>
unfamiliar territory.” One result, as Carter recognized, is that Bowers<lb/>
inappropriately extended to the period of publishers’ bindings the idea<lb/>
that only the sheets (and not the binding) of a book could be a determi-<lb/>
nant of issue. The one place where Carter slipped up was when he said<lb/>
that Bowers’s collation formula might be “unnecessarily elaborate” for<lb/>
nineteenth-century books, seemingly not recognizing that the formula<lb/>
was not elaborate for books with a simple structure and that the for-<lb/>
mulary had to be prepared to handle complex structures, which many<lb/>
nineteenth-century books certainly do have. But if we make allowance<lb/>
for this misjudgment, we can still read the essay with profit for its many<lb/>
helpful insights and its point of view.<lb/>
About a year after Carter delivered this lecture, his <title>ABC for Book-<lb/>
Collectors</title> (1952) was published—the book that has proved to be his most<lb/>
famous one. It has sold well throughout the English-speaking world for<lb/>
several generations and is now in its ninth edition (having been sensitively<lb/>
revised several times since his death by Nicolas Barker, most recently<lb/>
with Simran Thadani). The book was not the first glossary of book-world<lb/>
terms: a well-established one, <title>The Bookman’s Glossary</title>, had been published<lb/>
in 1926 by R. R. Bowker, the publisher of the American edition of Carter’s<lb/>
<title>Taste and Technique</title>, and was in its third edition in 1952. Carter’s concern<lb/>
with improving it had been shown in a letter noted in <title>Publishers’ Weekly</title> on<lb/>
11 August 1945; but the <title>Glossary</title> was geared more toward librarians and<lb/>
publishers than collectors and dealers, and the <title>ABC</title> was, as Carter says<lb/>
in his preface, the first “to deal comprehensively with the terminology of<lb/>
this particular subject and no other.” He benefited from the advice of an<lb/>
impressive group of consultants, enumerated in the preface as “a sort of<lb/>
Tenth Legion,” and the result was a remarkably thorough treatment. It<lb/>
included not only terms one encounters in dealers’ catalogues and basic<lb/>
<pb n="21"/>
concepts of collecting (such as “condition”) but also standard reference<lb/>
books and fundamental points of bibliographical analysis.<lb/>
Indeed, Carter’s recognition of the essential role of bibliographical<lb/>
scholarship in collecting is a notable feature of the book. One learns, for<lb/>
example, about formes and collations, the bibliographical meanings of<lb/>
“sheet” and “signature,” and the importance of distinguishing integral<lb/>
from inserted advertisements. And the information is sound, as when he<lb/>
emphatically states that collations are necessary for modern books. He<lb/>
even brings up press figures, clearly summarizing the current knowledge<lb/>
of them and then adding, “The bibliographers have not made much out<lb/>
of them yet. But they will.” The only place I have found in the first edition<lb/>
where Carter slips up seriously is when he says that valuing dust-jackets<lb/>
is “a matter of taste,” noting that Morris L. Parrish, “one of the greatest<lb/>
sticklers who ever lived,” threw them away; he should simply have said<lb/>
that Parrish was wrong. (The reference to Parrish was deleted twenty<lb/>
years later, in the fifth edition.) Another distinguishing characteristic of<lb/>
the book is that its advice is conveyed in the entertaining prose that was by<lb/>
then well-honed. Commenting on the undiscriminating citation of author<lb/>
bibliographies (at the end of the entry for “Bibliography”), Carter says,<lb/>
The judicious collector soon learns that verdicts are not infallible just because they<lb/>
are in print; that the cry of “Not in Prism” should excite him only if Prism’s book<lb/>
both claims to be comprehensive and has some reputation for accuracy; but that as<lb/>
long as others continue to cherish a variant or issue canonised by however incom-<lb/>
petent a bibliographer, so long will booksellers continue to cite even an incompetent<lb/>
bibliography rather than none at all.<lb/>
And the long entry on “Rarity” begins this way (with what is probably the<lb/>
most quoted passage in the book):<lb/>
Rarity is the salt in book-collecting. But if you take too much salt, the flavour of the<lb/>
dish is spoiled; and if you take it neat it will make you sick. Similarly, those book-<lb/>
collectors who exalt rarity above any other criterion tend to develop third-degree<lb/>
bibliomania, which is a painful and slightly ridiculous ailment.<lb/>
It is easy to see why this book is such a pleasure to consult. The book<lb/>
world is fortunate to have a reliable source of basic information that has<lb/>
been, through its appeal, widely disseminated and influential.<lb/>
In 1958 Carter brought out a revised edition of Browne’s <title>Urne Buriall<lb/>
and the Garden of Cyrus</title>, marking the three-hundredth anniversary of its<lb/>
original appearance. As published by Cambridge University Press in a<lb/>
compact and attractive volume, it gave Carter’s text a much wider circu-<lb/>
lation than it had achieved in the limited edition of 1932, a not inconsid-<lb/>
erable service. And the two-page preface shows the skill and charm that<lb/>
Carter brought to the writing of such pieces. In his praise of Browne’s two<lb/>
<pb n="22"/>
great essays as “the perfected products of his maturity,” Carter displayed<lb/>
the maturity of his own prose:<lb/>
in <title>Urne Buriall</title>, the curious lore, the strange fantasies, the whimsical speculations,<lb/>
the extraordinary conceits, the relish for picturesque legend and equally picturesque<lb/>
reality, the fascination exerted on the author by bizarre historical and mythical fig-<lb/>
ures—all these jewelled elements, like the thousand small pieces of stained glass in<lb/>
a great rose window, are harmonised by Browne’s deeply reflective imagination, and<lb/>
patterned, with the most polished and elaborate artistry, into paragraph after para-<lb/>
graph of baroque magnificence.<lb/>
Carter was able to emend Browne’s text with a few further authorial<lb/>
corrections, drawn from six additional author-corrected copies that had<lb/>
become known since 1932 (bringing the total to twelve), as well as several<lb/>
other justifiable emendations.<lb/>
Otherwise, however, this edition is less desirable in three ways. First,<lb/>
Browne’s marginal references are omitted. Second, Carter reports that<lb/>
“a quarter of a century’s reflection has convinced me of the over-severity<lb/>
of my earlier reaction” against the modernizing of previous editors, and<lb/>
he therefore modernizes spelling and punctuation in a few places—in<lb/>
only a very few, fortunately, or so it seems (though one cannot be sure<lb/>
without a full collation, since these changes are not listed). Third, the<lb/>
short list of “Emendations in the Present Text” records only the emenda-<lb/>
tions to his 1932 text (except, that is, for the occasional modernizing of<lb/>
accidentals), and thus one does not have a complete list of emendations<lb/>
to the first edition, such as the one in his 1932 edition—“which,” he says,<lb/>
“was too elaborate to repeat in a reading edition and to which readers<lb/>
concerned with such things are referred.” But that earlier edition can be<lb/>
consulted only in rare-book rooms. And in any case, the idea of a “read-<lb/>
ing edition”—“for the general reader, not for the antiquarian or for the<lb/>
specialist”—is suspect. Ordinary readers are often interested in textual<lb/>
alterations; and when they are not, the presence of the information does<lb/>
not deter them from reading. That Carter continued to be concerned with<lb/>
Browne’s text is shown by his “working copies” of the two impressions of<lb/>
this edition, in which he marked eleven possible revisions in the first and<lb/>
eight corrections in the second.<lb/>
Carter’s other publications of the 1950s were mostly useful contin-<lb/>
uations of his long-standing enthusiasms: handlists of A. E. Housman,<lb/>
Stanley Morison, and William Johnson Cory (plus an edition of Cory),<lb/>
showing how valuable the handlist genre can be; and essays on book col-<lb/>
lecting, Wise, and publishers’ bindings, some of them in the new journal<lb/>
<title>The Book Collector</title>. He also continued to produce reviews steadily and to<lb/>
write occasional biographical accounts and obituaries, primarily (but not<lb/>
exclusively) of book-world figures. Two obituaries from <title>The Times</title> in this<lb/>
<pb n="23"/>
period display his prose in response to two contrasting personalities. Of<lb/>
Belle da Costa Greene, Morgan’s librarian, he wrote (19 May 1950):<lb/>
The elder J. Pierpont Morgan was a formidable and autocratic grandee, and not,<lb/>
one may suppose, an easy master. His librarian steadily enhanced his original confi-<lb/>
dence in her without sacrificing one jot of her own imperious temper, so that in her<lb/>
later years the posture of the autocrat came perhaps the more naturally to her. She<lb/>
was always direct, she was no respecter of persons, she could on occasion be high-<lb/>
handed; but in a world where dust settles as easily on persons as on things these are<lb/>
refreshing tactics.<lb/>
In his portrait of Wilmarth Lewis’s wife, he said (14 May 1959):<lb/>
She was Annie Burr Auchincloss; and the stamp of that aristocratic lineage was<lb/>
as plainly visible in her handsome presence as it was subtly perceptible beneath the<lb/>
charm and friendliness of manner which endeared her not merely to her own wide<lb/>
acquaintance but to hundreds of scholars, students and connoisseurs whom her hus-<lb/>
band’s dedicated passion for Strawberry Hill and its master continually drew into<lb/>
the Farmington orbit.<lb/>
These examples of Carter’s effectiveness in this genre can be duplicated<lb/>
from all parts of his career. The bookseller A. W. Evans, for example,<lb/>
“would dominate you by a combination of personal charm and an easy,<lb/>
urbane scholarship which endowed the transaction with an atmosphere<lb/>
of mutual privilege” (19 April 1943). And who besides Carter would have<lb/>
said that the death of the collector Louis H. Silver extinguished “a fire<lb/>
before which his many friends delighted to warm their hands” (5 Novem-<lb/>
ber 1963), or that there was an “ironically sad splendour” in the timing of<lb/>
the choreographer Andrée Howard’s death (20 April 1968)? (His writing<lb/>
about Howard reflects his love of ballet; his use of “sad splendour” may<lb/>
echo the title of Sadleir’s novel <title>Desolate Splendour</title>.)<lb/>
Two publications of 1956-57 serve to mark these years (when he was<lb/>
beginning work at Sotheby’s) as a turning point: one consolidated what<lb/>
had gone before, and the other looked forward. The first was a gathering<lb/>
of his essays called <title>Books and Book-Collectors</title> (1956), consisting of eighteen<lb/>
pieces written between 1934 and 1955 and including treatments of Wise,<lb/>
detective fiction, the study of nineteenth-century books, and collecting his-<lb/>
tory, along with eight biographical sketches and his amusing review of his<lb/>
own <title>ABC</title>. It is an appealing selection, which served to introduce new read-<lb/>
ers to his prose. And it preserved in book form essays that are otherwise not<lb/>
very accessible. (There are many more that deserve to be collected.) The<lb/>
other publication—the one that looked forward to his new life—was So-<lb/>
theby’s 213th Season, 1956-1957, a pictorial review of the season in pamphlet<lb/>
form, with an introduction by him. Carter initiated the idea of an annual<lb/>
review (which he edited for the first few years) in this modest fashion, and<lb/>
it evolved into the series of elaborate volumes called <title>Art at Auction</title>.<lb/>

<hi rend="smallcaps">The 1960s and 1970s</hi><lb/>
From the time he began at Sotheby’s in 1955, Carter was occupied<lb/>
with devising ways to bring American auction business to London, a task<lb/>
he was ideally suited for and very successful at accomplishing; and after<lb/>
1960, when Sotheby’s decided to open a full-time New York office with<lb/>
Peregrine Pollen as head, he was also helping to get that office established.<lb/>
His efforts to publicize Sotheby’s were coincidentally assisted by the three<lb/>
American lecture tours he was asked to make for the English Speaking<lb/>
Union in 1961-63. Another instance of his supporting the sale of art dur-<lb/>
ing this period (though without any mention of Sotheby’s) was a letter<lb/>
he wrote to <title>The Times</title> from New York (published 21 March 1962), which<lb/>
serves as a good illustration of his epistolary style:<lb/>
<q>
Everyone’s Business<lb/>
Sir,— To an Englishman at this distance the attitudes of Parliament, press, and<lb/>
public towards the Royal Academy seem (with the honourable exception of<lb/>
<title>The Times</title>) oddly governessy.<lb/>
The Academy, surely, is a society of gentlemen accountable, like any other club,<lb/>
to its membership and to the law of the land: but how to anyone else? It owns certain<lb/>
property; it has certain liabilities. Like many other clubs, it is a victim of the economic<lb/>
arithmetic of the 1960s. Some clubs raise the subscription: others charge more for<lb/>
whisky: others again let in cads. The Academy decides to sell a picture.<lb/>
Would even a member of Parliament, let alone any busybody who can spell<lb/>
Leonardo, presume to interfere publicly in the private affairs of the Athenaeum or<lb/>
White’s, of the Beefsteak or the Garrick? And if they did, would you, Sir, print their<lb/>
letters? I take leave to doubt it, while remaining<lb/>
Your obedient servant,<lb/>
John Carter<lb/>
</q>
Below his name, he gave his New York address as the Grolier Club, char-<lb/>
acteristically linking his location with the content of the letter (a practice<lb/>
that goes back to a 1930 letter in <title>Bookmart</title> about defining “first edition,”<lb/>
where he used the First Edition Club as his address).<lb/>
But all the travel and negotiations of these years (which he called<lb/>
“hectic” in a 1971 recollection) did not prevent his devoting a great deal<lb/>
of time and energy (in the early and middle 1960s) to the project that led<lb/>
to <title>Printing and the Mind of Man</title> (a title for which he was responsible). Carter<lb/>
played a major role, first as an active member of the Supervisory Com-<lb/>
mittee for a historical display (of which Stanley Morison was the “inspirer<lb/>
and foster-father,” as Carter put it) to be held in conjunction with the July<lb/>
1963 International Printing Machinery and Allied Trades Exhibition, and<lb/>
then as co-editor (with Percy Muir) of an expanded catalogue of books<lb/>
that were selected to show the impact of printing on intellectual history.<lb/>
<pb n="25"/>
The majestic volume that appeared in 1967 was designed by John<lb/>
Dreyfus (with title-page lettering engraved by Reynolds Stone) and printed<lb/>
at Cambridge University Press for publication by Cassell. The writing was<lb/>
equal to the design, with substantial commentaries produced by (in ad-<lb/>
dition to Carter and Muir) Nicolas Barker, H. A. Feisenberger, Howard<lb/>
Nixon, and S. H. Steinberg. Carter’s hand is evident throughout, though<lb/>
he was the sole author of only a few entries. (The entries are unsigned,<lb/>
but Muir indicated the authorship in a set of proofs, now at Cambridge<lb/>
University Library.) Carter wrote the commentaries on Maimonides,<lb/>
Shakespeare, Lewis Carroll, and Churchill and was the co-author (with<lb/>
Muir) of four others. The Churchill item (his speech of 20 August 1940)<lb/>
is the last of the 424 entries in the book. It is not surprising that Carter<lb/>
wrote this entry, given his admiration for Churchill (as shown by his 1941<lb/>
account of meeting him, mentioned above). In the entry, having cited the<lb/>
Gettysburg Address, he says, “Lincoln and Churchill were far more than<lb/>
a century apart in temperament, but they shared a genius for language.”<lb/>
He ends his commentary by noting that Churchill had “an eloquence that<lb/>
matched the hour.”<lb/>
The volume can be seen as an elaborate presentation of one of Carter’s<lb/>
“new paths”—not one taken up in <title>New Paths</title> but one that he and Randall<lb/>
had promoted at Scribner’s, as reflected in Carter’s 1938 catalogue on<lb/>
<title>Science and Thought in the Nineteenth Century</title>. But new paths can evolve into<lb/>
established paths, and <title>Printing and the Mind of Man</title> became a signpost for<lb/>
collectors, with “PMM” being cited in dealers’ descriptions, and it thus<lb/>
turned into the kind of list that Carter always advised collectors not to<lb/>
follow. And, like any selection, its choices were subjective, reflecting in<lb/>
this case an English-language bias. How comprehensive it is as a record<lb/>
of the writings that in printed form have affected Western civilization can<lb/>
be debated. But it remains a readable and well-informed guide to some of<lb/>
the monuments (many of them undebatable) of intellectual history.<lb/>
Aside from <title>Printing and the Mind of Man</title>, Carter’s principal publica-<lb/>
tions of the 1960s came at the beginning and end of the decade. First,<lb/>
in 1961, was a useful edition (with a graceful and informative preface) of<lb/>
Housman’s <title>Selected Prose</title>, which made more widely available some pas-<lb/>
sages from Housman’s celebrated prefaces to his Latin editions, as well<lb/>
as some of his other writings on textual criticism. (One may object to the<lb/>
way the prefaces were cut and also to two of Carter’s editorial practices:<lb/>
after reporting Housman’s concern for accuracy, he says that “minor vari-<lb/>
ations of typographical details [unspecified] have been accommodated<lb/>
to the style in current use at Cambridge”; and he also inserts six com-<lb/>
mas without noting precisely where these “temerities” occur.) Then in<lb/>
1968-70 a series of four “Working Papers” for a revised edition of the<lb/>
<title>Enquiry</title> were published as pamphlets in limited editions to be distributed<lb/>
<pb n="26"/>
by Blackwell’s. (The revision of the <title>Enquiry</title> that Carter and Pollard had<lb/>
worked on sporadically for decades never appeared; but in 1983 Nicolas<lb/>
Barker and John Collins brought out a supplementary volume, <title>A Sequel<lb/>
to “An Enquiry into the Nature of Certain Nineteenth Century Pamphlets”:<lb/>
The Forgeries of H. Buxton Forman and T. J. Wise Re-Examined</title>, bringing together<lb/>
all the Wiseian research that had accumulated.) One product of Carter’s<lb/>
New York life in the middle of the decade was a series of six charming<lb/>
pamphlets called “Halcyon Booklets,” financed by Mary Jean Kempner<lb/>
Thorne and published (with Carter as editor) between 1964 and 1966 un-<lb/>
der the imprint of the Halcyon-Commonwealth Foundation, which had<lb/>
been set up chiefly for this purpose. The series gave Carter an outlet for<lb/>
reprinting some favorite essays, such as Churchill’s “Iron Curtain” speech<lb/>
and William Johnson Cory’s “On the Education of the Reasoning Facul-<lb/>
ties,” a touchstone for Carter throughout his life.<lb/>
His other publications during these years (aside from reviews) con-<lb/>
sisted mainly of essays in exhibition catalogues on Wise and Housman<lb/>
and pieces for the <title>Antiquarian Bookman</title> and <title>The Book Collector</title>. A reminis-<lb/>
cent note, not surprisingly (and indeed appropriately), entered into some<lb/>
of these writings, such as those on collecting Catullus, detective fiction,<lb/>
and Housman. Two others should be noted. For the 1970-71 volume of<lb/>
<title>Art at Auction</title>, he wrote an essay on the early history of Sotheby’s in New York<lb/>
that he subtitled “Some Egotistical Reminiscences”: it is of absorbing in-<lb/>
terest for the study of bookselling history and of Carter’s biography. And<lb/>
when the Private Libraries Association in 1970 handsomely reprinted his<lb/>
<title>Taste and Technique in Book-Collecting</title>, he added as an “Epilogue” his presi-<lb/>
dential address to the Bibliographical Society, delivered on 18 November<lb/>
1969 and entitled “Taste and Technique in Book Collecting, 1928-1968.”<lb/>
These dates are significant, for they cover more than the twenty years<lb/>
since his book was first published and go back another twenty years to<lb/>
the beginning of his career. He is thus reflecting on his whole professional<lb/>
life, describing such changes (in which he played a part) as the growth<lb/>
of institutional collecting and of an interest in authors’ archives and the<lb/>
monuments of science and intellectual history. The essay is of a piece<lb/>
with the 1948 book in its prose style and its multiplicity of examples, but<lb/>
it is far more personal—as in the delightful five-page tour of the great<lb/>
assemblage of illustrious antiquarian bookshops in London during his<lb/>
time, with his incisive impressions of their proprietors. Although the piece<lb/>
ends uncertainly, with some apprehension as to how collectors will react<lb/>
to the new investigative techniques affecting author bibliographies, the<lb/>
preceding four pages show that Carter, as usual, had kept abreast of de-<lb/>
velopments in analytical bibliography. It does not seem unexpected that<lb/>
he would give this climactic position, in an essay on book collecting, to<lb/>
bibliographical scholarship.<lb/>
<pb n="27"/>
In the spring of 1970 Carter completed his term as president of the<lb/>
Bibliographical Society; and from the autumn onward, his life was domi-<lb/>
nated by health problems, including some small strokes. He died on 18<lb/>
March 1975, two months short of his seventieth birthday. During his last<lb/>
year he was awarded the Bibliographical Society’s Gold Medal, and two<lb/>
of his publications were tributes to Percy Muir and Graham Pollard, two<lb/>
friends with whom he had been closely associated since the late 1920s. I<lb/>
am glad that Lord Redcliffe-Maud, in his unpublished oration for Carter’s<lb/>
funeral at Eton on 5 May 1975, referred to Carter’s “unpatronising kind-<lb/>
ness to people younger (or less learned) than himself.” And it was equally<lb/>
important to mention his “extraordinary success in setting himself rigor-<lb/>
ous, incorruptible professional standards without ever losing his amateur<lb/>
status.” These, along with personal loyalty, were prominent among his<lb/>
defining characteristics.<lb/>
There are many reasons to remember John Carter. The first one I<lb/>
want to mention is his prose style—not that it is more important than his<lb/>
bibliographical contributions, but because it is basic to the role he played<lb/>
in bibliographical history as a communicator to a wide audience. And he<lb/>
does deserve attention as a writer. His prose, stylish and witty, is a joy to<lb/>
read, and once people start reading, they want to read more. That is why<lb/>
the <title>ABC</title> has sold so well: it is not simply consulted as a reference book but<lb/>
read all the way through, since one entry leads a person on to the next.<lb/>
Even people not particularly interested in the book world, when they are<lb/>
exposed to an essay of his, want to find another one. And in the process,<lb/>
of course, they learn something about books. Which brings us to his role<lb/>
as an educator. The impulse for a good deal of his writing, I think, was<lb/>
to educate—both the general public and his book-world colleagues, to<lb/>
set them on a sensible course of thinking about books as physical objects.<lb/>
(Sadleir, reviewing the <title>ABC</title> in <hi rend="italic">The Spectator</hi>, referred to Carter’s “quali-<lb/>
ties as an educator.”) That motive underlies not only the <title>ABC</title>, <title>Binding<lb/>
Variants</title>, <title>Taste and Technique</title>, and <title>Printing and the Mind of Man</title> but also the<lb/>
running commentary formed by his extensive journalism.<lb/>
Furthermore, he had the knowledge to be a generally reliable guide.<lb/>
He not only had the practical experience of examining thousands of books<lb/>
as a bookseller and a collector; he also had a thorough acquaintance with<lb/>
the history of his field and the literature of bibliographical scholarship,<lb/>
gained through reviewing many hundreds of books about books (it is hard<lb/>
to imagine that anyone has ever reviewed more of them). Occasionally,<lb/>
however, he faltered. His editions of Browne (the second one), Catullus,<lb/>
and Housman showed that he had not thought as carefully about textual<lb/>
criticism as he had about bibliophily and bibliography. Even in those<lb/>
areas, there were some minor missteps when he commented on original<lb/>
<pb n="28"/>
condition, the collation formula, and dust-jackets. But normally his judg-<lb/>
ments stand up well, as do his own bibliographical investigations. The<lb/>
study of nineteenth-century books has of course moved on from where<lb/>
he left it; but his <title>Binding Variants</title>, <title>More Binding Variants</title>, <title>Publisher’s Cloth</title>,<lb/>
and the <title>Enquiry</title> were pioneer efforts, demonstrating ways of focusing on<lb/>
physical evidence in nineteenth-century books. And his own principal<lb/>
collections remain intact, available to support further research: publish-<lb/>
ers’ bindings at the Bodleian, detective fiction and Housman at the Lilly,<lb/>
Catullus at Texas, and Cory at Eton.<lb/>
John Carter’s name was known to everyone in the English-speaking<lb/>
antiquarian-book world of the middle decades of the twentieth century.<lb/>
His presence was felt through his influential conversations and consulta-<lb/>
tions with collectors and dealers, librarians and scholars; his involvement<lb/>
with notable catalogues, important auctions, and celebrated transactions;<lb/>
his place on the boards of organizations and journals; his continuous<lb/>
reporting of bibliographical events and issues; his prolific reviewing of<lb/>
books, periodicals, and exhibitions; his lecturing to both scholarly and<lb/>
general audiences; and his authorship and editorship of innovative and<lb/>
fundamental publications. By means of these activities, he promoted in-<lb/>
ternational unity in the antiquarian-book world and publicized the inte-<lb/>
gral role of bibliographical scholarship in bookselling and book collecting.<lb/>
To have been the book-world voice for two generations, leaving a trail<lb/>
of informed and civilized commentary along with several classic works in<lb/>
admirable prose, is a considerable legacy.<lb/>

<hi rend="smallcaps">HANDLIST</hi><lb/>
This handlist of John Carter’s published writings is divided into five sections:<lb/>
(A) Books and Pamphlets. (B) Books and Pamphlets Edited. (C) Contributions to<lb/>
Books and Pamphlets. (D) Contributions to Periodicals, except the <title>Times Literary<lb/>
Supplement</title>. (E) Contributions to the <title>Times Literary Supplement</title>. In sections D and E,<lb/>
a letter preceding each entry indicates whether it is an article (A), an editorial (E),<lb/>
a letter to an editor (L), a note or query (N), an obituary (O), or a book or journal<lb/>
review (R). (Articles and notes can be long or short, and the distinction between<lb/>
them can sometimes be subjective.) Offprints of articles, often made available<lb/>
with printed wrappers (and sometimes with changed pagination), are not nor-<lb/>
mally noted; but a few inscribed by Carter are cited. Cross-references consist of<lb/>
a section letter followed by a year (and sometimes, for ease of reference, a month<lb/>
also). All items are signed “John Carter” except where otherwise indicated.<lb/>
Seven categories of material offer special problems, and my comments on<lb/>
them here are meant to supplement the entries for them in the handlist below:<lb/>
(1) Letters to Editors, 1927-75. Letters to editors formed an important genre<lb/>
of writing for Carter, and he was a prolific writer of them. They appeared in a<lb/>
wide range of journals, and I am well aware that there have to be a large number<lb/>
that I have missed, especially in some of the book-trade weeklies and some of the<lb/>
non-book-world periodicals. But many are here, offering a good sample of his<lb/>
epistolary style, providing a considerable amount of biographical information,<lb/>
and displaying the personality that the letters projected. For Carter’s many letters<lb/>
to the <title>Times Literary Supplement</title>, see the discussion in section E below.<lb/>
(2) Scribner Catalogues, 1927-53. Carter was employed by Charles Scribner’s<lb/>
Sons in September 1927 as the London representative for the Scribner Book<lb/>
Store in New York, with the responsibility for acquiring British and European<lb/>
continental books to be sold in the store’s Rare Book Department. The head of<lb/>
that department when Carter was hired was John C. Champion, who was suc-<lb/>
ceeded in March 1935 by David A. Randall, with whom Carter worked until<lb/>
Scribner’s London office was closed in 1953. Thus any of the approximately fifty<lb/>
catalogues issued by the Rare Book Department between 1927 and 1953 (or the<lb/>
nearly two dozen Rare Book Bulletins starting in 1939) could include entries<lb/>
written by Carter, especially for books that he had supplied. Beginning with his<lb/>
second trip to New York in early 1932, he worked closely with Champion and<lb/>
was responsible for a changed direction in the catalogues, now featuring books<lb/>
that reflected new approaches to collecting (an interest that resulted in 1934 in<lb/>
his anthology <title>New Paths in Book Collecting</title>). The first of these was <title>First Editions of<lb/>
Famous Adventure Stories, 1831-1922</title> (catalogue 92, November 1932), and another<lb/>
was <title>Detective Fiction</title> (catalogue 98, 1934); Carter wrote introductions to both. Af-<lb/>
ter Randall’s arrival, the collaboration was even closer, and still more innovative<lb/>
topics appeared. According to Randall’s autobiography, <title>Dukedom Large Enough</title><lb/>
(1969), Carter was responsible for catalogues dealing with the Modern Library,<lb/>
“science and thought,” and classical music (though of course he would have<lb/>
contributed to many others). There is sufficient evidence for including entries<lb/>
for sixteen Scribner catalogues and one Rare Book Bulletin in section B below,<lb/>
<pb n="30"/>
as pamphlets edited by Carter: catalogues 92 (1932), 94-95 (1933), 98 (1934), 100<lb/>
(1935), 112-13 (1937), 117 (1938), 119-21 (1938), 124 (1940), 131 (1945), 133 (1946),<lb/>
137 (1951), and 138 (1953) and bulletin 4 (1939). Other catalogues and bulletins<lb/>
may fall into this category as well (such as the undated and unnumbered 52-<lb/>
page catalogue, reproduced from typescript, of Conan Doyle material). Although<lb/>
Randall stated that he compiled <title>Familiar Quotations: A Collection of Their Earliest<lb/>
Appearances</title> (catalogue 102, 1935), it seems likely that Carter collaborated with<lb/>
him on the introduction. A blanket entry for all the Scribner catalogues and bul-<lb/>
letins from 1927 through 1953 is included in section C, as a way of representing<lb/>
the scattered entries and notes that he wrote for many catalogues over the years.<lb/>
(3) Double Crown Club Menus, 1933-36. A blanket entry for the delightful<lb/>
menus of this dining club of typophiles (of which Carter was president in 1946)<lb/>
is included in section B because Carter (elected to the Club in 1932) was secretary<lb/>
from 1933 to 1936 and can therefore be thought of as the editor of the menus<lb/>
during those years, each of which was designed by a different person (often a<lb/>
prominent book designer or artist). He designed two himself, numbers 38 (May<lb/>
1933) and 55 (April 1936); and he was the subject of a third, number 65 (February<lb/>
1938), which was for the meeting at which he spoke on “Cheap Reprints” (a talk<lb/>
printed in <title>Typography</title> for Winter 1938). Forty-eight of the menus from Carter’s<lb/>
own collection (ranging from 1924, when the Club began, to 1970, and including<lb/>
the two he designed) were listed in Potter Books catalogue 7 (May 1977). Carter<lb/>
was also one of the speakers who participated in the discussion of Stanley Mori-<lb/>
son at the November 1967 dinner, which resulted in a separate publication (see<lb/>
C:1968). A biographical entry for Carter is included in <title>The Double Crown Club:<lb/>
Register of Past and Present Members</title> (1949); and James Moran’s <title>The Double Crown<lb/>
Club: A History of Fifty Years</title> (1974) quotes from Carter’s witty reports on the meet-<lb/>
ings and is entered in section C.<lb/>
(4) Pseudonymous and Unsigned Contributions to <title>Bibliographical Notes & Queries</title>,<lb/>
1935-39. This journal resulted from conversations among the members of<lb/>
Michael Sadleir’s informal dining group (the “Biblio Boys”), who recognized the<lb/>
desirability of greater communication in the rare-book world. P. H. Muir (of El-<lb/>
kin Mathews Ltd.) was its editor from the start, in January 1935, with David A.<lb/>
Randall (of Scribner’s) joining him as “American editor” in October. Although<lb/>
members of the group did their best to support the journal through numerous<lb/>
contributions, many under pseudonyms, there was insufficient material for it to<lb/>
continue after May 1939. (At that point fifteen issues—four for 1935 designated<lb/>
as volume 1 and eleven, numbered as twelve, for 1936-39 as volume 2 —had<lb/>
been published, totaling 151 pages and containing 330 queries, with replies to<lb/>
many of them; Cordex “self-binding” cases, with gilt-lettered spines, for shelving<lb/>
each of the two volumes were also available.) Carter contributed 39 items using<lb/>
his own name, and some of his comments were substantial: for example, his notes<lb/>
on Thomas Gray’s <title>Odes</title> (in May 1936 and April and November 1938) amount<lb/>
to more than 2500 words, and those on Florence Nightingale’s <title>Notes</title> (October<lb/>
1935), a 1684 edition of Catullus (May 1936), and Melville’s <title>Typee</title> (February<lb/>
1937) are at least 750 words each. And the only two articles that appeared in the<lb/>
journal, written to fill out the last two pages of the last two issues, were his. He<lb/>
<pb n="31"/>
also contributed under several pseudonyms. In his own bound set of the fifteen<lb/>
issues (now in my collection), Carter wrote, “Among the pen names adopted by<lb/>
J.W.C. are Richard Gullible, Harriet Marlow, E. Schlengemann, George Wayn-<lb/>
flete, Milton A. Hellman.” He also identified “Harriet Marlow,” a name taken<lb/>
from Beckford’s fiction, as his in <title>Publishers’ Weekly</title> 140 (1941 [9 August]): 381.<lb/>
“E. Schlengemann” was the person from whom the British Museum bought its<lb/>
first copies of the forgeries (see the <title>Enquiry</title>, p. 145). It is surprising that “Richard<lb/>
Gullible” is in this list because that name was used by Richard Jennings in 1934<lb/>
for his series of six parodies (sent to Carter and Graham Pollard as letters) that<lb/>
came to be known as the “Gullible Papers”; Carter arranged for the printing of<lb/>
those leaflets, and his account is in <title>The Book Collector</title> 8 (1959): 182-83 (see also lot<lb/>
44 in the Sotheby catalogue of the Carter sale, 24 March 1976). But his listing<lb/>
of the name here means that the two items signed with this name in <hi>BN&Q</hi> can<lb/>
be assigned to him. Since he says that these five names were “among” the ones<lb/>
he used, there were certainly others. Percy Muir, in a letter to me on 5 April<lb/>
1978, said that “all the Carter aliases” in the journal were “Harriet Marlow,” “E.<lb/>
Schlengemann,” and “Holmlock Shears”; but he then named two more as “pos-<lb/>
sibles”: “Ignoramus” and “Michael Trevanion.” The latter is well established<lb/>
as a name used by Simon Nowell-Smith and can be ruled out. But if we accept<lb/>
“Holmlock Shears” (used once) and “Ignoramus” (used twice), we have seven<lb/>
names, and I have included items with all seven signatures in section D below<lb/>
(totaling 42 items). It is likely that there are still other pseudonymous contribu-<lb/>
tions by Carter, and some of the unsigned items might be his as well; to cover<lb/>
this possibility, section D also includes a blanket entry for such pieces at 1935-39.<lb/>
(5) British Information Services Pamphlets. From November 1943 through Oc-<lb/>
tober 1945, Carter was director of the General Division of British Information<lb/>
Services in New York (at 30 Rockefeller Plaza). One of his responsibilities was to<lb/>
oversee the preparation and production of the many BIS publications, including<lb/>
a large series of pamphlets intended for wide public distribution, as he explained<lb/>
in a detailed article about the BIS operation, “Publishing—But for Free,” in<lb/>
<title>Publishers’ Weekly</title> on 10 November 1945 (148: 2136-39). Any, or all, of the BIS<lb/>
pamphlets published during this period can be considered to have been edited<lb/>
by him, but his exact (and no doubt varying) involvement in them is not known.<lb/>
One that appeared soon after his arrival (and is mentioned in his 1945 article) is<lb/>
likely to have received particular editorial attention from him, given his admira-<lb/>
tion for Churchill: <title>Winston Churchill, Prime Minister: A Selection from Speeches Made<lb/>
by Winston Churchill during the Four Years That Britain Has Been at War</title> (December<lb/>
1943). The pamphlets dealt not only with the war but also with British life in<lb/>
general; other titles from these years include <title>Britain’s Industrial Cities</title> (1944), <title>Brit-<lb/>
ain’s Sea Power</title> (1944), <title>The British Commonwealth and Empire</title> (1944), <title>Fifty Facts about<lb/>
the Middle East</title> (1944), <title>Flying Bombs</title> (1944), <title>John Britain</title> (1944), <title>A Picture of Britain:<lb/>
Background of a People</title> (1944), <title>African Achievement</title> (1945), <title>Britain’s Future in the Mak-<lb/>
ing</title> (1945), <title>The British Merchant Navy</title> (1945), and <title>Miracle Harbor</title> (1945). To cover<lb/>
Carter’s editorial work on BIS publications, a blanket entry is included in section<lb/>
B at 1943-45. Only one of the BIS pamphlets, <title>Victory in Burma</title> (1945), is known<lb/>
to have been entirely written by Carter, and it is listed in section A.<lb/>
<pb n="32"/>
(6) Unsigned Commentary in <title>The Book Collector</title>, 1952-75. Carter’s set of <title>The<lb/>
Book Collector</title> is at the Library of Congress. There are well over a hundred places<lb/>
where Carter made some kind of marginal note (or put a question mark or excla-<lb/>
mation point in the margin), often for the purpose of questioning a statement or<lb/>
its wording; and there are about sixty places where he simply put a line or a check<lb/>
mark or an X in the margin. In only fourteen places did he indicate his author-<lb/>
ship of unsigned paragraphs in the “Commentary” (or “News and Comment”)<lb/>
section by writing his initials or “I drafted this” in the margin. There may be no<lb/>
distinction between these two kinds of annotation; but it is possible that “I drafted<lb/>
this” indicates later revision by someone else (though the result would probably<lb/>
still be primarily his writing). All fourteen are given entries in section D below.<lb/>
It seems very likely that he wrote still other unsigned paragraphs as well, and<lb/>
they are represented by a blanket entry for 1952-75. As for his pseudonymous<lb/>
contributions of notes and queries to <title>The Book Collector</title>, see the discussion above<lb/>
for <title>Bibliographical Notes & Queries</title>, since he continued to use the same pseudonyms<lb/>
in this revival of the function of the old journal.<lb/>
(7) Sotheby Catalogues, 1955-72. From October 1955, when Carter became an<lb/>
associate in the book department at Sotheby’s, until July 1972, when he retired,<lb/>
he was in a position to write up entries for inclusion in Sotheby auction cata-<lb/>
logues, and he occasionally did so. For example, Anthony Hobson told me that<lb/>
Carter gave him a hand in cataloguing Sydney Cockerell’s collection in 1956.<lb/>
And John Kerr and P. J. Croft identified for me several lots that were described<lb/>
by Carter: in the 1 December 1964 sale, lots 526 and 528; 6-7 December 1966,<lb/>
lot 611; 8-9 July 1968, lots 782-827 and 840; and 9-10 December 1968, lots 756-<lb/>
57a. He also catalogued the manuscript of Evelyn Waugh’s <title>Scoop</title> for the sale<lb/>
of 7-8 July 1969 and Lear’s <title>A Book of Nonsense</title> for the sale of 22 June 1970, and<lb/>
any lot of Housman material was probably catalogued by him. But according<lb/>
to Hobson and Kerr, he did not otherwise write many catalogue entries. I have<lb/>
included a blanket entry in section C for all the Sotheby catalogues from 1955<lb/>
to 1972, as a way of representing the scattered entries that he wrote over the<lb/>
years. Also entered in section C are a preface, an introduction, and a note of<lb/>
acknowledgment that have been identified as his in the catalogues for the Sadleir<lb/>
(1958), Silver (1965), and Diaghilev (1968) sales. There are two catalogues that<lb/>
have so far been identified as ones that Carter was entirely responsible for: those<lb/>
for the Pariser sale of Wiseiana on 4-5 December 1967 and for the Ewing sale<lb/>
of Victorian fiction on 12-13 October 1970; these catalogues are given entries in<lb/>
section B, as books edited by Carter.<lb/>
The basis for the attribution of other unsigned or pseudonymous publications,<lb/>
except for those in the <title>Times Literary Supplement</title>, is sometimes explained within the<lb/>
entries themselves and otherwise can normally be assumed to be the collections of<lb/>
press cuttings in the Eton and Cambridge University libraries. For the unsigned<lb/>
contributions to the <title>Times Literary Supplement</title>, see section E below.<lb/>
Finally, there are two other matters I must comment on. First is the question<lb/>
whether Carter wrote <title>The Fall of the Titan</title> (London: Lincoln Williams, 1934), a<lb/>
novel by “John Waynflete,” according to the title page. The authorship of this<lb/>
<pb n="33"/>
work has often been attributed to John Carter by collectors and library cata-<lb/>
loguers because his middle name was Waynflete and because he occasionally<lb/>
used “John Waynflete” as a pseudonym beginning in 1944 (having used “George<lb/>
Waynflete” from 1939 and “Waynflete” from 1940). Neither the content nor the<lb/>
stilted style of this sentimental anti-Labour novel suggests Carter’s authorship;<lb/>
but the idea has been proposed that it might have been written as a parody. The<lb/>
question is fully discussed in the appendix below. Since Carter’s authorship has<lb/>
never been proved or disproved (but seems unlikely), I am mentioning the book<lb/>
here rather than including it in the handlist.<lb/>
<lb/>
Second, during the time (April 1953 to October 1955) when Carter was the<lb/>
personal assistant to Sir Roger Makins, the British ambassador to the United<lb/>
States, he wrote some speeches and articles for Makins. A few of them, in the<lb/>
form of carbon-copy typescripts (annotated by Carter) and in published form<lb/>
(no doubt revised by Makins), are in the Carter collection at Eton. The extent to<lb/>
which Makins’s published articles reflect Carter’s ghostwriting is uncertain, and<lb/>
I have not included any of them in the handlist.<lb/>
<lb/>
I have collected Carter’s publications for many years, and that process has<lb/>
brought numerous items to my attention that I would not otherwise have known<lb/>
about. I have also drawn on the collections of Carter material at Eton College,<lb/>
King’s College Cambridge, the Cambridge University Library, the Bodleian Li-<lb/>
brary, the Library of Congress, the Lilly Library, the Grolier Club, the Harry<lb/>
Ransom Center, and the R. R. Bowker Company. There are many people to<lb/>
whom I owe a debt of gratitude. I wish first to acknowledge the generosity of A.<lb/>
S. G. Edwards, who has repeatedly alerted me to (and even provided copies of )<lb/>
many obscure items over the past forty years. He also read a draft of this essay<lb/>
and handlist, as did Nicolas Barker (who made helpful comments) and Michael<lb/>
Meredith (whose help included checking some material at Eton that I might not<lb/>
have seen on my visit there). In addition, I wish to record my indebtedness to<lb/>
the following individuals (many of them now deceased): Richard Bucci, Ernes-<lb/>
tine Carter, Sebastian Carter, Meghan Constantinou, P. J. Croft, Arthur Crook,<lb/>
Brooke Crutchley, Scott Ellwood, Basie Bales Gitlin, Harrison Hayford, Richard<lb/>

Reprinted (with a new title page) from The Colophon (D:1933, February), which had<lb/>
reprinted (with some added introductory paragraphs) the appendix (pp. 141-46) to<lb/>
Carter’s edition of Browne’s Urne Buriall (B:1932). In the copy in my collection<lb/>
(inscribed “ex dono authoris 1933”), Carter changed the printed date “MCMXXXII”<lb/>
to “MCMXXXIII” and (another matter of dating) revised the first line of page [7] by<lb/>
deleting “to be” and “shortly” from the statement that his Browne edition was “to be<lb/>
published shortly.” Cf. D:1966 (Autumn) and C:2003 for a later essay with the same<lb/>
title (the first four words of which are a quotation from the last chapter of Urne Buriall).<lb/>

An Enquiry into the Nature of Certain Nineteenth Century Pamphlets. By Carter and Gra-<lb/>
ham Pollard. London: Constable; New York: Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1934.<lb/>
xii,400 pp. Cloth, dust-jacket. Published 2 July 1934. 2000 copies printed,<lb/>
700 of them for America. Copies intended for American distribution have<lb/>
“$6.00” stamped at the top of the front dust-jacket flap. The four-page pro-<lb/>
spectus, which indicates that the book can be ordered for 15ss from Birrell<lb/>
& Garnett (where Pollard was a partner), states that the book “introduces<lb/>
scientific methods which have never before been applied to bibliographical<lb/>
problems of this period.” For Carter’s later writings on the Wise-Forman<lb/>
forgeries (some of them in collaboration with Graham Pollard), see especially<lb/>
“Thomas J. Wise and His Forgeries” (D:1945, February), “Thomas J. Wise<lb/>
and H. Buxton Forman” (E2:1946, June), The Firm of Charles Ottley (A:1948),<lb/>
“Thomas J. Wise in Perspective” (C:1959), the four Working Papers (A:1967-<lb/>
70), “How We Got Wise” (D:1970, March), and “Aftermath of An Enquiry” (in<lb/>
<pb n="35"/>
the 1983 reprint of the Enquiry listed below). Carter provided new material<lb/>
for Stephen Potter’s “The Clandestine Activities of Thomas J. Wise” on the<lb/>
BBC Third Programme on 28 May 1948 (repeated 10 and 31 August 1948);<lb/>
and he and Pollard discussed the forgeries on BBC Two on 12 November<lb/>
1966. Most of Carter’s papers relating to Wise are at the Harry Ransom<lb/>
Center (University of Texas, Austin).<lb/>
Haskell House subedition: New York: Haskell House, 1971. xii,400<lb/>

<title>Victory in Burma</title>. New York: British Information Services, July 1945. 32 pp. Pic-<lb/>
torial wrappers. Printed by Alco Gravure (Hoboken, N.J.). Unsigned. In the<lb/>
Eton copy, Carter wrote: “The facts and figures came of course from the<lb/>
Information Division of BIS; but this booklet was written single-handed dur-<lb/>
ing three or four days’ solitary confinement in our apartment in New York.<lb/>
I also selected the photographs, which I still think first-rate.” For Carter’s<lb/>
account of the publication program of British Information Services in New<lb/>
York (where he was in charge of publications from November 1943 through<lb/>
October 1945), see his “Publishing—But for Free” (D:1945, November). In<lb/>
that article he refers to <title>Victory in Burma</title> as one of the “popular pamphlets”<lb/>
dealing with the war but does not reveal his authorship of it. Given the huge<lb/>
numbers of these pamphlets that were printed, <title>Victory in Burma</title> must have<lb/>
been the most widely circulated of all Carter’s writings, with the possible<lb/>
exception of his <title>ABC for Book-Collectors</title> (A:1952). For further comment on<lb/>
his work for British Information Services, see the headnote to the handlist,<lb/>

<title>Taste and Technique in Book-Collecting: A Study of Recent Developments in Great Britain<lb/>

delivered on 17 and 24 November and 1 December 1947, with “some sub-<lb/>
stitution of transatlantic titles among the books cited as examples” (as Carter<lb/>
noted in the 1970 reprint). Dedicated to his wife. The four-page prospectus,<lb/>
<pb n="37"/>
indicating that the book could be ordered from Bowker for $5, notes that<lb/>
Carter’s work “is always eagerly awaited by fellow bookmen on both sides<lb/>
of the Atlantic.” According to Bowker records, 2000 copies were published<lb/>
on 26 July 1948. An advance extract from the last chapter (“Condition”)<lb/>
had been published in <title>Publishers’ Weekly</title> (also published by Bowker) on 22<lb/>
November 1947 (D:1947). On 8 June 1948 Carter wrote to Sol Malkin (edi-<lb/>
tor of <title>Antiquarian Bookman</title>), asking him to include, in the issue closest to the<lb/>
book’s publication date, a notice (in the “Sack Cloth and Ashes Department”)<lb/>
of an error in his discussion of a variant in Boswell’s <title>Johnson</title> (this letter is<lb/>
cited in Richard Cady catalogue 21 [1985], item 23). Then in early 1949,<lb/>
Carter arranged for an erratum slip to be printed, correcting this error: on<lb/>
page 98 he had said that the “gve/give” variant in Boswell’s <title>Johnson</title> is one of<lb/>
two examples of points that are “neither interesting nor significant”; the er-<lb/>
ratum slip notes that “the priority of the <hi>gve</hi> reading was long ago established<lb/>
by Prof. Pottle” in his bibliography of Boswell. A proof of this erratum slip,<lb/>
dated 1 February 1949, is in the Bowker files; a copy of the final slip, signed<lb/>
“J.C.” in print, is taped into the Rosenwald copy in the Library of Congress.<lb/>
By 7 November 1955, there were still 133 copies of the book unsold, and<lb/>
these were given to Carter.<lb/>
<hi>English (Cambridge University Press) edition:</hi> Cambridge: Cam-<lb/>
bridge University Press, 1948. xi,201 pp. Cloth, dust-jacket. Price 15s. 1500<lb/>
copies printed (according to a publisher’s dummy in the collection of Richard<lb/>
Landon). The Cambridge edition (a new typesetting) was published three<lb/>
months after the American edition, on 29 October 1948, according to a re-<lb/>
view copy in my collection. And the copy (also in my collection) that Carter<lb/>
gave to his friend Brooke Crutchley, the University printer, has an inscription<lb/>
(“for the printer from a completely satisfied author”) dated 26 October 1948.<lb/>
(The American preface is dated 1 December 1947, and the English preface<lb/>
is dated 21 July 1948, only five days before the American publication date.)<lb/>
Since the error that necessitated the erratum slip in the American edition had<lb/>
come to Carter’s attention by early June (see above), he was able to make a<lb/>
change during production of the Cambridge edition. A set of the Cambridge<lb/>
proofs in my collection, dated 5-6 May 1948 (with the title-page date of “194”,<lb/>
before the fourth digit was known), has the same erroneous text on p. 103 that<lb/>
the American edition has on p. 98. But the Cambridge edition as published<lb/>
in October has a revised text, with the passage altered in two ways. First, the<lb/>
cancels in Shelley and Conrad, which in the earlier text “produced a genuine<lb/>
distinction of issue,” now “make a proper bibliographical ‘point.’” Second,<lb/>
the Boswell example is attached to this sentence (“as does the misprint ‘gve’<lb/>
for ‘give’ on p. 135, vol. 1 of <hi>Boswell</hi>”), so that in the next sentence only some<lb/>
transposed lines in <hi>South Wind</hi> (and not the Boswell misprint) are “neither<lb/>
interesting nor significant.” The introduction was reprinted (condensed) from<lb/>
the English edition in <hi>Good Living</hi> (C:1948) and, from the American edition, in<lb/>
William Targ’s <hi>Bouillabaisse for Bibliophiles</hi> (C:1955); chapter 10 was reprinted<lb/>
(condensed) from the American edition as “Bookseller and Auctioneer” in<lb/>
<hi>The Atlantic Monthly</hi> (D:1948, July) and, from the English edition, as “Book-<lb/>
shop and Auction Room” in <hi>The Bookseller</hi> (D:1948, December); and chapter<lb/>
<pb n="38"/>
11 was reprinted (condensed) from the American edition as “Reflections on<lb/>
Rarity” in <hi>The New Colophon</hi> (D:1948, April). The tenth paragraph of chapter<lb/>
10 was quoted on the front cover of <hi>AB Bookman’s Weekly</hi> for 20-27 September<lb/>
1976 (58:1545). Second impression, with corrections: 1949. The correction<lb/>
to page 103 made in the first Cambridge impression evidently did not seem<lb/>
adequate to Carter, for in the second impression he deleted the Boswell<lb/>
reference entirely (shortening the page by one line, accommodated by a<lb/>
larger space in the mid-page section division).<lb/>
Private Libraries Association subedition, with an epilogue:<lb/>
London: Private Libraries Association, 1970. xiv,242 pp. Cloth, dust-jacket.<lb/>
Additional dedication to S. C. Roberts and Frederic G. Melcher. The text<lb/>
is that of the corrected English impression, with a “Prefatory Note 1970”<lb/>
(pp. xiii-xiv) and three pages (pp. 203-05) of “Corrections & Notes (1969)”<lb/>
added. The epilogue, “Taste and Technique in Book Collecting, 1928-1968”<lb/>
(pp. 209-42) was Carter’s presidential address to the Bibliographical Society<lb/>
on 18 November 1969. Second impression: 1972. Third impression: 1977.<lb/>
<title>The Firm of Charles Ottley, Landon & Co.: Footnote to An Enquiry</title>. By Carter<lb/>

as a paper to the Bibliographical Society [in November],” as stated in a<lb/>
“Prefatory Note” dated 25 October 1948. Dedicated to “S.M.” and “M.S.”<lb/>
(Stanley Morison and Michael Sadleir). In an inscribed copy (listed in Ulysses<lb/>
Bookshop catalogue 13 [1992], item 104), Carter wrote below the eight-line<lb/>
Latin dedication, “The only work in Latin of John Carter.” (But he also wrote<lb/>
a Latin dedication for his Morison handlist, A:1950.) Reissue with a leaflet of<lb/>
“Corrections and Additions” laid in: 1967 (leaflet date). [4],95 pp. See A:1967.<lb/>

<title>A Handlist of the Writings of Stanley Morison</title>. With notes by Morison and indexes<lb/>
by Graham Pollard. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press for private dis-<lb/>
tribution, 1950. ix,46 pp. Paper-covered boards, dust-jacket. Limited to 500<lb/>
copies. A tribute to Morison on his sixtieth birthday (6 May 1949). Laid into<lb/>
some copies is Morison’s eight-page <hi>Prolegomena ad Curriculum Vitae</hi> (Cam-<lb/>
bridge, 1949). Carter’s copy, with his bookplate, at the Library of Congress<lb/>
provides additional information. At the foot of the front free endpaper he<lb/>
wrote: “First copies bound 7 June for distribution to some of those attending<lb/>
at the Senate House, Cambridge, 8 June, for S.M’s Litt.D.” He also wrote<lb/>
on this endpaper: “There are two states of the dedication leaf: this is the<lb/>
second.” The dedication in this copy reads “EDVARDO / DIANAE FILIO<lb/>
/ VIATICVM”. On a letter of thanks from Morison to Carter, 15 June 1950<lb/>
(laid in), Carter noted: “a longer and more specific dedication was provided<lb/>
(at the printer’s request) for the majority of copies.” In a fuller account for<lb/>
<hi>The Book Collector</hi> (“Morisonianum,” D:1965, Autumn), Carter gave the text<lb/>
of the longer dedication: “EDVARDO / HVNC PATRINI SVI / SCRIPTORIVM<lb/>
CATALOGVM / A PATRE EXCVSVM / DICAT EDITOR”. He also explained<lb/>
that the shorter dedication was his original and preferred one and that he<lb/>
asked the printer to use it for a few copies after the main<lb/>
<pb n="39"/>
press run had been completed. Thus the second state as printed preserves<lb/>
the earlier version of the text. There is also a printed presentation slip (“with<lb/>
the compliments of the author and printer”) laid in Carter’s copy and an<lb/>
erratum slip stapled to the verso of the dedication leaf: “For MR MORI-<lb/>
SON, read DR MORISON, passim / (The edition of this erratum is limited<lb/>
to 25 copies)”. Although the book was not intended for public sale, Carter<lb/>
reported in his Book Collector piece that fifty copies in 1958, and twelve more<lb/>
in 1965, were sold to Elkin Mathews for sale to the public. For Carter’s later<lb/>

prospectus, indicating that the book could be ordered from Bertram Rota for<lb/>
15s and providing two specimen pages, contains prose that is characteristic<lb/>
of Carter: for example, the book is said to be “salted with well-distributed<lb/>

Ernestine Carter’s *Flash in the Pan* (C:1953). In the Harvard copy (and many<lb/>
others), on page [8], line 2, Carter crossed out “five” and wrote “six” in<lb/>
the margin (“five” is erroneous because six “deviations” are listed). In the<lb/>
Eton copy, there is a carbon typescript of Carter’s letter to Osbert Lancaster<lb/>
on 23 May 1963 (when the booklet was at the printer’s) with this sentence:<lb/>
“Its elegance (but not necessarily its chastity) would be greatly enhanced<lb/>
by a pocket-size portrait of the author’s heroine, preferably holding a mar-<lb/>
tini glass, to accompany the dedication.” The dedication is to the Countess<lb/>
of Littlehampton, one of Lancaster’s characters. Lancaster did provide the<lb/>
drawing.<lb/>

Carter’s authorship is established by material at the Lilly Library: his typescript<lb/>
and the letter from Carter to Randall, 27 July 1965, enclosing the typescript; in<lb/>

Catullus collection went to Texas).<lb/>

Its original title was “Child’s Guide to Paden,” as shown by a revised six-page<lb/>
typescript of an earlier version laid into the copy of the pamphlet that Carter<lb/>
labeled “working copy” and dated 18 February 1967 (in my collection). He<lb/>
marked this copy at seven places: on page 2, he put a short line in the margin<lb/>
by line 28, as he did by line 4 on page 4, by lines 16-18 on page 8, and by<lb/>
line 9 on page 12, and he put a longer line by lines 13-23 on page 23; he cor-<lb/>
rected a typographical error in line 31 of page 4 (“of” for “on”); and in the<lb/>
upper margin of page 11, at the head of the list of known copies of The New<lb/>
Timon, he wrote “20 Mch 1925 Anderson mixed sale 263 sewn uncut $36”.<lb/>

impression: July 1967. 200 copies for sale. In the copy of the second<lb/>
impression that Carter labeled “working copy” (in my collection), he wrote<lb/>
the numbers 8 and 11 on the front wrapper; on page 8 he put a line in the<lb/>
margin by lines 14-16, and on page 11 he marked for deletion the phrase “at<lb/>
the company” in lines 37-38 (a typographical error). Laid in is a photocopy<lb/>
of page 797 from Book Auction Records for 1936-37, with a line in the margin<lb/>
marking the entry for Tennyson’s The Cup and the Falcon and a note in the<lb/>

The Mystery of “The Death of Balder.” By Carter and Graham Pollard.<lb/>
Working Papers for a Second Edition of An Enquiry into the Nature of Certain<lb/>
Nineteenth Century Pamphlets no. 3 (January 1969). Oxford: Distributed for<lb/>
the authors by B. H. Blackwell, 1969. 21 pp. Wrappers. 200 copies for sale<lb/>
at one guinea. (In no. 4 [1970], the printing record states that 300 copies of<lb/>
no. 3 were for sale.) In Carter’s set of “working copies” of the four Working<lb/>
Papers (in my collection), this is the only one not marked “working copy”; it<lb/>
simply has Carter’s signature on the front wrapper. The first of its two anno-<lb/>
tations is “Todd dustjacket / 7i” in the upper right corner of the title page.<lb/>
The reference is to Thomas J. Wise: Centenary Studies, edited by William B.<lb/>
Todd (C:1959), the jacket of which is mentioned in the first sentence of this<lb/>
pamphlet. Carter may simply be calling attention to the fact that the jacket<lb/>
copy considers The Death of Balder a potential Wise forgery, whereas this<lb/>
Working Paper shows that it was not. The significance of “7i” is not clear,<lb/>
but possibly Carter wished to make a change (not necessarily connected<lb/>
with that jacket) in the footnote (numbered 1) on page 7. The only other<lb/>
annotation is on page 11, where he underlined “three years” and put a ques-<lb/>
tion mark in the margin.<lb/>

1970. 36 pp. Wrappers. 400 copies for sale at one guinea. In the copy that<lb/>
Carter labeled “working copy” and dated 22 December 1970 (in my collec-<lb/>
tion), he wrote on the title page, “except for pp. 30/32 mostly H.G.P.” (i.e.,<lb/>
Pollard); then on page 30 he marked as “JWC” the passage beginning with<lb/>
“We do not foresee”, and on page 32 he marked the end of the passage at<lb/>
the eleventh line.<lb/>

Vellum binding inlaid with morocco, designed by Nash. Limited to 215 cop-<lb/>
ies, priced at 15 guineas. Printed at the Curwen Press, overseen by Oliver<lb/>
Simon. The four-page prospectus (including a specimen of page 26) states:<lb/>
“One copy consisting of two volumes, the first <title>Urne Buriall</title> and <title>The Garden<lb/>
of Cyrus</title>, the second a portfolio of all Mr. Nash’s original drawings, both<lb/>
specially bound, at 350 guineas.” An indication of Carter’s research for<lb/>
this edition is offered by his copy of Edward H. Marshall’s 1929 Macmillan<lb/>
edition, interleaved with his extensive notes and the results of his collations<lb/>
of earlier editions (described in G. F. Sims catalogue 102 [1979], item 85).<lb/>
There is a set of proofs at the Grolier Club and another in my collection,<lb/>
with material in both cases relating to the preparation of the 1958 revised<lb/>
edition. My set, which is the earlier of the two, is a bound one that Carter<lb/>
gave to John Sparrow (who wrote his name and “d.d.editor” on the front<lb/>
free endpaper). On the half-title, Carter noted, “2nd proof corrected”, and<lb/>
he wrote “final proof ” on the divisional title for “The Garden of Cyrus”;<lb/>
he entered fourteen marginal revisions on five pages of the introduction and<lb/>
27 corrections on fifteen pages of “Urne Buriall.” Laid into the volume is<lb/>
a list of ten “proposals” for changes to be made in the text being prepared<lb/>
for the 1958 Cambridge edition—a list that was marked to be sent to Geof-<lb/>
frey Keynes, John Hayward, John Sparrow, and Jeremiah Finch (a Browne<lb/>
scholar at Princeton). The Grolier set (also bound, from Carter’s library) is<lb/>
designated as the final proofs on the spine and incorporates in the printed<lb/>
text all of the changes entered in the margins of my set. It does contain nu-<lb/>
merous marginal revisions and corrections, but they are for the 1958 edition,<lb/>
and they include all but one of the proposed changes on the list laid into my<lb/>
set. (The one not included consists of three alterations in the passage begin-<lb/>
ning at line 12 on page 74: “their” for “the” before “true”, “or” for “of ”<lb/>
after “ours”, and “contrive” or “contain” for “continue”.) The fortunes of<lb/>
the 1932 edition after publication were partly told in a letter from Desmond<lb/>
Flower (of Cassell’s) to Geoffrey Keynes on 8 February 1965 (the copy sent<lb/>
to Carter is at the Grolier Club). Upon publication, only 29 copies were sold<lb/>
at the original price of fifteen guineas (owing to the Depression), and soon<lb/>
afterward 37 sets of sheets were sold to the Redfern Gallery. In 1941 Cas-<lb/>
sell’s premises at La Belle Sauvage, an old Ludgate Hill coaching inn, were<lb/>
destroyed by German bombs, and 20-30 bound copies were lost. But some<lb/>
sets of sheets (possibly close to a hundred), having been stored in a subsidiary<lb/>
warehouse, were spared. Many of these were made available to the Folio<lb/>
Society, which was licensed to sell them in a binding with Nash’s original<lb/>
designs. In an advertisement headed “Treasure Trove” in <title>The Book Handbook</title><lb/>
for June 1951 (2.2:x), the Folio Society announced the availability of cop-<lb/>
ies bound by Sangorski & Sutcliffe, in a slip-case, for twenty guineas. The<lb/>
<pb n="45"/>
price had gone up to £36 by 1965, when sets of sheets were still available<lb/>
for binding to order. The “Appendix” (pp. 141-46) was reprinted, with some<lb/>
added introductory paragraphs, as “The Iniquity of Oblivion Foil’d” in<lb/>
<title>The Colophon</title> (D:1933, February) and as a separate (A:1933); the last chapter was<lb/>
reprinted as a separate by the Rampant Lions Press (B:1946).<lb/>
<hi>Revised edition:</hi> Edited by Carter, with a “Preface” (pp. vii-viii) and<lb/>
appendixes (pp. 115-20). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1958.<lb/>
viii,120 pp. Cloth, dust-jacket. 3000 copies. The copy that Carter inscribed<lb/>
to his aunt, Faith Compton Mackenzie (in my collection), is dated 28-29<lb/>
October 1958. In the copy that Carter labeled “working copy” on the dust-<lb/>
jacket and the front free endpaper (in my collection), he listed four page<lb/>
numbers (45, 48, 58, 89) on the front free endpaper and called them “Que-<lb/>
ries” (not corrections), but his annotations appear on other pages as well.<lb/>
Most of them contain references to “LCM”—that is, L. C. Martin’s 1964<lb/>
edition—but without any implication that the Martin readings should be<lb/>
accepted (and indeed those at 48.4 and 68.30 had already been rejected in<lb/>
his published notes). The LCM annotations are as follows: 30.5 “LCM”;<lb/>
37.24 “LCM unlike” [for “nor like”]; 48.4 “LCM contriving” [for “continu-<lb/>
ing”]; 48.22-26 “?see LCM”; 66.1 “LCM conjecture contained” [for “con-<lb/>
tinued”]; 68.30 “LCM conjecture containe” [for “continue”]; 69.6 “LCM<lb/>
[delete sign]” [deleting a comma after “divisions”]. There are three other<lb/>
annotations relating to Browne’s text. On page 45, Carter marked for possi-<lb/>
ble deletion (with a question mark) the comma after “hope” in line 18, add-<lb/>
ing the marginal note “(see Lytton Strachey)”—whose analysis of Browne’s<lb/>
style is referred to twice in Carter’s preface. And there are marginal notes<lb/>
on pages 58 (the insertion of “which” before “with” in line 14) and 89<lb/>
(“seases” for “creases” in line 24, with a question mark), both of which are<lb/>
marked out. In “A Note on the Text,” he changed “compositor” to “press-<lb/>
corrector” (117.27). <hi>Second impression:</hi> 1967. 2000 copies. The Grolier<lb/>
Club copy of the 1967 impression, which Carter labeled “working copy” on<lb/>
the dust-jacket, has, on the front free endpaper, the date 8 August 1967 and<lb/>
a list of nine page numbers headed “Correct” along with one page number<lb/>
labeled “Queries.” Two of the page numbers refer to editorial matter, but<lb/>
the other eight point to readings requiring correction in Browne’s text, and<lb/>
all eight had been reported to Carter by Geoffrey Keynes in a letter of 4<lb/>
June 1968 (laid into the Grolier Club copy). That letter was apparently<lb/>
occasioned by a letter from Carter following the publication of Keynes’s<lb/>
edition of Browne’s <title>Selected Writings</title> (Faber & Faber, 1968), which includes<lb/>
Carter’s texts. Keynes begins, “I could have sworn I did send you a list of<lb/>
errors,” and the list is as follows (erroneous readings first): 33.16 body of ]<lb/>
body of the / 35.21 <hi>Ecclisiastes</hi> ] <hi>Ecclesiastes</hi> / 36.6 acccount ] account / 77.17<lb/>

(A:1952) 1a. Housman wrote to Carter on 9 November 1933 saying that,<lb/>
although he “was not a willing party to the original publication [in 1892] . . .<lb/>
your flattering proposal, if carried out, will not make matters perceptibly<lb/>
worse; so I offer no objection.” On 5 December 1933, he added, “I should<lb/>
like to have it stated that the Council of University College, not I, had the<lb/>
lecture printed [in 1892]. I consented, because it seemed churlish to refuse.”<lb/>
The copy in my collection, which came from Carter’s library, has a pencil<lb/>
line in the margin beside the bottom eleven lines of page 21 and the top five<lb/>
of page 22 (on the importance of “the hunger and thirst for knowledge” in<lb/>
human life), and another one beside the bottom five lines of page 22 and the<lb/>

headed “A Collection of Scores, Orchestral Parts and MS. material from the<lb/>
library of Sergei Diaghileff in use from 1909 to 1929 by his Ballets Russes”; a<lb/>
three-paragraph description (unsigned, but by Carter, who had brought the<lb/>
collection over from Paris) is on the reverse. The Grolier Club has a bound<lb/>
original (ribbon) typescript describing this collection, with 29 annotated items<lb/>
and a three-page introduction that includes some of the same prose as on the<lb/>
leaf inserted into catalogue 119; this typescript has annotations in Carter’s<lb/>
hand. The binding of the typescript matches that of the buckram boxes in<lb/>
which the collection was housed, and the volume would have accompanied<lb/>
the collection if it had been sold en bloc, as had been intended; but according<lb/>
to Carter’s note, “22 items left Oct 52”.<lb/>

states that 5000 copies were printed, with 3000 bound for publication on 1<lb/>
December 1939. This is an advance copy with the original state of the “Con-<lb/>
tents” leaf (A3); a cancel A3 was substituted before publication (and, accord-<lb/>
ing to the publisher, before review copies went out) in order to incorporate an<lb/>
acknowledgment of the Richards Press (see also the Sotheby catalogue of the<lb/>
Carter sale, C:1976, lot 337). In the course of a 1943 article for the Times Liter-<lb/>

<pb n="49"/>
der attack by two American scholars, Tom Burns Haber and William White,<lb/>
and the controversy thus aroused appeared in the correspondence columns of<lb/>
the <title>Times Literary Supplement</title> during the next sixteen years, resulting in correc-<lb/>
tions in later impressions; for the key moments in this debate, see the letters<lb/>

ingly claims that “the poet’s notes and manuscripts, in accordance with his<lb/>
own instructions, were destroyed after his death”; but Housman’s injunction<lb/>
did not apply to all his manuscripts, and the “Note on the Text” refers to<lb/>
editorial changes made after “further scrutiny of the manuscripts.” Second<lb/>

[British Information Services pamphlets.] New York: British Information Ser-<lb/>
vices, 1943-45. Unsigned. These pamphlets are entered here because Carter<lb/>
was director of the General Division of British Information Services in New<lb/>
York from November 1943 through October 1945, and one of his responsi-<lb/>
bilities was to oversee the preparation and production of BIS publications,<lb/>
which included a large number of widely distributed pamphlets. He can<lb/>
therefore be considered the editor of those pamphlets. The one that he is<lb/>
known to have written, <title>Victory in Burma</title> (1945), is entered in section A. For<lb/>

Cambridge University Press, 1947. xiii,50 pp. Published both in wrappers<lb/>
without illustrations and in cloth (and dust-jacket) with 16 plates. Sadleir, in<lb/>
his copy of the cloth issue (in my collection), wrote on the jacket “marked for<lb/>
authorship,” and in the table of contents he entered “MS” or “JC” by each<lb/>
section heading except two (D and G), where he put a question mark. The<lb/>

In the copy Carter presented to John Hayward, Carter wrote, “The notes<lb/>

format is a disgrace to the Scribner press, & I am ashamed of it. But some of<lb/>
the contents are, I think, rather nice, though it’s too deliberately mixed a bag<lb/>
to be of more than ephemeral interest. Please do not show it to anyone in or<lb/>
near the trade” (quoted from Rota catalogue 290 [1999], item 99).<lb/>

Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1961. xv,204 pp. Hardback (with<lb/>
dust-jacket) and paperback. Carter-Sparrow-White (A:1952) 21. In the Eton<lb/>
copy of the Collamore exhibition catalogue (C:1961), Carter noted that his<lb/>
preface to the <title>Selected Prose</title> incorporates most (except for the conclusion) of<lb/>
his address at that exhibition opening. In a note in <hi>The Book Collector</hi> a year<lb/>
later (“Housmaniana,” D:1962, Spring), he explained the production history<lb/>
of the book: “The first impression (serving both the British and American<lb/>
markets) bears on the reverse of the title-leaf the legend ‘Reprinted in the<lb/>
United States of America’. The collector will naturally infer an earlier print-<lb/>
ing: he will be wrong. The bibliographer will wonder, reprinted from what?<lb/>
The explanation is that the book was set at Cambridge (the page-proofs, to<lb/>
which I happen to have access, carry the normal imprint of the University<lb/>
Printer); the edition was then produced in the United States by photo-offset<lb/>
from ‘reproduction proofs’; it was bound and jacketed (for the cloth issue)<lb/>
and wrappered (for the paperback) also in the United States; and the cop-<lb/>
ies for publication from Bentley House on 8 Nov. 1961 (20 Oct. from CUP<lb/>
New York) shipped across the Atlantic.” For Carter’s other editions of Hous-<lb/>

typography, book production and the graphic arts”; one of the “members”<lb/>
of the Foundation was Stanley Morison. The prospectus does not indicate<lb/>
<pb n="53"/>
that the Foundation was financed by Mary Jean Kempner Thorne, primar-<lb/>
ily for the purpose of publishing the booklets. Copies were available for $1<lb/>

<title>Printing and the Mind of Man: A Descriptive Catalogue Illustrating the Impact of Print<lb/>

and Percy H. Muir. London: Cassell, [1966]. 16 pp. Wrappers. A “specimen”<lb/>
(so called in the introductory essay on the inside front wrapper) to advertise<lb/>
the full edition (B:1967), it consists of the first sixteen pages of the main text<lb/>
of the projected volume (a single sewn gathering) with added wrappers. The<lb/>
text is in a preliminary state—the major difference being that there is an<lb/>
illustration for the Thomas Littleton entry (no. 23) and none for Aesop (no.<lb/>
15), whereas the reverse is true in the published book. The recto of the front<lb/>
wrapper reproduces the title-page wording of the book but in a different set-<lb/>
ting. The essay on the verso of the front wrapper, entitled “The Impact of<lb/>
Print,” with Carter’s characteristic phrasing, was obviously written by him;<lb/>
it was later used (with the title and the last two sentences deleted, along with<lb/>
nine smaller revisions) on the book’s dust-jacket flaps. (It was also used in a<lb/>
four-page prospectus, where Carter is known to have changed by hand the<lb/>
phrase “full descriptions” to “in-depth descriptions” in the third sentence.)<lb/>
In the copy of the specimen in my collection, presented by Carter to Arthur<lb/>
Cohen on Michaelmas 1966, Carter wrote a note on the inside back wrapper<lb/>
regarding the price of “approximately” nine guineas listed among the statis-<lb/>
tics and specifications printed there: “this was figured before the September<lb/>
estimate reduction: should not therefore be exceeded.” The price when pub-<lb/>
lished was seven guineas.<lb/>

Reynolds Stone. Muir’s set of proofs on which he identified the authorship<lb/>
of the commentaries is in Cambridge University Library. It indicates that<lb/>
Carter wrote the annotations for entries 14 (Maimonides), 122 (Shakespeare<lb/>
Folio), 354 (<hi>Alice in Wonderland</hi>), and 424 (Churchill’s speech of 20 August<lb/>
1940) and that he collaborated with Muir on entries 302 (Murray’s Travellers<lb/>

and 403 (Frederick W. Taylor’s <hi>The Principles of Scientific Management</hi>). As<lb/>

Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1969. 54 pp. Cloth, dust-jacket.<lb/>
Carter-Sparrow-White (A:1952) 23. Includes an appendix (pp. 47-54), “Shelley,<lb/>
Swinburne and Housman,” condensed from an article by Carter and John Sparrow<lb/>
in the <hi>Times Literary Supplement</hi> (E2:1968, November). Published 11 November<lb/>
1969. In the “Note on the Text,” Carter points out that Housman’s manuscript<lb/>
has no title other than “Cambridge inaugural.” The decision to supply a title,<lb/>
he says, was not his. “But,” he adds, “having deferred to the decision, I discovered<lb/>
in myself a disinclination to defer to anyone else’s preference in such presumption;<lb/>
so, for better or worse, the title here given to the Cambridge inaugural is mine.”<lb/>
Carter reported two errors in a letter published in the <hi>Times Literary Supplement</hi><lb/>
on 27 November 1969, p. 1362: at 22.19, “preserved” should be “preserve”;<lb/>
at 23.11, “examples” should be “example”. Carter first published the lecture,<lb/>
omitting a short paragraph on Shelley and Swinburne, in the <hi>Times Literary Supplement</hi><lb/>
of 9 May 1968, with an appended “Note” (E2:1968); and he had the <hi>TLS</hi> text<lb/>
reprinted “for private circulation” (see the preceding entry). For Carter’s other<lb/>

the embodiment and the inspiration / of the indomitable spirit / of the common<lb/>

Based on an exhibition held 1-30 April, 1961. In the Eton copy, Carter says that this “Footnote” was the conclusion of his address at the opening of the exhibition (and the rest of the address was used in the preface to <hi>Selected Prose</hi> [B:1961]). He also states that the following sentence (on p. 36, lines 18-19) was written by David Randall: “The Sophocles and Plautus I managed to rescue must be among the few which survive today.” In my copy, in the blank space on p. 37, he adds: “this was not said by me, & is not true.

Assembled at the British Museum and at Earls Court, London, 16-27 July 1963</hi> (London: F. W. Bridges & Sons and the Association of British Manufacturers of Printers’ Machinery, 1963), pp. 7-9. (Cover subtitle: <hi>Catalogue of the Exhibitions at the British Museum and at Earls Court, London, 16-27 July 1963</hi>.) In a letter to David Randall on 18 December 1964 (at the Lilly Library), Carter says that the preface “was, as a matter of fact, written by the third of the signatories to it.” Carter was a member of the Supervisory Committee and would have been involved in various aspects of the preparation of this book, but he was not on the Editorial Board—nor on the British Museum Committee, which oversaw the historical exhibition of fine printing that was mounted in the British Museum (whereas the Earls Court exhibition displayed, along with printing equipment, books that were monuments of intellectual history). The catalogues of both exhibitions are included in this publication but are separately paginated. In the preface to the British Museum part, R. A. Wilson thanks Carter (along with Nicolas Barker and Percy Muir) for special help “in selecting the books and producing the following catalogue.” Carter’s Curwen Press edition of Browne (B:1932) is listed as item 177. Because the British Museum exhibition was to run two months longer than the one at Earls Court, its catalogue was made available separately, with the imprint of the British Museum and the title <hi>Printing and the Mind of Man: An Exhibition of Fine Printing in the King’s Library of the British Museum, July-September 1963</hi>. (There was also <hi>A Keepsake for Visitors</hi> of three pages). For the expanded work (of which Carter was co-editor) that grew out of the Earls Court exhibition,<lb/>

E Contributions to the <hi>Times Literary Supplement</hi>, 1931-74<lb/>
Carter made almost a thousand contributions to the <hi>Times Literary Supplement</hi> from 26 March 1931 (a letter on “Original Boards”) through 3 May 1974 (a review of Sydney Roscoe’s book on John Newbery): about 700 were reviews, and the rest were letters and articles. Together they covered a remarkable number of the books, bibliographical periodicals, exhibitions, auctions, and other book-world events of their time. All the reviews were unsigned (following TLS policy until 1974), and all the letters were signed; some of the articles were signed, but<lb/>
<pb n="88"/>
most were not. It would be a pointless duplication to list all these contributions<lb/>
here because a nearly complete (and fully indexed) list is available to subscribers<lb/>
on the internet, in the <hi>TLS</hi> Historical Archive (at &lt;www.the-tls.co.uk&gt;), which<lb/>
identifies the authorship of most unsigned pieces. It is easy to use: one simply<lb/>
enters Carter’s name and “Contributor” to see a nearly complete chronological<lb/>
list. In the list, every item has a citation (title, date, page); and for the pieces clas-<lb/>
sified as reviews, there are the names of the authors and the titles of the books and<lb/>
journals reviewed as well. Every item also has a link to a view of the original page.<lb/>
<lb/>
One can, if one wishes, limit the list to “Editorial” (which means articles and<lb/>
letters) or “Reviews.” Choosing “Reviews,” however, will not provide a list of<lb/>
all the reviews because some items are incorrectly classified in the Archive. For<lb/>
example, many short “articles,” and even some long ones, are actually reviews<lb/>
of books or journals but were not set up in the way reviews usually were, with<lb/>
details of the book or journal in the heading; as a result, they are not classified as<lb/>
reviews. (And occasionally the reverse is true.) Thus if one wishes to see whether<lb/>
Carter ever reviewed a particular book or journal in the <hi>TLS</hi>, one should (after<lb/>
entering Carter’s name as contributor) enter the name of the author or title of<lb/>
the book or journal as “Keyword” (rather than “Author” or “Book title”), and it<lb/>
will be located even if it does not appear in the heading of the piece. This search<lb/>
would then have to be supplemented by an examination of list E1 below.<lb/>
<lb/>
The Archive contains a few other errors, but they are normally obvious and<lb/>
pose no difficulty. For example, Carter’s second letter to the <hi>TLS</hi>, entitled “Sir<lb/>
Thomas Browne” on 16 July 1931, is listed twice because another letter on the<lb/>
same page, by three other writers, is entitled “Sir Thomas More,” and the entry<lb/>
mistakenly merges these two references and lists the merged entry twice. For a<lb/>
variety of reasons, many other duplicated entries exist, and the extra ones can be<lb/>
ignored, though they cause the stated total number of Carter’s contributions to<lb/>
be somewhat inflated—but see the first list below for items to be added, bringing<lb/>
the total back to nearly a thousand.<lb/>
<lb/>
There are two main sources for <hi>TLS</hi> authorship: the archival set of published<lb/>
issues (with the authors’ names written on them) and the “Stock Books” (showing<lb/>
the material available for use each week). Apparently the electronic Archive was<lb/>
based on the first, with occasional reference to the second when the first is unclear,<lb/>
as is implied in Derwent May’s 2001 book, <hi>Critical Times: The History of the “Times<lb/>
Literary Supplement”</hi> (p. xi). (This procedure is confirmed by the fact that in some<lb/>
instances the Archive fills the space for “Contributor” with the statement “can’t find<lb/>
in stock book.”) In 1977 and 1978, Arthur Crook (who had been editor of the<lb/>
<hi>TLS</hi> from 1959 to 1974 and was then hoping to write a history of the journal) kindly al-<lb/>
lowed me to examine the Stock Books, which I went through for the issues from 31<lb/>
August 1940 to 5 November 1971 (but the bibliographical “back page” authors were<lb/>
not noted until 30 August 1941). I have checked my notes against the electronic<lb/>
Archive and have found that 59 items credited to Carter in the Stock Books are not<lb/>
assigned to him in the Archive. In all these cases except one, the Archive gives no<lb/>
contributor’s name, and many of them are classified as advertisements. (Perhaps the<lb/>
program called for a contributor’s name to be entered if “Review” were used; but<lb/>
“Editorial” did not, and it is not clear why “Advertisement” was sometimes chosen<lb/>
<pb n="89"/>
when the contributor’s name was not indicated in the archival copies and could<lb/>
not be located in the Stock Books.) In the one instance where the Archive gives a<lb/>
contributor’s name for one of these items assigned to Carter in the Stock Books, the<lb/>
Archive is incorrect, as explained in the list below at 2 January 1953.<lb/>
<lb/>
These pieces clearly are Carter’s work and should be added to the list of<lb/>
his contributions. Even with them added, some of Carter’s contributions are<lb/>
surely still not accounted for: anyone who attentively reads the <hi>TLS</hi> back page<lb/>
for this period will find elements of Carter’s style in other pieces, which is not<lb/>
surprising since he was in charge of the back page from 1946 to 1967 (except<lb/>
for 1953-55, when he was in Washington). But I have not included <hi>TLS</hi> items<lb/>
solely on the basis of my judgment. It is perhaps unnecessary to tell future users<lb/>
of this handlist that the <hi>TLS</hi> Archive, like other electronic files, may at some<lb/>
point be revised—with the result that the errors and omissions noted here may<lb/>
be corrected.<lb/>
<lb/>
In the first of two lists below, all the additions from the Stock Books (and four<lb/>
other additions) are recorded. The second list brings together Carter’s major<lb/>
contributions to the <hi>TLS</hi>, extracted from the full listing.<lb/>
<lb/>
E1  Additions to the TLS Archive’s List of Carter’s Contributions<lb/>
<lb/>
The items listed here, with four exceptions, are attributed to Carter in the Stock<lb/>
Books but are not credited to him (or anyone, except in one case) in the electronic<lb/>
Historical Archive. The four additions not from the Stock Books are a letter of<lb/>
12 August 1944, which is not credited to Carter in the Archive even though it<lb/>
is signed; an unsigned report on the Silver sale (2 December 1965), which is<lb/>
identified by a cutting at Eton; some paragraphs on the Maurice Pariser sale<lb/>
in a “Commentary” column (14 December 1967), which is identified by a type-<lb/>
script photocopy at the Harry Ransom Center; and some paragraphs on Stanley<lb/>
Morison in a “Commentary” column (19 December 1968), which is identified by<lb/>
a corrected proof at Eton. (These last two items raise the possibility, indeed the<lb/>
probability, that Carter made other contributions to the “Commentary” column,<lb/>
which began on 19 October 1967; the contributors to this column are usually not<lb/>
identified in the Archive.) All these pieces are unquestionably Carter’s work and<lb/>
should be added to the list in the Archive.<lb/>

E2  Carter’s Major Contributions to the <hi>TLS</hi><lb/>
It may be useful to extract from the full list, for separate recording here, Carter’s major <hi>TLS</hi> pieces. The list below consists of (1) editorials (unsigned leaders), (2) signed pieces of any length (other than letters), and (3) unsigned pieces<lb/>
<pb n="93"/>
and signed letters that are the equivalent of two full columns or more in length.<lb/>
Reviews that are long simply because they take up a number of bibliographical<lb/>
journals and discuss the contents of each are not included here; they amount to<lb/>
a series of short reviews (and individual issues of journals often do receive inde-<lb/>
pendent reviews). Five pieces in this list will not be found under Carter’s name<lb/>
in the Historical Archive (those at 20 April 1946, 19 January 1951, 9 April 1964,<lb/>
29 May 1964, and 17 December 1964). They are among the items assigned to<lb/>
Carter only in the Stock Books and recorded in the list above; since they are long<lb/>
enough to qualify for the present list, they are repeated here.<lb/>
<lb/>
Eleven pieces in this list were later reprinted: those at 1 June 1946, 20 March<lb/>
1948, 2 June 1950, 25 August 1950, 12 January 1951, 13 April 1951, 9 May 1952,<lb/>
18 March 1955, 28 August 1959, 9 May 1968, and 30 October 1970. Twelve<lb/>
pieces were signed: those at 27 April 1933, 22 August 1935, 30 May 1936, 5<lb/>
June 1943, 1 June 1946, 12 July 1957, 6 September 1963, 14 March 1968, 9 May<lb/>

APPENDIX<lb/>
<hi>John Carter’s Supposed Novel</hi><lb/>
<lb/>
Those who are familiar with John Carter’s writings have long been aware of<lb/>
the 1934 novel called <hi>The Fall of the Titan</hi>, by “John Waynflete.” It has regularly<lb/>
been attributed to Carter, whose full name was John Waynflete Carter and who<lb/>
occasionally used “John Waynflete” (or “George Waynflete” or “Waynflete”) as<lb/>
a pseudonym, as on the second edition (1946) of the volume of clerihews that he<lb/>
edited for the Rampant Lions Press, the private press of his brother Will. But<lb/>
the novel has not been read by many people because of its rarity. As of August<lb/>
2020, WorldCat records only four copies worldwide: at the British Library, the<lb/>
National Library of Scotland, Oxford, and Yale (three of which—all but Ox-<lb/>
ford—attribute the authorship to Carter in their catalogues). There are also cop-<lb/>
ies at Trinity College Dublin and Swansea University, and there may of course be<lb/>
other institutional copies not reported to WorldCat. In addition, I am aware of a<lb/>
few individuals who possess a copy. Nevertheless, it is clearly a very scarce book.<lb/>
<lb/>
Because I recently acquired a copy (with the assistance of A. S. G. Edwards),<lb/>
I am now in a position to read it, which I have done. The experience, however,<lb/>
was not what I had expected. Carter’s writing is known for its elegance and wit,<lb/>
and this novel is written with ludicrous formality and is full of banal sentiments.<lb/>
One only has to read a few pages to begin wondering: did Carter really write this?<lb/>
The name “John Waynflete” is what has caused people to think that he did. But<lb/>
<pb n="99"/>
if he did, the next question is: why would he have written it in that style? And if<lb/>
that question can be answered, there is the question of when, in his pre-1934 life,<lb/>
he would have been likely to have the time or inclination to write it.<lb/>
<lb/>
Since so few people have read the novel, the best way to begin a discussion<lb/>
of it is to describe its plot (which is relevant evidence in itself ). The story en-<lb/>
compasses the rise and fall of Silas Burney, a depraved and unscrupulous man<lb/>
who becomes a famous Labour leader. In Book I (of four Books, comprising 38<lb/>
chapters), we learn that Silas has neglected his wife and four children, being more<lb/>
dedicated to the Socialist Party. The next Book covers his becoming a member<lb/>
of Parliament and a powerful and influential speaker (the titan of the Labour<lb/>
movement); his being befriended by the daughter (named Miles) of Sir John<lb/>
Walker, a “tolerant and kind” newspaper owner who treats his employees well;<lb/>
and Miles’s asking Silas to help a housemaid (Flossie) whom (unknown to Miles)<lb/>
he has seduced. At this point we are told that “there are always forces at work,<lb/>
unseen forces, ever vigilant to bring to nought the evildoer wherever found, and<lb/>
Silas Burney was now to see the first signs of his fall” (p. 147).<lb/>
<lb/>
In Book III, Miles and Flossie gradually discover that they are in love with<lb/>
the same man (Silas); and a Sir Jacob Randles promises Silas wealth and his<lb/>
daughter’s hand in return for Silas’s arranging for Sir Jacob to be given a title.<lb/>
Silas, in Book IV, vows to pay Flossie to be rid of her (and the child she had by<lb/>
him) in order to accept Sir Jacob’s offer. Sir John, convinced of Flossie’s good-<lb/>
ness and with evidence of Silas’s duplicity, manages to bring everyone together in<lb/>
London, where Silas is confronted. Flossie makes an eloquent speech (including<lb/>
poetry) at the end of which she dies, but not before Silas has wept and asked for<lb/>
forgiveness. In a brief Epilogue, we learn that Silas and his daughter have moved<lb/>
to Canada, where he says to her that the bright star they see in the sky “may be<lb/>
your mother’s eyes looking down on you and me, and hoping and praying that<lb/>
you will become like her—a woman who brought ‘the Titan’ down and made<lb/>
him a MAN!”<lb/>
<lb/>
There are a number of other characters that I have not mentioned; and<lb/>
most of the characters, from time to time, engage in political discussion, often<lb/>
uttering long statements on the dangers of socialism and the corruption of the<lb/>
demagogues who attain office. One character wonders “if the rottenness and<lb/>
canker had gone too far to save the nation” (p. 73). And not only the characters<lb/>
but the narrative voice also raises this concern:<lb/>
<lb/>
There has been working silently on the English Nation for many years, a spirit alien to<lb/>
everything that makes for honesty of purpose, integrity of character and truthful speech.<lb/>
Turn where we will, this insidious power is at work, ceaselessly, noiselessly, resolutely; bent<lb/>
on undermining the British Character and the British Constitution. (p. 95)<lb/>
<lb/>
From the opening chapter, the narrator’s views are clear: a minister’s strictures,<lb/>
for instance, are said to have “aroused the bellicose propensities of a certain class<lb/>
who alas! have assumed the reins of government,” and a footnote here states<lb/>
“Labour Government in Office” (p. 11). The formality of expression is illustrated<lb/>
on the previous page when two men conversing on a veranda say they should<lb/>
move inside because of an approaching storm: by doing so, they were “suiting<lb/>
the action to the word.” The style ranges from overly formal to melodramatic:<lb/>
<pb n="100"/>
“Some women who love brush the stars with their shoulders, they bring a touch<lb/>
of Heaven into the dreariest life, they smooth life’s wrinkles and chase fear and<lb/>
doubt into night” (p. 83). These examples are perhaps sufficient to suggest the<lb/>
novel’s tone and point of view.<lb/>
<lb/>
The book of 285 pages was published at 7s. 6d. in early 1934 by Lincoln Wil-<lb/>
liams Ltd., a short-lived London publisher with offices at 19 Adam Street (and<lb/>
was printed by the Clock House Press of Hoddesdon). It may have been available<lb/>
in late 1933, for it is included in the publisher’s advertisement in <hi>The Bookman</hi><lb/>
for December 1933. The Lincoln Williams firm was active for only three years,<lb/>
from 1932 to 1935, when financial problems brought about its end. It went into<lb/>
administration in July 1935, following a petition from Amy Gilmour, author of<lb/>
a novel called <hi>The Lure of Islam</hi>, which the firm had published in 1933; and the<lb/>
winding-up order is dated 20 August 1935. I am aware of fifty titles with the<lb/>
Lincoln Williams imprint during those years, and they encompass a wide variety<lb/>
of books, ranging from reference books on cricket and books of practical advice<lb/>
to biographies, memoirs, travel writing, historical studies, poetry, and fiction. It<lb/>
seems likely that many of them were paid for by their authors.<lb/>
<lb/>
The dust-jacket for <hi>The Fall of the Titan</hi> (known from Richard Landon’s copy)<lb/>
lists twelve other novels, with titles like <hi>The Seal of Love</hi>, <hi>Hearts Adrift</hi>, and <hi>Noonday<lb/>
Devil</hi>. It carries on the front an illustration by H. W. Perl (1897-1952), the famous<lb/>
(and much collected) artist of pulp-fiction covers, who did other Lincoln Williams<lb/>
jackets as well. No information about the author is given, and the blurb consists<lb/>
of only two phrases: “A powerful story of ambition, intrigue, love and disaster.<lb/>
A novel to put into the hands of thinking young people.”<lb/>
<lb/>
On 5 April 1934 the <hi>Times Literary Supplement</hi> included the book in its section<lb/>
of brief notices of “New Books and Reprints” (pp. 245-46). The short review is<lb/>
worth quoting in full:<lb/>
<lb/>
In a style so stilted and sententious as to read almost like a parody, the author tells the<lb/>
story of one Silas Burney, a bold bad Labour leader, who, despite the fact he had robbed<lb/>
his employer, left his wife and children to starve, seduced a housemaid, and trifled with<lb/>
the affections of a baronet’s daughter, becomes a power in the land and is confidently<lb/>
spoken of as the coming Prime Minister. There is, however, as we are reminded in capital<lb/>
letters, “something in the world that works against a bad man.” The “Titan” crashes,<lb/>
and is made to see the error of his ways as the result of a remarkable dying speech by the<lb/>
housemaid which, starting with an impassioned eulogy of Cobden, Bright and free trade,<lb/>
ends up by warning him that “bankruptcy and death are the final heirs of imposture and<lb/>
make-belief.”<lb/>
<lb/>
This review is notable in two ways: the deftness of its plot summary and the per-<lb/>
ceptiveness of its suggestion that the book might be a parody. The <hi>TLS</hi> historical<lb/>
archive does not give the names of the authors of brief reviews of this kind. But<lb/>
these two points invite the speculation that the review might have been written<lb/>
by Carter himself (if he wrote the book) as a way of instructing readers to treat<lb/>
the book as a parody. (Many years later he wrote a review of his <hi>ABC for Book-<lb/>
Collectors</hi>.) Although he did not become a regular reviewer for the <hi>TLS</hi> until 1936,<lb/>
he had already published a signed article there (on Byron in the 27 April and<lb/>
4 May 1933 issues) as well as a few letters, and he was already involved, with<lb/>
several others, in reinvigorating the <hi>TLS</hi> back page as a bibliographical forum.<lb/>
<pb n="101"/>
Conceivably the fact that the book was noticed at all shows Carter’s influence<lb/>
(of the twelve other novels listed on the dust-jacket for <hi>The Fall of the Titan</hi>, only<lb/>
five were given any notice in the <hi>TLS</hi>). In any case, whether or not Carter had<lb/>
anything to do with the review, the idea that the novel might be a parody is<lb/>
worth considering.<lb/>
<lb/>
This idea would seem to be at odds with the dust-jacket recommendation<lb/>
that the book should be “put into the hands of thinking young people”—which<lb/>
implies that it should be taken at face value. On the other hand, of course, this<lb/>
blurb could be part of the parody. But if one wished to produce a parody of senti-<lb/>
mental fiction with an anti-Labour slant, it would take a remarkable commitment<lb/>
to devote about 90,000 words to the cause. And it is not clear what would be<lb/>
accomplished. Parodying the literary conventions and moralistic tone of popular<lb/>
fiction would affect the expression of political views on both sides. It would not,<lb/>
in other words, be a way of directing the reader’s sympathy to move from one<lb/>
side to the other—though possibly it could reveal shortcomings in the arguments<lb/>
on both sides. Or it could simply, through exaggeration, show the weaknesses of<lb/>
popular fiction. But it is not very effective as a parody, since it is tiresome rather<lb/>
than amusing. Viewing it as a parody, therefore, does not redeem it from being<lb/>
an unsatisfactory piece of writing, in contrast with everything known to be from<lb/>
Carter’s pen.<lb/>
<lb/>
The novel does contain a few elements that would be compatible with Cart-<lb/>
er’s authorship, the first being its many classical references. Carter’s devotion to<lb/>
the classics, nourished at Eton and King’s Cambridge (where he took an honors<lb/>
degree in classics), was lifelong and was reflected in his collecting and editing<lb/>
of Catullus and his admiration for A. E. Housman. Although Catullus is not<lb/>
mentioned in the novel, there are references to Aristotle, Plutarch, Aristophanes,<lb/>
Tacitus, Cicero, Socrates, and Homer. There is even a conversation about re-<lb/>
membering classical texts from one’s college days (p. 132), and a Latin quotation<lb/>
from Augustine is the subject of another conversation (p. 33). Other literary allu-<lb/>
sions include Byron, Moliere, Lamartine, Clovis Hugues, and Shakespeare (one<lb/>
character uses the phrase “stale, flat, and unprofitable”). There are few biblio-<lb/>
philic touches, but a character introduced on the first page is “a lover of books”<lb/>
(p. 230), and another character visits a bookshop that had been Dodsley’s in the<lb/>
eighteenth century (pp. 51-52). These references do not, however, furnish strong<lb/>
enough evidence to outweigh the overall style and tone, for they are not beyond<lb/>
the competence of many people with a literary education.<lb/>
<lb/>
If Carter wrote the novel, it is not credible that he wrote it in the years just<lb/>
prior to its publication. Immediately after he came down from Cambridge in<lb/>
1927, he was fully occupied with the book world, having been hired at once by<lb/>
Scribner’s London office to supply rare books to the New York shop. And his<lb/>
letters to the <hi>TLS</hi> beginning early in 1931 show that he was already immersed<lb/>
in the study of publishers’ bindings, Sir Thomas Browne, and the Wise-Forman<lb/>
forgeries—the subjects of his remarkable series of publications in 1932-34 (<hi>Bind-<lb/>
ing Variants in English Publishing</hi> and an edition of Browne in 1932 and <hi>An Enquiry<lb/>
into the Nature of Certain Nineteenth Century Pamphlets</hi> in 1934). Also in these years he<lb/>
contributed introductions to two Elkin Mathews catalogues, searched for books<lb/>
<pb n="102"/>
to send to Scribner’s, wrote four catalogues for Scribner’s, collaborated on other<lb/>
Scribner catalogues, and edited Catullus and <hi>New Paths in Book Collecting</hi>. It is<lb/>
hard to conceive of his writing <hi>The Fall of the Titan</hi> at the same time. (The only<lb/>
periods when he might have had some free time on his hands would have been<lb/>
on shipboard when traveling to and from New York in early 1929 and early<lb/>
1932; but it seems unlikely that he would have given priority to this novel over<lb/>
the bibliographical projects he had in progress.)<lb/>
<lb/>
So we are left with the possibility that he wrote it for amusement during his<lb/>
college years. But that, too, is hard to believe: why would he have chosen to de-<lb/>
vote so much time to a work of melodramatic political fiction (or a parody of one),<lb/>
when he was busy with his studies and with book-hunting? And if he had done<lb/>
so, everything we know about him suggests that he would have made a better job<lb/>
of it, even as an undergraduate. The novel as it stands would presumably have<lb/>
been an embarrassment to him by 1934. Why would he have wanted to resurrect<lb/>
it by giving it to a publisher? A possible reason could be that he thought it might<lb/>
bring in some money. But if he wanted to publish it and conceal his authorship,<lb/>
surely he would not have chosen a pseudonym that could so easily be identified<lb/>
with him.<lb/>
<lb/>
We thus come back to the name “John Waynflete,” which remains, after all,<lb/>
the seemingly most persuasive link with Carter—and probably the only one<lb/>
considered by the collectors and library cataloguers who have made the connec-<lb/>
tion. But it is not as decisive as it may at first seem to be. Carter’s verifiable uses<lb/>
of the name “Waynflete” did not begin until after 1934: first as “George Wayn-<lb/>
flete” in <hi>Bibliographical Notes & Queries</hi> in 1939, then as “Waynflete” in<lb/>
<hi>Publishers’ Weekly</hi> in 1940, and finally as “John Waynflete” in <hi>The Cornhill Magazine</hi><lb/>
in 1944. Therefore if someone other than Carter were looking for a pseudonym, even<lb/>
someone attuned to the bibliophilic world, there would have been no reason to<lb/>
avoid “Waynflete” as a name already in use. And Carter was not well enough<lb/>
known (at least until the <hi>Enquiry</hi> came out, a few months after the novel) for<lb/>
many people to have been aware of his middle name. (I realize that Carter’s use<lb/>
of “George Waynflete” in 1939 could be seen as his way of distancing himself<lb/>
from the novel he had signed “John Waynflete” five years earlier—though not a<lb/>
very great distancing. But this argument goes both ways: he could also have been<lb/>
distancing himself from the “John Waynflete” someone else had used five years<lb/>
earlier—which he would probably have been aware of through the <hi>TLS</hi> review.)<lb/>
<lb/>
If there was no reason for someone else to avoid using “Waynflete” in 1934,<lb/>
what reason would there have been for anyone else to choose it? Actually, there<lb/>
would have been many people to whom the name might have occurred as an<lb/>
appealing and appropriate pseudonym: anyone who had a connection with Eton,<lb/>
Winchester, or Magdalen College. Carter’s middle name results from a family<lb/>
connection with William Waynflete, a fifteenth-century Provost of Eton, who<lb/>
was also a Bishop of Winchester and the founder of Magdalen College Oxford.<lb/>
The name is well known to persons who have some association with any of these<lb/>
institutions. And, as Nicolas Barker has pointed out to me, it further impinges on<lb/>
people’s consciousness through its use in place names, such as a road in Oxford,<lb/>
a street in London, and a close in Bishops Waltham. The widespread knowledge<lb/>
of the Waynflete name is indicated by its presence even in America: in Portland,<lb/>
<pb n="103"/>
Maine, for example, there is a Waynflete School, which was named for the same<lb/>
William Waynflete. It is not a rare name, in other words, and descendants of Wil-<lb/>
liam Waynflete survive on both sides of the Atlantic. Someone other than Carter<lb/>
could well have chosen to use “John Waynflete” in 1934. And it might not be a<lb/>
pseudonym at all.<lb/>
<lb/>
The collections of Carter’s papers in various libraries (Eton, King’s, Cam-<lb/>
bridge University Library, Bodleian, and Lilly among them) do not seem to con-<lb/>
tain anything relevant; Sebastian Carter, John’s nephew, knows nothing about<lb/>
the novel; and Michael Meredith tells me that it was not among Carter’s copies<lb/>
of his own books at the time of his death. Carter’s authorship of it has not been<lb/>
proved or disproved. The question comes down to how one evaluates the likeli-<lb/>
hood that anyone other than Carter could have used “John Waynflete” versus<lb/>
the likelihood that Carter could have written something, even as a parody, with<lb/>
the style and content of this novel. Unless there is evidence that I am not aware<lb/>
of, I think it seems reasonable to say that the arguments against John Carter’s<lb/>
authorship of <hi>The Fall of the Titan</hi> are stronger than those supporting it.<lb/>

THE SOURCES OF THE SUSSEX DECLARATION:<lb/>
A RECONSIDERATION<lb/>
<lb/>
by<lb/>
John Bidwell<lb/>
<lb/>
In April 2017 several newspapers carried stories about the discovery of a manu-<lb/>
script Declaration of Independence. Conjectures about the political signifi-<lb/>
cance of the manuscript began to circulate in print and then proliferated on<lb/>
the web where the original announcements are still accessible. The discovery<lb/>
was sufficiently newsworthy that Prime Minister Theresa May and President<lb/>
Donald Trump took time to look at it while Trump was making his UK state<lb/>
visit in 2019. Unfortunately, they and their advisors were misinformed. Basic<lb/>
assumptions about the date and origins of the manuscript are in error and have<lb/>
prompted unfounded claims about its historical importance. I hope to correct<lb/>
those errors here and set the record straight by reviewing the bibliographical<lb/>
arguments that made that manuscript a media sensation.<lb/>
<lb/>
My main concern is with an article by Danielle Allen and Emily Sneff in<lb/>
the <hi>Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America</hi> (PBSA). It serves as the definitive<lb/>
announcement of the discovery and a means of explaining the authors’ research<lb/>
methods. They describe and date the manuscript (see figure 1) in the article and<lb/>
suggest a route by which it came to its present location in the West Sussex Record<lb/>
Office (WSRO), Chichester, England. In brief this is how they present their find-<lb/>
ings: sometime between 1783 and 1790 a clerk made a copy of the Declaration<lb/>
of Independence, the manuscript that had been engrossed on parchment for the<lb/>
Continental Congress in 1776. The clerk had trouble reading the original, com-<lb/>
mitted errors of transcription, and even smudged the title, but was ambitious<lb/>
enough to write it out on a large sheet of parchment. Measuring 24 by 30½ inches,<lb/>
it was intended for display and was probably commissioned by the Pennsylva-<lb/>
nia lawyer James Wilson (1742–1798), one of the Founding Fathers who had<lb/>
signed the engrossed Declaration. Wilson played a prominent part in drafting<lb/>
the Constitution, which he also signed, and relied on this copy to argue for a<lb/>
strong national government founded on the will of the people rather than a loose<lb/>
confederation of semi-independent states. His concept of nationhood is evident<lb/>
in the way the clerk transcribed the fifty-six signatures in the engrossed Decla-<lb/>
ration, not grouped by states as in the original but intermingled in a seemingly<lb/>
random order.<lb/>

random order, as if to express the personal convictions of the Signers instead of<lb/>
their duties to the states they represented.<lb/>
<lb/>
After this preliminary overview, the authors explore the historical context in<lb/>
a second article published in the <hi>Georgetown Journal of Law & Public Policy</hi> (GJLPP).<lb/>
Here they narrow down its dates to 1785–1787 and discuss how it figured in<lb/>
the deliberations of the Constitutional Convention. They note the possibility<lb/>
that it had belonged to Charles Lennox, third duke of Richmond (1735–1806),<lb/>
whose family seat was not far from Chichester. Richmond was an advocate of the<lb/>
American cause, a proponent of parliamentary reform, and a tenacious member<lb/>
of the opposition sympathetic to the ideals enunciated in the Declaration. Allen<lb/>
and Sneff make other conjectures in those two articles and expand on them in<lb/>
statements to the press. They refer to the manuscript as the Sussex Declaration<lb/>
and I will too, although I disagree with them about its origins and significance.<lb/>
<lb/>
While the PBSA article was being prepared for publication, they issued a press<lb/>
release on 20 April 2017 in collaboration with a Communications Officer at Har-<lb/>
vard University. Within days, articles about the Sussex Declaration appeared in<lb/>
the <hi>New York Times</hi>, the <hi>Guardian</hi>, and the <hi>Washington Post</hi>. A CBS television crew<lb/>
showed up at the West Sussex Record Office to film the document on site. A<lb/>
Wikipedia article about the “physical history” of the Declaration cites two of the<lb/>
newspaper reports as well as the press release, which can still be found online in<lb/>
Danielle Allen’s Declaration Resources Project website. They elaborate on their<lb/>
hypotheses in a lecture at the National Archives broadcast by C-SPAN on 6 July<lb/>
2017 and recapitulated in the online National Archives News with a link to a You-<lb/>
Tube version of the lecture. There and in other media appearances they speculate<lb/>
that Thomas Paine may have been an intermediary responsible for bringing the<lb/>
Sussex Declaration to the duke of Richmond. Their claims are less explicit in the<lb/>
<hi>New York Times</hi> article, which only queries the connection with Paine and Rich-<lb/>
mond. Performing due diligence, however, the reporter consulted outside experts<lb/>
such as a legal historian who observed that even if their attribution to Wilson is<lb/>
wrong, an early manuscript of the Declaration is still “the discovery of a lifetime.”<lb/>
<lb/>
At the end of the PBSA article Allen and Sneff consider an alternative<lb/>
hypothesis: their document was based on a miniature facsimile Declaration<lb/>
printed in Boston in or after 1836 (figure 2). I brought that facsimile to their<lb/>
<pb n="108"/>

attention after they had sent me a preliminary draft of their article. No great<lb/>
amount of scrutiny was required to see that it was the source of the Sussex Dec-<lb/>
laration. The similarities in style and structure are obvious. In my view they are<lb/>
not dealing with a clerk who rearranged the signatures to fulfill Wilson’s politi-<lb/>
cal agenda but rather an amateur who transcribed the facsimile in an exercise of<lb/>
penmanship. But they submit that hypothesis only to dismiss it. Their rebuttal<lb/>
touches on several topics, mainly textual inconsistencies and a question of qual-<lb/>
ity: the facsimile was a mass-produced keepsake measuring no more than 5¾ by<lb/>
4½ inches. Why, they ask, would the clerk use such a paltry print to copy out a<lb/>
Declaration on this scale? They defend their position by pointing out anomalies<lb/>
in the layout of the facsimile not repeated in the manuscript, a transcription<lb/>
problem posed by the sequence of signatures. If the clerk had been copying the<lb/>
facsimile, they say, surely those anomalies would be present in the manuscript.<lb/>
<lb/>
So, what is the source of the Sussex Declaration: the parchment engrossed<lb/>
for the Continental Congress, signed by most of its members on 2 August 1776,<lb/>
the iconic document in the National Archives— or a cheap facsimile printed in<lb/>
Boston some sixty years later? What is the source of the Boston facsimile? In<lb/>
the following I will propose answers to those questions less glamorous than the<lb/>
hypotheses of Allen and Sneff but more consistent with the writing practices<lb/>
and design considerations involved in making a copy of the Declaration. Here,<lb/>
as in other bibliographical endeavors, the pure and simple physical evidence<lb/>
should prevail over less substantial arguments, no matter how many of them<lb/>
may be mustered against a few overriding objections. I will address the main<lb/>
arguments of the <hi>PBSA</hi> article, which is intended to establish the date of the<lb/>
Sussex Declaration. I will not be concerned with the <hi>GJLPP</hi> article, for it is<lb/>
entirely predicated on its predecessor and assumes that the alternative hypoth-<lb/>
esis has been refuted. If the dates they propose are not valid, then they cannot<lb/>
attribute it to James Wilson and cannot claim that Wilson used it during the<lb/>
Constitutional Convention.<lb/>
<lb/>
II<lb/>
<lb/>
Allen and Sneff begin by recounting the provenance of the Sussex Declara-<lb/>
tion. They note that it was deposited in the WSRO by a local solicitor whose firm<lb/>
had done business with the Richmond family. A WSRO archivist told them that<lb/>
the solicitor once had his pick of the family papers that had been entrusted to the<lb/>
firm since the eighteenth century, but were discarded in bulk sometime before<lb/>
1956. Indeed, the finding list of the deposit mentions two or three items relating<lb/>
to the family but they are so scattered and insignificant that it is hard to believe<lb/>
that they came from a trove dating back to the eighteenth century. The deposit<lb/>
is clearly the gleanings of a local history collector who found a few curiosities in<lb/>
his office and kept anything else that caught his eye. The finding list relegates the<lb/>
Sussex Declaration to a miscellaneous section at the end where it is accompanied<lb/>
by an 1828 legal opinion about a conveyance to the duke of Richmond’s trustees,<lb/>
checks drawn on a London bank in the 1840s and 1850s, an advertisement of a<lb/>
London dyer active ca. 1844, a list of the kings and queens of England, and a<lb/>
<pb n="110"/>
1750 letter from the bell ringers of Chichester. With the exception of the letter,<lb/>
nothing in this section has a secure date earlier than 1825. Nonetheless a WSRO<lb/>
archivist dated the Declaration in the late eighteenth century, an educated guess<lb/>
for cataloguing purposes, but Allen and Sneff make it a starting point of their<lb/>
exposition in <hi>PBSA</hi>.<lb/>
<lb/>
They find additional evidence in the physical features of the Sussex Declara-<lb/>
tion. They note that it was written on a large size of parchment suitable for ex-<lb/>
hibition and that it has nail holes in the corners as if it had been displayed at one<lb/>
point. On the advice of conservators they concede that the nails might have been<lb/>
meant to restrain the parchment for other purposes. They view the square shape<lb/>
of the nail holes as evidence for a date in the eighteenth century, but the source<lb/>
they cite contradicts their conclusions. Yes, early hand-wrought iron nails were<lb/>
square but so were the cut nails produced in British and American factories dur-<lb/>
ing the first half of the nineteenth century. Wire nails, which would have made<lb/>
round holes in the parchment, were not introduced until the 1850s in America or<lb/>
a bit earlier in England. The parchment was made of a middling-quality sheep-<lb/>
skin. They contend that it was “well prepared,” which may be so, but a Library<lb/>
of Congress conservation report graded it below a more prepossessing calfskin<lb/>
document they had brought in for comparison.<lb/>
<lb/>
The Sussex Declaration may have been put on view, but then it was filed<lb/>
away and forgotten. It was folded twice for storage, in which state it became<lb/>
severely soiled on one side, badly abraded along the folds with loss of text, and<lb/>
seriously damaged on the outer edge of the four leaves with loss of parchment.<lb/>
As to the edge damage, Allen and Sneff admit that a rodent could be to blame<lb/>
but believe it is more likely that a seal had been removed (<hi>PBSA</hi>, p. 362). In that<lb/>
case, however, the two outer leaves would have suffered more than the two in-<lb/>
ner leaves. When I saw it at the WSRO, the depredations seemed to me to be<lb/>
uniform on each of the four leaves. They do not explain what function a seal<lb/>
would have served and why it would have been removed. But those conjectures<lb/>
are beside the point because the parchment was then folded a third time as if<lb/>
it had been demoted to an even smaller storage space. These signs of abuse<lb/>
and neglect are hard to square with their contention that it was a “ceremonial”<lb/>
manuscript, a word used repeatedly in the <hi>PBSA</hi> article to signify the ambitious<lb/>
intentions of those who produced it. In the <hi>GJLPP</hi> article they use the word even<lb/>
more frequently to express its iconic function and the innovative ideas of James<lb/>
Wilson, who used it to elaborate his views on the Constitution. If it was owned<lb/>
by Richmond, then it must have fallen out of favor in a bad way to end up in<lb/>
that ignominious condition.<lb/>
<lb/>
The title has some words in black letter, but the text is mostly in a utilitar-<lb/>
ian round hand, which Allen and Sneff attribute to a clerk employed by Wilson.<lb/>
It cannot be assigned to a prominent politician although they have examined<lb/>
the writings of likely candidates and their amanuenses as well. They notice the<lb/>
<pb n="111"/>
absence of the long s prevalent in manuscripts of this period, but they believe<lb/>
that the clerk was one of the “stylistic radicals” who had dropped that usage.<lb/>
They do not mention that Wilson sometimes used a long s in his drafts of the<lb/>
Constitution, apparently more conservative in his writing practices than his hired<lb/>
hand. Arguing for the American origins of the manuscript, they compare it with<lb/>
contemporary deeds and indentures, some reproduced in the <hi>PBSA</hi> article, some<lb/>
in the Declaration Resources Project website. They detect stylistic features more<lb/>
likely to be local than to come from England, but to my mind the sample is too<lb/>
small to be convincing. Their morphological analysis of the document has been<lb/>
more useful for their purposes than the script itself, which is difficult to date.<lb/>
<lb/>
Allen and Sneff assert that the clerk made several drafts before completing<lb/>
the “final fair copy” of this manuscript (<hi>PBSA</hi>, p. 367). They perceive a certain<lb/>
amount of effort expended to produce a symmetrical composition, uniform line<lb/>
endings, no word breaks, and other artistic touches worthy of a document in-<lb/>
tended for display. Nonetheless the clerk botched the job at the beginning and<lb/>
made it worse while trying to correct it. He began to write a date in the same<lb/>
size and style of the black letter “In Congress” on the first line of the title but<lb/>
then thought better of it and began to rub out his mistake. His erasure merely<lb/>
smudged his work leaving remnants of that date easily apparent at first sight. For<lb/>
Allen and Sneff this was an opportunity for further scientific investigation, the<lb/>
results of which are posted on the Declaration Resources Project website and<lb/>
summarized in the <hi>PBSA</hi> article. They commissioned various tests using imaging<lb/>
techniques and other digital technologies to scrutinize the erasure. In the docu-<lb/>
mentation they received they see evidence that the erased date referred to when<lb/>
the clerk was working on the manuscript: either “July 4, 178” or “July 4, 179,”<lb/>
the last digit indecipherable. Starting on the fair copy, forgetting the momentous<lb/>
date of Independence, the clerk made an absent-minded slip of the pen as if he<lb/>
was thinking about his present circumstances instead of his assignment to rein-<lb/>
terpret the Declaration.<lb/>
<lb/>
The technical reports on the website are inconclusive and are mostly about<lb/>
methodology. A Library of Congress conservator considered the possibility that<lb/>
the third digit in the erased date might be an 8 or 9 but was not willing to com-<lb/>
mit to that reading. I believe there is an easier explanation. Yes, the clerk made<lb/>
a mistake but when and why did he try to fix it? It is more likely that the clerk<lb/>
forgot the July 4, 1776, date while copying out the text, and then went back to<lb/>
write it on the first line next to “In Congress.” Then he realized that this stopgap<lb/>
measure would spoil the symmetrical composition and erased his work, decid-<lb/>
ing instead to insert the missing date between the first and second lines, obvi-<lb/>
ously an afterthought. He had to break it up at either end of the title and cut it<lb/>
down to a size that would fit between the lines. He used a similarly compressed<lb/>
cursive to mend a mistake in the fifth line of text, correcting the word “when”<lb/>
to “whenever.” This sequence of events explains the smudged title, the inserted<lb/>
date, and the amateurish script. Other mistakes provide opportunities for Allen<lb/>
and Sneff to devise an elaborate argument for the early origins and historical<lb/>
significance of the Sussex Declaration. These too can be explained by viewing<lb/>
them in a bibliographical context, a means of understanding the copying process<lb/>
in manuscript and print.<lb/>
<pb n="112"/>
The bibliographical record begins in 1776 with the broadside printed in the shop<lb/>
of John Dunlap and continues through the eighteenth century with its letter-<lb/>
press progeny in newspapers and broadsides. In the nineteenth century, however,<lb/>
Americans turned to the engrossed Declaration for a validation of their republi-<lb/>
can beliefs and an affirmation of their national identity. They could buy copies<lb/>
of the manuscript reproduced the way they wanted to see it, more as an object of<lb/>
veneration than an artifact of history. They expected the text to be accurate, of<lb/>
course, but they also sought to enhance its meaning with patriotic imagery, ar-<lb/>
tistic interventions maybe strange to our eyes yet perfectly compatible with their<lb/>
concept of a facsimile. New and improved intaglio, letterpress, and lithographic<lb/>
printing technologies helped them to realize its iconic potential in copiously or-<lb/>
namented allegorical compositions, some intended to be works of art, others di-<lb/>
rected toward the bottom of the market. Good and bad, each of these prints has<lb/>
a publication history, which can tell us why some were not reliable, what went<lb/>
wrong with them, and how they caused the mistakes in the Sussex Declaration.<lb/>
<lb/>
Benjamin Owen Tyler and John Binns were the first to issue facsimiles of the<lb/>
Declaration. Tyler was a writing master, Binns a newspaper publisher, each in<lb/>
his own way well qualified to produce and market patriotic prints. Tyler stole a<lb/>
march on Binns, who had issued proposals in March 1816 but allowed his artists<lb/>
to take their time and did not finish his version until October 1819. Tyler issued<lb/>
his in May 1818 at half the price his rival had announced. And as a further provo-<lb/>
cation, he launched an advertising campaign capitalizing on an endorsement he<lb/>
had received from Thomas Jefferson. Binns took the bait and complained about<lb/>
the interloper’s exploitive tactics. Quick to take offense, eager for publicity, the<lb/>
facsimilists fought a newspaper war extolling the beauty and accuracy of their<lb/>
products while attacking the character, honesty, and patriotism of their adversar-<lb/>
ies. Both obtained impressive certificates of authenticity, Tyler from the Acting<lb/>
Secretary of State Richard Rush, Binns from Secretary of State John Quincy<lb/>
Adams. Both embellished the text in styles fashionable at that time. Tyler showed<lb/>
off his skills in penmanship by transcribing the text in ornamental scripts, some<lb/>
more elaborate than others but reaching a rhetorical crescendo in the “emphati-<lb/>
cal words” at the end. Binns opted for an allegorical design, an oval “cordon of<lb/>
honor” composed of state seals surrounding the text and surmounted by symbols<lb/>
of prosperity next to medallion portraits of Washington, Hancock and Jefferson.<lb/>
The fifty-six signatures beneath the text were the only portions of these prints<lb/>
rendered in what we would consider a facsimile, Tyler’s truer to the original than<lb/>
Binns’s, both with distinctive traits that make them easily identifiable. The writ-<lb/>
ing master improved some of the signatures, unconsciously correcting marks of<lb/>
infirmity and haste. The signatures in the allegorical print had to be truncated<lb/>
in places to fit in that crowded composition.<lb/>
