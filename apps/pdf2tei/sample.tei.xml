        <title>John Carter: An Assessment
and a Handlist</title>

        <lb/>J
        <lb/>OHN CARTER WAS ONE OF THE MOST PROMINENT AND SIGNIFICANT
        <lb/>figures in the Anglo-American book world in the twentieth
        <lb/>century. Indeed, he held a unique position, for he distinguished
        <lb/>himself as a bookseller, a collector, a scholar, and a writer, equally
        <lb/>at home and equally recognized on both sides of the Atlantic.
        <lb/>He created innovative rare-book catalogues for the Scribner Book Store;
        <lb/>formed several notable collections, especially of Catullus and Housman;
        <lb/>was a pioneer investigator of the bibliographical problems of nineteenth-
        <lb/>century publishers' bindings; performed (with Graham Pollard) a classic
        <lb/>piece of bibliographical detection in uncovering the Wise-Forman forger-
        <lb/>ies; produced a scholarly edition of Sir Thomas Browne's Urne Buriall and
        <lb/>the Garden of Cyrus; and wrote (or co-wrote or co-edited) several celebrated
        <lb/>works-An Enquiry into the Nature of Certain Nineteenth Century Pamphlets
        <lb/>(1934), Taste and Technique in Book-Collecting (1948), ABC for Book-Collectors
        <lb/>(1952), and Printing and the Mind of Man (1967).

        <lb/>A record of his published writings is obviously a basic guide to his ac-
        <lb/>complishment. But such a record is also desirable for another reason that
        <lb/>would not apply to many people: nearly every piece he wrote, no matter
        <lb/>how small (including brief reviews and letters to editors), is worth reading
        <lb/>for its style and wit. I am therefore presenting here a handlist (following in
        <lb/>Carter's tradition of handlist-writing) that will enable readers to find these
        <lb/>pieces. Carter published so prolifically (some 1500 items are known) in such
        <lb/>a wide array of venues that there are bound to be many items I have missed,
        <lb/>especially among his letters to editors. But what is here is a comprehensive
        <lb/>nucleus to which additions can be made. As Carter said in his handlist of
        <lb/>Stanley Morison, it is
