In the<lb/>\nspring of 1941 he could report, in reference to the Maggs shop, that “the<lb/>\nnightingale is still singing in Berkeley Square—this year in the key of B<lb/>\nminor” (19&#160;April&#160;1941).<lb/>\n<lb/>\nOne of the high points of the war years for him, and one of the most<lb/>\nemotional, was the occasion (7&#160;July&#160;1941) when he presented to Churchill<lb/>\nthe manuscript of Clough’s poem that Churchill had read in a radio broad-<lb/>\ncast two months earlier; his charming account, in the issue of 2&#160;August<lb/>\n1941, is “Clough to Churchill.” On that occasion he also gave Churchill<lb/>\na copy of <hi rend=\"italic\">Grim&#160;Glory</hi>, the 1941 book of wartime photographs edited by his<lb/>\nwife, for which he had composed the dedication to Churchill. (Five years<lb/>\nearlier, on 26&#160;December&#160;1936, he had married Ernestine&#160;Fantl, a native<lb/>\nof Savannah, Georgia, who was then the curator of architecture at the<lb/>\nMuseum of Modern Art.) The most memorable of all these pieces, “A<lb/>\nBookseller’s Day in London” (2&#160;November&#160;1940), reports that “it’s three<lb/>\nweeks now since I went to sleep not hearing a German bomber some-<lb/>\nwhere overhead”; and he wakes up to “the now all too familiar sound of<lb/>\nthe demolition squads shovelling piles of broken glass into trucks.” Instead<lb/>\nof reading the morning papers he turns to a favorite essay by his great-<lb/>\ngreat-uncle William Johnson Cory, “which makes me think of sanity and<lb/>\nthe classics and all the things I was brought up to respect.” His account of<lb/>\nhis day’s routine under wartime conditions is journalism at its best, vividly<lb/>\nconveying the atmosphere of a particular time and place.<lb/>\n<lb/>\nCarter’s major book of the 1940s resulted from his being asked to de-<lb/>\nliver the Sandars Lectures in Bibliography at Cambridge in 1947. Entitled<lb/>\n<hi rend=\"italic\">Taste and Technique in Book-Collecting</hi>, the book was published on 26&#160;July<lb/>\n1948 by R.&#160;R.&#160;Bowker in New&#160;York (the publisher of <hi rend=\"italic\">Publishers’ Weekly</hi>)<lb/>\nand, three months later (on 29&#160;October), by Cambridge University Press<lb/>\nin England. (The Cambridge edition is preferable, with its wonderful<lb/>\ntypography, its comfortable feel in the hand, and its old-fashioned use<lb/>\nof recto running-titles, obviously written by Carter, that summarize the<lb/>\ncontent of each two-page spread—this last a feature of the <hi rend=\"italic\">Enquiry</hi> also.<lb/>\nFor typographic excellence, the book was named one of the “Fifty Books<lb/>\nof the Year” by the National Book League.) It is, in my opinion, Carter’s<lb/>\nbest book, and the best book about book collecting ever written. Although<lb/>\nit has many devotees, it has nevertheless been overshadowed by several<lb/>\nof his other books. The reason may be its title, which sounds like a how-<lb/>\nto manual. But the book is actually a perceptive historical study of book<lb/>\ncollecting, along with an account of the role of taste and technique (that<lb/>\nis, connoisseurship) in making it a serious scholarly pursuit. He states in<lb/>\nthe preface that it is “not a primer or a text-book or a manual for begin-<lb/>\nners” but rather “a somewhat ruminative treatise”—or, as he later says,<lb/>\n</p>",
