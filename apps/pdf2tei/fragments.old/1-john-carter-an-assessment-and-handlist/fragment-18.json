When, in the issue of 20 December <lb/>\n1941, he looked back on his PW writings, he found “some couched in <lb/>\nthe intolerant language of youth, others in the autocratic style of middle <lb/>\nage, but none of them expressing sentiments to which their writer would <lb/>\nnot still subscribe.” They include some of the best articles he ever wrote.<lb/>\nAt the same time Carter was playing a role in the creation of another <lb/>\noutlet for book-world news, the back page of the Times Literary Supplement. <lb/>\nMichael Sadleir was the prime mover in this endeavor: in early 1931 he <lb/>\nconvened a group of friends (including Carter, Pollard, Percy Muir, John <lb/>\nHayward, and Dudley Massey) to discuss with Simon Nowell-Smith, a <lb/>\nnew member of the Times staff, the possibility of expanding the cover- <lb/>\nage of the book world on the TLS back page from the limited “Notes <lb/>\non Sales” it presently carried. This group, which became known as the <lb/>\n“Biblio Boys,” continued (with an evolving membership) to have monthly <lb/>\ndinners for many decades; it stands as a major example of the role that <lb/>\nsocial connections and personal communication can play in the respon- <lb/>\nsible development of a field (as glimpsed in Bertram Rota catalogue 290, <lb/>\nThe Biblio-Boys, 1999). The earliest instance of the group’s influence was <lb/>\nthe invigoration of the TLS back page, which did become a widely fol- <lb/>\nlowed forum for the antiquarian-book world. Carter was by far its most <lb/>\nprolific contributor—and, beginning in 1946 during Stanley Morison’s <lb/>\neditorship, its formally appointed supervisor, a position he kept (except <lb/>\nduring his Washington years, 1953-55) until 1967, when the bibliographi- <lb/>\ncal page ceased to be a regular feature. He wrote about 700 reviews for <lb/>\nthe TLS between 1931 and the end of his life, along with some 300 other <lb/>\npieces (letters, articles, and notes, many of them amounting to additional <lb/>\nreviews). His sensible and well-expressed views (which had a scholarly <lb/>\nunderpinning) were thereby given wide circulation. But the TLS policy of <lb/>\nanonymity meant that most readers (those not privy to book-world gos- <lb/>\nsip) were not aware that Carter’s was the dominant voice through which <lb/>\nthey were being provided with remarkably thorough coverage from the <lb/>\nantiquarian-book world, including reports of auctions and exhibitions as <lb/>\nwell as reviews of bibliographical journals and books.<lb/>\nAnother product of the Biblio Boys’ conversations, though of much <lb/>\nshorter duration, was Bibliographical Notes &amp; Queries, a periodical that <lb/>\nMuir undertook to edit from the Elkin Mathews shop, beginning in Janu- <lb/>\nary of 1935. Carter did his part to make the journal succeed by furnishing <lb/>\na large number of queries and replies (many under pseudonyms), covering <lb/>\na wide range of topics, from publishing practices to specific books (often <lb/>\nwith substantial discussions). But the services to scholarship provided by <lb/>\nthe journal were not sufficiently used to allow it to continue past the May <lb/>\n1939 issue. It was nevertheless a valiant attempt to promote the inter-<lb/>",
