He specifies one of its com-<lb/>panions: ‘The Richardson collection contains a manuscript in which the poet<lb/>has transcribed from his <hi rend=\"italic\">Pastorals</hi> the various lines he thought defective, and …<lb/>referred the task of selection to Walsh, who has jotted down his decisions at the<lb/>bottom of Pope’s remarks’.<hi rend=\"sup\">35</hi> This is certainly the manuscript (Smith, ‘Alexander<lb/>Pope’, <hi rend=\"italic\">PoA</hi> 274) which, having long been a companion to the autograph fair copy<lb/>of the <hi rend=\"italic\">Pastorals</hi>, was sold separately from it at the Houghton sale of&amp;nbsp;1980, and was<lb/>Lot&amp;nbsp;381 in the Roy&amp;nbsp;Davids sale at Bonhams, 8&amp;nbsp;May&amp;nbsp;2013.<lb/><lb/>29. <hi rend=\"italic\">Works of Alexander Pope</hi>, ed.&amp;nbsp;Elwin and Courthope, 3. 127–157 passim; Wasserman,<lb/><hi rend=\"italic\">Pope’s Epistle to Bathurst</hi>, 60 notes that the ‘Chauncy MS’ readings derive from the Huntington<lb/>manuscripts.<lb/>30. <hi rend=\"italic\">Works of Alexander Pope</hi>, ed.&amp;nbsp;Elwin and Courthope, 3. 172–178 passim (cf.&amp;nbsp;Mack, ed.,<lb/><hi rend=\"italic\">Last and Greatest Art</hi>, 160–162); ‘the ignoble shout of Guise’ (3.&amp;nbsp;172) is a bad emendation of the<lb/>manuscript reading ‘the noble shout of Guise’.<lb/>31. <hi rend=\"italic\">Works of Alexander Pope</hi>, ed.&amp;nbsp;Elwin and Courthope, 3. 241–273 passim (cf.&amp;nbsp;Mack, ed.,<lb/><hi rend=\"italic\">Last and Greatest Art</hi>, 424–430 and 436–450); Elwin’s reference to plural manuscripts is <hi rend=\"italic\">Works</hi>,<lb/>1.&amp;nbsp;xviii.<lb/>32. <hi rend=\"italic\">Works of Alexander Pope</hi>, ed.&amp;nbsp;Elwin and Courthope, 3. 289–300 passim, and 3.&amp;nbsp;279, 400<lb/>n 2 (cf.&amp;nbsp;Mack, ed., <hi rend=\"italic\">Last and Greatest Art</hi>, 172–186).<lb/>33. <hi rend=\"italic\">Works of Alexander Pope</hi>, ed.&amp;nbsp;Elwin and Courthope, 4. 271 n 2; Vander&amp;nbsp;Meulen, <hi rend=\"italic\">Pope’s<lb/>Dunciad of 1728</hi>, 43.<lb/>34. <hi rend=\"italic\">Works of Alexander Pope</hi>, ed.&amp;nbsp;Elwin and Courthope, 1.&amp;nbsp;239.<lb/>35. <hi rend=\"italic\">Works of Alexander Pope</hi>, ed.&amp;nbsp;Elwin and Courthope, 1.&amp;nbsp;240.<lb/>",
