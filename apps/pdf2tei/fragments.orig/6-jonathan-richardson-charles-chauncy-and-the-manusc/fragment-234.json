Smith suggests that it could,<lb/>\narguing that the ‘Epistle on Taste’ manuscript, 485 above, was catalogued as Lot<lb/>\n111 in the Samuel sale with a note of its Chauncy provenance, and that the ‘Ethic<lb/>\nEpistles’ was catalogued as Lot 112, and ‘by virtue of its juxtaposition to Lot 111<lb/>\nmay also have come from Chauncey’. She also notes that a manuscript of Epistle<lb/>\nIV of the Essay on Man was acquired by Pierpont Morgan in 1909, and argues<lb/>\nthat ‘this suggests that there were more Chauncy MSS in circulation than had<lb/>\nreached the sale rooms in 1889’. So there were, as we have seen: the Chauncy<lb/>\nfamily sold their manuscripts in 1887, and not all of these were bought by Nas-<lb/>\nsau Lees to return to the market in 1889. But the only Pope manuscript with a<lb/>\ndefinite Chauncy provenance which Smith can identify as having been sold after<lb/>\n1889 without having been part of the Nassau Lees sale is the ‘Epistle on Taste’<lb/>\nmanuscript which, as we have seen, was sold as Lot 485 with the Chauncy manu-<lb/>\nscripts in 1887. There is no reason to believe that the Chauncy family withheld<lb/>\nany of their literary manuscripts from the sale of 1887 for separate sale at around<lb/>\nthe same time, and the statement made at that time by their family lawyer sug-<lb/>\ngests that they did not do so. In that case, if the Samuel manuscript of the Essay on<lb/>\nMan is to be distinguished from the manuscripts now at the Morgan Library and<lb/>\nHarvard, it was never a Chauncy manuscript. That is of course perfectly possible<lb/>\n— Charles Chauncy bought all of Jonathan Richardson’s literary manuscripts of<lb/>\nPope apart from the Pastorals, but there were manuscripts which Richardson, and<lb/>\ntherefore Chauncy, never possessed, for instance the manuscript of Epistle IV<lb/>\nwhich has just been mentioned — but a hypothetical Chauncy provenance can-<lb/>\nnot be part of the argument for the existence of a third Essay on Man manuscript.<lb/><lb/>\n487 Epistle III to Lord Bathurst. The original Autograph MS. of Pope, with<lb/>\nhis numerous alterations and corrections, wanting 8 lines at end. Transcript of the<lb/>\nsame by Mr. Pope, with his autograph corrections and alterations, and the<lb/>\nprinted edition of Epistles III to VII, with numerous MS. corrections and<lb/>\nalterations by Pope himself. Also Epistle II, Autograph MS. of Pope, with<lb/>\nhis MS. alterations and corrections | folio.<lb/>\n£21 to Thompson, and thence to Nassau Lees, at whose sale the same body of<lb/>\nmaterial was Lot 81: the manuscript of ‘Epistle II’, the Epistle to a Lady, is now<lb/>\nunlocated; the two manuscripts of ‘Epistle III’, the Epistle to Bathurst, are now<lb/>\nHuntington HM 6007 and 6008; ‘the printed edition of Epistles III to VII, with<lb/>\nnumerous MS. corrections and alterations by Pope himself’ is extracted from<lb/>\nPope’s Works, volume II (1735), with collations in Richardson’s hand rather than<lb/>\nPope’s, and is now Huntington HM 6009 (Smith, ‘Alexander Pope’, 2 and PoA<lb/>\n65, 67–70).<lb/><lb/>\n22. HM 6007 and 6008 are reproduced in Earl R. Wasserman, Pope’s Epistle to Bathurst:<lb/>\nA Critical Reading, with an Edition of the Manuscripts (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Press, 1960).<lb/>\nA somewhat fuller description of HM 6009 is in Koon, ‘Pope’s First Editors’, 22.<lb/>\n</p>",
