She in turn left her books to her daughter<lb/>\nCharlotte Chauncy by her will, proved in 1841 (PROB&amp;nbsp;11/1940/325), but Char-<lb/>\nlotte appears to have predeceased her, and the movement of the books within the<lb/>\nChauncy family for the next&amp;nbsp;46&amp;nbsp;years is unclear. In&amp;nbsp;1887, however, the barrister<lb/>\nand antiquary William Thorpe wrote a letter to the <hi rend=\"italic\">Times</hi> about a completely<lb/>\ndifferent manuscript with a Chauncy provenance, in which he stated that ‘I am<lb/>\ninformed by the family solicitor, Mr.&amp;nbsp;Teesdale&amp;nbsp;... that when the Chauncy collec-<lb/>\ntions were disposed of by&amp;nbsp;... Sotheby in&amp;nbsp;1790, the autographs were retained by<lb/>\nthe family, who have now sent them to the hammer’ (<hi rend=\"italic\">Times</hi>, 17&amp;nbsp;September&amp;nbsp;1887,<lb/>\n7; repeated in essentials <hi rend=\"italic\">Times</hi>, 4&amp;nbsp;October&amp;nbsp;1887, 3).
