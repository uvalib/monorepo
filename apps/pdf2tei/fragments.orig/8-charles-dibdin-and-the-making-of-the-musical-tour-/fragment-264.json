A theatre had <lb/>\nbeen opened in 1781, but Worcester was not known for its culture. Swift, though <lb/>\nmostly resident in Dublin, owned a house there. His father, Deane Swift, died at <lb/>\nWorcester in 1783, and the dedication to <hi rend=\"italic\">The Temple of Folly</hi> is dated “Worcester, <lb/>\nApril 12th, 1787.”<hi rend=\"sup\">10</hi> It is easy to imagine an eccentric Irishman with strong literary <lb/>\ninterests being glad to welcome the diversions Dibdin offered. Dibdin stayed in <lb/>\nWorcester a full two weeks on his second visit, considerably longer than he usually <lb/>\nstayed at one place on his tour; there was thus plenty of time for him and Swift to <lb/>\nsee each other. It is possible Dibdin had already conceived the idea of publishing <lb/>\nan account of his tour in a series of letters; but, even if this were the case, it was <lb/>\nthe conversations with Swift that prompted him to start work. Given the dates, <lb/>\nthough, it is more likely that the whimsical, “visionary” Swift came up with the <lb/>\nidea of a <hi rend=\"italic\">Musical Tour</hi>—perhaps in response to Dibdin’s lively stories about his <lb/>\nexperiences—making him, given what I have suggested above, a vital influence <lb/>\non Dibdin’s career, though one which has gone entirely unrecognized.<lb/>\nDibdin directed a first <hi rend=\"smallcaps\">MT</hi> letter to Swift on 16 August, just two days after <lb/>\nleaving Worcester. It can certainly be called “visionary” in the plans it lays out. <lb/>\nDibdin, now in Hereford, promises that, in addition to a basic narrative of his <lb/>\nmovements and experiences, the planned book will<lb/>\ngive the public some useful hints relative to inns, manufactories, natural and artificial <lb/>\ncuriosities, the state of the country as to cultivation, and such other particulars as have <lb/>\ncursorily struck me. . . . Having also had many opportunities of conversing with men of <lb/>\ngenius, I shall communicate my remarks on those conversations; in which, in particular, <lb/>\nwill be comprised my sentiments on <hi rend=\"italic\">Music</hi> in all its points of view. . . . Another object <lb/>\nwhich peculiarly demands my attention is the <hi rend=\"italic\">Theatre</hi>. Nor will a fair exposition of <lb/>\nits arcana come by any means improperly through the medium of this publication. An <lb/>\naccount of the motives which induce me to quit my native country are a part of my <lb/>\ncompact with the public, and they cannot be enumerated without relating many theatri-<lb/>\ncal transactions. . . . These matters, together with a prodigious number of observations, <lb/>\nboth of my own and others, on all general subjects—anecdotes, and the essence of what <lb/>\nI have delivered, at different places, under the title of <hi rend=\"italic\">Readings and Music</hi>, will make <lb/>\nup a series of letters. (2–4)<lb/>\nImportantly, this first letter shows Dibdin envisaging a much more dialogic work <lb/>\nthan that which eventually emerged. He describes Swift, remarkably, and with <lb/>\na good deal of flattery, as “the best judge I know of all general subjects, whether <lb/>\nnatural or acquired” (1). And crucially, in the conclusion, he expresses a hope <lb/>\nthat the letters “with the advantage of your [Swift’s] sentiments on each separate <lb/>\nletter, [will] be found to excite and satisfy public curiosity” (4).
