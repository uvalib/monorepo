  "tei": "<pb n=\"335\"/>\nBy a chance that could only have happened in the era of the Internet, I came<lb/>\nacross a joint application by Thurston and Dudley for a U.S. patent:<hi rend=\"sup\">23</hi><lb/>\nPatent application filed April 15, 1913. Serial no. 761,151. Book cover. Charles W.<lb/>\nThurston and Sarah Emery Dudley, United States Citizens residing at London. Patent<lb/>\nissued by the United States Patent Office, July 14, 1914, no. 1,103,102.<lb/>\nThe application is for a book cover incorporating a slot on the inside into<lb/>\nwhich a card can be inserted. The invention is trivial, but the technical draw-<lb/>\ning accompanying it (figure 4) shows the unmistakable emblem of The Broth-<lb/>\ners, just as it appears on the front paste-down of the 1913 edition of <hi rend=\"italic\">Comte de<lb/>\nGabalis</hi>. And there are the signatures of Charles W. Thurston and Sarah Emery<lb/>\nDudley. Simultaneously with the first edition, they had planted this clue to The<lb/>\nBrothers’ identity where no one would think of looking for it. It also revealed<lb/>\nThurston’s first name, making it possible to track him down.<hi rend=\"sup\">24</hi> In 2021 I ac-<lb/>\nquired sixteen letters written in the 1920s and 1930s to Hurwitz from Brunton,<lb/>\nThurston, and Thurston’s wife, which supplied further biographical informa-<lb/>\ntion on all of them.<hi rend=\"sup\">25</hi><lb/>\nCharles Willis Thurston (1872–1937) was born near Boston into an inventor’s<lb/>\nfamily. As a boy he “gathered mushrooms in Emerson’s front yard”<hi rend=\"sup\">26</hi> and fre-<lb/>\nquented the local Native Americans. He left a faint trail in the Boston art scene.<hi rend=\"sup\">27</hi><lb/>\nBy 1908 he was among the host of American artists exhibiting in Paris. Thus<lb/>\nhe was almost certainly the unnamed illustrator of our edition. I do not know<lb/>\nwhether there were any other Brothers, nor who was Thurston’s own master. His<lb/>\nteachings partly resemble those of Thomas Lake Harris (1823–1906), founder of<lb/>\nthe Brotherhood of the New Life, who consorted with fairies and claimed to be<lb/>\nmarried to a queen in their realm.<lb/>\nA tentative conclusion emerges from this: that Sarah or Lotus Dudley met<lb/>\nThurston in London after her husband’s death. He instructed her in psychic and<lb/>\nesoteric matters, and they collaborated on the <hi rend=\"italic\">Comte de Gabalis</hi>. While the occult<lb/>\nmaterial was Thurston’s, by page-count it is in small proportion to the excerpts<lb/>\nfrom classical works, quotations, summaries, supplements, and comparisons that<lb/>\nfill out the 377 pages, not to mention the translation itself. Dudley, with her<lb/>\nBryn Mawr education and the British Museum at hand, was easily capable of<lb/>\nsuch work. She probably financed the 1913 London edition and the New York<lb/>\nedition of the following year. In 1922, with the earlier editions impossible to find,<lb/>\n<lb/>\n23. The patent application was revealed in a YouTube talk of May 25, 2021, entitled<lb/>\n“Who Wrote the <hi rend=\"italic\">Dayspring of Youth</hi>?” I am grateful to the presenter, identified only as<lb/>\n“MtalksX,” for this vital piece of information.<lb/>\n24. On his ancestry, see the <hi rend=\"italic\">Frost Genealogy</hi> (https://archive.org/stream/<lb/>\nfrostgenealogyin00fros/frostgenealogyin00fros_djvu.txt) and <hi rend=\"italic\">Thurston Genealogies</hi>, compiled by<lb/>\nBrown Thurston (Portland, Maine: Compiler, 1880), 232.<lb/>\n25. Charles Thurston married Aileen Winifred Cook (1889 or 1890–1953) on April 30,<lb/>\n1921. The marriage certificate describes both as “Artist and decorator.” The letters to Hur-<lb/>\nwitz will be made accessible on the website of the Paul Brunton Philosophic Foundation.
