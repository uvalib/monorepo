  "tei": "<pb n=\"334\"/>\n a group of young aspirants living a Bohemian existence in postwar Bloomsbury.<lb/>\nTheir mentor, the White Brother of the title, is an older occultist called “Brother <lb/>\nM” who takes them on astral journeys and other adventures.<lb/>\nThe book is actually a roman à clef. Michael Juste was a pseudonym of Michael <lb/>\nHurwitz (1897-1961), author, poet, playwright, and, under the name of Michael <lb/>\nHoughton, founder and proprietor of the Atlantis Bookshop, which still exists <lb/>\n(as of 2024) near the British Museum. His nephew, the eminent English violinist <lb/>\nEmanuel Hurwitz, remembered him as “a benevolent white magician.”<hi rend=\"sup\">18</hi><lb/>\nMichael’s friend, called “David” in the book, is securely identified as Raphael Hurst <lb/>\n(1898-1981), who would become a best-selling author on spirituality under the <lb/>\nname of Paul Brunton.<hi rend=\"sup\">19</hi> Brunton’s son, Kenneth Thurston Hurst (1923-2009), <lb/>\nhas confirmed that Brother M was a family friend and his own godfather (witness <lb/>\nKenneth’s middle name). But he only knew him as Mr. Thurston, an American <lb/>\npainter living in London and specializing in lacquer work for upscale department <lb/>\nstores. No one hitherto had been able to identify him.<lb/>\nThere are two further books authored simply by M and bearing The Brothers’ <lb/>\nemblem. The first was The Dayspring of Youth (1933), advertised by the pub-<lb/>\nlisher as “By One of the Brothers.”<hi rend=\"sup\">20</hi> The reviewer in Psychic Science speculated <lb/>\nthat M “seems to be identical with Michael Juste, author of White Brother.”<hi rend=\"sup\">21</hi> It <lb/>\nwas a good guess, but missed the mark.<lb/>\nA second book by M, The Lord God of Truth Within, was compiled by Hurwitz <lb/>\nand published in 1941 by the press of the esoteric entrepreneur Manly Palmer <lb/>\nHall.<hi rend=\"sup\">22</hi> It is subtitled A Posthumous Sequel to The Dayspring of Youth, and includes <lb/>\nanecdotes about sylphs and gnomes who are M’s personal friends.<lb/>\nM mentions Comte de Gabalis in both books. In Dayspring he prefaces a long <lb/>\nquotation with the words: “In a book previously mentioned by us, The Comte <lb/>\nde Gabalis, we have written this passage about prayer . . .” (p. 326). In The Lord <lb/>\nGod of Truth Within, M writes: “we have spoken about [Merlin] in a former book <lb/>\n[footnote] Comte de Gabalis.” (p. 159) The three books form a coherent, if idio-<lb/>\nsyncratic, body of doctrine.<lb/>\nYet the 1922 edition loudly claimed to be the work of Lotus Dudley. My <lb/>\nfirst unpleasant suspicion was that she had appropriated Thurston’s work and <lb/>\nrepublished it under her own name(s). He could have been referring to this when <lb/>\nhe wrote, in the Preface to The Dayspring of Youth, “as certain people in the past <lb/>\nhave assumed authorship of some of my writings, all publications of the Brothers <lb/>\nwill be issued in future under their seal and copyrighted” (p. 7). But this does <lb/>\nnot accord with what is known of Dudley’s character. The references to Comte de <lb/>\nGabalis in Thurston’s later books, carefully read, do not claim authorship: they <lb/>\nmerely say that his words have appeared in it.<lb/>\n18.
