Suarez, S.J. for supporting those projects.<lb/>A number of other colleagues greatly aided this work: Ann Dinsdale and Sarah Laycock at the Brontë Parsonage Museum provided not only access to rare and fragile materials, some of which were on display, but also expert guidance on their respective collections.<lb/>Alexandra Ault, Karen Limper-Herz, Alexander Lock, and Laura Walker provided key assistance at the British Library.<lb/>I am also grateful to Tim Dolin and David Vander Meulen, who both provided feedback toward the final stage of publishing this article.<lb/>I am most indebted, however, to Terry Belanger, for reading this essay in its own various stages of composition during what turned out to be an unprecedented global pandemic.<lb/>His bibliographical expertise, learned observations, and helpful suggestions improved this work at every turn.<lb/>Finally, my own bibliographical research would not have been possible without his support and the early training that I received at Rare Book School.<lb/>This work is dedicated to him.</p></note>",
