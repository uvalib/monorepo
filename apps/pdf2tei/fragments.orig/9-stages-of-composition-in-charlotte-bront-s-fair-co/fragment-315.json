The lack of any<lb/>\n  underlying pencil numbering, combined with the wove paper stock, confirms that this was a<lb/>\n  later addition, while the presence of brown numbering suggests that the alteration was made<lb/>\n  before Brontë introduced the red-ink sequence into the MS. The asterisk corresponds to the<lb/>\n  partial-leaf excision present on f.
