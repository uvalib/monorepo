The reading also conflates Brontë’s identity with her work—a fallacy that <lb/>\n is traceable to earlier feminist studies, such as Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar’s <lb/>\n landmark study <hi rend=\"italic\">The Madwoman in the Attic</hi>, which employ metaphors of illness <lb/>\n (in the case of Gilbert and Gubar, “female schizophrenia” and “dis-ease”) in an <lb/>\n effort to identify the very real, adverse effects of patriarchal structures on nine-<lb/>\n teenth-century women writers.<hi rend=\"sup\">56</hi> The result in this instance is an argument that <lb/>\n purports to be based on material evidence but that hinges on a literal psychologi-<lb/>\n cal diagnosis of a woman author who surely deserves less armchair analysis—and <lb/>\n instead more bibliographical attention—from her twenty-first-century critics.<lb/>\n Finally, Marin’s study offers up an interpretation of the manuscript that is at <lb/>\n odds with its material construction.<hi rend=\"sup\">57</hi> Marin argues that only two of the 28 exci-<lb/>\n sions that Brontë made entailed any substitution with another text— evidence <lb/>\n that leads her to conclude that Brontë was intent on merely eliminating passages <lb/>\n from the novel.<hi rend=\"sup\">58</hi> Yet, of the 28 excisions that I have documented, 11 excisions <lb/>\n entail textual changes, including substantial revisions that required either the <lb/>\n recopying of leaves or the addition of new leaves that expanded the length of <lb/>\n the manuscript. And so, by my calculation, 39% of the excisions present in the <lb/>\n manuscript were made as part of a series of substantial, later-stage revisions or <lb/>\n expansions to the manuscript—some of which actually increased its size, rather <lb/>\n than reducing it. Brontë often excised the upper or lower portions of leaves <lb/>\n owing to changes made to the content in the sections of leaves falling between <lb/>\n them. These inserted leaves bear new writing that, at a casual glance, seem to be <lb/>\n part of one continuous draft. When taking additional leaf removals into account <lb/>\n along with partial-leaf excisions, there are a total of 41 instances of removals that <lb/>\n entailed expansions. In short, when Brontë removed either full leaves or portions <lb/>\n of them, it was often with the aim of introducing new or revised content.<lb/>\n <head>3. <hi rend=\"italic\">Paper as Evidence</hi></head><lb/>\n To investigate how a manuscript was composed and edited—and to identify <lb/>\n any excisions or revisions made to it—requires a very close look at its physical <lb/>\n structure.

In her analysis, Marin mentions 906 folios (see p. 27)—numbers that <lb/>\n do not reflect either the Clarendon analysis (which she cites just once in her article) or the <lb/>\n 896-leaf count of the British Museum and BL. Her count likely includes some combination of <lb/>\n endpapers or fly-leaves inserted by bookbinders. In addition, Marin mentions 28 excisions (p. <lb/>\n 27), but her footnote (p. 29) lists just 25 leaves bearing excisions—and this list includes five <lb/>\n leaves that are entirely intact, per my own direct examination of the manuscript and also the <lb/>\n study of the Clarendon editors: BM ff. 149 and 150, vol. 1; BM ff. 9, 45, and 252, vol. 2. It is <lb/>\n unclear how Marin identified these intact leaves as bearing excisions.<lb/>\n <hi rend=\"sup\">58.</hi> Marin, “Charlotte Brontë’s Heron Scissors,” 27.<lb/>",
