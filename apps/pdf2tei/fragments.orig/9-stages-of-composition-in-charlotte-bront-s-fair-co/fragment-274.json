Indeed, the royalist senti-<lb/>ments in the MT represent another aspect of this remarkable book’s transfor-<lb/>mative significance in his career, for Dibdin had previously felt very differently<lb/>about the House of Hanover. The major royal event during the period he pub-<lb/>lished <hi rend=\"italic\">The Devil</hi> was the death of Princess Amelia, George III’s aunt and the last<lb/>surviving child of George II, on 31 October 1786. <hi rend=\"italic\">The Devil</hi> includes a complaint<lb/>that “<hi rend=\"smallcaps\">THE</hi> papers, and indeed the whole town [are] at this time absurdly full<lb/>of the death of the Princess Amelia,” and offers, as an antidote, a humorous<lb/>“Impromptu”:<lb/>Amelia in the ground doth lie,<lb/>And black of course is worn in common;<lb/>Hard that so many men must dye!<lb/>In compliment to one old woman.<hi rend=\"sup\">21</hi><lb/>This was probably, though not certainly, written by Dibdin, who in either case<lb/>was happy to print it, as his only comment on the Princess’s death. After the MT,<lb/>such sentiments disappear from his writing, and on the contrary he went out of<lb/>his way to celebrate royal events, as for example with his <hi rend=\"italic\">Ode in Honour of the<lb/>Nuptials of Their Royal Highnesses the Prince and Princess of Wales</hi> (1795). In the wake<lb/>of the French Revolution, Dibdin’s popular brand of royalism, diffused through<lb/>dozens of songs, did much to shore up loyalist feeling in England.<lb/>The publication of the MT was set for 12 May. On 26 April, Dibdin and<lb/>Gales claimed they had “nearly five Hundred” subscribers, some of whom had<lb/>subscribed for multiple copies, and that the subscription would close on 1 May.<hi rend=\"sup\">22</hi><lb/>By the time Gales printed the list of “Subscribers’ Names,” 557 copies were<lb/>accounted for, though my own amended copy of the MT, seemingly used by<lb/>Gales as a sort of reference copy, shows that a few subscribers had withdrawn,<lb/>or been wrongly recorded in the first place. Dibdin intended to take the remain-<lb/>ing copies to India. When the volume appeared on 12 May, an “Advertisement”<lb/>at the front written by Dibdin—occupying the final leaves of the Winchester<lb/>manuscript—claimed there had been a late surge of interest, with “nearly two<lb/>hundred” extra copies subscribed for; Dibdin was accordingly extending the sub-<lb/>scription to 12 June, after which a “second edition” would be printed by John<lb/>Preston in London (Gales having “a prior engagement”). This may in part have<lb/>been marketing hype, for I have found no evidence that any second edition was<lb/>actually produced. A balanced reading of the evidence would suggest that the<lb/>book was probably oversubscribed, but not to such an extent that it made sense<lb/>to print a new edition. Nevertheless, despite his tendency to grumble, it seems<lb/>that both the musical tour and the volume he wrote about it succeeded beyond<lb/>Dibdin’s expectations.<lb/></p>\n<note n=\"21\" place=\"foot\"><lb/><hi rend=\"italic\">The Devil</hi> (London, 1786–87), 128 (No. VIII).<lb/></note>\n<note n=\"22\" place=\"foot\"><lb/>“Musical Tour,” <hi rend=\"italic\">Sheffield Register</hi>, 26 April 1788, [2].<lb/></note>",
