Is there any evidence in the <lb/>\n manuscript that accounts for the novel’s feeling of disunity or discord? Is this <lb/>\n sense of random disjunction, observed by Lewes and others, reflected in the <lb/>\n actual structure of the manuscript itself? Any attempt to address these questions <lb/>\n requires a close study of the document and its physical construction.<lb/>\n<head>1.\tThe Current State of the Manuscript</head><lb/>\nEven a quick glance at the fair-copy manuscript of <hi rend=\"italic\">Shirley</hi> suggests that many-<lb/>\nhands have modified the manuscript since it left Charlotte Brontë’s custody. Cur-<lb/>\nrently, volumes 1 and 3 are three-quarter bound in boards covered in brown <lb/>\ngoatskin and fine-grained book cloth. These recent bindings date from August <lb/>\n1976, when volumes 1 and 3 of the manuscript were rebound by the BL,<hi rend=\"sup\">28</hi> accord-<lb/>\ning to a “Record of Treatment” tipped in onto the rectos of the first of three rear <lb/>\nfree endpapers.<hi rend=\"sup\">29</hi> Volume&amp;nbsp;2 of the manuscript is still in a binding that was likely <lb/>\ncommissioned by Brontë’s publisher, George&amp;nbsp;Smith. The binding of volume&amp;nbsp;2 <lb/>\nconsists of worn, three-quarter tan calf and boards covered in marbled paper, <lb/>\nin a manner typical of the last quarter of the nineteenth century; the volume <lb/>\ncontains light brown uncoated endpapers with a single flyleaf at the front appear-<lb/>\ning to have been introduced as part of the binding process.<hi rend=\"sup\">30</hi> When the BL later <lb/>\nrebound volumes&amp;nbsp;1 and&amp;nbsp;3 in 1976, the binders discarded the endpapers, but they <lb/>\n27.&amp;nbsp;Glen, <hi rend=\"italic\">Imagination in History</hi>, 186.<lb/>\n28.&amp;nbsp;The spines of the 1976 rebind are decorated as follows: covered in brown goatskin, <lb/>\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;they feature six compartments and five raised bands (double ruling in blind around each raised <lb/>\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;band). Reading from the head of the spine down: the top compartment is empty, except for a <lb/>\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;new, white shelf-mark label that reads “$667&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;A”; the second compartment contains a deep <lb/>\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;maroon spine label that reads as follows: “[double rule in gold] | SHIRLEY [in gold] | [single <lb/>\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;rule in gold] | M.&amp;nbsp;S.&amp;nbsp;S. [in gold] | [double rule in gold]”; the third compartment is empty; the <lb/>\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;fourth compartment contains the following lettering tooled in gold: “VOL.&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;I&amp;nbsp;[III]”; the fifth <lb/>\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;compartment contains the following text tooled in gold: “GEORGE&amp;nbsp;SMITH | MEMORIAL <lb/>\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;| VOL.&amp;nbsp;IV&amp;nbsp;[VI]”; the sixth compartment contains the following text tooled in gold: “BRITISH <lb/>\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;LIBRARY | ADDITIONAL | MS. | 43,477&amp;nbsp;[43,479]”.<lb/>\n29.&amp;nbsp;The record of treatment documents that “RS” examined volume&amp;nbsp;1 of the manuscript, <lb/>\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Add&amp;nbsp;MS&amp;nbsp;43477, “after binding” on 24&amp;nbsp;August&amp;nbsp;1976. Volume&amp;nbsp;3, Add&amp;nbsp;MS&amp;nbsp;43479, is also documented as <lb/>\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;having been examined by “RS” on the same day.<lb/>\n30.&amp;nbsp;The following is a description for the spine of volume&amp;nbsp;2. The original spine is of brown <lb/>\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;leather (appears to be calf) with six compartments and five raised bands (each raised band <lb/>\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;tooled in gold with double rule) with a deep maroon spine label located in the second compart-<lb/>\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;ment [“SHIRLEY.”] tooled in gold: top compartment blank, aside from a sticker label with <lb/>\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;the old shelf-mark “670” canceled in pencil; in second compartment from top: “[double rule in <lb/>\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;gold] | SHIRLEY. | [single rule] | M.&amp;nbsp;S.&amp;nbsp;S. | [double rule in gold]”; third compartment empty; <lb/>\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;fourth compartment: “VOL.&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;II.”; fifth compartment: “GEORGE&amp;nbsp;SMITH | MEMORIAL. <lb/>\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;| VOL.&amp;nbsp;V.”; sixth compartment: “BRIT.&amp;nbsp;MUS. | ADDITIONAL | MS. | 43,478. | [old shelf <lb/>\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;mark label at bottom with the following letter in pencil] B”. These library markings were tooled <lb/>\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;onto the spine in the twentieth century.<lb/>",
