Benedict</name></byline>\n<p><hi rend=\"dropcap\">O</hi>ne of the greatest contributions to Latin American literary culture in the twentieth century came in the form of Victoria Ocampo’s literary journal <hi rend=\"italic\">Sur</hi> (1931–92).<hi rend=\"sup\">1</hi><lb/>\nWith an unparalleled life span—when compared with similar literary magazines of the time— and an astounding list of international authors who lined its pages, <hi rend=\"italic\">Sur</hi> is an exemplar of literary excellence.<lb/>\nCount-<lb/>\nless scholars and critics have discussed the pivotal role of <hi rend=\"italic\">Sur</hi> in introducing international writers to Latin American readers and simultaneously putting Latin American writers on the map for international readers.<hi rend=\"sup\">2</hi><lb/>\nAbove all, there has been a marked interest in examining <hi rend=\"italic\">Sur</hi>’s impressive networks (Willson; Larkosh; Majstorovic [2013]), its lasting impact on Latin American letters (King [1981;1986]), and its political stance (Majstorovic [2005]).<lb/>\nHowever, to date there has been no consideration of the marketing tactics employed by Ocampo to help sell the books that she produced with her publishing firm of the same name, Editorial Sur (1933–85).<hi rend=\"sup\">3</hi><lb/>\nWhile a close examination of all of these marketing strategies is out of the scope of this paper, I focus on one particular method that points to Ocampo’s deep-seated understanding of the book industry as well as to her life’s work to popularize both national and in-<lb/>\nternational works of great renown.<hi rend=\"sup\">4</hi></p>\n<p>More specifically, I examine the function of pre-publication— or teaser—book chapters in the literary journal <hi rend=\"italic\">Sur</hi>.<lb/>\nIn particular, I analyze which Editorial Sur books were excerpted in the literary</p>\n<p><hi rend=\"sup\">1</hi> The most fruitful publication period of <hi rend=\"italic\">Sur</hi> was from 1931 through 1966. During this<lb/>\nthirty-six-year period Ocampo produced 302 issues, whereas only sixty-seven issues of the jour-<lb/>\nnal she had founded appeared from 1967 through 1992. Ocampo herself passed away in 1979.</p>\n<p><hi rend=\"sup\">2</hi> See Meyer; King (1981; 1986); and Willson. Less critical attention is given to Ocampo’s<lb/>\npublishing house, Editorial Sur (1933–79).</p>\n<p><hi rend=\"sup\">3</hi> Editorial Sur published its first works in 1933 and continued to produce ten (or more)<lb/>\nbooks a year until the early 1970s. By 1985, there were no new works published under its<lb/>\nname. The firm was reestablished in 2005 and has since published a number of titles under<lb/>\nthis imprint.</p>\n<p><hi rend=\"sup\">4</hi> I am currently working on a larger project about the history of Editorial Sur that details<lb/>\nthe following marketing strategies: commonplace advertisements for Editorial Sur within the<lb/>\nliterary journal <hi rend=\"italic\">Sur</hi>; advertisements on the cover flaps of <hi rend=\"italic\">Sur</hi> for Editorial Sur works; book re-<lb/>\nviews of Editorial Sur works in <hi rend=\"italic\">Sur</hi>; inserted flyers for Editorial Sur books; and the promotional<lb/>\nsashes (or bands) that adorned many Editorial Sur books.</p>",
