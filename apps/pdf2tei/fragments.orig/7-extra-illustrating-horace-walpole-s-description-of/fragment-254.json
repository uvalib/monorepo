At the foot <lb/>of the second Index Kirgate has added a pencil note giving information on the <lb/>number of visitors to the house:<lb/>In 1786, Eighty tickets were given to different People for admission to view <lb/> Strawberry Hill<lb/>In 1787, Seventy Ditto were given<lb/>In 1789, One Hundred were given<lb/>In 1807, Mrs. Damer says about 80 or 90 are used yearly<lb/>Upon an average, about 80 were given yearly<lb/>For the period 1784 –96 we have Walpole’s manuscript “Book of Visitors,” <lb/>which broadly confirms the first three entries, but there is no comparable evidence <lb/>for the number of visitors after his death in the years of Anne Damer’s occupa-<lb/>tion.<hi rend=\"sup\">23</hi> The note also confirms that the volume, in which the earliest entries are <lb/>proofing corrections that are part of the process of printing the 1784 Description, <lb/>was annotated by Kirgate until at least 1807, only three years before his own death.<lb/>Between the two versions of the Index of Rooms is a list in pencil by Kirgate <lb/>headed “The following Drawings were made by Mr. Carter for Mr. Bull &amp; Mr. <lb/>Walpole” (see appendix below). It lists thirty-six drawings created for Bull’s copy <lb/>of the Description, while five of them were also in Walpole’s. One drawing, “Gal-<lb/>lery 10 G[uineas],” is crossed through and marked “bought by Mr. Baker”— <lb/>presumably the Strawberry Hill Press collector and bibliographer George Baker <lb/>(1781–1858). It is correct that Bull’s copy, despite its wealth of Carter watercolors <lb/>and drawings, does not have his view of the Gallery.<lb/>But as well as this additional material, there are many annotations to the text <lb/>by Kirgate, for this is his interleaved proof copy of the 1784 text. It preserves a <lb/>number of cancels that were corrected in the text as issued, and contains numer-<lb/>ous notes by him as the orchestrator of extra-illustration, and even a few notes <lb/>inserted or initiated by Walpole that throw shafts of light on Walpole’s last years <lb/>at Strawberry Hill. It is very likely that this is the copy that was lot 413 on the <lb/>eighth day of the sale of Kirgate’s library, where it was described as “containing <lb/>many Notes in MS. by T. Kirgate,” and was bought by George Baker for £16. <lb/>At Baker’s sale in 1825, it appears among some seventy-six Strawberry Hill Press <lb/>and related books and ephemera as “A Description of Strawberry Hill, with sev-<lb/>eral loose pieces interleaved, with M.S. memoranda throughout.” It was bought <lb/>by Longman for a far more modest £1.19s., a reflection of the depression in book <lb/>prices that was to be lamented in Dibdin’s Bibliophobia (1832).<hi rend=\"sup\">24</hi><lb/>To begin with Walpole’s notes, these are only on the text pages (pre-dating <lb/>the book’s being bound up interleaved) and are limited but essentially correc-<lb/>23. “Book of Visitors,” Percival Merritt Collection, Houghton Library, Harvard Uni-<lb/>versity, M.S.
