The state<lb/>\ngroupings would have had no meaning in this graphic concept and would have<lb/>\nprevented the artist from placing the signatures in an even array, although ves-<lb/>\ntiges can be detected in sequences of Maryland, North Carolina, and New Jersey<lb/>\ndelegates. Symmetry was the top priority of the artist. By a simple computation,<lb/>\nhe found a way to accommodate the fifty-six signatures in a graphic construct<lb/>\ncomposed of six columns and nine rows with the exception of the first and last<lb/>\ncolumns, which have ten signatures instead of nine.<lb/>\nAllen and Sneff argue against the priority of the Bridgham print on the grounds<lb/>\nthat the Sussex copyist could not have replicated its sequence of signatures. They<lb/>\nbelieve that he would have had to backtrack between columns if he started the<lb/>\ntranscription process by reading across the rows. Diagrams in the <hi rend=\"italic\">PBSA</hi> article<lb/>\n(pp. 401 and 402) intimate that he would have been confused by the extra names<lb/>\nin the first and last columns and could not have dealt with them to arrive at the<lb/>\nsequence in the Sussex Declaration. The transcription process does not seem all<lb/>\nthat difficult to me. The copyist proceeded through the six rows of names, one<lb/>\nname after another left to right, allowing the first and last columns to be slightly<lb/>\nstaggered. He then inserted the two extra names, Roger Sherman and Elbridge<lb/>\nGerry, to restore the alignment between the inner and outer columns. Then he<lb/>\nresumed the regular progression from left to right in the last three lines.<lb/>\nTurning that argument around, I question why Bridgham’s artist would have<lb/>\nreplicated the sequence in the Sussex Declaration. Why would he use it as a start-<lb/>\ning point and then go off and consult some other source to turn those round hand<lb/>\nnames into facsimile signatures? In the manuscript, the names occupy six rows<lb/>\nand then spill over to a seventh row containing a name and a half. What value<lb/>\nwould he have seen in that haphazard arrangement? He would have been much<lb/>\nmore interested in creating his own sequence to make a block of signatures in<lb/>\npleasing proportions. Let’s say he knew about the hidden ordering principle and<lb/>\nwished to preserve it. But why would he be privy to the secret rather than anyone<lb/>\nelse in the Declaration business? There are too many loose ends and coincidences<lb/>\nin this scenario. It is much more likely that he began with the Boston Bewick let-<lb/>\nterpress broadside, an easily adaptable model for the layout and decoration. He<lb/>\nthen reconceived it as an engraved miniature and decided on a symmetrical com-<lb/>\nposition in accordance with the aesthetic of that genre. To achieve the “neatness”<lb/>\nhighly prized in that period, he changed the order of the signatures to fit them<lb/>\nin a rectangular block, nine rows deep, six columns across. Neatness, uniformity<lb/>\nand symmetry were his goals and the real reasons for rearranging the signatures.<lb/>\n<hi rend=\"bold\">Misspelled signatures.</hi> Allen and Sneff note that the copyist misspelled<lb/>\nsome of the signatures. They cite eight problematic names, three of which might<lb/>\nbe excused as alternatives: Pinn for Penn, Rutlidge for Rutledge, Hayward for<lb/>\nHeyward. A ninth could be added to their list, a garbled superscript in the signa-<lb/>\nture of Samuel Huntington: Sam<hi rend=\"sup\">u.</hi> for Sam<hi rend=\"sup\">el</hi>. More egregious errors occur in four<lb/>\nnames: Floys for Floyd, Harnson for Harrison, Witherspoare for Witherspoon,<lb/>\nand M. Keap for M: Kean.
