Published 11 November 1969. In the “Note on the<lb/>\nText,” Carter points out that Housman’s manuscript has no title other than<lb/>\n“Cambridge inaugural.” The decision to supply a title, he says, was not his.<lb/>\n“But,” he adds, “having deferred to the decision, I discovered in myself a<lb/>\ndisinclination to defer to anyone else’s preference in such presumption;<lb/>\nso, for better or worse, the title here given to the Cambridge inaugural is<lb/>\nmine.” Carter reported two errors in a letter published in the <hi rend=\"italic\">Times Literary<lb/>\nSupplement</hi> on 27 November 1969, p. 1362: at 22.19, “preserved” should be<lb/>\n“preserve”; at 23.11, “examples” should be “example”. Carter first pub-<lb/>\nlished the lecture, omitting a short paragraph on Shelley and Swinburne,<lb/>\nin the <hi rend=\"italic\">Times Literary Supplement</hi> of 9 May 1968, with an appended “Note”<lb/>\n(E2:1968); and he had the <hi rend=\"italic\">TLS</hi> text reprinted “for private circulation” (see<lb/>\nthe preceding entry).
