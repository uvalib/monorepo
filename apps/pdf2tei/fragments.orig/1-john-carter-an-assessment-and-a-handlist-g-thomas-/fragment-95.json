In the one instance where the Archive gives a<lb/>\ncontributor’s name for one of these items assigned to Carter in the Stock Books, the<lb/>\nArchive is incorrect, as explained in the list below at 2 January 1953.<lb/>\n</p>\n<p>\nThese pieces clearly are Carter’s work and should be added to the list of<lb/>\nhis contributions. Even with them added, some of Carter’s contributions are<lb/>\nsurely still not accounted for: anyone who attentively reads the TLS back page<lb/>\nfor this period will find elements of Carter’s style in other pieces, which is not<lb/>\nsurprising since he was in charge of the back page from 1946 to 1967 (except<lb/>\nfor 1953-55, when he was in Washington). But I have not included TLS items<lb/>\nsolely on the basis of my judgment.<lb/>\n</p>\n<p>\nIt is perhaps unnecessary to tell future users<lb/>\nof this handlist that the TLS Archive, like other electronic files, may at some<lb/>\npoint be revised—with the result that the errors and omissions noted here may<lb/>\nbe corrected.<lb/>\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the first of two lists below, all the additions from the Stock Books (and four<lb/>\nother additions) are recorded. The second list brings together Carter’s major<lb/>\ncontributions to the TLS, extracted from the full listing.<lb/>\n</p>\n<head>E1. Additions to the TLS Archive’s List of Carter’s Contributions</head><lb/>\n<p>\nThe items listed here, with four exceptions, are attributed to Carter in the Stock<lb/>\nBooks but are not credited to him (or anyone, except in one case) in the electronic<lb/>\nHistorical Archive. The four additions not from the Stock Books are a letter of<lb/>\n12 August 1944, which is not credited to Carter in the Archive even though it<lb/>\nis signed; an unsigned report on the Silver sale (2 December 1965), which is<lb/>\nidentified by a cutting at Eton; some paragraphs on the Maurice Pariser sale<lb/>\nin a “Commentary” column (14 December 1967), which is identified by a type-<lb/>\nscript photocopy at the Harry Ransom Center; and some paragraphs on Stanley<lb/>\nMorison in a “Commentary” column (19 December 1968), which is identified by<lb/>\na corrected proof at Eton. (These last two items raise the possibility, indeed the<lb/>\nprobability, that Carter made other contributions to the “Commentary” column,<lb/>\nwhich began on 19 October 1967; the contributors to this column are usually not<lb/>\nidentified in the Archive.) All these pieces are unquestionably Carter’s work and<lb/>\nshould be added to the list in the Archive.<lb/>\n</p>\n<head>E1:1944</head><lb/>\n<p>L “Morris L. Parrish,” TLS, 12 August 1944, p. 396.
