New York: British Information Services, July 1945. 32 pp. Pic-<lb/>\ntorial wrappers. Printed by Alco Gravure (Hoboken, N.J.). Unsigned. In the<lb/>\nEton copy, Carter wrote: “The facts and figures came of course from the<lb/>\nInformation Division of BIS; but this booklet was written single-handed dur-<lb/>\ning three or four days’ solitary confinement in our apartment in New York.<lb/>\nI also selected the photographs, which I still think first-rate.” For Carter’s<lb/>\naccount of the publication program of British Information Services in New<lb/>\nYork (where he was in charge of publications from November 1943 through<lb/>\nOctober 1945), see his “Publishing—But for Free” (D:1945, November). In<lb/>\nthat article he refers to Victory in Burma as one of the “popular pamphlets”<lb/>\ndealing with the war but does not reveal his authorship of it. Given the huge<lb/>\nnumbers of these pamphlets that were printed, Victory in Burma<lb/>\nmust have been the most widely circulated of all Carter’s writings, with the<lb/>\npossible exception of his ABC for Book-Collectors (A:1952).
