Initially Pope <lb/>may have intended to follow up this design with heraldic headpieces for his friends <lb/>adapted from the <hi rend=\"italic\">Odyssey</hi> headpieces, but at a later stage, while various poems <lb/>were in press, he obtained fresh engravings of these arms from Kent and included <lb/>them instead. When the ‘large Quarto’ was advertised in the <hi rend=\"italic\">Grub-street Journal</hi> <lb/>on 24 April 1735, it was with ‘Copper Plates, design’d by Mr. Kent’ (Griffith, 2:287).<lb/>\n<lb/>Different engravings show up in the different formats of the <hi rend=\"italic\">Works</hi>. In the case <lb/>of the first poem in the collection, <hi rend=\"italic\">An Essay on Man</hi>, the large-paper folios used the <lb/>sheets of the collected edition of 1734 (Foxon P851). I suspect that by this point in <lb/>his career Pope had recognized that large-paper folios were difficult to sell. The <lb/>subscription editions of the Homer translations had been in quarto and readers <lb/>who needed to make up large folio sets would have been difficult to identify. For <lb/>the <hi rend=\"italic\">Iliad</hi>, 250 large-paper folios were printed, but I should be surprised if Pope <lb/>and Gilliver persisted with so many. From the number of surviving copies, it <lb/>seems that the large-folio edition of the <hi rend=\"italic\">Works</hi> was quite small.<hi rend=\"sup\">40</hi> For the quarto, <lb/>however, <hi rend=\"italic\">An Essay on Man</hi> was newly printed, and Pope took the opportunity to <lb/>replace the modified <hi rend=\"italic\">Odyssey</hi> headpiece with a new one (figure 7). The result is <lb/>bolder and clearer. The supporting falcons have been removed and the motto <lb/>has been taken out of the central oval and placed on an outside ribbon. The <lb/>lyres are still there but the foliage is wrapped gracefully in circles round them. <lb/>Pope clearly liked the heraldic effect of the original <hi rend=\"italic\">Odyssey</hi> adaptation and was <lb/>prepared to pay for an engraving that presented it more clearly. I suspect the <lb/>design was Kent’s, though only Fourdrinier has signed it.<hi rend=\"sup\">41</hi><lb/>\n<lb/>The poem that follows the <hi rend=\"italic\">Essay on Man</hi> and introduces the second sequence <lb/>of epistles also starts with variant forms of the heraldic headpiece. <hi rend=\"italic\">To Sir Richard <lb/>Temple Lord Viscount Cobham</hi> begins in the quarto (figure 8) with another adapted <lb/><hi rend=\"italic\">Odyssey</hi> engraving (from Book V), and in the folio with a new specially designed <lb/>one (figure 9). In the thick-paper copy of the enhanced <hi rend=\"italic\">Works</hi> II (Griffith 514) that <lb/>Pope seems to have published in 1739, the <hi rend=\"italic\">Odyssey</hi> headpiece appears unaltered. <lb/>Presumably the sheet containing the first page must have been printed first back <lb/>in 1735 (the most expensive copies impressed while the type was clean), and sent <lb/>off to the rolling press, where the unaltered engraving was used. Before the ap- <lb/>propriate sheet of the ordinary paper quarto arrived, the engraving must have <lb/>been altered (perhaps all this activity was in Fourdrinier’s shop), and before the <lb/>large folio was impressed the new engraving must have been prepared.<lb/>\n<lb/>Pope changed his mind about the order of the four epistles that begin this <lb/>second section. They ended up <hi rend=\"italic\">To Cobham</hi>, <hi rend=\"italic\">To a Lady</hi>, <hi rend=\"italic\">To Bathurst</hi>, and <hi rend=\"italic\">To Burlington</hi>, <lb/>but in the quarto Cobham’s second page is numbered ‘48’ and Bathurst’s ‘8’. <lb/>The folio was tidied up and impressed later, but it was from the same setting <lb/>of type and its first page number in this section, ‘8’, suggests a merely partial<lb/>\n<lb/><hi rend=\"sup\">40</hi>. Few copies survive. The British Library has one (Ashley 5235), as apparently from <lb/>ESTC T5391 do six North American libraries. The two copies listed in Oxford libraries <lb/>(26 September 2016) are actually quartos. The ESTC T222362 and Foxon, <hi rend=\"italic\">English Verse</hi>, <lb/>P851 between them list four copies of the related <hi rend=\"italic\">Essay on Man</hi>.<lb/>\n<lb/><hi rend=\"sup\">41</hi>. The <hi rend=\"italic\">Works</hi> quarto does not use the Leucothea tailpiece at the end of Epistle II of <lb/>the collected <hi rend=\"italic\">Essay</hi> but substitutes the siren of Epistle III instead. The other engravings <lb/>are the same.<lb/>",
