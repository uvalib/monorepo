In the summer of 1732 he had discussions <lb/>with Samuel Buckley about whether they could be used in the edition of Jacques <lb/>Auguste de Thou’s <hi rend=\"italic\">Historiarum Sui Temporis</hi> (1733), a large showy book on excep-<lb/>tionally thick paper that Buckley, the printer of the <hi rend=\"italic\">London Gazette</hi> and govern-<lb/>ment informant, had been planning since before January 1728.<hi rend=\"sup\">13</hi> In a letter of 16 <lb/>June [1732], Pope said he had had the articles of his contract checked and could <lb/>now confirm his offer to lend the engravings to Buckley. These discussions with <lb/>Buckley probably alerted Pope to the possibility of using the same engravings <lb/>when later that year he made plans for collecting his works. In an agreement <lb/>with Lawton Gilliver on 1 December 1732, he said he was planning to publish a <lb/>series of epistles (<hi rend=\"italic\">To Burlington</hi> had been published a year before, on 14 Decem-<lb/>ber 1731) and was willing to sell the publishing rights of each one to Gilliver for <lb/>one year for £50, the rights then to revert to Pope. In a memorandum that was <lb/>most probably written at the same time, Pope recorded his intention of allowing <lb/>Gilliver to collect all these epistles and the <hi rend=\"italic\">Dunciad</hi> (of which Gilliver owned the <lb/>copyright and had an edition in quarto and folio ‘lying by’) in ‘The Works of M<lb/>r <lb/>Alexander Pope. Volume the Second’.<hi rend=\"sup\">14</hi> The full range of the plan for the epistles <lb/>was originally printed at the end of the first collected edition of <hi rend=\"italic\">An Essay on <lb/>Man</hi>, <lb/>published 20 April 1734, and is recorded by Spence.<hi rend=\"sup\">15</hi><lb/>\nThe engravings from the <hi rend=\"italic\">Odyssey</hi> (headpieces, initials, and tailpieces) that <lb/>Pope lent to Buckley and decided to reuse himself were designed by William <lb/>Kent and engraved by Paul Fourdrinier.<hi rend=\"sup\">16</hi> They have recently been subjected <lb/>to a detailed and appreciative analysis by Nicholas Savage.<hi rend=\"sup\">17</hi> I share his admi-<lb/>ration for them. The headpieces are not deep, with the height a little more than <lb/>a third of the width (the image approx. 6 cm high by 16 wide), but these propor-<lb/>tions worked well on the quarto page of the subscription editions.
