The quarto and the large-paper folio have the same<lb/>illustrations in the preliminaries, but differ in the body of the text. After each<lb/>epistle the quarto has one of the tailpieces from the Odyssey: Epistle&amp;nbsp;I the mermaid<lb/>fountain from the end of Odyssey&amp;nbsp;VII (from the gardens of Alcinous); Epistle&amp;nbsp;II</p>\n<note n=\"32\" place=\"foot\">Both the image and the plate were reduced in size for the Works title page. The end of<lb/>Fourdrinier’s name has been lost, and there remains some smudging bottom left where the ma-<lb/>terial has not quite been cleared away. The change would be similar to the more radical adjust-<lb/>ments to some of the headpieces. An exceptionally full account of changing a plate, though for<lb/>a later period, is given in Roy&amp;nbsp;J.&amp;nbsp;L. Cooney, ‘Chart Engraving at the Admiralty’s Hydrographic<lb/>Department, 1951–1981’, <hi rend=\"italic\">Journal of the Printing Historical Society</hi>, 25 (1996), 31–46. I suspect in<lb/>Pope’s case the alteration could be made without heating or beating the plate flat, and that the<lb/>new designs were created with the minimum intervention necessary.</note>\n<note n=\"33\" place=\"foot\">David Foxon, <hi rend=\"italic\">English Verse</hi>, gives the dates as 20 February 1733 (P822), 29 March<lb/>1733 (P833), 8 May 1733 (P840), 24 January 1734 (P845), and, for the collected edition 20<lb/>April 1734 (P850–3).</note>",
