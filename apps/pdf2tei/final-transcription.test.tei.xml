<head>John Carter: An Assessment<lb/>and a Handlist</head>
<byline><hi rend="italic">by</hi> <name type="pname"><hi rend="smallcaps">G. THOMAS TANSELLE</hi></name></byline>
<p>
<hi rend="dropcap">J</hi>ohn carter was one of the most prominent and significant<lb/>
figures in the Anglo-American book world in the twentieth<lb/>
century. Indeed, he held a unique position, for he distinguished<lb/>
himself as a bookseller, a collector, a scholar, and a writer, equally<lb/>
at home and equally recognized on both sides of the Atlantic.<lb/>
He created innovative rare-book catalogues for the Scribner Book Store;<lb/>
formed several notable collections, especially of Catullus and Housman;<lb/>
was a pioneer investigator of the bibliographical problems of nineteenth-<lb/>
century publishers’ bindings; performed (with Graham Pollard) a classic<lb/>
piece of bibliographical detection in uncovering the Wise-Forman forger-<lb/>
ies; produced a scholarly edition of Sir Thomas Browne’s <hi rend="italic">Urne Buriall and</hi><lb/>
<hi rend="italic">the Garden of Cyrus</hi>; and wrote (or co-wrote or co-edited) several celebrated<lb/>
works—<hi rend="italic">An Enquiry into the Nature of Certain Nineteenth Century Pamphlets</hi><lb/>
(1934), <hi rend="italic">Taste and Technique in Book-Collecting</hi> (1948), <hi rend="italic">ABC for Book-Collectors</hi><lb/>
(1952), and <hi rend="italic">Printing and the Mind of Man</hi> (1967).<lb/>
</p>
<p>
A record of his published writings is obviously a basic guide to his ac-<lb/>
complishment. But such a record is also desirable for another reason that<lb/>
would not apply to many people: nearly every piece he wrote, no matter<lb/>
how small (including brief reviews and letters to editors), is worth reading<lb/>
for its style and wit. I am therefore presenting here a handlist (following in<lb/>
Carter’s tradition of handlist-writing) that will enable readers to find these<lb/>
pieces. Carter published so prolifically (some 1500 items are known) in such<lb/>
a wide array of venues that there are bound to be many items I have missed,<lb/>
especially among his letters to editors. But what is here is a comprehensive<lb/>
nucleus to which additions can be made. As Carter said in his handlist of<lb/>
Stanley Morison, it is “intended to serve as a series of signposts now and as<lb/>
a basis for amplification, correction and addition in the future.”<lb/>
</p>
<p>
As an introduction to the handlist, I shall attempt a brief assessment of<lb/>
Carter’s achievement, which is a by-product of the overview provided by<lb/>
the handlist. It is inevitably biographical to some extent; but the empha-<lb/>
sis is on Carter’s writings, not his life, because a book-length biography<lb/>
already exists: Donald C. Dickinson’s <hi rend="italic">John Carter: The Taste and Technique of</hi><lb/>
</p>
<pb n="2"/>
<p>
 a Bookman (2004). The biographical details selected for mention here and<lb/>
 in the handlist (many of which do not appear in the Dickinson book) are<lb/>
 those that seem to me most relevant for understanding the background<lb/>
 and context of his writings and his wide influence. I knew John Carter for<lb/>
 only the last ten years of his life: some of my recollections were written<lb/>
 up in section 36 of my memoir, “The Living Room” (published in vol-<lb/>
 ume 59 of <hi rend="italic">Studies in Bibliography</hi> and then in <hi rend="italic">Books in My Life</hi>, 2021), and<lb/>
 I dedicated my book about book-jackets to his memory. I shall not forget<lb/>
 the many kindnesses he showed me and the important favors he did for<lb/>
 me, and the present offering is a reflection of my gratitude.<lb/>
</p>
<head><hi rend="smallcaps">ASSESSMENT</hi></head>
<head>The<lb/>1930s</head>
<p>
 John Carter’s first post-collegiate publication on a bookish subject, an<lb/>
 article on “Original Condition” in the 15 November 1930 issue of<lb/>
 <hi rend="italic">Publishers’ Weekly</hi>, came only three years after college and inaugurated an amaz-<lb/>
 ing four-year period of brilliant productivity. Born John Waynflete Carter<lb/>
 at Eton on 10 May 1905, he was educated at Eton and King’s College<lb/>
 Cambridge, where he achieved a double first in the classical tripos and<lb/>
 an honors degree in 1927. By that time he was already collecting Catullus<lb/>
 and had become interested in textual criticism through the influence of A.<lb/>
 E. Housman’s lectures. Almost immediately after leaving Cambridge he<lb/>
 was hired (in September 1927) by the London office of Charles Scribner’s<lb/>
 Sons to locate rare books to be sold in their New York shop. In the three<lb/>
 years between then and that 1930 article, he was becoming acquainted<lb/>
 with the book dealers and collectors both in Britain and in America (his<lb/>
 first visit to New York being January to April 1929). But he was clearly do-<lb/>
 ing more, for his first three letters to the <hi rend="italic">Times Literary Supplement</hi> (in 1931-<lb/>
 33) show that by then he was already immersed in research on Sir Thomas<lb/>
 Browne, publishers’ bindings, and the pamphlets that became known as<lb/>
 the Wise-Forman forgeries—the subjects of his first major publications<lb/>
 (and of his early articles for the main book-collecting journals of the time,<lb/>
 <hi rend="italic">The Book Collector’s Quarterly</hi> in England and <hi rend="italic">The Colophon</hi> in America).<lb/>
 In May 1932 he published <hi rend="italic">Binding Variants in English Publishing, 1820-</hi><lb/>
 1900 as the sixth volume in Michael Sadleir’s important <hi rend="italic">Bibliographia</hi> se-<lb/>
 ries, which had the significant subtitle “<hi rend="italic">Studies in Book History and Book<lb/>Structure</hi>” (where “structure” makes clear the interest in bibliographical<lb/>
 analysis). Sadleir, a publisher (Constable was his firm), novelist, and col-<lb/>
 lector, had already established himself (he was sixteen and a half years<lb/>
 older than Carter) as a bibliographical scholar and a pioneer historian<lb/>
 of publishers’ bindings. He had published a bibliography of Trollope in<lb/>
 1928 (a landmark through its explicit demonstration that an author bibli-<lb/>
</p>
<pb n="3"/>
<p>ography can be a contribution to the history of publishing); and two years later <hi rend="italic">The Evolution of Publishers’ Bindings Styles, 1770-1900</hi> came out as the first volume in his <hi rend="italic">Bibliographia</hi> series. Carter’s admiration for Sadleir<lb/>
is suggested by a letter he wrote to <hi rend="italic">The Times</hi> on 20 December 1957 to<lb/>
supplement <hi rend="italic">The Times’s</hi> obituary of Sadleir: “None of those who moved<lb/>
in his orbit . . . was ever made to feel a satellite. But in our corner of the<lb/>
sky a star has fallen.” An “avowed disciple” of Sadleir (as he called himself<lb/>
in a 1970 article), Carter had been following Sadleir’s lead in investigat-<lb/>
ing edition binding; and he had published articles on the subject in 1931<lb/>
and 1932 that he was able to incorporate into his 1932 book. In the first<lb/>
chapter of that book, he modestly called it “a rather swollen appendix” to<lb/>
Sadleir’s book, but it is much more than that in several ways.<lb/>
First, the chapter called “Historical,” though it is a condensed ac-<lb/>
count of the beginnings and early use of cloth for bindings, draws on his<lb/>
own original research in publishers’ catalogues and trade journals. Sec-<lb/>
ond, the bulk of the first half is a detailed account of how to go about in-<lb/>
vestigating the bindings of nineteenth-century books and determining the<lb/>
order of variant bindings. He touches on the use of publishers’ records<lb/>
and catalogues, review copies, inscriptions, inserted advertisements, end-<lb/>
papers, and edge treatments, among much else, and he deals with such<lb/>
topics as special bindings, series variants, and bindings-up of parts, along<lb/>
with the description of cloth grains. The first half of the book (“General”),<lb/>
which also includes a “specimen investigation,” provides a “method of<lb/>
attack” that is then applied in the second half (“Particular”) to numerous<lb/>
books by some five dozen authors. This extensive survey of examples,<lb/>
based on the examination of an impressive number of copies, is yet an-<lb/>
other contribution of the book, making it useful for reference—and in<lb/>
the process displaying Carter’s cautious and undogmatic way of reaching<lb/>
conclusions.<lb/>
The book is addressed to “students and amateurs of book-structure”<lb/>
(p. xi), and Carter is concerned throughout to advance bibliographical<lb/>
study. He hopes to show “what an immensely important part of bibliog-<lb/>
raphy they [binding variants] become when they are taken seriously,” and<lb/>
he wants to help “develop a scientific method on general lines for dealing<lb/>
with so frequent a phenomenon” (p. 6). He makes clear that “the attitude<lb/>
of mind most desirable in a bibliographer is suspicion” (p. 39), and he<lb/>
stresses the necessity for examining multiple copies. His more specific<lb/>
observations on analyzing bindings form a perfect set of instructions for<lb/>
the beginner on how best to approach a nineteenth-century book: they<lb/>
have not been superseded, nor have they been stated in more attractive<lb/>
prose. Of the several pioneer studies of publishers’ bindings by Carter and<lb/>
Sadleir, this one is the most continuingly useful, still valuable as a guide.<lb/>
A few months after <hi rend="italic">Binding Variants</hi>, another of Carter’s major pub-<lb/>
lications came out: his edition of Sir Thomas Browne’s <hi rend="italic">Urne Buriall</hi> and<lb/>
</p>
<pb n="4"/>
<p>the <hi rend="italic">Garden of Cyrus</hi> (originally published in 1658, with “Urne Buriall” as a<lb/>
subtitle to “<hi rend="italic">Hydriotaphia</hi>”). It was a lavish production, elegantly printed<lb/>
by the Curwen Press and published (in an edition of 215 copies) by Cassell<lb/>
&amp; Company with thirty drawings by Paul Nash (printed by collotype and<lb/>
colored by pochoir) and a morocco and vellum binding designed by him.<lb/>
This handsome book is regularly regarded as one of the masterpieces of<lb/>
twentieth-century book production—as, for example, in Martin Hutner<lb/>
and Jerry Kelly’s <hi rend="italic">A Century for a Century</hi> (Grolier Club, 1999). But the work<lb/>
also makes a scholarly contribution to the study of Browne. Carter had<lb/>
been reading Browne since his Eton days, and by the early 1930s he was<lb/>
on the trail of author-corrected copies of the first edition (as his letter to<lb/>
the <hi rend="italic">Times Literary Supplement</hi> on 16 July 1931 shows), while he was working<lb/>
on a new edition, at the request of Desmond Flower (of Cassell’s). He was<lb/>
able to locate and use six such copies before his edition came out, only<lb/>
two of which had previously been known. The thoroughness of his work<lb/>
is symbolized by his annotated copy of Edward H. Marshall’s 1929 Mac-<lb/>
millan edition: its leaves, mounted on larger paper, were interleaved with<lb/>
blanks, which were covered with his notes reporting collations, references,<lb/>
and critical observations (described in G. F. Sims catalogue 102 [1979],<lb/>
item 85). As he noted in his introduction, he had collated all editions be-<lb/>
fore 1800 and all published in Great Britain since then (though he does<lb/>
not mention collating multiple copies of the early editions).<lb/></p>
<p>Carter’s editorial approach was admirable. Because the successive<lb/>
lifetime editions were unreliable, he based his text on the first edition<lb/>
and reported all his departures from it (except the correction of turned,<lb/>
dropped, or transposed letters), as well as the results of his collations.<lb/>
Aside from the adoption of Browne’s own corrections, the departures<lb/>
were few because he retained the punctuation and spelling of the first<lb/>
edition (except the long <hi rend="italic">s</hi> and the “sporadic” use of <hi rend="italic">v</hi> for <hi rend="italic">u</hi>). He correctly<lb/>
recognized that Browne’s “use of commas and semicolons, like his use of<lb/>
initial capitals and italics is too much a part of himself and his period to<lb/>
submit to this wholesale modernization [of earlier editors].” Nevertheless<lb/>
he did make an “irreducible minimum of corrections where the com-<lb/>
positor’s carelessness has produced intolerable obscurity.” Clearly there<lb/>
is room for disagreement here, for some of the obscurity may not have<lb/>
been caused by the compositor, and in any case what is intolerable is a<lb/>
subjective matter. But critical editing necessarily entails judgment, and<lb/>
these alterations are all recorded in the notes. The introduction ends with<lb/>
a gracious point not often made: although he has criticized earlier edi-<lb/>
tions, he says, “one cannot begin to criticize an edition until one has used<lb/>
it thoroughly, so that criticism becomes almost a proof of obligation.”<lb/></p>
<p>On 2 July 1934, less than two years after the Browne edition, Carter’s<lb/>
third major publication appeared—the one that made him a book-world<lb/>
</p>
<pb n="5"/>
celebrity: <hi rend="italic">An Enquiry into the Nature of Certain Nineteenth Century Pamphlets</hi>,<lb/>
written in collaboration with Graham Pollard, a bookseller with the firm<lb/>
of Birrell &amp; Garnett. The story of how Carter and Pollard uncovered the<lb/>
Wise-Forman forgeries has been told often; indeed, it is one of the best-<lb/>
known episodes in bibliographical history, familiar to many people out-<lb/>
side the book world (as a result of such treatments as Richard D. Altick’s,<lb/>
in his 1950 book <hi rend="italic">The Scholar Adventurers</hi>, and Dwight Macdonald’s, in a<lb/>
1962 <hi rend="italic">New Yorker</hi> article, as well as Carter’s own accounts). Its wide appeal<lb/>
is understandable, as the story of two young booksellers who, through<lb/>
persistent research, were able to bring down a dominant and respected<lb/>
figure (for Thomas J. Wise was a distinguished collector and widely known<lb/>
book-world symbol, the author of many bibliographies, and a former<lb/>
president of the Bibliographical Society). It also has the elements of a de-<lb/>
tective story, with parts of a puzzle gradually, but inexorably, falling into<lb/>
place. And in the <hi rend="italic">Enquiry</hi>, given the panache of Carter’s prose, the story<lb/>
was given a presentation that increased its appeal.<lb/>
Many of the people who are attracted to the story for all these reasons,<lb/>
however, do not recognize its important contribution to bibliographical<lb/>
scholarship. Identifying the perpetrators (which the book did not explic-<lb/>
itly do) is a different activity from proving that the pamphlets are indeed<lb/>
fraudulent. In the absence of explicit documents, the former involves<lb/>
circumstantial evidence, such as the fact that the suspected pamphlets<lb/>
entered the market from the stock of a single dealer (Herbert E. Gorfin).<lb/>
But the latter requires physical evidence from the items themselves. The<lb/>
use of such evidence for investigating books of earlier periods was well es-<lb/>
tablished by this time, but the bibliographical analysis of nineteenth- and<lb/>
twentieth-century books was in its infancy. The attention paid to “points”<lb/>
in modern books by collectors, dealers, and the writers of author bibliog-<lb/>
raphies was a form of physical examination, but it was often undisciplined<lb/>
and lacking in a concern for uncovering book-production history. Pub-<lb/>
lishers’ bindings, however, were beginning to be seriously studied, under<lb/>
the leadership of Sadleir and Carter. And the <hi rend="italic">Enquiry</hi> took a major step<lb/>
forward in demonstrating ways in which the analysis of paper and type<lb/>
could also be applied to post-1800 books.<lb/>
It is possible that Carter’s collecting of detective fiction played a role<lb/>
in inspiring the analysis of paper reported in the <hi rend="italic">Enquiry</hi>. He was certainly<lb/>
aware of the detective stories of R. Austin Freeman (discussed in his es-<lb/>
say in <hi rend="italic">New Paths in Book Collecting</hi> as reaching “a new level in scientific<lb/>
detection”, and it is not unlikely that he knew “The Apparition of Burl-<lb/>
ing Court” (1923; collected in <hi rend="italic">The Puzzle Lock</hi>, 1925). In that story, the<lb/>
detective, Dr. Thorndyke, proves a book to be fraudulent through several<lb/>
physical tests, the decisive one being a laboratory examination of the pa-<lb/>
per, which showed that the paper contained mechanical wood-pulp and<lb/>
<pb n="6"/>
<p>esparto. Thorndyke stated that “esparto was not used until 1860,” which<lb/>
was twenty years after the purported date of the book. It turns out that the<lb/>
presence of esparto in the paper of some of the pamphlets that Carter and<lb/>
Pollard were investigating was the basis for proving them to be forgeries.<lb/>
(Although Dr. Thorndyke is not referred to, another fictional detective,<lb/>
Edgar Allan Poe’s Auguste Dupin, is cited as a precursor in a later chapter<lb/>
[p. 87].) Whether or not there was any connection with Dr. Thorndyke,<lb/>
Carter and Pollard used the same procedure: after having the papers of<lb/>
the pamphlets tested and determining the dates when esparto and chemi-<lb/>
cal wood-pulp were introduced into papermaking, they found that twenty-<lb/>
two of the pamphlets had printed dates that preceded the dates when their<lb/>
paper would have been available, and thus they were fraudulent.<lb/></p>
<p>The authors were aware that their use of paper evidence was more<lb/>
groundbreaking than that of typographical evidence. The paper test, they<lb/>
said, “has not hitherto been applied to bibliographical purposes” (p. 42),<lb/>
whereas, in the opening sentence of the chapter on type, they call atten-<lb/>
tion to Robert Proctor’s work, decades earlier, identifying the printers<lb/>
of incunabula through the type designs. They also note that Proctor, a<lb/>
friend of William Morris, had in 1898 questioned (on the basis of its type)<lb/>
the Morris pamphlet that Carter and Pollard proved to be a forgery.<lb/>
The typographical tests they used throughout were proposed by Stanley<lb/>
Morison (they could hardly have had a greater typographical adviser).<lb/>
He noticed the kernless “f ” and “j” and the tilted question mark used<lb/>
in many of the pamphlets; and these characteristics not only provided<lb/>
another dating test (based on the earliest use of a kernless font) but also<lb/>
led to the identification of the printer as Richard Clay &amp; Sons (Clay had<lb/>
added that question mark to the font). The Clay firm was not involved in<lb/>
the deception: having been commissioned by Wise to print many facsimi-<lb/>
les for the Browning and Shelley societies, they had no reason to question<lb/>
the imprints and dates being placed on these other pamphlets. Carter and<lb/>
Pollard concluded that sixteen of the fraudulent pamphlets were definitely<lb/>
printed by Clay &amp; Sons and that all the rest probably were.<lb/></p>
<p>The analysis of paper and type is set out in chapters 4 and 5 with<lb/>
meticulous care and exemplary thoroughness. These chapters are part<lb/>
of the six that constitute part I, “Deduction,” tracing the story from the<lb/>
initial suspicion to the “proved conclusion.” In the last chapter of part I,<lb/>
the authors say, “With all its drudgery, detective work has a great intel-<lb/>
lectual fascination” (p. 93)—and this fascination has been conveyed to<lb/>
the reader. With the “machinery of detection” having been set forth, the<lb/>
authors move in part II, “Reconstruction,” to a description of the forger’s<lb/>
motivation, methods, and marketing strategies. Then comes the largest<lb/>
section of the book, part III, “Dossiers,” in which each of forty-six pam-<lb/>
</p>
<pb n="7"/>
phlets (by fifteen authors) is given a thorough account, reporting (among <lb/>
other things) the history of references to it, the location of known cop-<lb/>
ies, the results of tests, and a conclusion. The book as a whole not only <lb/>
demonstrates the use of certain paper and typographical tests in biblio-<lb/>
graphical analysis but also provides a model of how to draw conclusions <lb/>
cautiously and present the results responsibly.<lb/>
Another attraction of the book is its prose style. Although the book was <lb/>
a true collaboration between Carter and Pollard, Carter’s voice emerges <lb/>
plainly at many points, and some chapters are clearly his work, especially <lb/>
those in part II. The opening one, “The Modern First Edition Market, <lb/>
1885-1895,” is an expert survey of the development of interest in literary <lb/>
first editions (a preview of the more detailed account in <hi rend="italic">Taste and Tech-<lb/>nique in Book-Collecting</hi>), providing the necessary context for understand-<lb/>
ing why the kinds of pamphlets that Wise produced were sought after. It <lb/>
has many characteristic touches, such as this: “New vistas were opening <lb/>
before the collectors’ eyes, each with a glint of Eldorado at the end” (p. <lb/>
107). In “these feverish and speculative conditions,” Carter added, “it <lb/>
would have been almost surprising if there had not been some collateral <lb/>
descendant of Annius to perceive this golden opportunity. . . . At this time, <lb/>
the thing was, comparatively, easy money: the fish were rising, he [the <lb/>
forger] found (after a few experiments) the right fly, and they swallowed it <lb/>
with a regularity and unanimity which must have been to him exceedingly <lb/>
satisfactory” (pp. 108-09).<lb/>
The chapter on “Establishing the Pedigrees” shows Carter at his most <lb/>
skillful, for he convincingly points the finger at Wise without saying out-<lb/>
right that Wise created the forgeries (which could not be said, since the <lb/>
documentary evidence that later turned up—incriminating Harry Buxton <lb/>
Forman as well as Wise—was not known at that time). Wise could be <lb/>
criticized in other ways, however, especially for his supposed failure to be <lb/>
suspicious of the pamphlets, given the circumstances of their appearance <lb/>
and his bibliographical expertise. His behavior, Carter suggests, “savoured <lb/>
of Nelson with the telescope to his blind eye” (p. 134). Carter was unspar-<lb/>
ing in his condemnation of the “shocking negligence” of Wise (even though <lb/>
he had to call the forger “anonymous”) and of the resulting damage:<lb/>
Mr. Wise, by his credulity, by his vanity in his own possessions, by his dogmatism, by <lb/>
abuse of his eminence in the bibliographical world, has dealt a blow to the prestige <lb/>
of an honourable science, the repercussions of which will be long and widely felt. . . . <lb/>
Like the thirteenth stroke of a faulty clock, which discredits the accuracy of the hours <lb/>
which have gone before, the spuriousness of these books must inevitably cast asper-<lb/>
sions on many similar books which are, in fact, genuine. . . . If Mr. Wise, one of the <lb/>
most eminent bibliographers of our time, can be so extensively wrong, who can we <lb/>
be sure is right? (pp. 141– 42)<lb/>

<p><hi rend="dropcap">T</hi>he <hi rend="italic">Enquiry</hi> is a landmark of bibliographical analysis and the presentation<lb/>of bibliographical evidence, and it is written in such a way that it is an<lb/>enduringly readable story of detection.</p>
<p>The three major books of 1932‒34 were not Carter’s only significant<lb/>publications of the early 1930s. In November 1934, four months after the<lb/><hi rend="italic">Enquiry</hi> appeared, Constable (in London) and Scribner’s (in New York)<lb/>brought out a volume of essays (planned by him and Michael Sadleir)<lb/>that he edited, entitled <hi rend="italic">New Paths in Book Collecting</hi>. There had of course<lb/>been a number of books about book collecting during the previous forty<lb/>years, but what made this one distinctive was that it consisted of essays<lb/>by different writers, each taking up an appealing direction for collecting.<lb/>The authors were drawn primarily from his and Sadleir’s circle of book-<lb/>world friends, half of them dealers and half collectors: Carter (on “Detec<lb/>tive Fiction”), Sadleir (“Yellow-Backs”), P.&amp;nbsp;H. Muir (“Ignoring the Flag”<lb/>and “War Books”), Graham Pollard (“Serial Fiction”), David&amp;nbsp;A. Randall<lb/>(“American First Editions, 1900‒1933”), Thomas Balston (“English Book<lb/>Illustration, 1880‒1900”), C.&amp;nbsp;B. Oldman (“Musical First Editions”), and<lb/>John&amp;nbsp;T. Winterich (“The Expansion of an Author Collection”). When<lb/>Carter commented on this book in 1948 (in <hi rend="italic">Taste and Technique in Book-<lb/>Collecting</hi>), he called it “only one instance of the responsible part taken in<lb/>recent years by professional booksellers, not merely through their practi-<lb/>cal influence exerted in the course of business but also by their contribu-<lb/>tions to bibliophilic literature and propaganda, in the formulation and<lb/>the exposition of theory, of policy and of practice in the book-collecting<lb/>world” (Cambridge edition, p.&amp;nbsp;84). Here he was not only observing a de-<lb/>velopment but also describing the path he saw for himself as a bookseller,<lb/>one he faithfully followed.</p>
<p>The title of the volume was not meant to suggest that the subjects<lb/>discussed were entirely new, for some collectors were already focusing<lb/>on them; but they were new in the sense that they were not traditional,<lb/>and the purpose of the book was to call attention to, and encourage,<lb/>the approach to collecting represented by these trends. It was the paths<lb/>that were new, not necessarily the subjects: the book aimed not to “dic-<lb/>tate” but “to suggest by means of examples” (p.&amp;nbsp;7). As Carter remarked<lb/>in <hi rend="italic">Taste and Technique</hi>, the volume was “one gambit” in the “general<lb/>propagandist movement towards diversity of method” (p.&amp;nbsp;84). Through-<lb/>out his career, Carter argued that collectors should think on their own<lb/>and not simply repeat what earlier collectors had done. In the intro-<lb/>duction to this volume, for example, he says that collectors should have<lb/>“enough independence to dislike joining the herd movements which<lb/>are always ploughing their way across the book market” (p.&amp;nbsp;6). The<lb/>point is made several times in the opening pages through metaphor.<lb/>For example:</p>
<pb n="9"/>
<p>
A collection of “high spots” may sound the chord of C major, which is indeed a fine<lb/>
and resounding noise; yet there are other and more subtle harmonies, the pleasantest<lb/>
of which are those which we evolve for ourselves. These are composed of notes which<lb/>
anyone can use and many have used, but by our own arrangement of them we can<lb/>
achieve a sound never heard before. (p. 11)<lb/>
</p>
<p>
Earlier, in a visual metaphor, he says that the coherence of such a collec-<lb/>
tion can reveal a “beautiful pattern” (p. 4). This newly revealed pattern,<lb/>
like the “sound never heard before,” makes a “contribution to knowl-<lb/>
edge” (a phrase used on the first page). Implicit in all the essays that<lb/>
follow (“essays in method,” he calls them), and often explicit as well, is a<lb/>
recognition that collecting is a form of historical study and that follow-<lb/>
ing new paths increases our understanding of the past. With this kind of<lb/>
grounding, <hi rend="italic">New Paths</hi> remains one of the most perceptive and inspiring<lb/>
of introductory guides.<lb/>
</p>
<p>
Carter followed up on this book in two ways the same year. With<lb/>
Sadleir, he organized an exhibition “arranged to illustrate” <hi rend="italic">New Paths</hi> at J.<lb/>
&amp; E. Bumpus, accompanied by a substantial annotated catalogue; and for<lb/>
the Scribner Book Store he put together a catalogue on detective fiction<lb/>
(largely from his own collection). (In the next few years, he and David A.<lb/>
Randall, head of Scribner’s Rare Book Department in New York as of<lb/>
March 1935, publicized many more new paths in their catalogues.) His<lb/>
interest in publishers’ bindings also led to further contributions to their<lb/>
history in the form of two introductions to Elkin Mathews catalogues<lb/>
(1932) and two small books, <hi rend="italic">Publishers’ Cloth</hi> (1935, in connection with<lb/>
an exhibition at the New York Public Library) and <hi rend="italic">More Binding Variants</hi><lb/>
(1938, a supplement to his 1932 book).<lb/>
</p>
<p>
His editorial work also continued with editions of Housman’s <hi rend="italic">Intro-<lb/>ductory Lecture</hi> (1933) and <hi rend="italic">The Collected Poems</hi> (1939) and an incomplete<lb/>
edition of <hi rend="italic">Catullus</hi> (two fascicles only, 1934–35). (<hi rend="italic">The Collected Poems</hi> was<lb/>
published without an editor’s name; but four years later, in the course of<lb/>
an article in the <hi rend="italic">Times Literary Supplement</hi> on 5 and 12 June 1943, Carter<lb/>
revealed his editorship publicly.) These efforts, however, did not have the<lb/>
scholarly merit of the Browne edition. The Housman <hi rend="italic">Collected Poems</hi>, to<lb/>
take the primary example, could have been a triumph; but it was hastily<lb/>
produced and involved faulty editorial judgments. Housman’s will autho-<lb/>
rized his brother Laurence to destroy some manuscripts and to oversee<lb/>
the use of the others; and Laurence in turn asked Carter (who had helped<lb/>
organize the manuscripts) to produce an edition of the poetry. The result<lb/>
was criticized, beginning in the autumn of 1952 (when the book was in<lb/>
its thirteenth impression), by two American scholars, Tom Burns Haber<lb/>
(Ohio State) and William White (Wayne State), leading to an acrimonious<lb/>
feud that erupted periodically in the pages of the <hi rend="italic">Times Literary Supplement</hi><lb/>
(and, to a lesser extent, <hi rend="italic">The Book Collector</hi>) over the next sixteen years.<lb/>
</p>
<pb n="10"/>
<p>
<lb/>It started on 26 September 1952 in the <hi rend="smallcaps">TLS</hi> with a letter from White, <lb/>using information from Haber, who had studied the Housman manu-<lb/>scripts, beginning in 1950, much more thoroughly than Carter had. <lb/>White’s letter, referring to Carter’s “slip-shod editing,” alludes to the <lb/>two concerns that were the basis of their criticism: the outright errors <lb/>in the text and the questionable judgment underlying the handling of <lb/>uncanceled manuscript alternatives, where Carter followed the choices <lb/>made by Laurence Housman in the poems included in his posthumous <lb/>editions. Carter’s response (24 October 1952) was weak on both counts. <lb/>Regarding the first, he said he had only claimed “a more correct text.” As <lb/>for the second, he asserted that “the person authorized to perform this <lb/>[choice among variants] . . . was the author’s brother, whose judgment <lb/>they [White and Haber] are not entitled to challenge.” Haber’s long letter <lb/>on 7 November mainly described the history of the manuscripts and his <lb/>work with them; and it was not until a year later (2 October 1953) that <lb/>Haber, in a good letter summarizing the situation, made a proper reply <lb/>to Carter’s second point. Carter, he said, “is speaking wildly when he <lb/>says (of the poet’s brother) that consanguinity endows an editor with om-<lb/>niscience when choosing between alternative readings in a manuscript.” <lb/>Haber ends by regretting that the text “should be toyed with once again,” <lb/>since the fourteenth impression, about to appear, was not to be a thor-<lb/>ough revision. <lb/>That fourteenth impression, “freshly corrected” according to Carter <lb/>(23 October 1953), still contained errors that were noted by White (12 <lb/>February 1954), who also questioned Carter’s assertion that Housman’s <lb/>will gave his brother the right to choose between variants. Despite Carter’s <lb/>assurance (5 March 1954), White’s quotation from the will (14 May 1954) <lb/>suggests that Carter was incorrect. But this point, of course, is a legal one <lb/>and is irrelevant to a scholarly editor’s obligation to think through textual <lb/>decisions independently. The debate was quiescent for the next five years; <lb/>but during that time Haber’s <hi rend="italic">The Manuscript Poems of A. E. Housman</hi> (1955) <lb/>appeared, and it produced discussion in the <hi rend="smallcaps">TLS</hi> (1 July 1955; 15 June, 20, <lb/>27 July 1956) and <hi rend="italic">The Book Collector</hi> (4:110-14) that intensified the lack of <lb/>civility between Carter and Haber—though the anonymous front-page <lb/><hi rend="smallcaps">TLS</hi> review of Haber’s book on 29 April 1955, one of the most severe at-<lb/>tacks the <hi rend="smallcaps">TLS</hi> has ever published, was not by Carter but by his friend and <lb/>occasional collaborator John Sparrow. <lb/>The controversy over <hi rend="italic">The Collected Poems</hi> revived again when Haber <lb/>brought out a volume in 1959 called <hi rend="italic">Complete Poems: Centennial Edition</hi> <lb/>(from the same American publisher as <hi rend="italic">The Collected Poems</hi>), which contained the <lb/>same poems as Carter’s edition but with different texts. Carter asked (29 <lb/>May 1959) whether Haber had received authorization from the Housman <lb/>estate, questioned a number of readings, and said that Haber’s textual es-<lb/>

    <p>The novel <title>The Fall of the Titan</title> (London: Lincoln Williams, 1934), attributed on the title-page to “John Waynflete,” has often been ascribed to John Carter because Waynflete was his middle name and a pseudonym he later used.
