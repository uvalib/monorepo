"""
Custom Resource Lambda for managing AgentCore Gateway Cedar Policy lifecycle.

This Lambda is invoked by CloudFormation during stack deployment to manage
a Policy Engine and Cedar Policy for AgentCore Gateway. It handles the full
three-step process:
  1. Create a Policy Engine and wait for ACTIVE status
  2. Create a Cedar Policy inside the engine and wait for ACTIVE status
  3. Attach the Policy Engine to the Gateway and wait for READY status

CloudFormation Events:
- Create: Creates policy engine, cedar policy, and attaches to gateway
- Update: Deletes all existing managed policies, creates a new one with the
  updated document, and verifies the policy engine is still attached to the
  gateway. Uses a shared helper (_delete_managed_policies) that handles stale
  policy IDs from the PhysicalResourceId by listing and deleting all policies
  matching the managed policy naming convention.
- Delete: Detaches policy engine from gateway, deletes all managed policies,
  and deletes the policy engine

Waiter Strategy:
- Policy creation uses the policy_active waiter. Policy deletion uses the
  policy_deleted waiter. Policy Engine creation uses the policy_engine_active
  waiter. Policy Engine deletion uses the policy_engine_deleted waiter.
- Gateway operations currently use a custom polling loop as the
  bedrock-agentcore-control service does not provide an official
  waiter for gateway status changes.
