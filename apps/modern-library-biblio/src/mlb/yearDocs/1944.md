# MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1944 
   
## 1944 

### General 

Three new ML titles published in spring 1944—Bergson, *Creative Evolution* (368), Kaufman and Hart, *Six Plays* (369), and Melville, *Moby Dick* (G65)—along with a number of backlist titles that were reprinted that spring, include the following statement on the verso of the title page: 

<center> <em>Published by A. S. Barnes & Co., Inc.</em>  </center>

<center> <em> Distributed by Random House, Inc.</em> </center>

Paper shortages during the Second World War coupled with a surge in demand for reading matter meant that publishers found themselves unable to satisfy the demand for books. 

The War Production Board limited use of paper in the publishing industry in fall 1942, when each publishing firm was allocated a paper quota based on its use of paper in 1941. Initially publishers were limited to 90 percent of the paper they used before the war. Paper restrictions became increasingly severe as the war continued. There was an additional 10 percent cut in 1943, and a further 15 percent the following year. 

Most publishers were allocated less paper than they needed, but a few—especially publishers of college textbooks—had paper to spare. In fall 1943 the Modern Library entered into a relationship with the textbook publisher A. S. Barnes to launch a new series, the Illustrated Modern Library, using Barnes paper. To satisfy War Production Board requirements, Barnes officially became the publisher of the new series while RH acted as exclusive distributor. Several ML and MLG titles, including those noted above, were also published under this arrangement. The ML appears to have entered into similar arrangements with several other publishers that had surplus paper. 

The War Production Board outlawed distribution contracts of this kind in March 1944. Cerf stated, “Last year, we and several other publishers were able to produce thousands of books on paper that we purchased from college text book houses whose business had been virtually stifled for the duration [of the war]. We counted on doing the same this year. When the government ruled that this would no longer be legal, our entire production schedule was knocked into a cocked hat” (Cerf to Lewis Browne, 4 April 1944). 

All subsequent printings of ML titles during the war were published by Random House using its own paper allocation. Later that year the ML stopped reprinting Giants altogether. Newly published Giants continued to appear at a rate of two a year, but backlist titles were allowed to go out of stock until after the war. This was a sensible policy. The profit margin was lower than that of regular ML books, and the Giants were paper guzzlers. The 8 x 5½ inch Giants were larger than regular ML books, and many of them exceeded 1,000 pages in length. 

A. S. Barnes took over distribution as well as publication of the Illustrated Modern Library for the duration of the war, but its role was limited. Random House continued to select titles for the series, commission artwork, design the books, arrange for typesetting and plate making, and determine when and if Illustrated Modern Library titles were reprinted. 

### Number of titles 

Nine titles were added and one title was discontinued. The ML list now contained 239 titles. 

### Format 

The 1943 format was unchanged for the 1944 publications. All new titles in the regular ML were published in the standard format with the binding measuring 7¼ x 4⅞ in. (183 x 123 mm) and leaves trimmed to 7 x 4¾ (177 x 118 mm). Bindings were red, blue, green or gray. Rockwell Kent’s endpapers were medium gray (265) and consisted of a central panel of 1¾ x 1⅜ inches featuring the Kent torchbearer, surrounded by a pattern of books and the initials “ml” with the torchbearers.

Signed: W.S. [William Sharp]. 

> Front flap:<br> The Day family has become a part of our national tradition, and life without Father Day would be very nearly unthinkable. With him, it has been a joy, and sometimes even a trial, but always an enriching and heartwarming adventure. *Life with Father*, as a play, has broken records for continuous performances, and has established itself as a modern American classic. In book form, Clarence Day’s family album is aglow with the spirit of what all of us like best to remember of our own past. (*Spring 1944*) 

Originally published by Alfred A. Knopf, 1935. ML edition (pp. [*5*], v–258) printed from Knopf plates. Publication announced for February 1944; published 17 March 1944. *WR* 25 November 1944. First printing: 7,500 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1956. 

The ML paid Knopf a \$6,000 advance of which \$2,254 remained unearned in spring 1954. Sharp received \$75 for the jacket. Freiman wrote him: “Our one regret is that we cannot afford to pay you a fee closer to the true value of your work” (R. A. Freiman to Sharp, 18 November 1943). 

Lindsay and Crouse, the authors of the Foreword, had written the play based on Day’s book. In November 1943 the play was beginning its fifth year on Broadway; it eventually ran over seven years to become the longest-running non-musical play on Broadway. 

Competing with the ML edition was a reprint edition published in 1943 by Doubleday’s Sun Dial Press.

> Front flap:<br> As philosopher and man, Henri Bergson is one of the most esteemed intellectual figures of the twentieth century. His major work, *Creative Evolution*, embodies his chief contribution to the study of reality as life and change. Influential among philosophers and popular among general readers because of its persuasive argument and vivid illustrations, this book has achieved permanence in the literature of philosophical speculation. It takes an honored place in the Modern Library series as a work of enduring vitality and ever–renewing meaning to succeeding generations of thoughtful readers. (*Spring 1944*) 

*Jacket B:* As jacket A except in medium gray (265) and black. 

> Front flap as jacket A. (*Spring 1945*) Flap text reset with “was” substituted for “is” in first sentence (Bergson died in 1941). (*Spring 1960*)

The ML paid Holt a \$750 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy. When Cerf first approached Holt he noted, “I have never read Bergson’s CREATIVE EVOLUTION. I am taking Irwin Edman’s word on this one” (Cerf to William Sloan, Holt, 15 March 1943). He offered an advance of \$1,000 on the assumption that the ML would be able to print from Holt plates, but Sloan discovered that the plates had been melted as part of the war effort. Sloan offered to split the cost of new plates with the ML, with the plates to remain the joint property of both firms. He indicated that composition and plates would cost at least \$500 and suggested reducing the advance from \$1,000 to \$750, to which Cerf agreed. Edman received \$250 for the Foreword (Commins to Edman, 2 December 1943).

> Front flap:<br> In the entire world of the theatre, the legend “by Kaufman and Hart” is the hallmark of themes so timely, workmanship so sure and dialogue so sparkling that it is small wonder that in their own field these collaborators are simply beyond competition. Besides the six plays, in complete and unabridged versions, this volume offers an intimate picture of George Kaufman by Moss Hart and an equally revealing portrait of Moss Hart by George Kaufman, plus a serious introduction by their friend and severest critic, Brooks Atkinson of the *New York Times*.

The constant demand for this collection of songs and lyrics and the insistent requests for *The Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám* have led the editors of the Modern Library to add the Fitzgerald masterpiece to the Palgrave anthology. The poet and compiler were contemporaries, and the works by which they will always be known appeared within two years of each other. This long-cherished volume is introduced by one of the foremost anthologists of our time, Louis Untermeyer. (Spring *1944*)

*Jacket:* Non-pictorial in deep red (16) and black on cream paper with title and editor in reverse on deep red panel at upper left; background in cream with other lettering in black below panel. Front flap as 183b. (*Spring 1944*) 

Original ML anthology superseding *Anthology of American Negro Literature*, ed. V. F. Calverton (183). Publication announced for spring 1944. *WR* 16 September 1944. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1 January 1957. 

Watkins’s focus is narrower than Calverton’s. Calverton’s *Anthology of American Negro Literature* (1929) included short stories, selections from novels, drama, poetry, spirituals, blues, labor songs, essays, and autobiographies. Watkins includes four sections only: short stories, essays, autobiographies, and biographies. He notes, “This collection represents the vigorous thinking and writing that characterizes today’s Negro author. Here will be found—not the ‘traditional’ Negro, nor the Negro ‘ideal’—but the true American of Negro parentage speaking his mind about his problems, and offering suggestions for their solution” (pp. xi–xii). 

For poetry he refers readers to “five outstanding anthologies that have been published in this field: *Golden Slippers, An Anthology of Negro Poetry for Young Readers*, by Arna Bontemps; *Book of American Negro Poetry*, by James Weldon Johnson; *Caroling Dusk, An Anthology of Verse by Negro Poets*, by Countee Cullen; *Negro Voices, An Anthology of Contemporary Verse*, by Beatrice M. Murphy; *Negro Poets and Their Poems*, by R. J. Kerlin” (p. xii). Instead of including fragments from novels he recommends “that the following novels be read: *Their Eyes Were Watching God*, by Zora N. Hurston; *Home to Harlem*, by Claude McKay; *The Blacker the Berry*, by Wallace Thurman; *My Lives and How I Lost Them*, by Countee Cullen; *These Low Gro*unds, by W. E. Turpin; *Blood on the Forge*, by William Attaway; *Black Thunder*, by Arna Bontemps; *Native Son*, by Richard Wright, and *The White Face*, by Carl R. Offord” (p. xiii). 

Keneth Kinnamon compares Watkins’s anthology unfavorably to *The Negro Caravan*, edited by Sterling A. Brown, Arthur P. Davis, and Ulysses Lee (Dryden Press, 1941). Kinnamon writes that *The Negro Caravan* has been highly influential in establishing a canon of African-American literature. He believes the anthology will continue to have value that endures. He does not believe the same is true for the *Anthology of American Negro Literature* (1944). (Kinnamon, 1997)

*Contents:* The Haunted and the Haunters, by Edward Bulwer-Lytton – The Damned Thing, by Ambrose Bierce – The Monkey’s Paw, by W. W. Jacobs – The Phantom ’Rickshaw, by Rudyard Kipling – The Willows, by Algernon Blackwood – The Rival Ghosts, by Brander Matthews – The Man Who Went Too Far, by E. F. Benson – The Mezzotint, by Montague Rhodes James – The Open Window, by “Saki” (H. H. Munro) – The Beckoning Fair One, by Oliver Onions – On the Brighton Road, by Richard Middleton – The Considerate Hosts, by Thorp McClusky – August Heat, by W. F. Harvey – The Return of Andrew Bentley, by August W. Derleth and Mark Schorer – The Supper at Elsinore, by Isak Dinesen – The Current Crop of Ghost Stories, by Bennett A. Cerf. 

*Jacket A:* Non-pictorial in moderate greenish blue (173), very dark greenish blue (175) and brilliant yellow (83) on coated white paper with title in reverse and brilliant yellow against moderate greenish blue orb; “EDITED BY BENNETT CERF” in moderate greenish blue, “A MODERN LIBRARY BOOK” in brilliant yellow, other lettering in reverse, all against a very dark greenish blue background. 

> Front flap:<br> Deep in the heart of every human being, no matter how rational or sceptical, there lurks a fascination for the weird and occult. Disbelief does not lay ghosts, nor do the tests of science exorcise them. Stairs creak in the dark with the tread of unseen visitors; cemeteries send up midnight apparitions; and headless horsemen ride in the moonlight. 
> In this completely revised edition of *Famous Ghost Stories*, Bennett Cerf has included such classics of the supernatural as “The Beckoning Fair One,” “The Willows,” “The Supper at Elsinore,” and “The Phantom Rickshaw.” (*Fall 1944*) 

> Front flap reset with the following phrase added to the last sentence: <br> “and many other tales of terror and ghostly phenomena.” (*Fall 1959*) 

*Jacket B1:* Fujita non-pictorial jacket in deep yellow (85), strong purplish red (255) and black on coated white paper; “Famous” in deep yellow, “Ghost” in reverse, “Stories” in strong purplish red, and other lettering in reverse. 

> Front and back flaps:  <br> Perhaps no literary genre has as valid a claim to time-proven distinction as the ghost story; from the ages when men huddled around a fire and exchanged tales to hold back the night, to this day when science is beginning to probe the reaches of man’s mind, the ghost story has held a place of honorable speculation. Whether we scoff or believe, a finely wrought ghost story has a singular and compelling fascination. 
> Bennett Cerf introduces this selection of notable ghost stories that reflect the best of the form. Included are such shiveringly famous tales as “The Monkey’s Paw,” “The Phantom Rickshaw,” and “The Return of Andrew Bentley,” and such writers as Ambrose Bierce, Saki, Rudyard Kipling, and Isak Dinesen. Then, to bring the point hauntingly home, Mr. Cerf concludes with a group of contemporary “true” tales that confront the reader with phenomena that still chill the human imagination. 

Original ML anthology superseding *Best Ghost Stories* (67), which had been in the ML since 1919. Publication announced for spring 1944. *WR* 5 August 1944. First printing: Not ascertained. 

Cerf commented in *SRL*: “Ever since I have had anything to do with the Modern Library, it has included one anthology which struck me as several degrees below par, and that is its collection of ghost stories. This summer I finally have gotten around to the job of revising the volume. The first step in this process, duly recognized by the International Order of Anthologists and Livers on Other Peoples’ Wits, was to comb through all other anthologies on the subject thus availing myself of numerous valuable tips, and avoiding months of research in dusty library archives” (“Trade Winds,” *SRL*, 28 August 1943, p. 17). 

Eleven of the stories were still protected by copyright when the anthology was published. The ML probably paid the copyright holders a flat fee for permission to include them. Cerf received royalties of 4 cents a copy; by 1971 royalties had been increased to 6 cents a copy. 

*Famous Ghost Stories* (IML 17) was also published in the Illustrated Modern Library (1946) with illustrations by Hugo Steiner-Prag and William Sharp.

*Jacket A:* Nonpictorial on cream paper with lettering in deep reddish orange (36) and dark gray (266) as shown. 

>Text on front panel within a double frame in deep reddish orange: <br> A BRAND-NEW EDITION OF | EDGAR SNOW’S | RED STAR | OVER | CHINA | with additions to the text and a new last | chapter that bring the story of the conflict in | China up to the very last minute. | THIS IS THE BOOK THAT TELLS WHY | JAPAN CAN’T WIN! | The only foreign correspondent who penetrated deep into | Northwest China and returned to tell the tale describes with | first-hand detail the amazing stories of: |  The 6000-mile “Long March” of the army of Chu Teh, | “The Red Napoleon.” |  The inside story of the kidnapping of Chiang Kai-shek, | and its tremendous consequences. |  China’s united front against Japan, and its war tactics | and objectives. 

> Front flap:<br> No book published in America during the last decade has been so influential in interpreting to the Western mind the complexities and aspirations of present-day China as Edgar Snow’s *Red Star Over China*. Written with the authority of seventeen years of first-hand observation of the revolutionary events in the great centers and remote provinces, it has become required reading for everyone who seeks to understand the role of China in the world today. The author has revised this edition and provided a new introduction and epilogue to bring it up to the present. (*Fall 1944*) 

Originally published by Random House, 1938. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting with a new preface and epilogue. Publication announced for fall 1944. *WR* 3 February 1945. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1 January 1953. 

The Random House edition was out of print when Snow inquired about a ML reprint (Snow to Cerf, 10 November 1943). The original plates were too large for the ML’s format, and Cerf urged Snow to bring the text up to date. A revision, he wrote, “would give us a wonderful and thoroughly legitimate excuse for reviving the book” (Cerf to Snow, 12 November 1943). Snow liked the idea but later decided against a comprehensive rewriting. In the preface to the ML edition he wrote, “I have kept the original text untouched, except for minor deletions and changes in tense here and there, and instead I have brought the book up to 1944 by the addition of a brief chapter of summary in an epilogue” (p. viii). 

The original RH edition sold approximately 23,500 copies. There were six printings of the ML edition with total sales of just over 27,000 copies (Commins to Harold R. Isaacs, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 4 September 1956).

Designed by Paul Galdone; unsigned. *Note:* The jacket design in different color combinations was also used in spring 1941 for *Five Great Modern Irish Pla*ys (339), fall 1941 for *Collected Short Stories of Ring Lardner* (344), fall 1942 for *Collected Stories of Dorothy Parker* (353), and for four existing ML anthologies – *Best Ghost Stories* (67b), *Best American Humorous Short Stories* (80f), *Great Modern Short Stories* (188b), and *Great German Short Novels and Stories* (256b) when they appeared in the ML’s larger format between fall 1939 and the early 1940s. 

> Front flap:<br> It is almost twenty years since the first of Dorothy Parker’s light verse, sharpened to arrow-point and dipped in the bubbling acid of her wit, brought her the kind of fame that belongs to the most frequently quoted poet of the country. In that time not one of her countless imitators has so much as disputed her position as the foremost ironist in America. Here, for the legions of her old and new admirers, are all the poems which appeared originally in *Enough Rope*, *Sunset Gun*, *Death and Taxes*, plus numerous additional verses of equal brilliance. (*Fall 1944*) 

Originally published as *Not So Deep as a Well* by Viking Press, 1936. ML edition (pp. [v]–xii, 3–210) printed from Viking plates with part titles reset. Publication announced for fall 1944. *WR* 3 February 1945. First printing: Not ascertained. 

The title page, part titles, and endpapers of the Viking Press edition contained decorations by Valenti Angelo printed in moderate reddish orange. The title page of 375a is adapted from the Viking Press title page. There was at least one printing of 375a with the *First* statement omitted from p. [iv]. 

The Modern Library paid royalties of 10 cents a copy for Parker’s *Collected Stories* (1942) and probably paid the same for *Collected Poetry* (1942). By 1971 the royalty rate for *Collected Poetry* had risen to 30 cents—still 10 percent of the list price.
