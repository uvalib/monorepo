# MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1929  

## 1929  

### General  

With a few exceptions such as Villon, *Poems* (55) and *Passages from the Diary of Samuel Pepys* (89), the Boni & Liveright series remained true to its name and limited its scope to modern works. Cerf and Klopfer increased the number of older works, but they did so slowly. They added Defoe, *Moll Flanders* (127) in 1926 and *The Autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini* (132) the following year. Momentum began to increase in 1928 when Apuleius, *Golden Ass* (167), Sterne, *Tristram Shandy* (158), and Rabelais, *Gargantua and Pantagruel* (162) were added. Five ML titles published in 1929 were older classics: Petronius, *Satyricon* (156), Smollett, *Expedition of Humphry Clinker* (159), Chaucer, *Canterbury Tales* (161), and Homer’s *Iliad* (166) and *Odyssey* (167). Several of these works had been targets of censorship groups such as the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice, which was sufficient to redeem them in the eyes of the shallowest modernist.  

Cerf and Klopfer were interested in publishing older classics besides those that appealed specifically to modernist readers, but they questioned whether the Modern Library was the appropriate vehicle for them. Responding to a list of suggestions for the ML in 1928, Klopfer commented, “The one that intrigues me most is the ‘Selected Poems of John Donne’, although I am not sure that he would fit into the *Modern* Library” (Klopfer to John W. Gassner, 22 March 1928).  

For a time they contemplated starting a separate series of older classics along the lines of Everyman’s Library. They scoured the lists of Everyman’s Library, Loeb Classical Library, and the “100 Best Books” for potential titles. The lists they compiled consisted mainly of standard works of classical and English literature, together with those of the Renaissance and, to a lesser extent, French literature. After considering various names for the series, they seem to have settled tentatively on the name Seven Seas Library; that at least is the name that appears most often in penciled memos from this period. Other names included Phoenix Library, Salamander Library, Pantheon Library, Mercury Library, and Random House Classics.  

Another possibility they considered was taking over an existing series of standard classics. In 1929 Cerf wrote to J. M. Dent & Co., the English publishers of Everyman’s Library, offering to distribute the series in the United States. American distribution of the series had been handled since its inception by E. P. Dutton Co. The relationship between the two firms was very close, and Dent had no interest in changing American distribution of the series (Cerf to Hugh R. Dent, 12 December 1929; Dent to Cerf, 1 January 1930). Cerf’s inquiry may have contributed to the soured relations between Dutton and the Modern Library that persisted for many years.  

In the end Cerf and Klopfer decided not to start a separate series of older classics. Many of the works listed as potential titles for the Seven Seas Library eventually found their way into the Modern Library.  

Another change in scope was that the Modern Library gradually lost its European orientation and became a series with neither European nor American authors seemingly outweighing the other. Signs of increased interest in American authors appeared soon after Cerf and Klopfer bought the series. A 1926 advertisement featuring photographs of Modern Library authors showed four Americans—Walt Whitman, Sherwood Anderson, James Branch Cabell, and Eugene O’Neill—and one European, Anatole France (ML advertisement, *New York Herald Tribune Books*, 7 November 1926). The Modern Library catalogue for 1927, announcing publication of *The Scarlet Letter*, stated: “The addition of this splendid novel is consistent with the avowed intention of the publishers to include in the Modern Library as many American authors as possible” (ML catalogue, Spring-Summer 1927).  

American authors were added regularly to the ML after 1925. No year went by without the publication of works by Americans, but the balance was not tipped suddenly in their favor. Of the twelve titles published in 1926, three were by Americans: Anderson, *Poor White* (121), Melville, *Moby-Dick* (124), and Lewisohn, *Up Stream* (128). The greatest concentration of Americans added to the series before 1930 came in 1927, when six out of nineteen new titles were by American authors.  

As with the inclusion of older classics, the new emphasis on American works did not become abundantly clear until the 1930s. The stock market crash of October 1929 ended seven years of prosperity, but the ML entered the Depression in a strong position. As Cerf wrote in 1929, “The Modern Library is no longer an experiment; it has become an institution in the book world. . . . These ubiquitous books . . . at one time or another have penetrated into nearly every American home and into the libraries of many readers in other countries” (“The Modern Library,” *Publishers’ Weekly*, 9 February 1929, p. 657; published anonymously but written by Cerf).  

### Number of titles  

Cerf and Klopfer added nineteen titles, bringing the total number of active titles to 167. No titles were discontinued. Minor discrepancies between the number of titles indicated here and on the back panels of ML jackets are due primarily to the ML’s practice of including titles projected for January publication on fall lists.  

### Format and printing  

All new titles were published in the standard format with the binding measuring 6⅝ x 4⅜ in. (168 x 110 mm) and the leaves trimmed to 6½ x 4¼ in. (164 x 107 mm).  

The ML’s standard format was enlarged in 1939. The new binding measured 7¼ x 4⅞ in. (182 x 123 mm) with a trim size of 7 x 4¾ in. (177 x 120 mm). In 1969 a taller, slightly slimmer format was introduced with the binding measuring 7½ x 4¾ in. (190 x 120 mm) and a trim size of 7¼ x 4½ in. (182 x 115 mm). All dimensions indicated are approximate.  

Most books through 1954 were printed with 16 pages on each side of the sheet and bound in gatherings of 16 leaves (32 pages); by 1956 most books were being printed with 32 pages on each side of the sheet and bound in gatherings of 32 leaves (64 pages).  

### Title page  

All new titles had the final version of Elmer Adler’s title page with the title in open-face type and the last line of the title page as PUBLISHERS : NEW YORK, all within a double-rule frame. Adler’s title page was used with two different torchbearers. The six titles published January–March had torchbearer B; the thirteen titles published April-December reverted to Lucian Bernhard’s torchbearer A2.  

### Binding  

The imitation leather bindings used since 1917 had never been altogether satisfactory. Castor oil used in manufacturing the imitation leather caused the bindings to emit a fishy odor in warm weather. Cerf and Klopfer began to think seriously about abandoning the imitation leather bindings in 1928. After experimenting with various binding cloths, they discovered a natural finish balloon cloth manufactured by the Siegbert Book Cloth Corporation that seemed to meet their requirements. They prepared samples of the new binding, with semi-flexible covers, and showed them to several leading booksellers and department store buyers. The response was favorable, and they decided to go ahead.  

The balloon cloth binding was officially introduced with the Modern Library’s January 1929 publications, Conrad Aiken’s *American Poetry 1671–1928: A Comprehensive Anthology* (169) and Gustave Flaubert’s *Salammbô* (170). The old spine and cover design continued to be used through March, but this was a temporary expedient. Shortly after they decided to substitute balloon cloth for imitation leather, Cerf and Klopfer asked Rockwell Kent, who had created the Random House device in 1927, to make a “simple . . . but characteristic Kentian design for the back-strip” (Cerf to Kent, 11 December 1928). Kent more than fulfilled his commission. He not only drew a striking new spine for Modern Library book, but redesigned the torchbearer and created new endpapers as well.  

Kent began with the idea of putting the torchbearer at the base of the spine, but decided that the figure was too attenuated for the space available. Still, he felt that the torch idea should be kept and wanted to use a sizable spot of gold to make the spine distinctive. His first solution was a design incorporating a candle. To Klopfer he wrote:  

After, I assure you, making more designs for that book-back than there are published works in the Modern Library; after considering and rejecting innumerable pictorial designs, nudes, phallic symbols, and so forth, as either inappropriate to book covers or indigestible to middle western and New England patrons of your publications; I have conceived and executed the somewhat trite, but I feel appropriate, device which I enclose, and if you feel that in employing a candle as part of it I have gone as far in suggestion as may be permitted, please realize that I have shown some restraint in not making that candle of the horrid dipped variety, so much in vogue in modern days (Kent to Klopfer, 26 January 1929).  

The candle was never used. Cerf had warned Kent that the balloon cloth would not take readily every kind of design, and the candle may have been too detailed to be stamped clearly. At that point Kent decided that nothing could be done with the original design and discarded it.  

Three weeks later he sent in an entirely new design. The new design, he noted, “should not only work out better in stamping but . . . in every way pleases me more” (Kent to Klopfer, 16 February 1929). Intended for the base of the spine, it consisted of an elegantly styled grape vine with intertwined branches, leaves, and bunches of grapes. Beneath the roots of the vine the words “Modern Library” were lettered in sans-serif capitals. Kent recommended that the lettering for the title and author at the head of the spine be drawn by hand. “You can get much more satisfactory spacing in that way,” he wrote. “There are innumerable professional letterers, any of whom can do this every month for you, promptly and at little cost” (Kent to Klopfer, 26 January 1929). The ML does not appear to have adopted this suggestion.  

For the front cover of the binding Kent redrew Bernhard’s torchbearer. He thought Bernhard’s figure was “good in design, but too grotesque to be in keeping with the serious nature of the Modern Library.” Kent drew a more graceful, floating figure, with the torch, instead of being held aloft, carried in front of the runner with the flare trailing over the runner’s head. He omitted the words “Modern Library” which had encircled Bernhard’s figure on the grounds that it was sufficient to have them on the spine. He also made two other changes in the figure. Bernhard’s figure faced left, toward the spine. Kent thought this a violation of common sense and precedent in book design and turned it around. He also altered its sex. Bernhard’s figure was assumed to be feminine; around the Modern Library office it was known as “a dame running away from Bennett Cerf.” Kent made his version neuter. “I defy you to discover the figure’s sex,” he told Klopfer. “That’s modern enough for you” (ibid).  

Kent’s binding design was introduced with *The Cabala* by Thornton Wilder, the Modern Library’s April 1929 title. Bernhard’s torchbearer was not completely superseded by Kent’s figure. It never again appeared on the binding or endpaper, but it continued to be used on Modern Library title pages and on many of the jackets.  

Kent’s work for the Modern Library was a remarkable achievement in book design. The combination of smooth balloon cloth and Kent’s spine and front cover designs produced what were perhaps the handsomest volumes the Modern Library ever published. Unfortunately, Kent’s design appears to have been overly ambitious for books that retailed at ninety-five cents. The extra gold it required increased the Modern Library’s binding costs by half a cent per copy. That half cent doomed the design, and it was used in its complete form for less than two years.  

The balloon cloth bindings were available in four colors: red, blue, green, and brown. The Modern Library published each title simultaneously in all four bindings.  

### Endpaper  

Two endpaper designs were used in 1929. Lucian Bernhard’s endpaper printed in light yellowish brown remained in use through March. A new endpaper designed by Rockwell Kent was introduced in April in conjunction with his new binding. Copies of the first printing of Thornton Wilder, *The Cabala* (175), which was published in April but probably printed in March, exist with both endpapers. The paste-down and free endpapers both featured Kent’s torchbearer at the center, surrounded by a pattern of open books and the initials “ml”. The conjunct endpapers were identical except that the two torchbearers faced each other. For the first year Kent’s endpapers were available in four different colors—light grayish red (18), dark yellowish pink (30), light reddish brown (42), and pale green (149)—and were color coordinated with the balloon cloth bindings. Red bindings had light grayish red endpapers, blue and green bindings had pale green endpapers, and brown bindings had dark yellowish pink or light reddish brown endpapers.  

Beginning in fall 1930 all Kent endpapers were printed in moderate orange (53) and were used with all four binding colors. Moderate orange endpapers were used with all balloon cloth bindings from fall 1930 through spring 1939, except for John Reed, *Ten Days That Shook the World* (1935) and three spring 1939 titles that were published in the larger format that the ML would adopt for all titles beginning that fall. An enlarged version of Kent’s endpaper, with the central panels with Kent’s torchbearer unchanged but with the surrounding pattern of open books and the initials “ml” extended to fill the larger space, was introduced in spring 1940.  

### Jackets  

All 1929 titles except *The Memoirs of Casanova* (185) were originally published in uniform typographic jacket D. The Casanova jacket has an inset illustration of Casanova in left profile holding a candlestick in one hand and opening a bedroom door with the other while the candle casts a shadow of a satyr on the door. *The Memoirs of Casanova* appears to be the first ML title to have been published initially in a pictorial jacket without the option of a uniform typographic jacket.  

An unknown number of ML titles were available in optional pictorial jackets as well as the uniform typographic jacket.  

### Price  

95 cents.  

### Dating keys  

*Dating keys:* (Spring) Dostoyevsky, *Brothers Karamazov* xChaucer, *Canterbury Tales*. (Fall) Chaucer, *Canterbury Tales* xHemingway, *Sun Also Rises*.  

### Titles sought, suggested, declined 

Erich Maria Remarque’s anti-war novel *All Quiet on the Western Front*, with sales of 300,000 copies in its first year, topped the 1929 best-seller list (Hackett and Burke, p. 107). Cerf offered an advance of \$5,000 to \$10,000 against royalties of 12 cents a copy to reprint it in the ML, but the offer was a long shot (Cerf to Alfred R. McIntyre, Little, Brown, 5 August 1929). The reprint edition of *All Quiet on the Western Front* was published by Grosset & Dunlap, which distributed its hardbound reprints through a wide range of retail outlets. In contrast, ML books were distributed primarily through traditional bookstores and the book departments of major department stores.  

In another long shot, Cerf offered a \$6,000 advance against royalties of 12 cents a copy for a volume of plays by George Bernard Shaw (Cerf to Lowell Brentano, 6 December 1929). Shaw retained tight control over his copyrights and refused to allow his works to appear in inexpensive reprint editions. It was not until the mid-1950s, following Shaw’s death, that the ML was able to publish two collections of his plays.  

Cerf sought reprint rights to Paul Leicester Ford’s novel *The Honorable Peter Stirling*, originally published by Henry Holt in 1894, but Grosset & Dunlap was also interested. Holt gave reprint rights to Grosset & Dunlap because they had published an earlier reprint of the book (Gilbert, p. 107). Cerf also expressed interest in a Robert Benchley anthology (Cerf to Herschel Brickell, Holt, 27 August 1929 and 11 December 1929).  

Hendrik Willem van Loon suggested his own book, *Tolerance* (Boni & Liveright, 1925), noting that it was “the sort of book to appeal to the free-thinkers and the free-thinking community is usually fairly poor” (Van Loon to Cerf, 16 February 1929). George Oppenheimer at Viking Press suggested André Tridon’s *Psychoanalysis*, originally published by B. W. Huebsch in 1919 (Oppenheimer to Klopfer, 22 October 1929). Both suggestions were rejected.  

Several months after Edmond Rostand’s *Cyrano de Bergerac* (174) appeared in the ML, Duffield & Co. inquired if the ML would be interested in Rostand’s later play *Chantecler* or Paul Verlaines’s *Poems*. Cerf declined both suggestions but expressed interest in *The History of Mr. Polly* by H. G. Wells (Cerf to Ridgely Hunt, Duffield, 24 October 1929).  

Albert Mordell sent his book, *The Erotic Motive in Literature* (Boni & Liveright, 1919), to Cerf for consideration. Cerf replied that it had no place in the ML because its “appeal is special, and many statements that would have sounded revolutionary in 1919 would fall flat today” (Cerf to Mordell, 13 December 1929). Interest in Mordell’s book revived in the 1960s and 1970s, when it was reprinted in a paperback edition by Collier Books and in hardcover for the library market by Octagon Books. Several translations were published in Chinese and Korean between the 1970s and the first decade of the twenty-first century.  

### Christmas gift boxes 

The ML produced three Christmas gift boxes in 1929. Each set consisted of three ML titles in a slipcase. The books had specially designed pictorial jackets and were advertised as “specially boxed and bound in gay colors, with picture jackets” (ML ad, *PW* 116, 21 September 1929, p. 1265). *Three Great French Romances* and *Three Great Modern Novels* were new; *Three Great Renaissance Romances* was first offered as a Christmas gift box in 1928. The Keratol bindings used in 1928 were replaced by colored balloon cloth which the ML had introduced as its standard binding earlier in the year. The pictorial jackets used for *Three Great French Romances* and *Three Great Renaissance Romances* were later adapted for use on regular ML printings. Hynd’s pictorial jackets for the *Three Great Modern Novels* gift box were exceptional examples of expressionist graphics but may have been too edgy for the ML’s mainstream audience. Their use was limited to the 1929 gift box; they were never adapted for use on copies of the books sold separately. The retail price of each set was \$2.85. The 1929 gift boxes were the last, though unsold boxes continued to be listed in ML catalogs. The three sets were:  

1\. *Three Great French Romances*: Zola, *Nana*; Gautier, *Mademoiselle de Maupin*; Flaubert, *Madame Bovary*.  
2\. *Three Great Renaissance Romances:* Cellini, *Autobiography*; Merejkowski, *Romance of Leonardo da Vinci*; Symonds, *Life of Michelangelo*.  

3\. *Three Great Modern Novels*: Dostoyevsky, *Brothers Karamazov*; Butler, *Way of All Flesh*; Hardy, *Return of the Native*.

Published February 1945. *WR* not found. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1978/79. *Note:* The copyright date is 1944, but publication of *A Comprehensive Anthology of Modern Poetry* appears to have been delayed until early 1945 because of wartime paper shortages.  

*A Comprehensive Anthology of American Poetry* also comprised the American portion of the ML Giant, *An Anthology of Famous English and American Poetry* (G68b), published in December 1945. At Cerf’s insistence the initial printings of the Giant omitted the poems of Ezra Pound, who had been taken into custody in Italy in May 1945 and was later returned to the United States to face charges of treason. Cerf ignored Aiken’s strenuous objections but agreed to list the twelve omitted poems and to include that statement that Aiken had been “overruled by the publishers, who flatly refused at this time to include a single line by Ezra Pound” (Cerf’s distaste for Pound’s politics was focused entirely on the forthcoming anthology. There was never any suggestion of purging Pound from *A Comprehensive Anthology of American Poetry* or *Twentieth-Century American Poetry* (137.2), both of which were published shortly before Pound’s arrest. The removal of Pound’s poems from the Giant was widely condemned, and they were restored in the 1947 printing (see G68).  

Since the regular ML edition of *A Comprehensive Anthology of American Poetry* (169.2) and Aiken’s portion of the Giant are printed from different type settings, it may be of interest to compare the two formats. With the restoration of Pound’s poems in G68b, the content of the two editions is identical except for a 7-line footnote on p. 788 of the Giant indicating that Pound’s poems had been restored. Both books are printed in the same typeface, but the Giant uses a larger point size. The type page of 169.2 consists of 41 lines, including the headline, compared to 43 lines in the Giant. The dimensions of the type pages are 146 x 86 mm in the regular edition and 170 x 101 mm in the Giant. Most of the poetry is unaffected by the width of the type page, but there are lines of Walt Whitman that occupy two lines of type in the regular edition and a single line in the Giant. Excluding preliminaries, indexes, and the fly title, the poems occupy 476 pages in the regular edition and 420 pages in the Giant.  

*American Poetry 1671*–*1928* and *A Comprehensive Anthology of American Poetry* do not include Phillis Wheatley, Paul Lawrence Dunbar, Countee Cullen, Claude McKay, Langston Hughes, or any other African American poet. These and other African American poets had been represented in *An Anthology of American Negro Literature* (183), edited by V. F. Calverton and published in the ML nine months after the first edition of Aiken’s anthology. Calverton’s anthology was out of print by the time *A Comprehensive Anthology of American Poetry* appeared in 1945. The revised edition of *An Anthology of American Negro Literature* (372), edited by Sylvestre C. Watkins and available in the ML between 1944 and 1956, excluded poetry on the grounds that “five outstanding anthologies” edited by Arna Bontemps, James Weldon Johnson, Countee Cullen, Beatrice M. Murphy, and R. J. Kerlin had appeared since the publication of Calverton’s volume (Preface, p. xii). It does not appear to have occurred to Aiken to comment on the exclusion of African American poets from his anthology.

Cerf invited Will Durant to write an introduction to *Salammbô* after Durant’s publishers, Richard L. Simon and M. Lincoln Schuster, told him that Durant was an enthusiastic admirer of the work. Durant insisted on a fee of \$100, twice what the ML usually paid, and then submitted a general essay on Flaubert. Cerf asked for changes, noting: “It seems to me much too obvious that this is just a chapter from a book with much too much about Madame Bovary in it, and much too little about Salammbo. And what there is about Salammbo is simply a synopsis of the story” (Cerf to Durant, 14 August 1928; Durant to Cerf, 16 August 1928; Cerf to Durant, 10 September 1928). Durant indicated that he didn’t have time to make changes, and the ML published *Salammbô* without an introduction.  

Four years after *Salammbô* was discontinued, James T. Farrell suggested Flaubert’s *Sentimental* *Education* for the ML (Farrell to Cerf, 1 February 1939). Cerf responded, “I am sorry to say that I see little point in adding another Flaubert title to the Modern Library at this time. We had to drop out both SALAMMBO and THE TEMPTATION OF ST. ANTHONY  because of complete lack of demand, and even MADAME BOVARY doesn’t sell one-quarter of what it did ten and fifteen years ago” (Cerf to Farrell, 2 February 1939).

*Binding and endpaper variants:* The new binding design created by Rockwell Kent was introduced in April 1929, but Kent tested his design on copies of the first printing of *The Brothers Karamazov*, which was scheduled for publication in February. *The Brothers Karamazov* first appeared with Bernhard endpapers in balloon cloth binding A with spine lettering set from type. Copies of the first printing are also found in balloon cloth binding with Kent’s grapevine design on the spine, his torchbearer in gold on the front panel, and the title and author on the spine stamped from lettering drawn by hand rather than set from metal type. There is also an intermediate stage between binding A and binding B1 which incorporates all elements of Kent’s design except hand lettering on the spine. Later printings appeared in balloon cloth bindings B2, with Kent’s torchbearer blind stamped on the front panel. The ML appears to have rejected Kent’s recommendation to employ letterers to create title and author statements for the binding spines of subsequent titles.

*Jacket B*: Pictorial expressionist jacket in dark brown and bluish gray depicting an unclothed male figure with his head in his hand walking through a stylized landscape consisting of a flower, a combined moon and sun, and geometrical shapes. Signed: Hynd. (*Spring 1929*) *Note:* The ML experimented with several pictorial jackets in 1929 in connection with three boxed sets of three titles each that were intended for sale as Christmas gifts. The boxed sets, which were sold primarily in department stores, were *Three Great French Romances*, *Three Great Renaissance Romances*, and *Three Great Modern Novels*. Hynd’s jackets for the volumes in the *Three Great Modern Novels* gift box—Butler’s *Way of All Flesh* (13.1d jacket B) and Hardy’s *Return of the Native* (126b jacket B) in addition to *The Brothers Karamazov*—were exceptional examples of expressionist graphics. They were never adapted for use on regular ML printings.

> Front flap: <br> Friedrich Nietzsche paid Fyodor Dostoyevsky the supreme compliment of acknowledging him his teacher, for he learned from the Russian that even a great criminal could be a great man. Dostoyevsky’s understanding of every exaltation and humiliation of the human spirit, his profound tenderness and compassion, his intensity and psychological clairvoyance are nowhere so completely realized as in *The Brothers Karamazov*. Here the mystic and the realist at last come into accord and give to the world this crowning achievement of Dostoyevsky’s tormented and almost fabulous life. (*Fall 1933*)  

Garnett translation originally published in U.S. by the Macmillan Co., 1912. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published February 1929. *WR* 23 March 1929. First printing: 20,000. Discontinued 1971/72.  

Klopfer inquired about the possibility of printing the ML edition from Macmillan plates but was informed that the Macmillan Co. in New York used printed sheets imported from England (Klopfer to George P. Brett, Jr., Macmillan, 31 October 1928; Harold S. Latham, Macmillan, to Klopfer, 9 November 1928). Cerf and Klopfer decided to assume the cost of original composition and announced that the ML edition was the first to be printed in the United States. Other publishers, they noted, “always imported it from England rather than undergo the great expense of making a new set of plates for so lengthy a book” (ML circular, RH box 133, Advertising 1929 folder 2). At 988 pages *The Brothers Karamazov* was longest book the ML had published up to that time.  

*The Brothers Karamazov* sold about 30,000 copies in its first two-and-a-half years in the ML (Cerf to Robert Linscott, 9 October 1931). It ranked in the middle of the second quarter of ML titles in terms of sales during the 18-month period, May 1942–October 1943. In the early 1950s (November 1951–October 1952) it was the twelfth best-selling title in the ML; the Giant edition (G34) ranked in the second quarter of ML titles.  

*The Brothers Karamazov* was one of four works to be published in the regular ML, ML Giants, and Illustrated ML. The other works included in all three series were Cervantes, *Don Quixote* (1930: 197), Giant (1934: G14), Illus ML (1946: IML 16); Fielding, *History of Tom Jones* (1931: 208), Giant (1940: G52), Illus ML (1943: IML 5); and Whitman, *Poems* (1921: 94.1), title changed to *Leaves of Grass* (1929), *Leaves of Grass and Selected Prose* (1951: 440); *Leaves of Grass* (Giant,1940: G48), Illus ML (1944: IML )

> Front flap: <br> The problems of abnormal psychology are as manifold as the problems of modern life. To understand the origins and manifestations of the psychoses that afflict us, we must come to a better comprehension of the biological and social factors involved. This handbook gives an all–inclusive view of the interrelationship of mental diseases to the forces in modern life which cause them. Here eminent authorities speak in non–technical terms for the layman, that he may better understand the causes and consequences of a maladjusted mental equipment. (*Spring 1939*)

Cerf asked Everett Dean Martin of the New School for Social Research in 1926 if there was any chance of including his book *Psychology: What It Has to Teach You about Yourself and Your World* (W. W. Norton, 1924) in the ML. If not, he asked whether Martin would be interested in compiling an anthology on psychology as a companion to *An Outline of Psychoanalysis* (108). Martin replied negatively to both (Cerf to Martin, 21 September 1926; Martin to Cerf, 28 September 1926).  

Cerf turned next to Gardner Murphy, who received royalties of 5 cents a copy.  

*An Outline of Abnormal Psychology* sold 1,634 copies during the first six months of 1930 and 1,113 copies during the first six months of the following year. It ranked low in the second quarter of ML titles in terms of sales during the 18-month period, May 1942–October 1943.

> Front flap: <br> Abnormality, as Hippocrates suggested centuries ago, is essentially a matter of defect or of exaggeration, and so the line between what is normal behavior and what is abnormal behavior is a thin, shifting one. In the study of the range of human variability lies a key to sympathetic understanding of those who suffer the tragedy of a sick, disturbed mind. In such study, too, lies a key to a greater capacity to understand one’s own emotional and social growth and thus to cope more skillfully with the endless problems, crises, and frustrations of everyday living. In this book, eminent authorities, using non-technical language, introduce the layman to the scope and the new horizons of abnormal psychology. (*Fall 1954*)  

Revised edition published fall 1954. *WR* 16 October 1954. First printing: 7,500 copies. Discontinued 1970/71.  

Murphy wrote Cerf in 1953 that a revision of *An Outline of Abnormal Psychology* was badly needed. He indicated that he had recently reviewed the selections in the 1929 edition and that in almost every instance it would be possible to select a superior example to represent current research and practice. He noted that he would need a collaborator who was familiar with fields in which he was not up-to-date (Murphy to Cerf, 14 January 1953).  

Stein replied four months later that the ML was planning revisions of several titles, including *An Outline of Abnormal Psychology*. He suggested that Murphy engage a collaborator for a flat fee of \$300, which would be paid as an advance against Murphy’s royalties, and indicated that the ML would pay up to \$300 for permissions. The royalty rate was to remain at 5 cents a copy (Stein to Murphy, 15 May 1953). Murphy thought that \$500 should be the minimum fee for a collaborator but believed that permissions would be less than \$300. Stein agreed to the \$500 collaborator’s fee and reduced the permissions budget to \$200 (Murphy to Stein, 23 May 1953; Stein to Murphy, 29 May 1953). Murphy selected Bachrach as his collaborator. Bachrach made the preliminary selection of contents, and Murphy wrote a new introduction. The revised edition contained completely new material.  

The American Institute of Graphic Arts selected *An Outline of Abnormal Psychology* as one of the fifty best books of 1954 (*Fifty Books of the Year 1954: Catalog of the Thirty-third Annual Exhibition* [New York: American Institute of Graphic Arts, 1955], p. 34). The book was designed by Peter Oldenburg and manufactured by H. Wolff Book Manufacturing Company.

> Front flap: <br> Who can withhold a tear for Cyrano de Bergerac as he hides his preposterous nose in the darkness and lets his lyric utterances win the fair Roxane for the handsome but mute Christian de Neuvillette? Who has not been moved to pity by the romantic posturings of the unerring swordsman, this understudy knight of chivalry and ghost-writing maker of sonorous ballades? All the fine bravura of Edmond Rostand’s swaggering drama, all its poetical extravagance and glamor are here in Brian Hooker’s famous translation. (*Fall 1933*)  

Hooker translation originally published by Henry Holt & Co., 1923. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published March 1929. *WR* 27 April 1929. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1973/74.  

The Holt plates were too large for the ML’s format, so the ML reset the text and made new plates for its edition. The ML paid Holt royalties of 10 cents a copy, but Holt agreed to contribute to the cost of the new plates by accepting reduced royalties of 8 cents a copy on the first 30,000 copies. The ML paid Holt a \$3,400 advance in December 1928 against royalties on the first 40,000 copies at this sliding scale.  

In 1936 Holt considered bringing out a school edition of *Cyrano de Bergerac* at an educational discount, and Richard Thornton, the president of Holt, asked Cerf if the ML would object. Klopfer expressed concern that it would interfere with ML sales to college bookstores, but he acknowledged that Holt had the right to do as it wished. “I’m merely putting in this feeble squawk to see if I can’t get you to change your mind.” Thornton assured Klopfer that the proposed edition was aimed at high schools and wouldn’t affect the college market. “I would not have proposed such a volume if I had felt it would have any serious effect on your own book” (Thornton to Cerf, 17 June 1936; Klopfer to Thornton, 18 June 1936; Thornton to Klopfer, 19 June 1936).  

*Cyrano de Bergerac* ranked low in the second quarter of ML sales during the 18-month period, May 1942–October 1943. It was the tenth best-selling ML title during the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952. Sales may have been stimulated by the 1950 film starring Jose Ferrer.

Jacques Le Clercq, whose translations of Rabelais’s *Gargantua and Pantagruel* (G66) and Dumas’s *Three Musketeers* (153.2) were published in the ML in 1944 and 1950, indicated in 1953 that he was working a rhymed verse translation of *Cyrano de Bergerac* and inquired if the ML would be interested in it. He commented, “Of course, the Hooker job is superb. However, it does not render Rostand’s complete text and, though a perfect transposition, nevertheless lacks the bravura quality that was inherent in Rostand.” Commins replied that the ML couldn’t consider changing the translation, which had “established itself as standard for many college courses” (Le Clercq to Saxe Commins, 4 February 1953; Commins to Le Clercq, 10 February 1953; Commins Papers, Box 5, Princeton University Library). Le Clercq’s translation of *Cyrano de Bergerac* does not appear to have been published.  

By 1953 the ML’s plates were badly worn and Klopfer declared the ML edition “a disgrace.” He wrote Holt that he wanted to keep *Cyrano* in the series but that new plates had to be made. He suggested that Holt accept a 6-cent royalty on the first 25,000 copies printed from new plates, after which the rate would revert to 10 cents a copy. This time Holt declined to share the cost of new plates (Klopfer to Alfred C. Edwards, Holt, 6 May 1953; William E. Buckley, Holt, to Klopfer, 22 May 1953). The ML appears to have reset the text at its own expense. By the mid-1960s the ML was paying royalties of 5 cents a copy.

*Format: The Cabala* was the first ML title published in balloon cloth binding B. Copies with the statement “First Modern Library Edition | 1929” have been seen with the Bernhard endpaper, which was used through March 1929, the month in which the first printing was probably made, and also the Kent endpaper, which began to be used in April, the month in which *The Cabala* was published.

Signed: N.B. (*Spring 1929*) *Note:* At this period the ML was making a limited number of titles available in pictorial jackets as an alternative to the uniform typographic jacket. Jackets A and B were superseded by jacket C in fall 1931.  

*Jacket C:* Pictorial in grayish purple (228) and black on light purplish gray paper with inset illustration as jacket B; lettering in black, borders in grayish purple. (*Fall 1931*  

> Front flap: <br> The sensational success of *The Bridge of San Luis Rey* obscured for a time the fine lustre of Thornton Wilder’s earlier work, *The Cabala*. But critics and an enthusiastic minority of readers clung to their preference for the calm and suave classicism of the Italian tale in the Henry James tradition. The restraint and the mystical implications of *The Cabala*, the imaginative subtlety with which it is endowed, the firmness of its characterizations, its wit and irony, give it a place of eminence among contemporary novels. (*Fall 1933*)  

Originally published by Albert & Charles Boni, 1926. ML edition (pp. [iii], [3]–230) printed from Boni plates. The heading of the contents page of Boni printings was changed from *The Cabala* to *Contents* at some point between the sixth printing (January 1928) and the tenth printing (August 1928); ML printings use the second version of the contents page. Published April 1929. *WR* 11 May 1929. First printing: 8,000 copies. Discontinued fall 1937.  

Cerf invited Wilder to write a brief foreword to the ML edition. “I know that you have no great liking for doing introductions,” he wrote, “particularly to writings of your own; as a matter of fact it is not an introduction that we want for this book, rather a graceful salaam to send it on its way in its new format. . . . ‘The Cabala,’ at 95¢, is going to sell to a brand new audience that has never been able to afford to buy a book of yours before. In particular this new audience will be made up largely of college students. I am sure that just a few words stating how the book grew in your mind will be a fine thing to have in this edition” (Cerf to Wilder, 11 March 1929). He offered \$100, double the ML’s usual fee, but Wilder did not succumb to the invitation. At the last moment Cerf turned to Herbert Gorman, offering him \$50 for an introduction to be written within five days (Cerf to Gorman, 21 March 1929). Gorman met the deadline, and the ML edition went to press at the end of March.  

*The Cabala* sold well during its first two or three years in the series. There were two printings of 1,000 copies each in 1930 and another printing of 1,000 copies in 1931. The last printing recorded in the RH archives was for 1,000 copies in 1933.

> Front flap: <br> “By his dissolute life he had become as famous as other men by a life of energy, and he was regarded as no ordinary profligate, but as an accomplished voluptuary. . . . He became one of the chosen circle of Nero’s intimates, and was looked upon as an absolute authority on questions of taste in connection with the science of luxurious living.” This estimate of Petronius Arbiter by Tacitus completely characterizes the author of *The Satyricon* as the cultivated and depraved apotheosis of his uninhibited age. (*Fall 1936*)  

Abbey Classics edition with Scott Moncrieff introduction originally published in U.S. by Small, Maynard & Co., 1923, using sheets of the English edition. ML edition (pp. v–238) follows the text of the Abbey Classics edition with the substitution of modern typesetting conventions for Burnaby’s 17th-century practice of capitalizing nouns within sentences. Printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Publication announced for May 1929. *WR* 13 July 1929. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall 1957.  

*The Satyricon* was written during the reign of Nero. The Burnaby translation, originally published in 1694, was the first in English. Burnaby included supplements to the text, later shown to be spurious, that had been “discovered” in 1688. The first page of the ML text is headed: THE SATYRICON | OF PETRONIUS | *THE SATYR OF* | *TITUS PETRONIUS ARBITER* | *With its Fragments, recover’d at Buda, 1688*. (p. 1).  

The ML edition sold 2,015 copies during the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943, making it one of the ML’s ten worst-selling titles. It did not rank among the one hundred best-selling titles in the regular ML during the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952

> Front flap: <br> From the time Honoré de Balzac pronounced Stendhal’s preeminence among the novelists of France until today, the author of *The Red and the Black* has retained and spread his influence among writers of every nationality. His story of Julien Sorel is incomparably the most astute and penetrating study of middle-class mores in all fiction. It is, in addition, a relentless dissection of the hypocrisy and opportunism of as unconscionable an upstart as ever violated the Seventh and other Commandments in order to get on in the world. (*Spring 1933*)  

Scott Moncrieff translation originally published in U.S. in two volumes by Boni & Liveright, 1926. ML edition (pp. v–[288]; v–[352]) printed from B&L plates. Published June 1929. *WR* 13 July 1929. First printing: 4,000 copies. Discontinued 1973/74. Reissue format, 1984.  

The ML hyphenates the translator’s name as Scott-Moncrieff on the 177a title page and omits the hyphen in 177b‑e. Boni & Liveright was also inconsistent in its multi-volume *Works of Stendhal*, hyphenating the translator’s name on the title page of *The Red and the Black* and omitting the hyphen on the title page of *The Charterhouse of Parma* and the jackets of both works.  

The ML paid Liveright royalties of 10 cents a copy.  

*The Red and the Black* ranked high in the fourth quarter of ML titles in terms of sales during the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943. It rose to the first quarter of ML sales during the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952. The dramatic increase in sales may reflect use of *The Red and the Black* in college literature courses after the Second World War, when enrollments increased dramatically as large numbers of veterans took advantage of the G.I. Bill to earn college degrees.

> Front flap: <br> “True passion,” Stendhal wrote, “never thinks of anything but itself.” Based on an actual incident that Stendhal read about in the *Gazette des Tribunaux* in 1827, *The Red and the Black* is a brilliant psychological portrait of passion, opportunism and political intrigue set in 19th-century Restoration France. It is the story of Julien Sorel, a young man of humble origins but high aspirations, whose prospects for a respectable public career are cut short by boundless egotism, tragic love, and revenge. Stendhal’s characters, from the calculating Julien with his Napoleonic yearnings, to the benevolent Abbé Pirard, to the Marquis de la Mole and the Jesuit de Frilair, are intimately connected with contemporary historical circumstances. The contrast between the “red” and the “black” symbolizes the conflict between liberals and conservatives, the army and the clergy. As sharp in its analysis of blind ambition as it is in its satire of bourgeois mores and French society, *The Red and the Black* established Stendhal as one of the preeminent novelists of the 19th century.

> Front flap: <br> The glory that was Greece is nowhere so luminously reflected as in the mirror of her drama. Through the masks of tragedy and comedy, nobility and villainy, and all the duality of the human spirit, the life of man glows to passion and grows dim. Pity and terror in Æschylus, serene detachment in Sophocles, burning fervor for justice in Euripides and the robust intellectual comedy of Aristophanes—these qualities remain the message and the meaning of Greek drama. It is a heritage from antiquity that the modern spirit needs. (*Fall 1933*)  

Original ML anthology. Publication announced for July 1929. *WR* 14 September 1929. First printing: Not ascertained. Superseded spring 1951 by *Seven Famous Greek Plays*, ed. Whitney J. Oates and Eugene O’Neill, Jr. (439).  

Cerf wrote shortly after publication, “The Greek Plays has done nobly, and has thoroughly justified its inclusion in the series. I am still regretting the fact, however, that we did not get permission to use the Gilbert Murray translations” (Cerf to Landis, 8 May 1930). Twenty-two years later the ML used Murray’s translation of *The Frogs* in *Seven Famous Greek Plays* (439).

Here, too, are the caustic turns of speech, the sardonic wit and the acute powers of observation that have made Smollett’s books a plunder house for English writers during almost two centuries. And here, above all, is Smollett in a genial and mellow mood, but candid and outspoken, with the healthy frankness of the eighteenth century. (*Fall 1936*)  

ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published August 1929. *WR* 14 September 1929. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.  

Cerf wanted to include a volume of Machen’s stories in the ML and proposed the idea to him when he visited London in summer 1926. *The Hill of Dreams* and *The House of Souls* were in the U.S. public domain, but Machen, who badly needed the money a ML edition would bring, felt he could approve the proposal only if Alfred A. Knopf, his American publisher, did not object (Machen to Cerf, 7 July 1926). Cerf approached Knopf on several occasions but was unable to secure his approval. He told Machen he hadn’t given up hope; meanwhile, he asked him to write an introduction to a volume by Smollett. He offered \$100, twice the ML’s usual fee, and asked him which Smollett title he would recommend (Cerf to Machen, 21 April 1927). Machen indicated that *Humphry Clinker*, “the work of Smollett’s softened old age” was his own favorite. However, he thought that *Roderick Random* was “more characteristically Smollett: rough, hard, vigorous, cruel: I think it is the typical book to begin with. . . .” He expressed the hope that Cerf would send the money with his order for the introduction: “I am hard up” (Machen to Cerf, 30 April 1927). Illness delayed his work on the introduction by a year, but he wrote Cerf in April 1928 that he was ready to go ahead with it.  

*Humphry Clinker* ranked in the fourth quarter of ML titles in terms of sales during the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the 12-month period, November 1951–October 1952.

Here is Smollett, grown tolerant of human frailty after having screamed against it in *Roderick Random*, now writing in the mellow, satiric vein of amiable elderly people in whom there is a hard core of eccentricity. *Humphry Clinker*, now almost two hundred years old, still retains the freshness and the vigor of the best of the eighteenth-century novels.

> Front flap: <br> To classify *The Dance of Life* as a book of philosophy, as a spiritual autobiography or even as a book of personal affirmations does it scant justice. It is all of these and more. It is a book of aspiration, of growth and of revelation, written by a man who has partaken of life and contributed to its wisdom, grace and idealism. *The Dance of Life* may be considered the crowning achievement of Havelock Ellis’s life; it epitomizes his spirit and his work. (*Spring 1938*)  

Originally published in U.S. by Houghton Mifflin Co., 1923. ML edition printed from Houghton Mifflin plates made from a new typesetting. Published September 1929. *WR* 26 October 1929. First printing: 15,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1959.  

In addition to the ML printing, the new plates were used for 1929 printings in Houghton Mifflin’s Riverside Library and the Book League of America. A revised index keyed to the new typesetting appears in ML and Book League of America printings but not the Riverside Library printing, which ends on p. 342, the last page of text. The Book League of America contents page lists the index while the ML’s doesn’t. Ellis’s new foreword is unique to ML printings.  

The ML paid Houghton Mifflin an undetermined advance against royalties on the first 50,000 copies. There was a second printing of 5,000 copies in March 1931; printings reached 50,000 copies by October 1945.  

*The Dance of Life* ranked in the 3rd quarter of ML titles in terms of sales during the 18-month period, May 1942–October 1943. It was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the 12-month period, November 1951–October 1952.

> Front flap:  <br> The path of Lilly Czepanek’s destiny was made radiant and tragic by her own beauty. Her life was consecrated to love. As it was with Shulamite, who inspired Solomon’s Song of Songs, so love had set a seal upon Lilly’s heart. All the denials of poverty, the violences of lechery and the longings of her own dream world only made her more desirable in the eyes of men. Hermann Sudermann’s novel of a woman who walked in sin is a romance in the cause of love beyond purity. (*Fall 1935*)  

Seltzer translation originally published by B. W. Huebsch, 1909, and after 1925 by Viking Press. ML edition (pp. [3]–640) printed from Huebsch/Viking plates with Huebsch half title used as a fly title. Published October 1929. *WR* 23 November 1929. First printing: 8,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1942.  

ML printings do not identify the translator. Huebsch and Viking printings attribute the translation to Thomas Seltzer, but it was actually by his wife Adele Seltzer, who wanted to publicize her husband’s name. Thomas Seltzer’s contribution was typing the manuscript that was submitted to Huebsch (Levin, *Dare to Be Different*, pp. 85, 269).  

The ML paid Viking royalties of 8 cents a copy. There were three additional printings of 2,000 copies each between April 1930 and April 1931 and five known printings of 1,000 copies each between November 1932 and April 1941.  

Sudermann’s novel was read more widely in the early decades of the 20th century than it is today. Jackets of early ML printings of *Madame Bovary* (25.1) state on the front panel: “Today there are two more novels that are likely to be classed with [*Madame Bovary*] . . . Tolstoy’s ‘Anna Karenina’ and Sudermann’s ‘Song of Songs.’” (see 25.1a).

> Text on front: <br> A comprehensive anthology that presents a striking picture of the intellectual development of the American negro. The volume contains short stories, significant excerpts from novels, essays, spirituals, poetry, and blues, and includes contributions by Booker T. Washington, Walter White, Claude McKay, Jean Toomer, Eric Walrond, Countee Cullen, and many others. (*Fall 1929*)  

Original ML anthology. Published October 1929. *WR* 23 November 1929. First printing: Not ascertained. Superseded 1944 by a revised edition edited by Sylvestre C. Watkins (372).  

When W. C. Handy authorized the inclusion of five blues he had copyrighted, he stipulated that copyright notices were to be printed on the same pages as the lyrics. Calverton acknowledged Handy generously in the preface but neglected to include the individual copyright notices. Handy or his representative contacted the ML shortly after publication, insisting that the agreement be honored. Klopfer contacted the ML’s legal counsel about the matter (Klopfer to Edwin A. Falk, 27 November 1929). He subsequently wrote to H. Wolff Estate, the ML’s binders, informing them that pp. 223–28 were being reprinted and that corrected sheets would be sent over immediately. He asked that the bindery’s truckmen pick up all copies on hand and return them to the bindery’s stock. “It is necessary to have this cancel made on the entire edition,” he stated, “and all future editions will, of course, be correctly printed” (Klopfer to Miss J. A. Lanning, H. Wolff Estate, 26 December 1929). The corrected state of the first printing is described under 183a<sub>2</sub>. 

Calverton’s *Anthology of American Negro Literature* sold 3,243 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it near the top of the fourth quarter of ML and Giant titles in terms of sales. The anthology was superseded in 1944 by a new edition edited by Sylvestre C. Watkins (372). Watkins omitted poetry and other material.

> Front flap:  <br> Negro achievement in the arts has kept pace with a change in intellectual conviction. Injustice and discrimination have proven a challenge, and that challenge is being answered with the literature produced by the colored race during the last decade. This anthology gives a comprehensive picture of the struggle of a people to affirm its own genius. It is representative of a new consciousness; it gives evidence of a determination to end the admission of inferiority and to begin to assert the unique and durable qualities of a race.

> Text on front: “Mr. Van Vechten’s most popular novel introduces a continuous procession of restless modern sophisticates—artists, writers, actors, and the like. They are drawn from life, and indeed, many of them appear under their own names.” (*Fall 1929*)  

Originally published by Alfred A. Knopf, 1922. ML edition (pp. [*5*]–247) printed from Knopf plates. Published November 1929. *WR* 21 December 1929. First printing: 8,000 copies. Discontinued fall 1935.  

James Crowder, the ML’s midwestern sales representative, suggested the inclusion of *Peter Whiffle* (Crowder to Cerf, 21 December 1928). At this time Knopf remained cool toward the series because of his lingering resentment over the ML edition of *Green Mansions* (90). However, Cerf had become friendly with Blanche Knopf and the two of them were trying to put together a peace treaty (Cerf to Crowder, 24 December 1928). Relations between Knopf and the ML improved after a January 1929 luncheon meeting. Shortly thereafter Cerf offered Knopf a \$1,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy for *Peter Whiffle*. He also offered to pay Van Vechten \$100, double the ML’s usual fee, to write an introduction. Knopf transmitted the offer to Van Vechten, who indicated that he preferred that the book appear without an introduction. Van Vechten also wanted to make some corrections in the plates before Knopf turned them over to the ML (Knopf to Cerf, 13 February 1929). *Peter Whiffle* was the first copyrighted Knopf title to be reprinted in the ML.  

There was a second printing of 1,000 copies in August 1932.

> Front flap:
The pursuit of women and adventure was the chief activity of Casanova’s life. Amorous and exciting exploits demanded all his energy and ability. When old age tempered his audacity, he retired to write the nostalgic recollections of his youthful prowess. The manuscript which has come down to us in various condensations has been the joy of those who cultivate delectable but forbidden pleasures, as it has been anathema and despair to prudes. The Modern Library edition includes the most vivid encounters and escapades of a glamorous life. (*Fall 1936*)  

Unidentified translation edited and probably abridged for the ML by Madeleine Boyd. Published November 1929. *WR* 21 December 1929. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.  

The ML sold exclusive reprint rights to the Madeleine Boyd edition to Garden City Publishing Co. for \$1,500. The ML supplied duplicate plates (omitting the introduction) and retained all rights to publish its own edition (Robert F. de Graff, Garden City, to Cerf, 22 January 1932). A full-sized edition with illustrations by Victor Candell was published by Garden City later that year under the imprint Sun Dial Press.  

*The Memoirs of Jacques Casanova* ranked in the 3rd quarter of ML titles in terms of sales during the 18-month period, May 1942–October 1943. It was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the 12-month period, November 1951–October 1952.

The pursuit of women and adventure was the principal activity of Casanova’s life. By his own account, amorous and other exciting exploits demanded virtually all of his energy and resourcefulness. When old age tempered his passions, he retired to write the recollections of his youthful escapades. The manuscript which has come down to us from the eighteenth century in various condensations has delighted those readers who cultivate an interest in accounts of forbidden pleasures. It has also brought a little discomfort to the prudish-minded. This edition includes some of the most vivid encounters and escapades of Casanova’s crowded life. (*Fall 1960*)

> Front flap:
Of the books of antiquity which adorn the Modern Library series, none is in greater favor than Homer’s *Iliad* and its companion volume, *The Odyssey* (No. 167). The immortal epic of the wrath of Achilles and the siege of Troy is as vivid to the contemporary reader as it must have been to Homer’s first enraptured listeners seven centuries before the Christian era, and as it has remained through the ages in its various renderings. The Lang-Leaf-Myers translation was chosen upon the urgent advice of the leading authorities in England and America. (*Spring 1936*)  

Lang-Leaf-Myers translation originally published in U.S. by the Macmillan Co., 1883. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published December 1929. *WR* not found. First printing: Not ascertained. Superseded fall 1964 by Rees translation (186.2).  

The ML originally planned to use the 17th-century translations of George Chapman for its editions of Homer’s *Iliad* and *Odyssey*. Advance advertising referred to the Chapman translations, as did fall 1929 catalogs and ML lists—including the lists inside first printings of the Homer jackets. The Lang-Leaf-Myers translation of *The Iliad* and the Butcher and Lang translation of *The Odyssey* were substituted at the last moment on the advice of several college professors. “We discovered that we could sell five times as many books in the new translation as we could have had we used the Chapman, since the Lang, Leaf, and Myers one is used in almost all of the colleges” (Cerf to George M. McKanday, Macmillan Co. of Canada, 25 November 1930).  

The Prefatory Note (p. [*5*]) indicates that Books I–IX were translated by Leaf, X–XVI by Lang, and XVII–XXIV by Myers, but that the whole was revised by all three translators.  

The ML hoped to use Macmillan plates, but Macmillan had to secure approval from its parent firm in London and was unable to make a solid offer until the end of October. By that time the ML had begun composition so that the books could be published in December.  

*The Iliad* ranked in the middle of the second quarter of ML titles during the 18-month period May 1942–October 1943 and rose into the lower part of the first quarter during the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952. Sales totaled 122,292 copies by spring 1958.

Highet received \$300 for his introductions to *The Iliad* and *The Odyssey* (Stein to Highet, 26 January 1950). The first section of the introductions (“The World of the *Iliad* and the *Odyssey*”) is common to both volumes, as is the bibliography. Highet’s introductions were also included in printings of *The Iliad* and *The Odyssey* in Modern Library College Editions, which were introduced in fall 1950. Most of the introductions written for MLCE appeared first in that series and were subsequently added to regular ML printings.  

The Prefatory Note and the poems on pp. [*6*] and [465] of 186.1a–b are omitted from 186.1c.  

Myers’s name was misspelled on the reset title page. Highet pointed out the error shortly after publication (Highet to Crary, 8 September 1950). There is a memo in the RH Papers ordering the correction on the MLCE title page. The title page of the regular ML edition does not appear to have been corrected.

> Front flap:
With the publication of *The Iliad*, Ennis Rees has completed the monumental work of translating all of Homer into natural, free-flowing verse, and he has fulfilled the promise of his brilliant translation of *The Odyssey*. > The tale of heroes and gods who fought the Trojan War is now available in a translation at once faithful to the superb original and extremely accessible to the contemporary reader.  

Rees translation originally published by Random House, 1963. ML edition (pp. v–529) printed from RH plates with the dedication and title page adapted from the RH printing. Published fall 1964. *WR* 16 November 1964. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1982/83.  

Epstein wanted to include Richmond Lattimore’s verse translation of *The Iliad* in the ML in 1960, but reprint rights do not appear to have been available (Epstein to Roger Shugg, University of Chicago Press, 6 January 1960). RH published Rees’s verse translation of *The Odyssey* later that year, followed by his verse translation of *The Iliad* in 1963. Rees’s volumes were designed so that the plates could be used for ML printings.  

The ML title page reproduces the title exactly as it appears in the RH printing, but the statement of responsibility for the translator (TRANSLATED BY | ENNIS REES) and the imprint are reduced in size, significantly improving the balance and aesthetic appeal of the ML title page. The dedication facing the title page is reduced from four lines in the RH printing (THIS TRANSLATION | IS DEDICATED | TO JEFFREY, AMY, | AND ANDREW) to two lines (TO JEFFREY, AMY, | AND ANDREW) in the ML.

> Front flap:
Of the books of antiquity which adorn the Modern Library series, none is in greater favor than Homer’s *The Odyssey* and its companion volume, *The Iliad* (No. 166). The immortal epic of the ten-year wanderings of Ulysses remains as vivid to the contemporary reader as it was when first recited to Homer’s enthralled audience many centuries before the Christian era. The Modern Library edition of the Butcher and Lang prose translation has been adopted by many leading universities as the standard text of this classic. (*Fall 1936*)  

Butcher and Lang translation originally published in U.S. by the Macmillan Co., 1879. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published December 1929. *WR* not found. First printing: Not ascertained. Superseded spring 1962 by Rees translation (187.2).  

See 186.1a for information about the selection of the Butcher and Lang translation.  

*The Odyssey* ranked in the middle of the second quarter of ML titles during the 18-month period, May 1942–October 1943, slightly below *The Iliad*. It was near the top of the second quarter during the 12-month period November 1951–October 1952, four titles below *The Iliad*.

> Front flap:
This is a completely new translation of the ODYSSEY of Homer. Brilliantly done in natural, free-flowing verse, it is the most readable version available to modern readers. 
The successful recapture here of the flavor and meaning of the ODYSSEY will enable the reader to see fully why the epic story of the wanderings of Odysseus has been one of the most treasured legacies of ancient Greece. (*Spring 1962*)  

Rees translation originally published by Random House, 1960. ML edition (pp. vii–416) printed from RH plates, with the title page adapted from the original plates. Published spring 1962. *WR* 4 June 1962. First printing: 10,000 copies. Discontinued 1971/72.  

Rees’s translation of *The Odyssey* filled the need for a modern verse translation. Richmond Lattimore’s verse translation of *The Odyssey* did not appear until 1967, sixteen years after his translation of *The Iliad*. The Lattimore translation probably would not have been available to the ML in any case. Rees’s verse translation of *The Iliad* was published in 1963 and was added to the ML the following year (see 186.2). Both of Rees’s volumes were designed so that the plates could be used for ML printings.  

The ML title page reproduces the title exactly as it appears in the RH printing, but the statement of responsibility for the translator (TRANSLATED BY | ENNIS REES) and the imprint are reduced in size, significantly improving the balance and aesthetic appeal of the ML title page. The 3-line dedication facing the title page in the RH printing, which is identical to that in Rees’s translation of *The Iliad*, is shifted in the ML printing to the recto of the third leaf (p. [v]).
