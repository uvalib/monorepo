# MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1932  

##  1932  

### General  

Elmer Adler, who had been a director of Random House since the imprint was created in 1927 to distribute and publish fine limited editions, resigned in 1932. Thereafter he devoted himself exclusively to his fine printing business, Pynson Printers, and to *The Colophon*, the bibliophilic quarterly which he published from 1930 to 1940. Random House was reorganized—still as a subsidiary of The Modern Library, Inc.—with Cerf and Klopfer as sole directors. It was not until 1933, following the bankruptcy of Liveright, Inc., that Cerf and Klopfer turned seriously to trade publishing.  

ML Giants, which had been introduced in fall 1931, continued to provide exceptional value in the Depression book market. The four volumes published in 1932 sold for \$1.00 each and averaged more than 1,300 pages per volume.  

The ML published a full-page ad in *Publishers’ Weekly* that lampooned the publishing industry adage, “You can’t sell books like soap.” Adapting the widely known slogan of Ivory Soap, the ad is headed “They Float!” and depicts an attractive young woman seated in her bath with five Modern Library books—*Of Human Bondage*, *Swann’s Way*, *The Magic Mountain*, *Droll Stories*, and *Sanctuary*—floating on the surface of the water (*PW*, 14 May 1932, p. 2015).  

### Number of titles  

Twenty-four titles were added and fifteen were discontinued, bringing the number of titles in the regular ML to 207. Six of the discontinued titles (two by Maupassant and four by Wilde) were repackaged as three volumes to offer better value. Chekhov, *Rothschild’s Fiddle and Other Stories*, which had been in the ML since 1917, was replaced by a more comprehensive collection, *The Stories of Anton Tchekov*, edited by Robert Linscott). Three new titles in ML Giants, including Gibbon, *Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire* in two volumes, brought the number of Giants to six titles in seven volumes. *Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire* was expanded to three volumes in 1946.  

### Format  

All new titles except Dreiser, *Sister Carrie* (230) were published in the standard format with the binding measuring 6⅝ x 4⅜ in. (168 x 110 mm) and the leaves trimmed to 6½ x 4¼ in. (164 x 107 mm). *Sister Carrie* was ¼ in. taller.  

The ML’s standard format was enlarged in 1939. The new binding measured 7¼ x 4⅞ in. (182 x 123 mm) with a trim size of 7 x 4¾ in. (177 x 120 mm). In 1969 a taller, slightly slimmer format was introduced with the binding measuring 7½ x 4¾ in. (190 x 120 mm) and a trim size of 7¼ x 4½ in. (182 x 115 mm). All dimensions indicated are approximate.  

Most books through 1954 were printed with 16 pages on each side of the sheet and bound in gatherings of 16 leaves (32 pages); by 1956 most books were being printed with 32 pages on each side of the sheet and bound in gatherings of 32 leaves (64 pages).  

### Title page  

All new titles had the final version of Elmer Adler’s title page with the title in open-face type; all but three had torchbearer A2. Dostoyevsky, *Crime and Punishment* (228) had torchbearer A3; Dos Passos, *Three Soldiers* (248) had torchbearer C1; *The Arabian Nights’ Entertainments* (244) had no torchbearer on the title page. All new titles except *The Arabian Nights’ Entertainments* had the 3-line imprint that began to be used in January 1931:  

<center> <span class="smallcaps">  Bennet A. Cerf · Donald S. Klopfer </span> </center>  
<center> T H E  M O D E R N  L I B R A R Y </center> 
<center> <span class="smallcaps"> New York<span>  </center>

The title page of *The Arabian Nights’ Entertainments* had so much text that there was no room for a torchbearer or Cerf and Klopfer’s names.  

The imprint for newly published titles reverted to the previous 2-line format in March 1936 after the Modern Library acquired the publishing firm Harrison Smith and Robert Haas, and Haas and Smith joined Cerf and Klopfer as partners.  

### Binding  

Balloon cloth binding D, with Kent’s torchbearer (1⅛ in.; 27 mm) stamped in gold on the front panel and stylized initials “ML” added in gold above the 2-line imprint on the spine.  

Balloon cloth bindings continued to be available in four colors: red, blue, green, and brown, with each title published simultaneously in all four bindings.  

### Endpaper  

Rockwell Kent endpapers in moderate orange (53). Moderate orange endpapers were used with all balloon cloth bindings from fall 1930 through spring 1939, except for three spring 1939 titles that were published in the larger format that the ML would adopt for all titles beginning that fall. An enlarged version of Kent’s endpaper was introduced in spring 1940. The central panels featuring Kent’s torchbearer were unchanged, but the surrounding patterns of open books and “ml” initials were extended to fill the larger space.  

### Jackets 

Eighteen of the 1932 titles were published in individually designed pictorial jackets. Four were published in uniform typographic jacket D and two in uniform typographic jacket F. Nearly all new titles published between 1932 and the introduction of the ML’s larger format in fall 1939 had pictorial jackets. Uniform typographic jacket D was used on newly published titles for the last time in spring 1932. The final examples of its use, *Poems of Longfellow* (235) and Franklin, *Autobiography and Selections from His Other Writings* (236), provoked an angry letter from Cerf, who had apparently given instructions that the jacket was no longer to be used for new titles.  

### Price  

95 cents.  

### Dating keys  

(Spring) Dreiser, *Sister Carrie* xDickens, *Pickwick Papers*; Giants through G5. (Fall) Dickens, *Pickwick Papers* xLewis, *Arrowsmith*; Giants through G7.  

### Titles sought, suggested, declined 

Cerf approached Arthur Pell at Liveright, Inc., about including a volume of plays by Eugene O’Neill in ML Giants (Cerf to Pell, 16 November 1932). Nothing came of this initiative. O’Neill became a Random House author the following year after the Liveright bankruptcy. O’Neill’s *Nine Plays* (G53), originally published by Liveright in 1932, was added to the Giants in 1941.  

After repeated attempts to get reprint rights to James Stephens’s *Crock of Gold* (Macmillan, 1912) Cerf enlisted the assistance of Hugh Eayrs, the president of the Macmillan Co. of Canada. Eayrs wrote to the president of the Macmillan Co. in New York urging him to allow a ML reprint (Eayrs to George Brett, Jr., 16 May 1932). Brett replied, “We are simply not going to give it to him . . . if we should want to do a cheap edition we would do it ourselves” (Brett to Eayrs, 24 May 1932).  

Cerf contacted Hermann Schaff for the rights to an edition of Synge plays, saying “If we can’t get this from you by peaceable means in the next two years, I will have to start negotiations with the Boston underworld to spirit you off somewhere and tickle your bare soles with lighted matches until you sign on the dotted line” (Cerf to Schaff, 16 November 1932). Cerf again contacted Doubleday for reprint rights to *Kim* (Cerf to Nelson Doubleday, 3 December 1932). Cerf was beginning to consider an anthology of Yiddish literature as early as January 1932.  

James Crowder, the ML’s sales representative for the Middle West, suggested Edmund Wilson’s *Axel’s Castle: A Study in the Imaginative Literature of 1870–1930*, which had been published by Charles Scribner’s Sons in 1931 (Crowder to Cerf, 4 June 1932). Cerf corresponded with Wilson about a ML edition in 1933. Wilson was interested and suggested adding several additional essays to the ML edition, which he proposed publishing under a new title such as *Literary Essays* or *Essays on Modern Authors*. He also asked for an advance of \$500 (Wilson to Cerf, 28 September 1933). In the end Wilson decided to incorporate the essays he had considered adding to *Axel’s Castle* into a new book (Wilson to Cerf, 6 November 1933).  

Dale Warren, the head of publicity at Houghton Mifflin Co., suggested a one-volume condensation of Proust, noting confidentially that the firm of Albert & Charles Boni, which then published the seven volumes comprising Proust’s *Remembrance of Things Past*, would welcome some ready cash (Warren to Cerf, 20 June 1932). Charles Boni had left in 1930, and the firm “was in major trouble” by the early 1930s (“Albert and Charles Boni” in *American Literary Publishing Houses, 1900–1980*, p. 57).  

The ML had already reprinted the first two volumes, *Swann’s Way* (1928) and *Within a Budding Grove* (1930), and would add *Guermantes Way* in 1933. Cerf thought that Warren’s suggestion was an excellent idea except from the point of view of the publisher of the complete set. He asked Warren to keep the idea under his hat and not even tell Ferris Greenslet, the manager of the Houghton Mifflin trade department. “We have had two conversations with Boni relative to buying the entire Proust property from him. In the event of a slow down, I think we might be able to get these books for our Random House list. In the event that anything happens along this line, I will let you know as promptly as possible. Something <u>must</u> break in this situation before the summer is very much advanced (Cerf to Warren, 21 June 1932; underlining in original). Five months later he indicated, “I have not given up hopes of buying the entire Proust property from Albert Boni. If anything develops along this line, be assured that I will get in touch with you immediately” (Cerf to Warren, 22 November 1932). Cerf was able to secure *Remembrance of Things Past* a year or so later. The Random House edition was published as a four-volume set in a wooden slipcase; Cerf described it as “one of the typographical masterpieces of 1934” (Cerf, *At Random*, p. 99).  

Warren never gave up his proposal for a one-volume condensation of Proust. When he repeated the idea in 1943, Cerf turned him down but added that he would give Houghton Mifflin rights to a condensed Proust if the firm would allow the ML to reprint Willa Cather’s *My Antonia*, which he had been trying to get for the series since 1925 (Cerf to Warren, 13 September 1943).

*Jacket B:* Uniform typographic jacket D with spelling of Dostoyevsky corrected.  

> Front flap:<br> In the whole literature of the subtle and mysterious relationship between man and the crimes he commits, *Crime and Punishment* stands supreme for its insight, its compassion and its psychological fidelity. The story of the murder committed by Raskolnikov, his punishment and atonement, is the most gripping and illuminating study ever written of a crime of repugnance and despair, and the consequences which arise inevitably from it. In Dostoyevsky’s mind, crime is its own punishment and retributive justice can never be as severe as the penalty the human soul can impose on itself. (*Spring 1935*)  

Garnett translation originally published in U.S. by the Macmillan Co., 1914. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published January 1932. *WR* 13 February 1932. First printing: Not ascertained. *Crime and Punishment* sold 16,923 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, making it the ML’s fifth best-selling title and the second best-selling title in the regular ML (*Of Human Bondage* was the best-selling title in the regular ML). It sold 10,943 copies during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, making it the fourth best-selling title in the regular ML. Sales through 1955 totaled 208,000 copies.

Originally published 1950 in MLCE and subsequently in the regular ML. The ML invited Harry Levin and then Lionel Trilling to write the introduction. Both declined on the grounds that the \$200 fee offered was inadequate (Erskine to Levin, 26 January 1950; Stein to Trilling, 3 February 1950; Trilling to Stein, 5 February 1950). At that point Stein telephoned Simmons, who had just accepted an invitation to write an introduction to *The Brothers Karamazov* for \$200, and he agreed to do *Crime and Punishment* instead.

> Front flap:<br> The reader who takes up this book for the first time has in store for him one of the rarest thrills that can be afforded by modern literature. The editors of the Modern Library unhesitatingly list it among the greatest novels of all time. That it ranks as one of the five best sellers in the entire series is a tribute to the taste of the American public. That the author is now in exile from his native land is a commentary on the Hitler regime that needs no amplification. (*Spring 1934*)  

Lowe-Porter translation originally published in U.S. in two volumes by Alfred A. Knopf, 1927. ML edition (pp. [*5*]–900) printed from Knopf plates with table of contents consolidated from vols. 1 and 2, fly title omitted, and page numeral “xi” removed from the foreword. Published January 1932. *WR* 13 February 1932. First printing: 17,000 copies. Discontinued spring 1938.  

Cerf approached Knopf about a ML edition of *The Magic Mountain* in 1929, when he offered a \$3,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy and indicated that he was willing to use the Plimpton Press rather than the ML’s regular printers so that the Knopf plates would not have to be moved (Cerf to Manley Aaron, Knopf, 19 November 1929). The reprint contract was not signed until May 1931. The agreement Cerf sent Knopf did not limit the ML’s rights to any period of time; Knopf inserted the standard clause granting reprint rights for a period of five years (Knopf, Inc. to Cerf, 14 May 1931). The terms of the final contract have not been ascertained, but the ML appears to have paid royalties of 12 cents a copy. The ML secured quotes from the Plimpton Press but in the end the ML edition was printed by Parkway Printing Co., the ML’s regular printers.  

Sales over the first five years totaled 48,004 copies as follows: 13,883 copies (1932); 7,871 copies (1933); 9,053 copies (1934); 9,902 copies (1935); 7,295 copies (1936) (Cerf to Kenneth Roberts, 23 November 1938).  

Knopf declined to renew the reprint contract for a second five-year term. Lewis Miller later explained, “Mr. Knopf has withdrawn THE MAGIC MOUNTAIN from us and plans to reissue it himself in what I imagine will be a \$3.00 edition. I believe Mr. Knopf feels that he can get more revenue for himself and for Mr. Mann in that way. We are sorry to have the book go, naturally” (Miller to Ellis Mount, Macmillan Co. of Canada, 18 May 1938). The final printing of the ML edition (10,000 copies in October 1936) was ordered after Knopf served notice that the reprint contract would not be renewed. Knopf appears to have allowed the ML a large final printing before giving up the title. Cerf expressed his appreciation: “Just a line to tell you again how much I appreciate your attitude in THE MAGIC MOUNTAIN matter. We are indebted to you for a lot of things. Some day maybe we will be able to square the account” (Cerf to Knopf, 26 October 1936). The ML edition was out of print by May 1938.  

Cerf never accepted the loss of *The Magic Mountain* and tried repeatedly to get it back. The following exchange of letters is typical. In 1942, after Mann’s *Buddenbrooks* (285) had also been withdrawn from the ML, Cerf offered a \$5,000 advance against royalties of 15 cents a copy “or to work out any other set of details that might satisfy you” for permission to publish *The Magic Mountain* as a Giant. He added, “Quite frankly, we get letters every week in the year demanding to know why this title is no longer in the series, and I’d rather have it back than any other book in print” (Cerf to Joseph C. Lesser, Knopf, 20 July 1942). Lesser replied that he wished he could say yes. “The title is just too good a back-list item for us to be willing to part with it on any arrangement whatsoever. As a trade publisher you must appreciate the necessity of our position” (Lesser to Cerf, 21 July 1942). Cerf replied: “I was afraid that your answer was going to be no on THE MAGIC MOUNTAIN.” He then asked if Knopf could be persuaded to allow *Buddenbrooks* into the Giants. “We really ought to have a Thomas Mann title somewhere along the line in a series that is supposed to represent the best in modern literature” (Cerf to Lesser, 22 July 1942).  

*The Magic Mountain* was included in MLCE in the 1960s after RH’s acquisition of Alfred A. Knopf, Inc. It was restored to the regular ML in 1992 as part of Random House’s “relaunch” of the series.

(*Spring 1932*) *Note:* To accommodate Dreiser’s plates the ML edition was ¼ inch taller than the ML’s standard format; later printings in the balloon cloth format were also ¼ inch wider. See the note directly below under 230a variant.  

> *Variant:* Wider format with binding measuring 6⅞ x 4⅝ in. (175 x 117 mm). Pagination and collation as 230a. Contents as 230a except p.

(*Fall 1939*) *Note:* The wider format may have been introduced well before 1939. The wider format allowed more generous inside and outer margins. It also meant that the endpapers extended beyond Kent’s endpaper design, leaving a white border of more than ⅛ inch at the fore-edge of the free endpapers.  

*Jacket:* Pictorial in moderate reddish purple (258) and black on cream paper depicting a woman’s head and shoulders in left profile; borders in moderate reddish purple, lettering in black. Signed C. (*Spring 1932*)  

> Front flap:<br> The story of the vicissitudes attendant upon the publisher’s suppression, in 1901, of *Sister Carrie* is the history of America’s emergence from the fog of suspicion and fear of realism in the novel. On the score of his uncompromising fight, Theodore Dreiser must be regarded a pioneer and liberator. His *Sister Carrie* pointed the tendency in American fiction for twenty-five years, and today it remains a monumental achievement, embodying all the sympathy, tenderness and unremitting naturalness for which its author has grown internationally famous. (*Fall 1933*)  

Originally published by Doubleday, Page & Co., 1900. Dreiser acquired the Doubleday, Page plates in 1906 and authorized printings by B. W. Dodge & Co., 1907; Grosset & Dunlap, 1908; Harper & Bros., 1912; and Boni & Liveright, 1917. ML edition (pp. [*1*]–557) printed from Dreiser’s plates. Published February 1932. *WR* 12 March 1932. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72.  

Dreiser’s account of the original publication of *Sister Carrie*, “The Early Adventures of Sister Carrie” (ML ed., pp. v–vii) indicates that it was rejected by Harper & Brothers before it was accepted by Doubleday, Page at the recommendation of the novelist Frank Norris, who was a reader for Doubleday. After the book was printed, Dreiser continues:  

> “Mrs. Frank Doubleday read the manuscript and was horrified by its frankness. She was a social worker and active in moral reform, and because of her strong dislike for the book and insistence that it be withdrawn from publication, Doubleday, Page decided not to put it in circulation. However, Frank Norris remained firm in his belief that the book should come before the American public, and persuaded me to insist on the publishers carrying out the contract. Their legal adviser—one Thomas McKee, who afterwards personally narrated to me his share in all this—was called in, and he advised the firm that it was legally obliged to go on with the publication, it having signed a contract to do so, but that this did not necessarily include *selling*; in short, the books, after publication, might be thrown in the cellar! I believe his advice was followed to the letter, because no copies were ever sold. But Frank Norris, as he himself told me, did manage to send out some copies to book reviewers, probably a hundred of them. (p. vi)  

Frank Doubleday, the senior partner, returned in July 1900 from a vacation and read *Sister Carrie* in typescript. Perhaps his wife read the novel as well, though this has never been firmly established. For whatever reason, Doubleday expressed a strong dislike for the narrative, calling it “immoral” and urging that his firm not publish it. Working through Page, he attempted to persuade Dreiser to withdraw the book, but Dreiser . . . stood firm and demanded publication. Doubleday sought legal advice and found that indeed he was committed to putting *Sister Carrie* into print, but that he was under no obligation to market it strongly (West, “The Composition and Publication of *Sister Carrie*”, Dreiser Web Source, University of Pennsylvania Library, 2000).  

Doubleday, Page printed 1,008 copies of *Sister Carrie* and left 450 unbound. Norris sent out 127 review copies. *Sister Carrie* sold 456 copies between its publication on 8 November 1900 and February 1902, and Dreiser received royalties of \$68.40 (Lehan, p. 1159). Dreiser indicates that the Doubleday, Page plates along with some bound and unbound copies of *Sister Carrie* were bought by the rare book dealer J. F. Taylor & Company (“The Early Adventures of Sister Carrie,” p. vi). Dreiser later purchased the plates and books from them. Subsequent reprints of *Sister Carrie*, including the Modern Library’s, were arranged with Dreiser.  

The ML negotiated its edition directly with Dreiser. Dreiser received a \$2,500 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy. He paid \$500 of the advance to Horace Liveright, Inc., probably for the use of the plates which had been licensed to Liveright. All of the royalties were credited to Dreiser’s account; Liveright received no further income from the ML edition (Dreiser Papers, Van Pelt Library, University of Pennsylvania. Dreiser to Horace Liveright, Inc., 27 October 1931). When a ML printing was required, Klopfer wrote to Dreiser asking him to give instructions for the plates to be delivered to the ML’s printers. After Dreiser’s death the ML acquired world rights on a non-exclusive basis (Dreiser Papers. E. E. Harper to Mrs. Theodore Dreiser, 1 April 1948).  

Dreiser’s foreword, “The Early Adventures of Sister Carrie,” was originally published in *The Colophon*, pt. 5 (1931). The “Publisher’s Note on the Modern Library Edition of ‘Sister Carrie’” (p.vii) states:  

> One of the very first books mentioned for inclusion in the Modern Library series was Sister Carrie. This was back in 1918. This book, as much as any written by an American, we felt, expressed the trend and spirit of the literature we wanted in our series. Mr. Dreiser, however, very reasonably kept one eye cocked on the royalty statements covering the two-fifty edition [the trade edition published by Boni & Liveright in 1917], and it was only in February, 1932, after more attempts than we care to think about, that we persuaded him to let us do the book. We are proud to have Sister Carrie on our list.  

*Sister Carrie* was not one of the ML’s best-selling titles in the 1930s. Sales reached 9,984 copies by the end of 1934 and 18,635 copies by the end of 1939, when Dreiser’s account showed an unearned balance of \$636.50 (Dreiser Papers. RH file). *Sister Carrie* sold 5,637 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it the second quarter of ML and Giant titles. During the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952 it sold 7,097 copies, placing it solidly in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles.

> The history of the vicissitudes attending upon the suppression, in 1901, of *Sister Carrie* is part of the history of America’s emergence from the then prevailing atmosphere of prudery and suspicion. Fear of realism in the novel prompted the campaign against writers who dared challenge the romantic tradition. On the score of his uncompromising fight against censorship and for the new and rising school of American naturalism, Theodore Dreiser earned the right to be regarded as a pioneer and liberator. His *Sister Carrie* was the forerunner of a tendency in American fiction for at least a quarter of a century and even today it remains a monumental achievement as a novel of great sympathy, tenderness and unremitting naturalness. For these qualities alone Theodore Dreiser became internationally famous. (*Spring 1954*)

*Jacket:* Pictorial in strong red (12) and black on brilliant yellow paper depicting Dracula in top hat, bat-like cape and cane; borders and title in strong red, other lettering in black; adapted from the Sun Dial Library jacket. (*Spring 1932*) *Note:* The 231a jacket is one of most ML’s most striking jackets of the balloon cloth era. The image of Dracula is from the Sun Dial Library jacket; the lettering and brilliant yellow background are original to the ML. Designer unknown.  

> Front flap: 
> Mention of any thriller immediately brings a comparison to *Dracula*, the model toward which writers of the macabre strive. As a novel it has provided chills and nightmares for countless readers; on the stage and as a cinema it has aroused terror in the hearts of vast audiences. The monstrous figure of Dracula, half human, half bat, the “human vampire,” is as original and forbidding a creature as the literature of horror has ever created. His sinister deeds grip you with an icy fear and hold you spellbound. (*Fall 1935*)  

Originally published in U.S. by Doubleday, McClure & Co., 1899. ML edition printed from Doubleday, Doran plates made from a new typesetting; the plates appear to have been made for the ML’s exclusive use. Published February 1932. *WR* 12 March 1932. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1990. *Dracula* was one of eleven Sun Dial Library titles added to the ML after Cerf and Klopfer bought the Doubleday series in 1930. *Dracula* had been the Sun Dial Library’s best-selling title with total sales of 10,953 copies to February 1930.  

The plates for *Dracula*, along with new plates for Maugham’s *Of Human Bondage* (199) and Bennett’s *Old Wives’ Tale* (207), were ready in July 1930 (Doubleday, Doran to Klopfer, 14 July 1930). The ML paid Doubleday, Doran royalties of 10 cents a copy. Klopfer suggested a reduction in the royalty rate after *Dracula* entered the public domain but indicated that the ML would agree to whatever Doubleday decided (Klopfer to Mina Turner, Doubleday, 17 April 1958). By 1965 the ML was paying royalties of 5 cents a copy.  

*Dracula* sold 5,052 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of ML and Giant titles. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.

Original ML collection. Publication announced for February 1932. *WR* 9 April 1932. First printing: Not ascertained. 

*The Stories of Anton Tchekov* superseded Chekhov’s *Rothschild’s Fiddle and Other Stories* (27) which had been in the ML since 1917. Cerf had discussed a revision of the earlier volume with Linscott and wrote him in 1930, “I have been awaiting some word from you in regard to the volume of Tchekov’s Short Stories. The more I think about this the more advisable it seems to scrap our entire volume and get out the best possible new collection that we can. If you want to undertake this task, you will be elected with due eclat” (Cerf to Linscott, 15 October 1930). Eight of the fourteen stories in *Rothschild’s Fiddle* were retained in Linscott’s collection. “Rothschild’s Fiddle” was added in later printings (232b).  

The ML used the spelling “Chekhov” from 1917 through 1929 and the spelling “Tchekov” from 1930 through spring 1956. Eva Le Gallienne’s use of “Tchekov” in the typescript of her preface to *The Plays of Anton Tchekov* (1930: 193) was probably responsible for the ML’s adoption of that spelling (RH box 89, Eva Le Gallienne file). The ML reverted to “Chekhov” in fall 1956 with the Stark Young translation of *Best Plays*.  

*The Stories of Anton Tchekov* sold 5,642 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles. It sold 3,429 copies during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, making it eighty-ninth of the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML.

Cerf contacted Faulkner in 1931 about including one of his books in the ML. Faulkner replied: “I would like to see one of my books in your Modern Library series, though I do not know what steps are necessary to take with the publisher. . . . I would like to see THE SOUND AND THE FURY, with for preface a pamphlet which Evelyn Scott wrote about the time the book was published, in your list [Scott’s 10-page pamphlet, *On William Faulkner’s The Sound and the Fury,* was published by Cape & Smith in 1929]. That would be my idea. However, I don’t think it will be a choice of title that will hold any agreement among the three of us up.” Cerf enclosed a ML catalogue and invited Faulkner to select a few volumes. He requested Joyce’s *Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man* and any titles by Dostoyevsky. “I have seen several reviews of my books in which a Dostoyefsky [*sic*] influence was found. I have never read Dostoyefsky, and so I would like to see the animal” (Faulkner to Cerf, 15 April 1931).  

Cerf and Klopfer wanted to include *The Sound and the Fury* or *As I Lay Dying*, but Cape & Smith had printed both novels from standing type which had since been melted. At this point in his career Faulkner’s audience remained small, and Cerf and Klopfer did not want to pay the cost of composition and plate making. Evelyn Harter, who worked in production and design at Cape & Smith, Smith & Haas, and Random House between 1929 and 1937, notes that it was not unusual at this period for books without an assured market to be printed from standing type. It was cheaper in the 1930s to pay the printer to hold type against the possibility of a reprint than to make electrotype plates. After a year or so if no reprint appeared likely, the printer would then be instructed to melt the type (Harter, *The Making of William Faulkner’s Books, 1929*–*1939*, pp. 7, 50–51). This practice made it more difficult for reprint publishers like the Modern Library to publish inexpensive reprint editions of contemporary works several years after their initial publication since they normally expected to print copyrighted books from the original publisher’s plates.  

Faulkner’s next book, *Sanctuary*, had more commercial appeal. It was the only Faulkner title published by Cape & Smith for which plates were made. It also became the first Faulkner title to appear in paperback. The American branch of Penguin Books—soon to become Signet Books—published it in April 1947. By August 1948 there had been eight printings the 25-cent paperback, accounting for more than 570,000 copies (Signet edition, 8th printing, August 1948; total copies indicated on front cover).  

In his introduction to the ML edition Faulkner acknowledges that he initially wrote *Sanctuary* for money. The introduction begins:  

> This book was written three years ago. To me it is a cheap idea, because it was deliberately conceived to make money. I had been writing books for about five years, which got published but not bought. . . . 
> Then I began to get a little soft. . . . I began to think of books in terms of possible money. I decided I might just as well make some of it myself. I took a little time out, and speculated what a person in Mississippi would believe to be current trends, chose what I thought was the right answer and invented the most horrific tale I could imagine and wrote it in about three weeks. . . . (233.1b‑c, pp. v–vi)  

After sending the manuscript to his publisher, Faulkner took a job working the overnight shift at a power plant. “On these nights, between 12 and 4, I wrote *As I Lay Dying* in six weeks, without changing a word. I sent it to Smith [his publisher] and wrote him that by it I would stand or fall.” He continues:  

>I think I had forgotten about *Sanctuary*, just as you might forget about anything made for an immediate purpose, which did not come off. *As I Lay Dying* was published and I didn’t remember the mss. of *Sanctuary* until Smith sent me the galleys. Then I saw that it was so terrible that there were but two things to do: tear it up or rewrite it. I thought again, “It might sell; maybe 10,000 of them will buy it.” So I tore the galleys down and rewrote the book. It had been already set up once, so I had to pay for the privilege of rewriting it, trying to make out of it something which would not shame *The Sound and the Fury* and *As I Lay Dying* too much and I made a fair job and I hope you will buy it and tell your friends and I hope they will buy it too. (233.1b–c, pp. vii–viii)  

Faulkner’s introduction in the first ML printing is in smaller type than the rest of the text. Shortly after publication Klopfer asked that it be reset in type uniform with the rest of the book (Klopfer to Van Rees Book Composition Co., 31 March 1932). In subsequent printings the introduction occupies four pages instead of two. Cerf did not like Burck’s jacket illustration but it was left unchanged until 1940, when E. McKnight Kauffer designed a new jacket for use with the ML’s larger format.  

Faulkner became a Random House author in 1936 when RH acquired Smith & Haas. *Sanctuary* remained his only title in the ML until 1946, when *The Sound and the Fury & As I Lay Dying* (394) were published together in a single volume.  

*Sanctuary* sold 4,939 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it the third quarter of ML and Giant titles. Faulkner’s audience increased significantly after he won the 1949 Nobel Prize in Literature. By spring 1951 Faulkner had four volumes in the series. All four were in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles in terms of sales during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952. *The Sound and the Fury & As I Lay Dying* was the fifth best-selling title in the regular ML, followed by *Light in August* (429), *Absalom, Absalom!* (434), and *Sanctuary* (233), which sold 4,844 copies, making it forty-fifth of the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML.

It is a virile, challenging novel that cannot be ignored or set aside. *Sanctuary* arouses the most extreme enthusiasm or revulsion; it holds spellbound its most ardent admirers and bitterest foes from first sentence to last.

When Mr. Faulkner saw the galley proofs of that version of *Sanctuary*, he felt “that there were but two things to do: tear it up or rewrite it.” 
> He chose the latter course and did a thorough revision of the book, cutting some sections entirely and adding new ones, rewriting other sections in whole or in part, and rearranging the order of the narration. He thus succeeded in making it a book which “would not shame . . . too much,” as he put it, *The Sound and the Fury* and *As I Lay Dying*, which had been published in the two preceding years. (*Inside of jacket blank; back flap lists Faulkner titles published in the ML through fall 1964.*)  

The letterpress plate for the 233.1c title page appears to have been used for 233.1d with the line for Faulkner’s introduction and the rule at the foot of the page removed and torchbearer H substituted for torchbearer D3.  

The memorandum issuing the instruction to drop the introductions from *Sanctuary* and *Absalom, Absalom!* was dated 14 November 1962 (Box 538, ML spring 1962 folder). The introduction to Faulkner’s *Light in August* was also dropped around this time. The earliest printing of *Sanctuary* without the introduction was in 1963 or 1964. Introductions appear to have been dropped when Faulkner titles in the ML began to appear in uniform non-pictorial jackets on coated white paper. The earliest use of the uniform Faulkner jacket was for *Light in August* in spring 1963. By 1967 the regular ML included ten Faulkner titles in white uniform jackets. Four, including *Sanctuary*, were existing ML titles that were outfitted in new jackets. Four titles—*Selected Short Stories*, *Intruder in the Dust*, *A Fable*, and *Pylon*—were new to the series. *The Sound and the Fury* and *As I Lay Dying*, had previously been combined in a single ML volume.

The first Modern Library edition of *Sanctuary* appeared in the following year (1932), printed from the original plates, as all subsequent editions have been. These plates, because of the conditions surrounding their production, had a larger than usual number of typographical errors, most of them immediately recognizable as such. Some were discovered and corrected from time to time, but many remained. A great effort has been made in this new edition, which was entirely reset, to produce, with the co-operation of the author, the definitive text.

> Front flap:<br> *Tess of the D’Urbervilles* has earned a prominent place on the shelf of the world’s greatest novels. Time does not lessen its appeal. The years since its publication have witnessed a constantly renewing enthusiasm for this heroic story of a woman victimized by an implacable fate. The fate of the novel itself is the highest tribute to its quality.

*Tess of the D’Urbervilles* sold 7,699 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it low in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles. Hardy’s *Return of the Native* (126) outsold *Tess of the D’Urbervilles* by about 30 copies. *The Mayor of Casterbridge* (17) and *Jude the Obscure* (145) ranked in the fourth quarter of ML titles. *The Return of the Native* remained the ML’s best-selling Hardy title during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, ranking low in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles. *Tess of the D’Urbervilles* and the other two Hardy titles were not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular series during that period.

> Front flap:<br> Implacable fate plays a major role in the novels of Thomas Hardy. In *Tess of the D’Urbervilles* it wreaks havoc in the life of its heroine and makes her the victim of forces beyond her control. Her story, grim and unrelieved in its pathos, is told in the manner of heroic tragedy. The fate of the novel itself is, in a sense, a measure of its quality and the strong feelings it aroused. When it was first published, *Tess of the D’Urbervilles* was shunned and proclaimed immoral. Now it is acknowledged as one of the notable literary achievements of the last decade of the nineteenth century. (*Fall 1956*)  

Bibliographical edition originally published by Harper & Brothers, 1920. ML edition (pp. xxv–[xxxiv], [1] – [508]) printed from offset plates photographically reduced from the 1920 Harper edition with running heads omitted, preliminaries repaginated, and the map of Hardy’s Wessex redrawn.

When plans were made to publish *Tess of the D’Urbervilles* in MLCE, Stein offered Weber \$150 to write the introduction (Stein to Weber, 30 June 1950). Weber accepted but added:  

> I assume that you will take care to get the correct definitive TEXT of this novel, and will avoid using the far-from-definitive edition first issued by the Modern Library. . . . NO EDITION OF TESS PUBLISHED BEFORE 1912 will provide you with a satisfactory text, and many an edition issued since 1912 still perpetuates the omissions of earlier editions. Macmillan’s London edition of 1912, and Harper’s “Anniversary Edition” issued in New York in 1920–21, or more recent reprints of either of these, are the only satisfactory sources of text for your projected edition. If you have any doubt about what’s what, please give me a chance to examine and comment on whatever you are going to use. I shall have occasion, in my introduction, to speak of Hardy’s revisions, and you will of course want your edition to be a definitive job (Weber to Stein, 3 July 1950).  

Stein checked with Harper’s about using the plates of their 1920 edition. Harper’s was agreeable provided the ML printed at Kingsport, Tennessee, where the plates were stored, and agreed to a plate royalty of 2 cents a copy. However, the Harper plates were too large for the ML format, and the ML in any case preferred to use their regular printer. The ML proposed to prepare its own plates photographically from the Harper plates (Stein memorandum to Emanuel Harper, 8 September 1950). The map was included at Weber’s suggestion.

Longfellow was the most commercially successful American poet of his time. There were only three years between 1845 and 1851 when Longfellow’s income from poetry did not exceed—sometimes substantially—his salary as the Smith Professor of Modern Languages at Harvard. He resigned from Harvard in 1854, and from 1875 until his death he received \$4,000 a year from his older books alone—more than twice what he had earned as a professor (Charvat, p. 113). His poetry remained sufficiently lucrative in the twentieth century for Houghton Mifflin Co., the ultimate successor of Longfellow’s original Boston publisher, Ticknor and Fields, to be concerned when the Modern Library announced its edition of Longfellow. Cerf received a letter from Robert Linscott at Houghton Mifflin:  

> A slight tremor of agitation swept over this office yesterday when we first noticed your announcement . . . [Longfellow is the] Poet of Poets most closely associated with Houghton Mifflin Company. Suckled at our even then venerable bosom, he was for years our mainstay, and office boys learned to lisp the leisured cadences of “Evangeline.”  

Linscott indicated that he presumed the ML would be using only works for which the copyright had expired, and he asked whether any courtesy acknowledgment would be made (Linscott to Cerf, 15 January 1932).  

The ML initially intended to base its edition on *The Poems of Henry W. Longfellow*, published in 1901 by the A. L. Burt Co. in its Home Library series. Linscott wrote again four days later:  

> You’re a trusting soul to take the Burt Home Library “Longfellow” which contains only the poems which apparently were out of copyright before 1900. In other words, out of seven and a half pages of contents as given in the Complete Cambridge Edition, only approximately two and a half are included in the Burt Longfellow (Linscott to Cerf, 19 January 1932).  

Linscott promised to send a copy of the Houghton Mifflin’s Complete Cambridge Edition with the copyrighted material marked.  

At this point Ferris Greenslet, the general manager of the Houghton Mifflin trade department, whom Tebbel has described as “the dominant figure at Houghton Mifflin in the thirties” (vol. 3, p. 537), intervened. He wrote Cerf:  

> I am rather embarrassed to know just what to say about it [the Longfellow matter]. As we still have a fair amount of the Longfellow material in copyright and therefore the only complete editions of that poet’s writings, we have always been rather tender on the topic and have asked our publishing colleagues with whom we have reciprocal relations to lay off Longfellow, and where they have done so, have tried to give them preferential treatment in copyright matters. 
> Are you really hell-bent to put Longfellow now into the Modern Library cheek-for-jowl with Oscar Wilde, Anatole France, *et cetera*, or can you wait until towards the end of the present bad decade when I believe the last copyright expires? (Greenslet to Cerf, 1 February 1932)  

Both Cerf and Klopfer appealed to Linscott to send the list of Longfellow material that had gone out of copyright since 1901 (Cerf to Linscott, 29 January 1932; Klopfer to Linscott, 30 January 1932). Linscott responded, “The Longfellow problem is a little murky as you may have gathered from Mr. Greenslet’s letter. . . . Under the circumstances, I’m afraid I shan’t be able to help you out—at least at present” (Linscott to Klopfer, 2 February 1932).  

In the end the ML appears to have secured reliable information about the copyright status of Longfellow’s poems. The ML was able to include nearly all of Longfellow’s best-known works.  

When the ML Longfellow was published Cerf sent a copy to Greenslet, who acknowledged, “It is, of course, innocent of any copyright evil. Best wishes for its success!” (Greenslet to Cerf, 28 April 1932). The ML edition of Longfellow remained in print through the 1970s. There was a new typesetting in 1944, but no attempt was made to add material that had entered the public domain since 1932.  

*The Poems of Longfellow* and *The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin* (236) were the last new ML titles to appear in uniform typographic jacket D. Most new ML titles were being published in pictorial jackets by 1932, and Cerf reacted angrily when he saw the Longfellow and Franklin jackets. The Franklin jacket was replaced almost immediately by a pictorial jacket. The uniform typographic jacket for *The Poems of Longfellow* remained in use until the early 1940s.  

Cerf complained about poor sales of the Longfellow volume in the 1930s, but it appears to have increased in popularity in the 1940s. *The Poems of Longfellow* sold 8,504 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it low in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles. Many of these sales were probably to people serving in the armed services. Sales declined to 4,528 copies during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, but that was still enough for it to hold on to its first-quarter ranking.

> Front flap:<br> The wide range of Benjamin Franklin’s interests and activities opened the doors of the world to him. Printer, inventor, philosopher, diplomat, champion of liberty, he made his influence felt not only upon his own time, but upon every American generation. His wise maxims and shrewd observations have become national axioms. His *Autobiography*, as rich in material as it is engaging in style, is one of those rare documents that reveals both a rich personality and the crucial events that transpired during his lifetime. (*Spring 1938*)  

Original ML collection. Published April 1932. *WR* 7 May 1932. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72.  

Cerf originally planned to publish Franklin’s *Autobiography* by itself. Three months before publication he decided to add more of Franklin’s writings so the book would be a better value. Goodman, who suggested the additional contents, received \$100 for his work on the volume.  

*The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin* and *The Poems of Longfellow* (235) were the last new ML titles to appear in uniform typographic jacket D. Most new ML titles were being published in pictorial jackets by 1932, and Cerf reacted angrily when he saw the Franklin and Longfellow jackets. He wrote the ML’s printer, “Please note that from this day forth, I don’t want any Modern Library jacket to go to press unless it has been personally O.K.’d by me. The O.K. must be for both the typography of the jacket, and the stock used for the jacket. I think that the jackets for Longfellow and Franklin are rotten” (Cerf to William Simon, Parkway Printing, 22 April 1932).  

The Franklin jacket was replaced almost immediately by a newly designed pictorial jacket (jacket B, described above). Copies of the first printing are found in both jackets. The pictorial jacket, which remained in use through the end of the 1930s, was one of the least attractive jackets the ML ever used.  

*The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin* sold 5,569 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it low in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles. It sold 3,468 copies during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952—a decline in real terms compared with the Second World War, when book sales of all kinds were booming, but enough to place it high in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles.

> Front flap:<br> The simplicity and clarity of Ernest Hemingway’s profoundly moving romance, *A Farewell to Arms*, have won acclaim from the critics, support from the public, and that final wreath – a host of imitators. Critics have spared no adjectives in praise of his sure-footed, athletic prose; readers have found enchantment in this poignant love story, and writers generally have drawn sustenance from Hemingway’s strength. *A Farewell to Arms* is an exciting book, true to its time and true to the convictions and vigor of its author. (*Fall 1934*)  

Originally published by Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1929. ML edition (pp. [v–vii], [1]–355) printed from Scribner plates with Scribner half title used as a fly title. Published May 1932. *WR* 28 May 1932. First printing: 7,000 copies. Discontinued spring 1953.  

The ML offered Scribner’s a \$6,000 advance against royalties of 12 cents a copy, the same terms as for Hemingway’s *Sun Also Rises* (190). Cerf initially hoped to publish *A Farewell to Arms* in September 1931 (Cerf to Maxwell Perkins, Scribner’s, 4 December 1930). The ML edition may have been delayed so that it would not conflict with the August 1931 publication of Grosset & Dunlap’s one-dollar edition. Cerf cabled Ford in Paris to ask him to write the introduction, offering \$75 and indicating that it was needed by 15 March (Cerf to Ford, 14 January 1932).  

There were printings in 1933 of 4,000 copies (January) and 3,000 copies (July), at least nine additional printings of 2,000 copies each by March 1941, and four printings between June 1941 and December 1942 totaling 14,000 copies. Sales during the first five years were as follows: 4,111 copies; 6,020 copies; 2,656 copies; 2,585 copies; and 2,632 copies (Cerf to Kenneth Roberts, 23 November 1938). *A Farewell to Arms* sold 12,287 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it sixteenth out of 271 ML and Giant titles and well ahead of *The Sun Also Rises*. It sold 7,766 copies during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, making it fourteenth out of the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML.  

Scribner’s decided in the early 1950s to promote its backlist more vigorously and terminated the ML’s reprint contracts for all three of the Hemingway titles in the series (Whitney Darrow, Scribner’s, to Cerf, 29 October 1952). A few months later the ML reported that *A Farewell to Arms* was completely out of stock (ML to Charles Burgess, Jr., Scribner’s, 16 February 1953). Scribner’s published a \$3.00 hardbound edition in March 1953 and a \$1.65 paperback in 1962.

> Front flap:<br> The devotees of the novels of Joseph Conrad divide their enthusiasm equally between *Victory* and *Lord Jim* (No. 186 in the Modern Library). Written in 1914, just before the outbreak of the World War, *Victory* has steadily grown in prestige through almost a quarter of a century. New readers come upon it as a rare discovery and old readers return to it for the sheer enjoyment of its prose style and subtle characterization. *Victory* represents Joseph Conrad at the apex of his story-telling powers. (*Fall 1936*)  

Originally published in U.S. by Doubleday, Page & Co., 1915. ML edition printed from plates made from a new Doubleday, Doran typesetting; the plates appear to have been used exclusively by the ML. Published June 1932. *WR* 2 July 1932. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72.  

Cerf tried on several occasions to secure reprint rights to *Victory*. In 1928 he offered an advance of \$3,600 against a 12-cent royalty—a royalty that the ML was then paying for only one other title (Cerf to Nelson Doubleday, 12 December 1928). Doubleday replied, “We do appreciate the high standing of the Modern Library, but we believe it is unwise to let the Conrad title go” (Nelson Doubleday to Cerf, 21 December 1928). *Victory* was included in the Sun Dial Library published by Garden City Publishing Co., the Doubleday, Doran subsidiary that specialized in hardcover reprints. The ML’s purchase of the Sun Dial Library in 1930 gave the ML reprint rights to any Doubleday title included in the series. *Victory* was the seventh of eleven Sun Dial Library titles that the ML added. The ML paid Doubleday, Doran a \$1,500 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy.  

*Victory* sold 7,335 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it low in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles. *Lord Jim* (210) sold 9,450 copies during the same period. Sales of *Victory* totaled 70,000 copies by 1949. By the early 1950s Conrad was one of the ML’s best-selling authors. *Victory* sold 7,966 copies during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, making it the twelfth best-selling title in the regular ML. *Lord Jim* was the eighth best-selling title.

> Front flap:<br> A band of pirates captures a vessel bound for England that contains a miscellaneous cargo—including a group of children who have been driven from their home by a West Indian hurricane. The difficulties encountered by the well-meaning buccaneers with these incredible children provide the frame-work for one of the most unusual books in the Modern Library series—a shocking, nerve-tingling story that the reader will never forget. (*Spring 1937*)  

Originally published in U.S. as *The Innocent Voyage* by Harper & Bros., 1929. ML edition (pp. 1–399) printed from Harper plates. Published July 1932. *WR* 2 July 1932. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1958.  

The ML paid Harper’s royalties of 10 cents a copy. Cerf had indicated interest in a ML edition the year the novel was published. Noting his personal enthusiasm for the book, he declared: “I think that I myself have bought over 50 copies of it” (Cerf to Henry Hoyns, Harper & Bros., 5 August 1929). Hoyns assured him that Harper’s would be glad to talk about a ML edition at the proper time (Hoyns to Cerf, 10 September 1929). Two years later, when Cerf sent Harper’s the reprint contract, he stated: “I don’t believe that this book will break any sales records in the Modern Library, but I am glad to have it for its prestige value and I have hopes that we may be able to enhance the popularity of the author’s other books” (Cerf to Hoyns, 5 December 1931). When the reprint contract was renewed in 1937, Klopfer commented, “Bennett and I have a warm spot in our hearts for this book and we want to keep it in the Modern Library, and will do a special promotion job when the movie is released” (Klopfer to Hoyns, 1 February 1937).  

When the reprint contract was up for renewal in 1942, Hoyns informed Klopfer that Harper’s were about to about to sign a contract with the Readers Club for a reprint edition and that George Macy, the club’s president, wanted the ML edition withdrawn while his edition was available (Hoyns to Klopfer, 3 March 1942). Klopfer spoke with Macy and convinced him that the ML edition would not interfere with the mail order sales of the Readers Club. He then told Hoyns that the ML would like to renew the contract for another five years, giving Harper’s the option to cancel if Macy insisted on exclusive reprint rights (Klopfer to Hoyns, 5 March 1942). He later noted that a small unearned royalty remained from the \$750 advance the ML paid when the contract was renewed in 1937. He suggested keeping the book in the ML at the same royalty but without an advance; if Harper’s wanted an advance, he indicated that the ML could pay \$250 but didn’t want to go higher in case the Readers Club edition hurt sales (Klopfer to Hoyns, 10 April 1942).  

In 1956 the College Department of Harper & Bros. expressed interest in adding *A High Wind in Jamaica* and Richard Wright’s *Native Son* (349) to the Harper Modern Classics series. William H. Rose, Jr., the Harper director of sales and promotion, asked Klopfer about their status in the ML, noting that Harper Modern Classics carried a short discount and had textbook distribution only (Rose to Klopfer, 20 July 1956). Klopfer replied that neither title was strong enough to withstand competition from an inexpensive Harper edition. “As long as your college department wants NATIVE SON and HIGH WIND IN JAMAICA, we’ll let them run out of the Modern Library as soon as our present stocks are exhausted” (Klopfer to Rose, 25 July 1956).  

*A High Wind in Jamaica* sold 4,551 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of ML and Giant titles. It did not rank among the one-hundred best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.

Separately and in their entirety they exemplify the spirit of the Elizabethan period, the richest in our literature, by their virility, daring and exuberant outspokenness. A compilation which includes Marlowe, Dekker, Heywood, Jonson, Beaumont and Fletcher, Webster, Massinger and Ford must be a treasury to be cherished by every modern reader. It is a book that has won for itself a distinguished place on the Modern Library shelf. (*Fall 1934*)  

Original ML anthology. Published August 1932. *WR* 10 September 1932. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1969.  

The plays in the anthology were selected by Cerf. He asked George C. D. Odell of Columbia University what he thought of the selection and invited him to write the introduction (Cerf to Odell, 9 April 1931). Odell approved the plays but declined to write the introduction because he was on sabbatical in Paris. That fall Cerf invited a succession of scholars to write the introduction—Hardin Craig of Stanford University, Felix E. Schelling of the University of Pennsylvania, J. F. A. Pyre of the University of Wisconsin, and John Livingston Lowes of Harvard University. As one after another declined, Cerf doubled the fee from fifty to one hundred dollars. Esther Cloudman Dunn of Smith College accepted the assignment in February 1932 and received the \$100 fee.  

*Eight Famous Elizabethan Plays* sold 2,678 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the fourth quarter of ML and Giant titles. It did not rank among the one hundred best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952. The ML sold over 70,000 copies of *Eight Famous Elizabethan Plays* by 1969 when *Drama of the English Renaissance*, edited by M. L. Wine (615), was published in the ML with the intent of superseding the earlier anthology.

> Front flap:<br> Alive with light-tipped quips and stinging darts, *The Plays of Oscar Wilde* represent in fullest measure the famous decadent’s unique contribution to English letters. Master of the scintillant epigram and electric repartee, he is nowhere so happy and felicitous as in his dramatic writings. In time his prose may grow faint in memory and his poetry may be given a somewhat less lustrous appraisal, but he will always be remembered as the creator of these inimitably urbane, ironic and effervescent comedies.

> Front flap:<br> “I have nothing to declare except my genius,” Oscar Wilde once told an American customs official. That genius is nowhere more apparent than in his plays, whose witty dialogue and paradoxical situations still have the power to charm, both on the stage and between covers. This volume contains one of his most perennially popular, *The Importance of Being Earnest*, whose satiric comments on English society and the clergy have never been surpassed; *Salomé*, considered shocking in its day, on which Richard Strauss’ opera is based; and three plays, *Lady Windemere’s* [*sic*] *Fan*, *a Woman of No Importance* and *An Ideal Husband*, which give full play to Wilde’s scorn for hypocrisy.

The dream quality of the fairy tales and the burning conviction of the poems set them apart from the other scintillating but artificial writings of Oscar Wilde.

> Front flap:<br> The world owes to the unchallenged master of the short story, Guy de Maupassant, an immense and increasing debt for having provided a transcript of life as dynamic as it is real and as true as it is fascinating. The forty tales in this volume represent him in the fullness of his powers, when his vision, style and artistry were at their apex. These stories were chosen and translated by Michael Monahan, whose introduction is a bold commentary and an acute analysis of Maupassant’s work. (*Fall 1935*)  

Original ML collection combining two ML volumes originally published by Boni & Liveright: *Love and Other Stories* (72) and *Mademoiselle Fifi and Twelve Other Stories* (8). Pp. [iii], i–xi, [*1*], 1–212 printed from plates of *Love and Other Stories*; pp. 7–251 printed from plates of *Mademoiselle Fifi and Other Stories*. Published spring 1932. *WR* 15 October 1932. First printing: Not ascertained. Superseded 1945 by *The Best Stories of Guy de Maupassant*, ed. Saxe Commins (383).  

Despite the statement on the title page Monahan does not appear to be the translator of all the stories in the collection. He was credited as the translator of *Love and Other Stories* (1919); the ML edition of *Mademoiselle Fifi and Twelve Other Stories* (1917) did not identify the translator. One story appears twice in the combined volume in different translations. “A Piece of String” (pp. 213–22) was added to *Love and Other Stories* by 1930. It was also included (in a different translation) as “The Piece of String” (pp. 23–31) in *Mademoiselle Fifi and Twelve Other Stories*.  

Maupassant’s *Best Stories* sold 6,269 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.

> Front flap:<br> The perpetual enchantment and all the magical and multi-colored pageantry of *The Arabian Nights* are offered here in Sir Richard Burton’s rendering for the delectation of adult minds. Shahrazad spins her tales without censorial interruption, and the spell that possessed King Shahryar and since then has possessed mankind is not broken, praise be to Allah, by discreet asterisks and decorous euphemisms. The tales in this volume were chosen because they are the most fascinating and representative of *The Book of a Thousand Nights and a Night*. (*Fall 1937*)  

Original ML selection. Published September 1932. *WR* 15 October 1932. First printing: Not ascertained.  

The title page of *The Arabian Nights’ Entertainments* had so much text that there was no room for the torchbearer or for Cerf and Klopfer’s names in the imprint.  

Cerf selected the stories included in the ML edition. The statement on the title page that the stories were “complete and unabridged” was not strictly true. Cerf explained his editorial approach and interpretation of “unabridged” as follows: “As far as the stories being complete and unabridged is concerned, the only thing that was left out of any of the stories included was long stretches of poetry, and a very occasional phrase that was of no importance whatever to the story. In every sense I believe it thoroughly fair to say that the stories are quite unabridged” (Cerf to Herman Schaff, John W. Luce & Co., 16 November 1932). The ML made three sets of plates, two of which were sold for \$950 each to Walter J. Black and Blue Ribbon Books. Black had first rights to the book for mail-order purposes. The ML followed with its edition in September 1932, and Blue Ribbon Books brought out an illustrated edition in November (Cerf to Walter J. Black, 13 January 1932). Grosset & Dunlap borrowed the ML’s plates in 1937 to print a motion picture edition, paying the ML a \$1,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy (Cerf to Edward Edelson, Grosset & Dunlap, 28 May 1937).  

*The Arabian Nights* sold 7,578 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it low in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling ML titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.

> Front flap:<br> *Yama the Pit* is as sinister and pitiless as the vice it exposes and condemns. It omits nothing and condones nothing of the abominations of the oldest profession in the world. The stark picture of a brothel and the prostitute’s way of life becomes by the artistry of Alexandre Kuprin an indictment more scathing and effective than all the moral indignation of vice crusaders and the periodical revelations of the police. *Yama* carries horror to a point beyond horror and into the realm of great realistic literature. (*Spring 1938*)  

Guerney translation originally published (“privately printed”) for subscribers only, 1922. New edition published by Bernard Guilbert Guerney, 1929, with additions, revisions, and corrections by the author, a foreword by Arthur Garfield Hays, and an author’s postscript. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting based on the 1929 edition. Publication scheduled for October 1932 but moved forward to September when Marx’s *Capital, The Communist Manifesto and Other Writings* (246) was postponed. *WR* 15 October 1932. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall 1952.  

Guerney’s introduction to the 1929 edition was revised for the ML.  

The ML paid Guerney a \$2,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy. The contract specified that royalties were to drop to 9½ cents after the first 20,000 copies. Cerf originally offered Guerney royalties of 9½ cents on all copies but increased the offer following negotiations with Guerney. The \$800 cost of making new plates was split between Guerney and the ML. Guerney’s half was to be charged against royalties after sales passed 20,000 copies, and the plates were to remain the property of the ML (Cerf to Guerney, 17 February 1931).  

*Yama* sold 2,700 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the fourth quarter of ML and Giant titles.

> Front flap:<br> With one-sixth of the habitable world governed by Marxian doctrines and with the rest of the world facing the possibility of a Communist social order, the writings of Karl Marx become more a modern revelation and prophecy than a mere economic interpretation of history. His *Capital and Other Writings*, judiciously and discriminatingly edited by Max Eastman, is the contemporary Bible of a newly emerged society, and as such it has an eminent place on the shelf of the Modern Library. (*Fall 1935*)  

Original ML collection. The abridgment of the three volumes of *Capital* and Borchardt’s essay, “The Theory of Crises” (pp. 13–314) are a reprint of *The People’s Marx: Abridged Popular Edition of the Three Volumes of “Capital,”* edited by Julian Borchardt and translated by Stephen L. Trask (London: International Bookshops, 1921). Publication of the ML edition originally scheduled for September 1932 but postponed until October because of additions to the manuscript. *WR* 12 November 1932. First printing: Not ascertained.  

*The People’s Marx* does not appear to have been copyrighted in the U.S. The ML reprinted it with the permission of the translator, Stephen L. Trask. Eastman notes, “This book itself has almost become a classic, and it seems to me a better way to get acquainted with Marx’s economic theories than merely to read through the first volume and stop, as is usually done” (p. xix). The selections from *The German Ideology* and *Critique of Political Economy* in Part II were added by the ML.  

Cerf was responsible for the inclusion of the essay by Lenin which was prominently noted on the title page and dust jacket. At the time he was compiling the volume Eastman referred to it as “that rather heavy encyclopedia-article of Lenin’s” and wanted to omit it so that more of Marx’s own writings could be included (Eastman to Cerf, 6 May 1932). Cerf responded, “I do want to leave in the Lenin article . . . since his name may add materially to the sale of the volume.” He indicated that he would cut it only if Eastman insisted (Cerf to Eastman, 9 May 1932). The Lenin essay that was included, “The Three Sources and Three Constituent Parts of Marxism,” may have been different from the one originally projected. Eastman states in the volume: “I have translated an introduction to Marxism written by Lenin in 1913 and published in a Russian magazine called *Education*. To this very orthodox statement by Lenin it might be well—in view of my own proposals—to add another remark made by him: ‘In no sense do we regard the Marxist theory as something complete and unassailable. On the contrary, we are convinced that this theory is only the corner-stone of that science which socialists must advance in all directions if they do not wish to fall behind life” (p. xix).  

Shortly after the publication of *Capital, The Communist Manifesto, and Other Writings*, Klopfer invited Eastman to translate a volume of Lenin’s writings for the ML. Eastman signed a contract to translate and edit the book, but other work got in the way and the contract was cancelled eighteen months later. See “Titles Sought, Suggested, Declined” under 1933 for more information.  

M. Lincoln Schuster of Simon and Schuster wrote to Cerf about the lack of an index to *Capital, The Communist Manifesto, and Other Writings*: “I think it is an outrage to publish DAS KAPITAL by Karl Marx without an index. On what page, for example, is the letter of instruction which Karl Marx wrote from London in 1850 to the Communist League? Remember your obligation to scholarship, Bennett: you’re publishing Karl not Groucho” (Schuster to Cerf, 7 February 1933). Klopfer replied that Schuster should blame Eastman, who never suggested an index (Klopfer to Schuster, 8 February 1933).  

Sales figures from the 1930s are not available. *Capital, The Communist Manifesto and Other Writings* sold 4,391 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of ML and Giant titles. It rose to the first quarter of ML and Giant titles during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952 with sales of 4,530 copies. In 1954 Eastman noted that *Capital, The Communist Manifesto and Other Writings* had sold nearly 4,000 copies in the past six months (Eastman to Cerf, 19 August 1954).  

The ML published an unabridged edition of the first volume of Marx’s *Capital* (G24) in the Giants series in 1936. The Giant sold 8,854 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943 and 4,333 copies during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, placing it in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles at both periods.

He stated, “I expect the book to be one of the most popular in our series year in and year out” (Cerf to Laurence Stallings, c/o The New York Sun, 24 October 1932). It sold 7,325 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it at the top of the second quarter of ML and Giant titles. During the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952 it sold 3,299 copies, making it one-hundredth out of the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML.

*Jacket:* Pictorial in brownish orange (54) and black on pale orange yellow (73) paper depicting three soldiers learning against a ship’s rail with black sea in background; borders in brownish orange, lettering in black. Signed: W.C. (*Fall 1932*)  

> Front flap:<br> The years that have passed since the World War have been severe to the literature of that disastrous episode in human history. Only a few books have survived. Of these, *Three Soldiers* stands pre-eminent. It reveals the cant and manufactured romanticism of war. Through the experiences of three men of the ranks, humanity’s most ghastly venture in mutual destruction stands condemned as criminal and futile. *Three Soldiers* introduced a writer who has since become a major figure among American novelists. Upon this first book his reputation rests securely. (*Spring 1935*)  

Originally published by George H. Doran Co., 1921. ML edition printed from Doubleday, Doran plates made from a new typesetting; the new plates appear to have been used exclusively by the ML. Publication scheduled for November 1932. *WR* 17 December 1932. First printing: 6,000 copies. Discontinued 1963.  

Eight months before the ML edition was published Cerf wrote Doubleday, Doran, “We think that we ought to have a Dos Passos book in the Modern Library, and we can’t make up our minds between the 42nd Parallel and Three Soldiers.” He asked how many copies *Three Soldiers* had sold in the trade edition and the subsequent reprint in Doubleday’s Sun Dial Library (Cerf to Robert de Graff, 9 April 1932). When he discovered that the plates for *Three Soldiers* were too large for the ML’s format he contacted Harper & Brothers about the comparative sales of Dos Passos’s *Manhattan Transfer* and *The 42nd Parallel*. *Manhattan Transfer* had sold 25,000 copies in contrast to 12,000 for *The 42nd Parallel* (Henry Hoyns, Harper & Bros., to Cerf, 12 April 1932), but the plates of those titles were also too large for the ML. In the end Cerf decided to begin with *Three Soldiers* and added *The 42nd Parallel* (307) to the ML five years later. Since new typesettings were required for both titles, Dos Passos was able to revise the texts for the ML editions.  

For *Three Soldiers* the ML paid Doubleday, Doran an advance of \$1,250 against royalties of 10 cents a copy. When Dos Passos submitted his corrections and revisions for the ML edition he told Cerf, “Let me know if I made more corrections in the *Three Soldiers* text than you can handle—I didn’t know if it was going to be reset or if the plates were just going to be photographed down. The text is in awful shape as I was away when it was published and didn’t correct any proofs.” He also asked Cerf to limit changes in his introduction to the ML edition to spelling corrections and to leave word arrangement and punctuation as they were. The introduction, he noted, “turned out a very long job, but while I was doing it I thought I’d better give ’em the works” (Dos Passos to Cerf, undated).  

*Three Soldiers* sold 4,102 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of ML and Giant titles. When Houghton Mifflin acquired the publishing rights from Doubleday in 1946, Klopfer noted that sales had averaged about 2,500 copies a year (Klopfer to Lovell Thompson, Houghton Mifflin Co., 20 August 1946). *Three Soldiers* did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.  

Houghton Mifflin withdrew *Three Soldiers* and Dos Passos’s *U.S.A.* (G42) from the ML in June 1961 when the firm launched its quality paperback series, Sentry Editions. Klopfer signed the termination agreement in June and instructed the production department to make no more printings of either title (Klopfer to “Gorgeous Redhead,” 14 June 1961). Houghton Mifflin allowed the ML to sell off its existing stock and asked how long it would take, explaining that they did not want to bring out *Three Soldiers* until the ML stock was exhausted (Hardwick Moseley, Houghton Mifflin, to Klopfer, 21 June 1961). Klopfer indicated that the ML had 3,000 copies of *Three Soldiers*, enough to last about a year, and a six- to eight-month supply of *U.S.A.* (Klopfer to Moseley, 22 June 1961). Moseley wrote at the beginning of 1964 to inquire if *Three Soldiers* was out of stock, and Klopfer replied that it was (Moseley to Klopfer, 15 January 1964; Klopfer to Moseley, 22 January 1964). *Three Soldiers* was published in Sentry Editions later that year.  

*Three Soldiers* was dropped from separately published ML catalogs after fall 1963, but it continued to be included in lists of ML titles at the end of ML volumes through 1970. Its ML number was reassigned to *The Buddhist Tradition*, edited by Wm. Theodore de Bary (613), in spring 1969 after the oversight was discovered.

> Front flap:<br> An historical and spiritual revelation, *Power* is at once an unerring psychological and throbbing physical evocation of a human being and of the whole pageant of mankind. All the hope and frustration, the idealism and iniquity, the sensualism and ascetism [*sic*] of an epoch come into a magical synthesis on Feuchtwanger’s enormous canvas. Süss, the Jew, becomes more than the central character of an historical novel laid in eighteenth-century Württemberg; he is the core and the symbol of a race whose intellectual and idealistic mission is timeless and unending. (*Spring 1934*)  

Muir translation originally published in U.S. by Viking Press, 1926. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Publication announced for November 1932. *WR* 17 December 1932. First printing: 6,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1946.  

The Muir translation of Feuchtwanger’s *Jud* *Süß* was published in London under the title *Jew Süss* and in the U.S. as *Power*. The Viking plates were too large for the ML’s format. The ML paid Viking Press \$800 on publication. Other financial details, including whether Viking Press or the ML paid for the new typesetting, have not been ascertained.  

*Power* sold 2,677 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the fourth quarter of ML and Giant titles.

(*Fall 1932*)  

> Front flap:<br> Du Maurier’s famous romance has already had four incarnations. Originally, in book form, it achieved a success for its author second only to the furore created by his own *Trilby*. Then as a play, it has been, since 1915, a perennial favorite. As an opera, with a score by Deems Taylor, it found a prominent place in the repertory of the Metropolitan Opera Company, and, finally as a cinema, it has reached countless thousands of people. In its original form, it remains a book of enchantment and transcendent beauty. (*Spring 1937*)  

Originally published in U.S. by Harper & Brothers, 1891. New bibliographical edition published by Harper & Brothers with a 1919 copyright date; the new edition was probably published in the 1920s. ML edition (pp. [ii], v–vii, [1]–416) printed from plates of the later Harper edition. Published December 1932. *WR* 31 December 1932. First printing: 7,450 copies. Discontinued fall 1956.  

The royalties that the ML paid to Harper & Brothers were based on sales, in contrast to the ML’s usual practice of paying royalties on the number of copies printed. *Peter Ibbetson* was one of the few books in the ML printed on special paper. The heavier paper may have been necessary because of Du Maurier’s illustrations. The paper order for the first printing may have been underestimated; the ML ordered a first printing of 8,000 copies and received 7,450.  

When the ML’s printers received the plates, Klopfer informed Harper’s that it might be necessary to trim some of the full-page illustrations and asked if that would be acceptable (Klopfer to Henry Hoyns, Harper & Bros., 10 November 1932). The statement is puzzling since the wood-engraved illustrations in the 1891 edition as well as those in the plates used by the ML appear to have been compatible with the ML’s balloon-cloth format.  

*Peter Ibbetson* sold 2,784 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the fourth quarter of ML and Giant titles. It was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.

> Front flap:<br> How to make available to the contemporary reader all the beauty of thought, language and imagery of *The Divine Comedy* has been the primary consideration of the editors of the Modern Library in issuing this translated version of Dante’s masterpiece, complete and unabridged. After careful consideration of all the extant English translations and after consultation with the foremost university authorities, the Carlyle-Wicksteed rendering was chosen. It gives the entire scope, substance and spirit of *The Divine Comedy* to those numberless readers who cannot cope with the original. (*Fall 1935*)  

*Jacket B:* Pictorial in vivid red (11) and strong brown (55) on coated cream paper depicting Dante with an open book standing on a hillside overlooking the walls of a city, viewed through a border of stone portals; background within borders in vivid red with title and statement of responsibility for translation in reverse, other lettering in strong brown. Designed by Paul Galdone, November 1937; unsigned. 

> Front flap as jacket A. (*Fall 1937*)  

Carlyle-Okey-Wicksteed translation originally published in England by J. M. Dent & Sons (Temple Classics, 3 vols., around 1900). ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published December 1932. *WR* 31 December 1932. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72. Also published in ML Paperbacks, 1955, and subsequently in Vintage Books.  

The ML selected the Carlyle-Okey-Wicksteed translation on the basis of reports from faculty members at Yale and Columbia and information from Henry C. Moriarty of the Harvard Cooperative Bookstore that it was the translation favored at Harvard. Cerf also sought the advice of Maurice Firuski of the Housatonuc Bookshop in Salisbury, Connecticut, about the translation, introduction, and notes. Cerf wanted an introduction by T. S. Eliot and offered Faber & Faber \$60 to reprint Eliot’s essay on Dante. When that offer was rejected Firuski recommended C. H. Grandgent of Harvard University. Cerf still hoped to get Eliot (Cerf to Firuski, 28 June 1932) but wrote Grandgent a month later offering \$75 for an introduction, which he indicated was needed by mid-September (Cerf to Grandgent, 25 July 1932). Grandgent sent the introduction in August.  

Cerf was pleased with the introduction but asked Grandgent to add a few paragraphs about the translation (Cerf to Grandgent, 18 August 1932). Grandgent replied that he had not read the translation the ML was using and knew nothing of the circumstances surrounding it. He thought the best translation he had read was that of Jefferson B. Fletcher (Macmillan, 1931) and indicated that he wouldn’t want to give it an inferior position (Grandgent to Cerf, 19 August 1932). Cerf sent him the Temple Classics edition, and Grandgent supplied an additional paragraph by the end of August. He wrote: “After careful consideration of all of the English translations of Dante, the work of John Aiken Carlyle, Thomas Okey, and P. H. Wicksteed was chosen. It is a translation that is clear, dignified, and accurate, in simple, idiomatic prose. It can be readily followed without any reference to the original Italian text. Its scholarly notes cover all obscure points more than adequately” (p. xiii).  

The Publisher’s Note states: “For this Modern Library edition of Dante’s *Divine Comedy* the best translations have been followed: *Inferno*, by John Aiken Carlyle; *Purgatorio*, by Thomas Okey; *Paradisio*, by Philip H. Wicksteed. The notes (edited for this edition by Julie Eidesheim) follow, in the main, the excellent notes for the *Inferno* and the *Purgatorio* by Dr. H. Oeslsner, and those prepared jointly by Dr. Oeslner and Philip H. Wicksteed for the *Paradisio*” (251.1, p. 3; 251.2, p. xvii).  

ML title pages and jackets from 1932 through the early 1960s referred to the translation as the “Carlyle-Wicksteed translation,” overlooking the translator of *Purgatorio*. Printings in the Illustrated Modern Library (IML 7) also omitted Okey’s name from the title page. The translations were not fully identified on the title page or jackets of regular ML printings until 1963/64 (251.2c).  

Shortly after Jason Epstein joined RH in 1958 he invited Charles S. Singleton of Johns Hopkins University to prepare a new translation of *The Divine Comedy* for the ML. Singleton indicated that he was working on a prose translation for the Bollingen Foundation, which was scheduled to be published by Princeton University Press in 1965, the seven-hundredth anniversary of Dante’s birth. Epstein secured the approval of the Bollingen Foundation for a ML edition to appear after theirs, and a contract was signed with Singleton, who received advances totaling three thousand dollars between 1959 and 1961. The project took longer than anticipated, however. It was not ready by 1965. Two years later it was still being listed as a future title in ML memoranda. The Bollingen Foundation edition appeared in six volumes between 1970 and 1975 with the text in Italian and English and with extensive commentary. By that time it was too late for a ML edition. The ML had become moribund and had ceased adding new titles.  

*The Divine Comedy* sold 8,362 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the first quarter ML and Giant titles. It sold 7,590 copies during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, making it fifteenth out of the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML. Sales totaled 151,638 copies by spring 1958.

Originally published 1950 in MLCE and subsequently in the regular ML. Wilkins received \$50 for the bibliography (Stein to Wilkins, 27 January 1950).  

A memo dated 27 September 1950 instructed that the title-page reference to “Carlyle-Wicksteed Translation” be changed to “Carlyle-Okey-Wicksteed Translation.” The change was made in the MLCE title page only. Thirteen years later another memo (28 February 1963) indicated that the jacket and title page of the regular ML edition should read “Carlyle-Okey-Wicksteed Translation.”  

The following note was added to verso of the title page: “The material included in this volume is taken from Temple Classics.”
