# MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1938 

## 1938   

### General   

The spring 1938 RH catalogue was indicative of the growing importance of RH’s trade list. It included Isak Dineson’s *Out of Africa*, William Faulkner’s *Unvanquished*, Robert Graves’s *Count Belisarius*, Edgar Snow’s *Red Star Over China*, and John Strachey’s *What is to be Done?* Other titles included *The Public Papers* and *Addresses of Franklin D. Roosevelt* in five volumes and *The Complete Greek Drama*, a two-volume set in the Lifetime Library, a series of mainly ancient classics that began the previous year with *The Complete Dialogues of Plato*.   

It was a list that even other publishers found impressive. Albert Knopf wrote to Cerf: “I have just been looking over with admiration and respect your new catalogue. You are publishing a lot of interesting books and building on a solid foundation” (Knopf to Cerf, 26 January 1938). Philip Van Doren Stern of Simon & Schuster was equally impressed, and perhaps a bit envious (Stern to Cerf, 26 January 1938).   

> I want to congratulate you on your really magnificent list. It is one of the finest that I have ever seen assembled by an American publisher. You will certainly have a successful year with books like these and you are building up a backlist that will give your house a solid foundation of real honest-to-God titles in the years to come. . . . 
> P.S. This is no Dale Carnegie crap [*How to Win Friends and Influence People*, then enjoying a huge success, was a Simon & Schuster publication.] I mean every word of it.   

### Number of titles   

Eight new titles were added and five were discontinued, bringing the number of titles in the regular ML to 219. Five new titles were published in the Giants series; by the end of 1938 ML Giants included forty titles in forty-two volumes.   

### Format   

All new titles in the regular ML except Walter D. Edmonds, *Rome Haul* (310) were published in the standard format with the binding measuring 6⅝ x 4⅜ in. (168 x 110 mm) and leaves trimmed to 6½ x 4¼ in. (164 x 107 mm). *Rome Haul* was ¼ in. taller and wider to accommodate the Little, Brown plates.   

The ML’s standard format was enlarged in fall 1939. The new binding measured 7¼ x 4⅞ in. (182 x 123 mm) with a trim size of 7 x 4¾ in. (177 x 120 mm). In 1969 a taller, slightly slimmer format was introduced with the binding measuring 7½ x 4¾ in. (190 x 120 mm) and a trim size of 7¼ x 4½ in. (182 x 115 mm). All dimensions indicated are approximate.   

Most books through 1954 were printed with 16 pages on each side of the sheet and bound in gatherings of 16 leaves (32 pages); by 1956 most books were being printed with 32 pages on each side of the sheet and bound in gatherings of 32 leaves (64 pages).   

### Title page   

All new titles in the regular ML had the final version of Elmer Adler’s title page with the title in open-face type; four had torchbearer A2 and four had torchbearer A3. All new titles had the 2-line imprint:   

<center> T H E M O D E R N L I B R A R Y  </center> 
<center> <span class="smallcaps">New York </span> </center>

### Binding   

Balloon cloth binding D, with Kent’s torchbearer (1⅛ in.; 27 mm) stamped in gold on the front panel and stylized initials “ML” added in gold above the 2-line imprint on the spine. Balloon cloth bindings continued to be available in four colors: red, blue, green, and brown, with the top edge stained the same color as the binding. Each title was published simultaneously in all four bindings.   

### Endpaper   

Rockwell Kent endpapers in moderate orange (53). Moderate orange endpapers were used with all balloon cloth bindings from fall 1930 through spring 1939 except for Reed, *Ten Days That Shook the World* (1935) and three spring 1939 titles that were published in the larger format that the ML adopted for all titles beginning in fall 1939. These four titles had blank endpapers. Since endpapers were printed from plates designed for the standard balloon cloth format, titles like Edmonds, *Rome Haul*, which were slightly larger than the standard balloon cloth format had endpapers with unprinted outer edges. An enlarged version of Kent’s endpaper was introduced in spring 1940. The central panels featuring Kent’s torchbearer were unchanged, but the surrounding pattern of open books and the initials “ml” was extended to fill the larger space.   

### Jackets  

All new titles were published in individually designed jackets. Four had pictorial jackets; Steinbeck, *Of Mice and Men* and *The Wisdom of Confucius* had non-pictorial jackets. Two titles had predominately non-pictorial jackets: the blue background of Canfield, *The Deepening Stream*, was patterned to suggest water currents, and Proust, *Cities of the Plain*, featured a small left-profile silhouette of the author.   

### Price   

95 cents.   

### Dating keys   

(Spring) Confucius, *Wisdom* xProust, *Cities of the Plain*; Giants through G40; jackets: 257. (Fall) Proust, *Cities of the Plain* xStone, *Lust for Life*; Giants through G42; jackets: 262.   

### Titles sought, suggested, declined   

Cerf wanted to add a historical novel to the ML. He wrote Doubleday, Doran about Kenneth Roberts’s *Arundel*, which dealt with Benedict Arnold’s expedition to Quebec during the Revolutionary War. He noted that he understood that Roberts was not keen about having his books in reprint editions but argued that the ML should “be considered in a rather different category than the ordinary reprint. We have got one book or more by almost every important American novelist in the series now” (Cerf to Malcolm Johnson, Doubleday, Doran, 12 May 1938). Cerf then wrote to Roberts himself, offering an advance of \$1,500 against royalties of 10 cents a copy. He indicated, “In these days and times, a \$1500.00 advance is a heavy one, but I feel so confident that ARUNDEL would sell like blazes in the Modern Library series that I think the advance would be earned in far less than the usual time and that, therefore, the book would sell in the Modern Library series very steadily for many years to come” (Cerf to Kenneth Roberts, 23 May 1938). Doubleday, Doran agreed to Cerf’s terms, but Roberts was unconvinced. He indicated that he was not certain that *Arundel* should be available in a cheap edition, and subsequently wrote that he had decided “to wait a while longer before allowing a cheap edition of any of my books” (Roberts to Cerf, 21 November 1938).   

Shortly thereafter Cerf wrote Hervey Allen about including his historical novel *Anthony Adverse* in ML Giants (Cerf to Hervey Allen, 6 December 1938). He first expressed interest in *Anthony Adverse* five years earlier, shortly after it was published (see 1933 Titles sought, suggested, declined). *Anthony Adverse* sold 300,000 copies in its first six months and led the fiction bestseller lists in 1933 and 1934. Nothing came of Cerf’s initiative. Like Roberts’s *Arundel*, *Anthony Adverse* does not appear to have been published in an inexpensive reprint edition.   

Cerf approached Little, Brown yet again about a ML edition of Charles Nordhoff and James Norman Hall’s *Bounty* trilogy, but Alfred McIntyre of Little, Brown indicated that the books were still selling too well in their original editions to consider an inexpensive reprint (Cerf to McIntyre, 19 April 1938; McIntyre to Cerf, 20 April 1938). That fall Cerf wrote again:   

>What we want at the moment is a real leader or two for our Modern Library list for the next year. We can get all the sound run-of-the-mill titles, but it is a different problem to find another item like our Freud or Jean Christophe to head next year’s list. This brings me around once again to the question of the Bounty trilogy. If we were to offer you \$5000.00 cash on signing of the contract for an edition of 50,000 copies of the trilogy, to be published in the Spring of 1939 as a Modern Library Giant at \$1.25, would you be inclined to consider the proposal? The understanding would be that after 50,000 copies had been exhausted, we could not print another edition in this format without a brand new contract with you. Frankly, I think this would be a wonderful title for the Modern Library and that it would establish the authors on a higher literary plane than they have ever occupied before (Cerf to McIntyre, 7 September, 1938).   

The advance was twice what Cerf had offered in 1936, though the royalty rate remained the same (see 1936 Titles sought, suggested, declined). McIntyre replied that Little, Brown was publishing its own one-volume edition in October for the Christmas season and that it would be withdrawn in January, after which Little, Brown would push the three separate volumes (McIntyre to Cerf, 8 September 1938).   

In 1940 Cerf tried again to secure the *Bounty* trilogy for the ML. On that occasion he was told that Little, Brown was publishing a new edition of the trilogy with illustrations by N. C. Wyeth (Cerf to McIntyre, 2 April 1940; McIntyre to Cerf, 6 April 1940). The edition with Wyeth’s illustrations was published in October 1940.   

During a trip to England in fall 1938 Cerf met with George Bernard Shaw, who had always opposed inexpensive reprint editions of his plays. On this occasion Cerf reported in a letter to Random House, “Old boy spryer than ever. All for us doing ‘9 Plays’ as Giant. Gotta get after Dodd, Mead on this soon” (Cerf Papers Box 71, Cerf European trip (1) folder. Cerf to Random House, undated). *Nine Plays* included *Mrs. Warren’s Profession*, *Arms and the Man*, *Candida*, *The Devil’s Disciple*, *Caesar and Cleopatra*, *Man and Superman*, *Fanny’s First Play*, *Androcles and the Lion*, and *Saint Joan*. However, when Cerf contacted Dodd, Mead after his return, he indicated that the two firms would have to find a formula satisfactory to both, given the number of editions of Shaw’s works that Dodd, Mead published. Since Dodd, Mead had no cheap edition of *St. Joan*, he suggested a ML edition of that play with “one or 2 lesser efforts. Perhaps Candida or Caesar & Cleopatra” (Cerf to Howard Lewis, Dodd, Mead & Co., 2 December 1938). There is no further correspondence in the archives about a ML reprint of Shaw’s plays. Shaw may have changed his mind, or Dodd, Mead may have vetoed the idea. It was only after Shaw’s death in 1950 that the ML was able to publish two volumes of his plays: *Four Plays* (1953) and *Saint Joan, Major Barbara, Androcles and the Lion* (1956).   

Henry Hoyns of Harper and Brothers suggested a ML edition of Paul Horgan’s novel *The Fault of Angels*, which had won the Harper Prize when it was published in 1933. Cerf replied that he did not think there would be sufficient sales to justify a ML edition (Hoyns to Cerf, 4 February 1938; Cerf to Hoyns, 17 February 1938).

Mann, *Magic Mountain* (1932)\*   

\*The ML’s reprint contract for *The Magic Mountain* (229) was limited to a term of five years. Knopf refused to consider a renewal, but he appears to have allowed the ML to make a final printing of 10,000 copies shortly before the contract expired.

> Front flap:<br> No criminologist of our time has approached Edmund Pearson for his accuracy in probing into the hidden motives and mysterious circumstances of famous homicides. *Studies in Murder* is the book by which he is best known. Originally, it contained analyses of the weird cases of Lizzie Borden, Benjamin Nathan, Captain Nash, Mabel Page and others. In the Modern Library edition two world-renowned cases are added, those of Bruno Hauptmann and the insurance murder of the almost indestructible Michael Malloy, with an essay, “Do We Execute Innocent People?” (*Spring 1938*)   

Originally published by the Macmillan Co., 1924. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting with illustrations omitted and three chapters added: “Malloy the Mighty,” “Hauptmann and Circumstantial Evidence,” and “Do We Execute Innocent People?” Published February 1938. *WR* 12 February 1938. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued fall 1950.   

The plates of the Macmillan edition were too large for the ML’s format. The added chapters in the ML edition were originally published in *The New Yorker*: “Malloy the Mighty” (23 September 1933), “Hauptmann and Circumstantial Evidence” (9 March 1935), and “Do We Execute Innocent People?” (22 June 1935). The Appendix is reprinted from the Macmillan edition and includes sources and acknowledgments for the first five chapters only.   

*Studies in Murder* sold 3,713 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of ML and Giant titles.

> Front flap:<br> The Erie Canal, with its roistering boatmen and hard-fisted muleteers, its legends and feuds, comes into its own in *Rome Haul*. Walter D. Edmonds has re-created all its lost glories in a book that is remarkable as a contribution to American folklore and fascinating as a novel of adventure. The dramatized version of *Rome Haul*, under the title of *The Farmer Takes a Wife*, enjoyed great success on the stage and screen. In the Modern Library series it will enlist a new army of enthusiasts. (*Spring 1938*)   

Originally published by Little, Brown & Co., 1929. ML edition (pp. [xiii]–347) printed from Little, Brown plates with fly title and chart of the Erie Canal on Little, Brown endpapers omitted.

Three-line statement on front panel: “*A New Masterpiece*” | *The strange and disturbing drama of* | *two men and a woman*.   

> Front flap:<br> Genuine compassion for his vagabonds and human flotsam gives the breath of life to John Steinbeck’s novels and makes them idylls of the lower depths. *Of Mice and Men* is Steinbeck at his compassionate best; it is a story movingly and forcefully told and with overtones of soaring beauty. Its first success as a national best-seller and its subsequent triumph in dramatic form have helped to place John Steinbeck in the company of the first prose writers of America. (*Spring 1938*)   

Originally published by Covici, Friede, 1937, and subsequently by Viking Press. ML edition (pp. [5]–186) printed from Covici, Friede/Viking plates. Published February 1938. *WR* 5 March 1938. First printing: Not ascertained.   

Cerf and Klopfer arranged the ML reprint with Covici, Friede, which had been Steinbeck’s publisher since the publication of his fourth novel, *Tortilla Flat*, in 1935. The close working relationship between Steinbeck and his editor Pascal Covici was comparable to those between F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway with Maxwell Perkins at Charles Scribner’s Sons. Covici, Friede failed shortly after *Of Mice and Men* appeared in the ML. The firm was acquired by Viking Press, Covici became a Viking editor, and Steinbeck became a Viking author. Arrangements for the second ML printing were made with Viking Press in October 1938.   

There were four ML printings between October 1938 and September 1942 totaling 10,000 copies. Steinbeck’s first book with Viking Press, *The Grapes of Wrath*, sold 430,000 copies in less than a year and was the best-selling work of fiction for 1939 (Madison, pp. 306–7; Hackett and Burke, p. 127).   

When *Of Mice and Men* was published in the ML it had to compete with a 39-cent reprint published by Blue Ribbon Books. Lewis Miller, the Random House sales manager, told one of the sales representatives: “Bennett felt strongly that the book deserved a place in the Modern Library, no matter what other editions were to be had” (Miller to Rosengren, 24 January 1938).   

*Of Mice and Men* sold 7,020 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles. Sales of all four Steinbeck titles in the ML totaled 35,975 copies during this period. *The Grapes of Wrath* was the only Steinbeck novel among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.

Sustained by the hope of someday owning a farm of their own, these two itinerant laborers arrive to work on a ranch in central California. George, who is short-tempered, relies on Lennie’s great physical strength for protection and in turn tries to keep his feeble-minded friend out of trouble. But in the end, Lennie’s fundamental weakness leads to the inevitable tragedy that Steinbeck so poignantly explores in this spare, poetic novel.

> Front flap:<br> For 2,500 years the writings of China’s great sage have represented the moral principles as well as the day-to-day standards of conduct for countless millions of people in the East. Today, as much as ever, his doctrines influence the way of life of the most populous nation on earth. A completely new English text has been prepared for the Modern Library edition of *The Wisdom of Confucius* under the editorship of Dr. Lin Yutang, the foremost interpreter of ancient and modern China in America today. (*Spring 1938*)   

Original ML collection. Published April 1938. *WR* 9 April 1938. First printing: Not ascertained.   

Several months before *The Wisdom of Confucius* was published Cerf wrote to a publishers’ representative in New Zealand, “I call your particular attention to the Confucius volume, edited by Lin Yutang. I think this will prove one of the most popular titles we have ever had, and we expect about three times the normal advance sale on it” (Cerf to Nash & Kissling, 17 November 1937). Cerf’s prediction was correct. *The Wisdom of Confucius* was one of the ML’s best-selling titles. In 1942 it was the third best-selling title in the series.   

While working on the manuscript Lin Yutang wrote, “I am conceited enough to think that it will be a gorgeous book, the most intelligible on Confucianism. I have gone through the entire material already, and besides the introduction, it will be principally the work of translating. Most of the chapters are not very long and the manuscript will be around two hundred pages” (Lin Yutang to Klopfer, 4 January 1938). The completed manuscript was submitted on 31 January. The ML’s financial arrangements with Lin Yutang have not been ascertained. He received \$300 on publication (Emanuel Harper to Lin Yutang, 11 April 1938); it is not known whether this represented partial payment of a flat fee or was an advance against royalties.   

Lin Yutang made a trip to Europe after submitting the manuscript and did not read the proofs. The ML’s rights to some of the material in the collection appears to have been challenged. In 1939 Random House paid \$250 for all rights to Miles Menander Dawson’s *The Conduct of Life (The Ethics of Confucius)*, originally published by International Press in 1915.   

*The Wisdom of Confucius* sold 12,000 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it seventeenth out of 281 ML and Giant titles. Sales declined by the early 1950s. During the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952 it sold 4,036 copies, making it sixty-first out of the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML.

His Introduction clarifies for the Western reader the great ethical teachings of Confucius.   

In 1945 the word “Jewish” was removed from the following sentence: “[Confucius] could sing and be extremely polite, but he also could hate and sneer with the hatred and contempt of a ‘real man,’ which was shared by Jesus in his hatred of the Jewish scribes” (p. 27, line 16). Freiman asked that the word be eliminated from the plates of both the regular ML and Illustrated ML editions (Freiman to Parkway Printing, 21 May 1945).   

*The Wisdom of Confucius* was shifted from ML 7 to ML 306 in fall 1959 when the six-volume Shakespeare was renumbered ML 2–7.

> Front flap:<br> “Confucianism stood for a rationalized social order through the ethical approach, based on personal cultivation. It aimed at political order by laying the basis for it in a moral order, and it sought political harmony by trying to achieve the moral harmony in man himself. . . . Fundamentally, it was a humanist attitude, brushing aside all futile metaphysics and mysticism, interested chiefly in the essential human relationships, and not in the world of spirits or in immortality. The strongest doctrine of this particular type of humanism, which accounts for its great enduring influence, is the doctrine that ‘the measure of man is man,’ a doctrine which makes it possible for the common man to begin somewhere as a follower of Confucianism by merely following the highest instincts of his own human nature, and not by looking for perfection in a divine ideal.”

> Front flap rewritten:<br> The growing interest in books on economics reflects the demand for enlightenment on means of production and modes of distribution. Knowledge of the needs and capacities of the individual and the society in which he lives are of vital concern to everyone. Such works as Adam Smith’s *The Wealth of Nations* (G-32), Karl Marx’s *Capital* (G-26), Thorstein Veblen’s *The Theory of the Leisure Class* (No. 63), *The Making of Society* (No. 183) and other volumes on economics and sociology make available to the general reader the widest possible range of thought on these subjects. Essential to this library of the world’s great social and economic thinkers is Henry George’s *Progress and Poverty*. The advocate of the single tax here analyzes the causes and effects of industrial depression and their consequences in terms of prosperity and poverty. (*Fall 1956*)

Scott Moncrieff translation originally published in U.S. in two volumes by A. & C. Boni, 1927. ML edition printed from A. & C. Boni/Random House plates. Published November 1938. *WR* 12 November 1938. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.   

Random House acquired the rights to Proust’s *Remembrance of Things Past* from A. & C. Boni when that firm ran into financial difficulties and published the seven-novel sequence in 1934 as a four-volume set in a wooden slipcase (Cerf, *At Random*, p. 99). RH subsequently published *Remembrance of Things Past* in two volumes. The seven novels were published individually in the ML between 1928 and 1951.   

*Cities of the Plain* sold 2,292 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the fourth quarter of ML and Giant titles. It was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952. *Swann’s Way* (166), which sold 5,017 copies between May 1942 and October 1943, was in the third quarter of ML and Giant titles and the only Proust title at that period to rank above the fourth quarter. By November 1951–October 1952 *Swann’s Way* had climbed to a secure position in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles.
