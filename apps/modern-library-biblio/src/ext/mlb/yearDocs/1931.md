# MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1931  

## 1931  

### General  

It took more than two years for the economy to decline to its lowest levels after the stock market crash of 1929. Modern Library sales fluctuated as the economy declined, but on the whole the series appears to have been well suited to the Depression book market. Few mainstream books sold for less than the ML’s retail price of 95 cents. Annual ML sales passed the million copy mark for the first time in 1930; sales for September 1931 were the best of any month in the Modern Library’s history up to that time (Cerf, “The Modern Library and the Price of Books,” *PW*, 7 December 1929, p. 2665; *PW*, 10 October 1931, p. 1649).  

Modern Library Giants, a subsidiary series created to enable the ML to include works that were too long to fit into the regular format and to accommodate substantial collections and anthologies, were introduced in fall 1931. The first three titles were Tolstoy, *War and Peace* (G1), Boswell, *Life of Samuel Johnson* (G2), and Hugo, *Les Misérables* (G3). The Giants were full-sized books, measuring 8¼ x 5½ in. (209 x 140 mm) with hard covers and wider margins than regular ML books. Many of the volumes exceeded 1,000 pages in length. The Giants sold initially for one dollar a copy, only five cents more than regular ML books. They were ideally suited to the Depression book market and were an immediate success.  

In contrast, the market for the fine limited editions that Cerf and Klopfer distributed and published under the Random House imprint collapsed. Many formerly wealthy collectors began searching for buyers for their collections. One collector, whose library included a large number of Kelmscott Press books, including *The Works of Geoffrey Chaucer*, together with volumes issued by the Ashendene, Golden Cockerel, Nonesuch, and Shakespeare Head presses and practically everything designed by Bruce Rogers, appealed to one of the RH sales representatives to help find a buyer for his books. When Klopfer was asked for suggestions, he could only reply, “I don’t know a soul who wants to buy a lot of press books today” (Carl Smalley to Cerf and Klopfer, 29 February 1932; Klopfer to Smalley, 4 March 1932). By 1933 Random House was offering overstocked fine press books at a fraction of the original price. The Random House edition of H. G. Wells’s *Time Machine* designed by W. A. Dwiggins (\$12.50 list) was available for \$2.00; the two-volume Nonesuch Press edition of Montaigne (\$42.00 list) was reduced to \$10.00; and the two-volume Gregynog Press Euripides (\$85.00 list) was \$15.00.  

Cerf and Klopfer published thirteen titles in the public domain under the Carlton House imprint, which they used mainly for “specials” intended for sale in department stores. The books were printed from ML plates. The 1931 titles were about the size of ML Giants and printed on good quality paper, bound in green, blue, or maroon leather with gilt tops, and were sold in black slip cases at a retail price of \$2.50. The venture was regarded as an experiment. Only 500 copies of each title were printed. The books were placed in selected department stores in major cities in time for the Christmas season. Most of the stores did not do well with the books. One of the sales representatives noted that they would have been all right before the Crash, but that 1931 “was one of those years when even \$2.50 was a high priced book” (Carl Smalley to Cerf, 18 August 1932).  

RH revived the Carlton House imprint for the 1932 Christmas season, but the books were very different. Fifteen titles were printed from ML plates in print runs of 3,000 copies each, with a retail price of 50 cents.  

### Number of titles  

Twenty-one titles were added to the regular ML in 1931 and five were discontinued, bringing the number of active titles to 198. Minor discrepancies between the number of titles indicated here and on inside panels of ML jackets are due primarily to the ML’s practice of including titles projected for January publication on fall lists. The new ML Giants series was introduced in fall 1931 with three titles: Tolstoy, *War and Peace* (G1), Boswell, *Life of Samuel Johnson* (G2), and Hugo, *Les Misérables* (G3).  

### Format  

All new titles except Conrad, *Lord Jim* (230) were published in the standard format with the binding measuring 6⅝ x 4⅜ in. (168 x 110 mm) and the leaves trimmed to 6½ x 4¼ in. (164 x 107 mm). *Lord Jim* was 6⅞ x 4⅝ in. (175 x 117 mm) with the leaves trimmed to 6¾ x 4½ in. (171 x 113 mm).  

The ML’s standard format was enlarged in 1939. The new binding measured 7¼ x 4⅞ in. (182 x 123 mm) with a trim size of 7 x 4¾ in. (177 x 120 mm). In 1969 a taller, slightly slimmer format was introduced with the binding measuring 7½ x 4¾ in. (190 x 120 mm) and a trim size of 7¼ x 4½ in. (182 x 115 mm). All dimensions indicated are approximate.  

Most books through 1954 were printed with 16 pages on each side of the sheet and bound in gatherings of 16 leaves (32 pages); by 1956 most books were being printed with 32 pages on each side of the sheet and bound in gatherings of 32 leaves (64 pages).  

### Title page  

All new titles had the final version of Elmer Adler’s title page with the title in open-face type and torchbearer A2, A3, or A6 (see individual entries). Beginning in January 1931 Cerf and Klopfer added their names to the imprint:  

<center> <span class="smallcaps">Bennett A. Cerf · Donald S. Klopfer</span></center>
<center> T H E  M O D E R N  L I B R A R Y </center> 
<center><span class="smallcaps"> New York</span></center>

The imprints of three 1931 titles—Fielding, *History of Tom Jones* (208), Boccaccio, *Decameron* (209), and Balzac, *Droll Stories* (221)—differed from the standard format. *The History of Tom Jones* had a colon instead of a dot between Cerf and Klopfer’s names; *The Decameron* and *Droll Stories* reverted to the two-line format without Cerf and Klopfer’s names.  

The imprint for newly published titles reverted to the previous 2-line format in March 1936 after the Modern Library acquired the publishing firm Harrison Smith and Robert Haas, and Haas and Smith joined Cerf and Klopfer as partners.  

### Binding  

Balloon cloth binding C, with Kent’s torchbearer (1⅛ in.; 27 mm) stamped in gold on the front panel and the 2-line imprint MODERN LIBRARY stamped in gold at the base of the spine, was used through April 1931. Balloon cloth binding D, with the front panel as binding C and the stylized initials “ML” added in gold above the 2-line imprint on the spine, was introduced in May and remained in use through spring 1939.  

Balloon cloth bindings continued to be available in four colors: red, blue, green, and brown, with each title published simultaneously in all four bindings.  

The Siegbert Book Cloth Corporation, which supplied some or all of the ML’s balloon cloth, decided to liquidate. Holliston Mills, Inc., took over Siegbert’s stock, trademarks, and patent rights.  

### Endpaper  

Rockwell Kent endpapers in moderate orange (53). Moderate orange endpapers were used with all balloon cloth bindings from fall 1930 through spring 1939, except for three spring 1939 titles that were published in the larger format that the ML would adopt for all titles beginning that fall. An enlarged version of Kent’s endpaper was introduced in spring 1940. The central panels featuring Kent’s torchbearer were unchanged, but the surrounding patterns of open books and “ml” initials were extended to fill the larger space.  

### Jackets 

Twelve of the 1931 titles were published in individually designed pictorial jackets. Five were published in uniform typographic jacket D and three in uniform typographic jacket E. The individually designed jacket of Wells, *Tono-Bungay* (225) features the 2-line title sandwiched between six strong yellow green bands, simulating a barrel labeled TONO BUNGAY.  

### Price  

95 cents.  

### Dating keys  

(Spring) Conrad, *Lord Jim* xBalzac, *Droll Stories*. (Fall) Balzac, *Droll Stories* xDreiser, *Sister Carrie*; Giants through G3.  

### Titles sought, suggested, declined  

Cerf wanted to include Rudyard Kipling’s *Kim* in the ML, possibly as a replacement for *Soldiers* *Three* which was dropped from the series in 1931. The novel was originally published in 1901, but Doubleday, Doran was not ready to grant reprint rights (Daniel Longwell to Cerf, 17 February 1931). He asked again nearly two years later (Cerf to Nelson Doubleday, 3 December 1932) with the same result. *Kim* (433) did not appear in the ML until 1950. Another book Cerf wanted was Henry Adams, *Mont-Saint-Michel and Chartres*, the trade edition of which was originally published by Houghton Mifflin in 1913. He was told that there was very strong opposition at Houghton Mifflin to a moderately priced edition (Roger L. Scaife, Houghton Mifflin, to Cerf, 24 January 1931). Herschel Brickell, head of the trade department at Henry Holt & Co., asked why Gogol’s *Dead Souls* wasn’t in the ML. Klopfer replied, “Dead Souls isn’t in the Modern Library yet because we haven’t got around to it. I think you’re right; it should be there” (Brickell to Cerf, undated; Klopfer to Brickell, 3 March 1931). *Dead Souls* (290) was published in the ML in 1936.  

Cerf wanted to include a collection of short stories by Arthur Schnitzler (Cerf to Richard L. Simon, 28 October 1931), perhaps as a potential replacement for Schnitzler’s novel *Bertha Garlan* (38) which was discontinued the following year. Simon and Schuster had published a collection of ten Schnitzler stories under the title *Little Novels* in 1929. It is not clear whether Simon and Schuster rejected the offer or Cerf abandoned it. When Cerf edited the ML anthology *Great German Short Novels and Stories* (256), published in April 1933, he included Schnitzler’s story “The Fate of the Baron” from the Simon and Schuster collection.  

Cerf considered including Siegfried Sassoon’s *Memoirs of a Fox Hunting Man*, which had been suggested by Tom Coward of Coward-McCann. Cerf was interested at first, but the plates were too large for the ML’s format, and he had reservations about Sassoon’s popularity in the United States. He eventually declined: “Maybe something will come along to increase Sassoon’s popularity in America, and in this case we hope that you will allow us to reopen negotiations on this book” (Cerf to Coward, 10 February 1931; 9 July 1931).  

R. I. Warshow of Greenberg: Publisher suggested *Wolfgang Goethe*, a two-volume biography by the Danish writer Georg Brandes, for the ML Giants series which was being launched in the fall. Cerf replied, “Cheers! What a <u>lousy</u> idea” (Cerf to Warshaw, 24 March 1931; underlining in original).  

When M. A. Dominick of Frederick A. Stokes Co. suggested the inclusion of a Louis Bromfield title, Cerf replied, “I have the very definite feeling that ed. & Dunlap have gotten all there is to be gotten out of the reprints of Mr. Bromfield’s books” (Cerf to Dominick, 22 October 1931). Stanley Rinehart of Farrar & Rinehart suggested Floyd Dell’s *Moon-Calf*, *The Briary-Bush*, or *Janet March*, which were then the property of Doubleday, Doran. Cerf responded, “I frankly don’t think that Dell’s old books are read widely enough today to justify their inclusion in a reprint series such as ours. I should think that be belonged with the heroes of yesterday like Cabell and Anderson. Or am I wrong?” (Rinehart to Cerf, 21 December 1931; Cerf to Rinehart, 22 December 1931).

> Front flap:<br> It is generally conceded by critics, and certainly it is staunchly maintained by hosts of readers, that Arnold Bennett’s most notable literary achievement is *The Old Wives’ Tale*. This chronicle of the Five Towns and France during the Siege of Paris is a project of heroic proportions, accomplished with infinite skill, and of a scope that invites comparison with the greatest novels of the Victorian era. It is a tale of ordinary people during extraordinary times, told with an insight encountered only in the works of the masters of fiction. (*Spring 1935*)  

Originally published in U.S. by Hodder & Stoughton, 1909. New bibliographical edition with preface by Bennett published by George H. Doran Co., 1911, and subsequently by Doubleday, Doran & Co. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting that Doubleday, Doran appears to have made for the ML’s exclusive use. Published January 1931. *WR* 14 February 1931. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1972.  

Cerf and Klopfer secured reprint rights in spring 1930 to four long-sought Doubleday titles—Bennett’s *Old Wives’ Tale*, Maugham’s *Of Human Bondage* (199), Walpole’s *Fortitude* (201), and Huxley’s *Point Counter Point* (203)—as part of a deal to buy the Sun Dial Library from Garden City Publishing Co., the Doubleday reprint subsidiary. The ML had exclusive reprint rights to *The Old Wives’ Tale* and paid Doubleday, Doran a \$3,000 advance against royalties of 12 cents a copy. There was a second printing of 5,000 copies in November 1931, a third printing of 3,000 copies in December 1932, and two printings of 3,000 copies each in 1933. Cerf stated in 1946 that *The Old Wives’ Tale* “remains, year in and year out, one of the most popular novels in the Modern Library” (Cerf, “Trade Winds,” *SRL* 29, 24 August 1946, p. 18).  

*The Old Wives’ Tale* was the third best-selling ML title during the first six months of 1931 (RH box 117, Publicity file). It sold 6,816 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the second quarter ML and Giant titles. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.

Treasured as one of the greatest achievements in the literature of fiction, it retains all the vitality and contemporaneity of the eternally human. Its unrestrained commentaries on the life of the period, its ridicule of the pretensions and its tolerance of the frailties of mankind, its naturalness and its unforgettable characters, assure the permanence of *Tom Jones* through the ages.

*Jacket A:* As 208.1b with front flap rewritten:  

> Henry Fielding’s story of a foundling is now more than two hundred years old, but still it has the vitality and appeal it had for its readers in the middle of the eighteenth century. Then, with few predecessors, Fielding created his own form and brought forth a pioneer work of English fiction. Now, with countless imitators, his book is read with the kind of appreciation one reserves for a novel that understands the ageless frailties of mankind and forgives them. A book that makes pretensions ridiculous and shows tolerance for weakness is ageless. *Tom Jones* is remembered with affection by readers of every variety for its complete naturalness and for its vivid characters. After two centuries the permanence of Henry Fielding’s novel is assured. (*Fall 1956*)  

*Jacket B:* As jacket A except on coated white paper with title and author in dark yellow (88) on inset white panel and background in moderate red (15). (*Fall 1963*)  

Originally published 1950 in MLCE and subsequently in the regular ML. Sherburn received \$200 for the introduction (Stein to Sherburn, 24 January 1950). Edmund H.

Unforgettable characters and episodes emerge in its pages: Tom himself—loving, high-spirited, brimming with impetuous vigor; irascible Squire Western with his dogs and drink; Sophia Western, who sees through sham with a gentle “Fie!,” and marvelously understands how to manage her prickly father; Mr. Allworthy, seeker of justice, blinded by his own good heart; Square the philosopher; Mr. Thwackum the divine; the black Blifil; and the author himself, permeating every page with kindly admonitions, scorn of hypocrisy, and admiration of the true virtue found in clarity of vision and a prudent disciplining of the spontaneous urgings of one’s own good nature. Picaresque novel, comic mock epic in prose, *Tom Jones* ranks in the forefront of world literature.

> Front flap:<br> An enormous, exuberant novel of appetite—for food, drink, women, experience—*Tom Jones* is, according to Samuel Coleridge, one of the most nearly perfect plots in the world. A foundling, Tom, is discovered one morning by Squire Allworthy and his squarish sister Bridget and brought up as a son in their household until it is time for him to leave and seek not only his fortune but his real identity. Athletic, charismatic, generous, filled with what Fielding called “the glorious lust of doing good” but with a tendency toward dissolution, Tom Jones is one of the first characters in fiction ever to display legitimate sides of good and evil. *Tom Jones*, the novel is one of the first examples of the “novel of incident,” one which develops character along with plot, and a crucial influence upon the development of modern fiction.  

Bowers edition originally published in two volumes by Wesleyan University Press, 1975, and reprinted in one volume. ML edition (pp. [3]–982) printed from offset plates photographically reduced from the one-volume Wesleyan University Press edition with the following material omitted: dedication (“To Ruthe”), table of contents, list of plates, preface signed by Battestin and Bowers, Battestin’s introduction, fly title (a reproduction of the title page of the 1749 edition), and all appendices (chronology of important dates, select bibliography, index to the corrections, abbreviations used in the notes). The illustrations by Warren Chappell (color plates and line drawings) and the color map on the endpapers are also omitted, as is the list of plates. Published spring 1985 at \$10.95. ISBN 0-394-60519-5.  

*The History of Tom Jones* (208.3) is in the 8¼ x 5½ inch format formerly used for ML Giants.  

Lines 3–4 of the title page are doubly flawed: Battestin’s introduction is not included in the ML edition, and Battestin’s name is misspelled.  

The full-page color and black-and-white illustrations by Warren Chappell in the one-volume Wesleyan University Press edition were originally created for the Illustrated Modern Library edition of *The History of Tom Jones* (IML 5, 1943). Chappell’s black-and-white vignettes at the head of the dedication, each of the eighteen books, and the end of the Illustrated Modern Library edition are omitted; in their place the Wesleyan University Press substitutes two flourishes and a swelled rule at the head of the introduction, a swelled rule and fluerons below the heading for each book, and a drawing of a couple walking arm-in-arm at the end of the text. All of these illustrations are omitted from the ML edition, which otherwise is a photographic reproduction of pp. [3]–982 of Wesleyan University Press edition, printed by offset lithography with the type page photographically reduced in size.

> Front flap:<br> For more than five centuries Giovanni Boccaccio’s *The Decameron* has stood virtually unchallenged in its supremacy as the world’s greatest collection of tales. Chaucer, Shakespeare, Keats and many other literary immortals found in these Florentine stories a never-failing inspiration and a veritable source book for plot material. To the modern reader, *The Decameron* affords undiminished stimulation and pleasure, despite the strictures and the vain attempts at suppression by hysterical censors. Boccaccio’s lusty book is one of the best-selling titles on the Modern Library list. (*Fall 1939*)  

Payne translation originally published in London, 1886. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published February 1931. *WR* 21 March 1931. First printing: Not ascertained. Superseded 1955 by Winwar translation (209.2a).  

Cerf and Klopfer took special precautions to insure that *The Decameron* would not invite the attention of censors. It had been the subject of occasional obscenity prosecutions in the 1920s, and the U.S. Treasury Department did not officially rescind the Customs ban against its importation until 1931 (Boyer 2002, p. 237). Working through Edwin A. Falk, the ML’s attorney, they sought the advice of Morris L. Ernst, who indicated that there was little danger unless they planned to include shocking illustrations in the volume (Ernst to Falk, 27 December 1930).  

The ML asked Ernst to write a foreword that was intended as a warning to John S. Sumner, the head of the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice. Ernst’s foreword emphasized the literary significance of *The Decameron*, its inclusion in the curricula of leading American universities, and the failures of previous attempts to suppress it. He stated: “At this time The Decameron is accepted as legal literature” (p. xxii).  

Cerf and Klopfer originally planned to publish the foreword anonymously, but Ernst suggested that his name be attached: “. . . if the enclosed foreword is signed with my name, it might deter to a slight degree our friend Mr. Sumner. I have licked him in every case I had so far. I rather think that he, William J. Schieffelin and his other directors, might shy off in case they see my name in the volume” (Ernst to Falk, 27 December 1930). Klopfer put Ernst’s name on the foreword but not on the title page. Ernst received \$50 for the foreword and \$100 in legal fees. Cerf assured booksellers in an article in *PW* that the Payne translation combined “the advantages of being complete and of satisfying the sometimes unaccountable whims of the governmental guardians of public morals” (Cerf, “The Modern Library and the Price of Books,” *PW* 119, 14 February 1931, p. 842).  

Sumner did not challenge the ML edition, but *The Decameron* remained a controversial book in some quarters. When a Chicago book wholesaler who specialized in the small town market requested an illustration of a ML jacket for its fall 1932 catalogue, the request specifically noted: “Any title at all will do . . . with the exception of the DECAMERON and the DROLL STORIES” (Wilcox & Follett to ML, 11 August 1932). A ML sales representative in the South who submitted an order for an assortment of titles for the college store of a North Carolina women’s college asked Lewis Miller, the ML sales manager, to select the books. But he advised: “Leave out Faulkner & Decameron so as not to sully the minds of Southern maidenhood. They love this stuff of course but the faculty raise a stink” (James S. Russell to Miller, 22 September 1940).  

*The Decameron* was the best-selling ML title during the first six months of 1931 (RH box 117, Publicity file). It sold 10,988 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it the first quarter of ML and Giant titles. During the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952 it sold 5,308 copies, retaining its position in the first quarter of ML and Giant titles but ranking a little lower than in the 1940s. Sales totaled 164,904 copies by spring 1958.

The ML began to consider a new translation of *The Decameron* in 1953 when Barry Ulanov of Barnard College submitted a six-page sample translation. Stein sent Ulanov’s sample to a number of readers but the response was generally unfavorable. Several readers suggested Frances Winwar’s translation as the best available. Stein wrote Winwar in December to express interest in using her translation (Stein to Winwar, 22 December 1953). She subsequently sent ten pages of revisions that were incorporated into the ML edition.

> Front flap:<br> *Lord Jim* is by all odds the most popular novel by Joseph Conrad, as well as one of the most exciting adventure stories ever written. It is the story of a heroic man victimized by his own integrity. Conrad wrote an admirer “I will have no favorites, but I do not feel grieved that you prefer ‘*Lord Jim*’ to all my other books. I won’t even say that ‘I fail to understand’ . . .” (*Spring 1936*)  

Originally published in U.S. by Doubleday & McClure Co., 1900. New bibliographical edition published in Doubleday, Doran & Co.’s Sun Dial Library (1928), *The Malay Edition of the Works of Joseph Conrad* (1929), and possibly elsewhere. ML edition (pp. [iii], [vii]–417) printed from Sun Dial Library/Malay Edition plates with decorations in the Malay Edition omitted from pp. [iii–iv] and [1–2] of ML printings. Published February 1931. *WR* 21 March 1931. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1973/74.  

*Lord Jim* was the first of eleven Sun Dial Library titles added to the ML after Cerf and Klopfer bought the Doubleday series in 1930. The ML paid Doubleday, Doran royalties of 10 cents a copy.  

The Doubleday contract authorizing the ML reprint mistakenly included Canadian rights. British publishers normally retained Canadian rights when they sold rights in the U.S. market, as did American publishers when they sold British rights. The ML’s Canadian distributor, the Macmillan Co. of Canada, sold *Lord Jim* for five months before Blackwood and Sons, Conrad’s British publisher, became aware of the transgression. Blackwood’s protested to Doubleday, and the ML stopped selling *Lord Jim* in Canada. But Cerf was irritated; after Canadian sales were halted he wrote, “This should satisfy those English bastards” (Daniel Longwell, Doubleday, Doran to Klopfer, 25 August 1931; Cerf to Longwell, 4 September 1931).  

*Lord Jim* sold 9,450 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it thirty-ninth out of 281 ML and Giant titles. Conrad’s *Victory* (238) sold 7,335 copies during the same period. Sales of *Lord Jim* totaled 115,000 copies by 1949. By the early 1950s Conrad was one of the best-selling authors in the ML. *Lord Jim* sold 8,669 copies during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952, making it the 11th best-selling title in the regular ML; *Victory* was the 15th best-selling title. *Nostromo* (438), published in November 1951, appears to have lagged behind Conrad’s other titles; it did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML at this period.

> Front flap revised:<br> Perhaps the most popular of all his novels, *Lord Jim* is undoubtedly Joseph Conrad’s most exciting adventure story. Its theme of a heroic man victimized by his own integrity and destroyed by his sense of lost honor is one of the most appealing in the literature of idealism. All the powers of a great descriptive artist and a thinker concerned with courage and devotion and the crises of conscience are lavished upon this tale of a man who stakes his life on a high principle and loses. “I will have no favorites,” Conrad wrote to an admirer, “but I do not feel grieved that you prefer *Lord Jim* to all my other books.” (*Spring 1955*)

> Front flap:<br> Concededly the most important autobiography that has yet been written in America, *The Education of Henry Adams* has exercised an enormous influence upon a generation now coming into its full maturity. An edition of one hundred copies, printed privately in 1907, had aroused profound admiration among scholars. When it was published in 1918, it immediately won and has since held an assured place among the significant works in American literature. This chronicle of a brilliant career and a constant spiritual quest is one of our great national literary treasures. (*Spring 1936*)  

*Jacket B:* Pictorial in vivid reddish orange (34), deep red (13) and gold on coated white paper with inset portrait of a young Henry Adams in deep red within a gold frame with city buildings outside frame at left and right; borders in gold, title in reverse on front panel, other lettering in deep red, all against vivid reddish orange background. Designed by Paul Galdone, April 1938; unsigned. 

> Front flap as jacket A. (*Spring 1938*)  

Privately printed by Adams in an edition of 100 copies, 1907. Trade edition published by Houghton Mifflin Co., 1918, shortly after Adams’s death. New bibliographical edition (“Popular Edition”) published 1927 and reprinted in Houghton Mifflin’s Riverside Library, 1928. ML edition (pp. [v]–517) printed from Popular Edition/Riverside Library plates. Published March 1931. *WR* 28 March 1931. First printing: 8,000 copies. Discontinued 1978/79.  

*The Education of Henry Adams* was one of the first titles Cerf tried to get after he and Klopfer bought the ML. At that time the original edition was still selling too well for Houghton Mifflin to consider a reprint edition (Robert Linscott, Houghton Mifflin, to Cerf, 25 August 1925). By 1930 Houghton Mifflin was willing to consider a ML reprint. Cerf assumed that the work would have to be reset since the plates of the original edition were far too large for the ML’s format, and he told Houghton Mifflin that the cost of making new plates would have to be taken into account in any reprint agreement (Cerf to Roger L. Scaife, Houghton Mifflin, 1 August 1930). He then learned that Houghton Mifflin had reset the book in a smaller format. After examining it he noted, “It will be a very tight squeeze and will not make a book we can be very proud of” (Cerf to Scaife, 11 August 1930).  

He offered a \$3,000 advance against royalties of 12 cents a copy—two cents more, he noted, than any other reprint house paid for nonfiction—and the offer was accepted (Scaife to Cerf, 4 August 1930; Cerf to Scaife, 11 August 1930; Scaife to Cerf, 12 August 1930). Cerf did not realize that the ML would be sharing the market with the one-dollar Riverside Library edition. Two weeks later Houghton Mifflin reduced the advance to \$2,500 against royalties of 10 cents a copy (Scaife to Cerf, 27 August 1930). The royalty was increased in the 1950s to 10 percent of the list price. James Truslow Adams received \$50 for writing the introduction (Cerf to Adams, 22 October 1930).  

Scaife complimented Cerf on the appearance of the Modern Library edition: “You have done remarkably well, considering the size of the plates, in making it an attractive volume” (Scaife to Cerf, 8 April 1931). When the ML switched to printing by offset lithography in the mid 1960s the type page was reduced photographically by about 4 mm.  

Later in 1931 Cerf and Klopfer ordered a single printing of *The Education of Henry Adams* in the format of the new ML Giants series. Around the same time they bought the remaining stock of a special printing of Young’s *The Medici* in the same format that had been made for Charles Boni earlier in the year. It was also bound in the style of the first three Giants, except the imprint on the spine identified the publisher as Charles Boni. The books were printed in editions of 1,500 each and were marketed to department stores as dollar “specials.”  

*The Education of Henry Adams* was the thirteenth best-selling ML title during the first six months of 1931 (RH box 117, Publicity file). It sold 6,932 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it high in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles. During the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952 it climbed into the first quarter of ML and Giant titles with sales of 5,782 copies.

> Front flap:<br> “Few books have had so unexpected success as *The Education of Henry Adams*. Printing the manuscript privately in 1907 in an edition of one hundred copies only for distribution among his friends, the author declined to allow the book to be published during his lifetime. He bequeathed the copyright, however, to the Massachusetts Historical Society, and in 1918, about six months after his death, the first published edition appeared. Although *The Education* had aroused a deep interest among all those who had been able to have access to one of the original copies, few if any would have predicted for it a great popular success. Yet it has already sold more copies than many ‘best sellers,’ and has won an assured place not only among the significant works in American literature but among those which command a wide and steadily enlarging public. Especially among the younger generation, the influence of the book is markedly increasing.” — from the Introduction

> Front flap:<br> “No more savage book was ever written,” says Carl Van Doren of *Gulliver’s Travels*. Far from being the children’s book that simple-minded people have made it, Swift’s fierce satire burns with hatred and revenge. It is a book for adults who must perceive beyond the record of imaginary travels among pygmies and giants an account of mankind in all its silly, vicious and hypocritical posturings. Included in this volume are Swift’s bitter comedies *A Tale of a Tub* and *The Battle of the Books*. (*Fall 1936*)  

ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published March 1931. *WR* 28 March 1931. First printing: Not ascertained. Superseded 1958 by *Gulliver’s Travels and Other Writings* (502).  

The text of *Gulliver’s Travels*, according to the Prefatory Note, “is substantially that of the second edition, with the corrections in Ford’s interleaved copy” (p. v). The text of *Tale of a Tub* and *Battle of the Books* “is based on that of the fifth edition published in 1710. Together with the original notes from this edition are given a few from Hawkesworth’s edition of Swift’s Works (1755–75) and from Sir Walter Scott’s (1814); these are marked respectively with the initial H and S” (p. vi). Van Doren received the ML’s standard \$50 fee for writing the introduction.  

*Gulliver’s Travels, A Tale of a Tub, The Battle of the Books* sold 5,463 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it low in the second quarter of ML and Giant titles. It did not rank among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.

> Front flap:<br> At whatever age *Gulliver’s Travels* may be read, it opens new worlds to the imagination. For the child this chronicle of fabulous travels among pygmies and giants is an adventure in strange encounters and dramatic conflicts. For the adult it is a commentary and revelation on the mind and behavior of mankind in all its frauds and attempts at honesty, its fatuous and earnest struggles to live in some kind of amity and its preposterous posturings. It is fierce satire with rich meanings for every age and circumstance; it is pure fantasy and startling reality that explores and exposes the frailty of man. Included in this volume are Swift’s bitterly ironic comedies *A Tale of a Tub* and *The Battle of the Books*. (*Spring 1951*)  

*Jacket B:* Pictorial in light greenish blue (172) and deep purple (224) on coated white paper with stylized left profile of Gulliver in deep purple with his eye represented by sailing ship and Lilliputian looking up at him from lower left; lettering in reverse and deep purple, background in light greenish blue.

*Jacket:* Pictorial in pale purplish blue (203) and black on coated white paper depicting a horse-drawn caravan; borders and title in reverse, other lettering in black. Signed: J.E.S. (*Spring 1931*)  

> Front flap:<br> Scratch a book seller and you find an evangelist of literature, a quaint idealist and a grim fighter for the holy cause of enlightenment. And who better embodies all the quixotic zeal of the book missionary than Professor Roger Mifflin as he rides through the countryside with his caravan of culture? Pegasus, hitched to his wagon-load of books, carries him and the liberated Helen McGill to adventures and a romance as charming as any on the shelves of his wandering library. (*Spring 1934*)  

Originally published by Doubleday, Page & Co., 1917. ML edition (pp. [1]–190) printed from Doubleday, Doran (and subsequently Lippincott) plates with Morley’s preface, “A Letter to David Grayson, Esq.,” omitted and the dedication omitted in the first printing. Publication initially announced for August 1931. Published March 1931. *WR* 28 March 1931. First printing: 8,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1955.  

*Parnassus on Wheels* was the second of eleven Sun Dial Library titles added to the ML after Cerf and Klopfer bought the Doubleday series in 1930. Cerf and Klopfer planned to include at least one of Morley’s books—*The Haunted Bookshop* was also in the Sun Dial Library—and settled on *Parnassus on Wheels*. Publication was announced for August 1931 but moved forward to March. “The demand for this title has been so great,” Cerf explained, “that there was no point in waiting so long to bring it out, since the plates were already in our possession” (Cerf to Hugh Eayrs, Macmillan Co. of Canada, 21 February 1931). When the ML wrote Doubleday, Doran in December 1937 requesting the plates for a new printing they were informed that the plates and publishing rights had been sold to J. B. Lippincott. Subsequent ML printings were arranged with Lippincott.  

Morley’s novel *Kitty Foyle* was a best-seller in 1939 and 1940 (Hackett and Burke, pp. 127–29), but his popularity appears to have diminished after the United States entered the Second World War. *Parnassus on Wheels* sold 1,814 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, making it the ML’s second worst-selling title. Morley was the only American among the authors of the ML’s ten worst-selling titles—and he had two books in that category. *Human Being* (334), which lasted just over five years in the series, outsold *Parnassus on Wheels* by nearly 300 copies.

> Front flap:<br> Katherine Mansfield’s sharp perceptions of significant detail, her vivid strokes of characterization and her ability so sensitively to merge reality with unreality give to her short stories the qualities of a remembered experience rather than those of a tale merely well told. In this collection are gathered the stories which reflect her spirit as well as her skill. They have been selected with the purpose of conveying the rare artistic integrity and the consuming passion for truth so evident in her life and work. (*Spring 1934*)  

Originally published in U.S. by Alfred A. Knopf, 1922. ML edition (pp. [*5*]–255) printed from Knopf plates. Published April 1931. *WR* 2 May 1931. First printing: 7,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1956.  

Cerf and Klopfer wanted a Mansfield title in the ML and signed a reprint contract with Knopf in October 1929 for *The Dove’s Nest*, paying a \$500 advance. *The Garden Party* was not considered because an inexpensive reprint was already available in the Sun Dial Library. When the ML bought the Sun Dial Library from Doubleday in 1930, Knopf agreed to cancel the contract for *The Dove’s Nest* so that the ML could include the more popular title. The ML increased the advance to \$700 against royalties of 10 cents a copy (Cerf to Knopf, 30 October 1930). The royalty rate was adjusted to 10 percent of the list price in 1947 when the ML increased its list price to \$1.25 (Klopfer to Knopf, Inc., 9 June 1947).  

*The Garden Party* had a steady if unspectacular sale in the ML. There were printings of 2,000 copies each in 1933, 1934, 1935, 1936, 1938, 1941, and 1943. When the reprint contract was renewed in 1938 for an additional three years, the ML guaranteed royalties for 5,000 copies during the renewal period (Klopfer to Joseph C. Lesser, Knopf, 15 June 1938). *The Garden Party* sold 3,830 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing in the third quarter of ML titles. It was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular Modern Library during the twelve-month period November 1951–October 1952.

> Front flap:<br> André Gide combines a rich and supple imagination with a conscience that tolerates no squeamishness in the disclosure of the most personal intimacies. The unspeakable has no existence for him; his service to his own truth is constant and uncompromising. Of the thirty distinguished volumes he has published, many of them rare and unobtainable because of their revelations, *The Counterfeiters* is his only novel, and he has avowed in his Journal: “Without reserve, I want to pour into it everything.” The translation is complete and unexpurgated. (*Spring 1936*)  

Bussy translation originally published by Alfred A. Knopf, 1927. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published May 1931. *WR* 23 May 1931. First printing: 6,000 copies. Discontinued fall 1946. *The Counterfeiters* with *Journal of the Counterfeiters* published spring 1962 (see 216.2).  

Cerf approached Knopf in 1929 about a ML edition of *The Counterfeiters*, offering a \$700 advance against royalties of 7 cents a copy on the first 10,000 copies with royalties to rise to 10 cents a copy thereafter. The reduced initial royalty (amounting to \$300) was intended to cover half of the cost of making new plates (Cerf to Knopf, 18 July 1929). The original Knopf plates were too wide for the ML’s 6½ x 4¼ inch (164 x 107 mm) trim size.  

Knopf did not object to a ML edition, but he thought a 1930 publication date was too soon and asked Cerf to take it up with him again the following year. He indicated that the ML could have Gide’s *Lafcadio’s Adventures*, which he described as “an even more amusing book,” in spring 1930, but Cerf preferred to wait for *The Counterfeiters* (Knopf to Cerf, 22 July 1929; Cerf to Knopf, 24 July 1929). The terms of the final reprint contract have not been ascertained but were probably similar to what Cerf proposed in 1929. When the contract came up for renewal in 1939, Cerf indicated that he would like to keep *The Counterfeiters* in the ML: “This is a book that doesn’t sell in any spectacular fashion, but it is a nice one for us to have” (Cerf to Knopf, 24 October 1939).  

*The Counterfeiters* sold 5,205 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it high in the third quarter of ML and Giant sales.

> Front flap:<br> The history of world literature during the first half of the twentieth century is now being written. Among the novels of that era a small handful seem assured of permanence. They are Thomas Mann’s *The Magic Mountain*, James Joyce’s *Ulysses*, Marcel Proust’s *Remembrance of Things Past*, and—without question—André Gide’s *The Counterfeiters*. Dorothy Bussy’s excellent translation of *Les Faux-Monnayeurs* was first published in 1927. To this edition of *The Counterfeiters* has been added the first English translation (by Justin O’Brien, well-known authority on Gide and translator of the *Journals of André Gide*) of the daybook kept by Gide while writing the novel. This Journal of “The Counterfeiters” (*Journal des Faux-Monnayeurs*) supplies a unique view into the mind of a great novelist at work. (*Spring 1962*)  

Originally published by Alfred A. Knopf, 1951, with *The Counterfeiters* printed from plates of the 1927 Knopf edition and *Journal of “The Counterfeiters”* printed from a new typesetting. ML edition (pp. [*5*]–432) printed from Knopf plates. Published spring 1962. *WR* 4 June 1962. First printing: Not ascertained. Also published in Vintage Books, February 1973.  

Sixteen years after the original ML edition was discontinued, *The Counterfeiters* was restored to the ML in a single volume with Gide’s *Journal of “The Counterfeiters*.” In 1971 the ML was paying royalties of 8 cents a copy to Knopf.

Pinkerton translation originally published in U.S. by B. W. Huebsch, 1914, using sheets of the British edition published by Martin Secker. New bibliographical edition published by Viking Press with preface by Ernest Boyd, 1926. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published July 1931. *WR* 15 August 1931. First (and only) printing: 6,000 copies. Discontinued fall 1935.  

The ML paid Viking an \$800 advance against royalties of 8 cents a copy. The ML had to reset the text because the Viking plates were too large for its format.  

Sales in 1931 totaled 3,684 copies, of which standing orders and other advance sales accounted for 2,238 copies. Sales during the first six months of 1932 totaled 242 copies. Cerf attributed the decline to competition from an unauthorized one-dollar reprint in a format larger than the ML’s. The edition published by the Illustrated Editions Co. in 1932 featured illustrations by Cameron Wright and was over three inches taller than the ML edition.  

The ML reprinted *Sanine* on the mistaken assumption that Viking Press owned the copyright. The manufacturing clause of the 1891 Copyright Act restricted American copyright to books that were manufactured in the U.S., and Huebsch’s use of British sheets in 1914 had cast *Sanine* irretrievably into the U.S. public domain. Cerf recognized that the unauthorized edition was not Viking’s fault, but he asked Harold Guinzburg, the president of Viking Press, if some adjustment could be made. He indicated that the ML had paid an advance on 10,000 copies and would not be reprinting (Cerf to Guinzburg, 14 November 1932). Cerf suggested an allowance of \$240 but emphasized that the decision was entirely up to Viking Press. Guinzburg noted that half of the advance had been paid to Martin Secker, the English publisher of the Pinkerton translation, but he promised to lift some of the burden from the ML’s shoulders and indicated that he would also try to sell the ML’s plates (Guinzburg to Cerf, 6 December 1932). Secker had no use for the plates, and Viking Press paid the sum Cerf suggested as a rebate for unsold copies (Guinzburg to Klopfer, 25 January 1933).

> Front flap:<br> Of all the distinguished novels written by Willa Cather, none has brought her greater prestige or a wider circle of readers than *Death Comes for the Archbishop*. This historical chronicle of the apostolic mission of Father Latour in the frontier Southwest among the Hopi and Navajo Indians is a romance of faith and invincible simplicity. Its rich humanity and its stirring account of the tenacity of a race giving way to the inevitable make it a memorable book to readers of every shade of religious conviction and literary taste. (*Spring 1935*)  

Originally published by Alfred A. Knopf, 1927. ML edition (pp. [*5*]–303) printed from Knopf plates with fly title omitted. Published September 1931. *WR* 19 September 1931. First printing: 15,000 copies. Discontinued spring 1937. Restored to ML, 1984.  

Willa Cather was one of the first authors that Cerf and Klopfer tried to include in the ML after they acquired the series from Horace Liveright. Cerf approached Houghton Mifflin in August 1925 about Cather’s *My Ántonia* or *The Song of the Lark*, offering royalties of eight cents a copy for the former or six cents for the latter. Robert Linscott, who was then at Houghton Mifflin, declined the offer. Four years later they approached Alfred A. Knopf about a ML reprint of *Death Comes for the Archbishop*, offering royalties of twelve cents a copy for a ML reprint.  

The ML paid Knopf a \$4,200 advance against royalties of 12 cents a copy. The advance sale was the largest the ML had ever had (Cerf to Hugh Eayrs, Macmillan Co. of Canada, 2 September 1931). Subsequent ML printings were as follows: 10,000 copies (November 1931), 5,000 copies (December 1932), 4,000 copies (July 1933), 5,000 copies (January 1934), 5,000 copies (August 1934), and 15,000 copies (June 1935). Sales of the ML edition during its first five years totaled 49,488 copies as follows: 14,309 copies; 11,842 copies; 7,935 copies; 7,492 copies; and 7,910 copies (Cerf to Kenneth Roberts, 23 November 1938).  

After the ML edition was published Cather decided that she did not want any of her books to be available in reprint editions, and she asked Knopf not to renew the ML contract when it expired in 1936. The terms of the contract were vague about the disposal of books remaining in stock after the contract expired, and Knopf, acting on Cather’s behalf, indicated that he hoped that sales could be discontinued after September 25th (Knopf to Klopfer, 9 June 1936). Klopfer suggested the following:  

In reading over the contract, it seems to me that it is open to so much dual interpretation that the best thing we had better try to do is to use common sense. We have a little over 8,000 copies of DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP in stock, or about a six months’ supply. It seems to me that it would be much more advantageous to Miss Cather, and certainly infinitely preferable from our point of view, to keep the book in the Modern Library through the Fall season, when we will undoubtedly sell out all of our copies at the regular price. The other alternative would be for us to remainder these copies before the 25th of September and I frankly would hate to do that, because it would probably mean having them placed all around the country at a remainder price. I don’t believe we are asking too much to be allowed to sell out the balance of this edition in our normal way, withdrawing the book from our list at the end of the year. Don’t you think that is the most sensible solution to the ambiguity of the wording of the contract? . . . It is with the utmost regret that we are being compelled to give up the reprint rights to DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP. Both Bennett and I feel very strongly that we would do anything within reason to renew this contract with you, but as you have explained how Miss Cather feels on the subject, there doesn’t seem to be anything more to say (Klopfer to Knopf, 10 June 1936).  

Knopf accepted Klopfer’s proposal. “I shall pass the good word—good from her point of view, I mean—on to Miss Cather” (Knopf to Klopfer, 11 June 1936). Sales appear to have continued past the end of 1936. *Death* *Comes* *for* *the* *Archbishop* was listed in the ML’s spring 1937 catalogue, but the ML edition was out of stock by May 1937 (Klopfer to Eayrs, 28 May 1937).  

In 1971, twenty-four years after Cather’s death, Random House, which had acquired Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., in 1960, published *Death Comes for the Archbishop* in its paperback series Vintage Books.

> Front flap:<br> Widely regarded as Willa Cather’s masterpiece, *Death Comes For The Archbishop* is set in the mid-19th century. Two French missionaries—Jaen Marie Latour and Joseph Vaillant—make their way into the harsh, unexplored, mountainous region of New Mexico in the hope of revivifying there the religion that had been brought by Spanish priests and then left to decay in the hands of an insubordinate and materialistic clergy. Father Latour, first bishop of the diocese, knows how to win the confidence of the Indians and to become a father indeed to the Mexicans. Slowly and firmly he gains control of the padres of the region, gradually replacing the slothful with men stamped by his own ardor. The cathedral that he builds in Santa Fe, using the stones of the region so that it will fit into its surroundings, is the crown of his missionary labor, in which he has succeeded in harmonizing two elements: the Catholic religion and the New Mexican way of life. “There is a great, a very great, love story in Miss Cather’s masterly quiet narrative. It is a severe, purely designed chalice of handbeaten silver, filled to the brim with the white essential wine of love. . . .” — *Saturday Review*

> Front flap:<br> The Borgian era, with all its excesses of lust and murder, its monstrous villainies and strange benevolences, is here unfolded in a tapestry of unrestrained color and animation. Frederick Baron Corvo, that unpredictable celebrant of Black Masses and practitioner of bizarre literary heresies, depicts the unbridled licence of the 15th Century with a demoniacal vision and an incandescent brilliance of metaphor. *A History of the Borgias* throws new light on the myths and legends surrounding one of the vilest and most glittering reigns of human depravity. (*Spring 1934*)  

Originally published in U.S. as *Chronicles of the House of Borgia* by E. P. Dutton, 1901, using sheets of the English edition. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting with the Leslie introduction added and the bibliography, appendices, and illustrations from the original edition omitted. (The ML table of contents erroneously lists appendices.) Published September 1931. *WR* 19 September 1931. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1 January 1960.  

The ML edition was the first to be set in type and printed in the U.S. Leslie’s introduction, a general study of the life and work of Frederick Rolfe, “Baron Corvo,” originally appeared as the introduction to Corvo’s *In His Own Image* (Knopf, 1925) and was reprinted by arrangement with Knopf. The ML omitted several paragraphs of Leslie’s text and altered the sentence beginning, “*Hadrian VII* is Rolfe’s masterpiece . . .” to “*Hadrian VII* with the possible exception of the Book on the Borgias is Rolfe’s masterpiece . . .” (ML, p. xxi).  

Printings of the ML edition reached 36,000 copies by June 1954 (Woolf, *Bibliography of Frederick Rolfe, Baron Corvo*, p. 46). *A History of the Borgias* sold 2,718 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the fourth quarter of ML and Giant titles. It was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period, November 1951–October 1952.

English translation by George Robert Sims originally published in London, 1874. Early editions did not identify the translator, and the ML edition, printed from plates made from a new typesetting, did not identify the translator either. Published October 1931. *WR* 7 November 1931. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1970/71.  

The translator states that “although *Les Cent Contes Drolatiques* were completed and published in 1837, the present is the first English version ever brought before the public” (Translator’s Preface, p. xi). Klopfer was unaware of the translator’s identity. He noted, “The book isn’t copyrighted in this country, but I cannot tell you who did the translation. It is passable” (Klopfer to Allen Lane, John Lane, The Bodley Head, 20 October 1931).

Shortly after editing *Four Famous Greek Plays* (178), Paul Landis, professor of English at the University of Illinois, reminded Cerf that they had talked about a volume of Corneille and Racine to serve as a companion to Molière’s *Plays* (110). “The need for such a book becomes more and more urgent, but I have combed the existing translations pretty thoroughly and have found none nearly good enough to justify reprinting” (Landis to Cerf, 20 March 1929).

> Front flap:<br> The novel upon which William McFee’s reputation rests most securely is *Casuals of the Sea*. When it appeared, twenty years ago, he was hailed, with Joseph Conrad, as one of the two greatest story-tellers of the sea. Today, his book is read with undiminished enthusiasm by a new generation of readers. In it they find the never-ending panorama of the sea as a background for the struggle of men in ships against the forces of nature and man’s will. (*Spring 1936*)  

Originally published in U.S. by Doubleday, Page & Co., 1916. ML edition printed from plates owned by Doubleday, Doran that were made from a new typesetting. Published November 1931. *WR* 5 December 1931. First printing: 8,000 copies. Discontinued 1 January 1954.  

Cerf expressed interest in including one of McFee’s books in the ML in January 1926, but Doubleday, Page turned him down. He was particularly interested in *Captain Macedoine’s Daughter*, but McFee appears to have been opposed to having any of his books in the ML. Later that year Cerf invited McFee to write an introduction to Hudson’s *Purple Land* (134) and indicated that he would like to meet with him to discuss the possibility of a ML edition of one of his books (Cerf to McFee, 26 August 1926; McFee to Cerf, 28 August 1926). Two of McFee’s novels, *Casuals of the Sea* and *Command*, were in the Sun Dial Library, which the ML bought in 1930 from Garden City Publishing Co., the Doubleday reprint subsidiary. Cerf and Klopfer initially planned to include both novels, but in the end only *Casuals of the Sea* was added.  

Morley’s introduction to *Casuals of the Sea* was originally for the Lambskin Library edition published by Doubleday, Page in 1922.  

The ML paid Doubleday, Doran a \$1,500 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy. A second printing was not required until May 1936 when there was a printing of 1,000 copies.  

*Casuals of the Sea* sold 3,588 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it low in the third quarter of ML and Giant titles. Total ML printings reached 20,000 copies by November 1945. It was not among the 100 best-selling titles in the regular ML during the twelve-month period, November 1951–October 1952.  

When Doubleday, Doran suggested a ML edition of *Command* in 1933, Cerf responded, “Personally, I think COMMAND is McFee’s most exciting book, but [it] seems . . . that the old boy’s stature has diminished somewhat in the eyes of the public in the past few years” (Robert de Graff to Cerf, 24 November 1933; Cerf to de Graff, 27 November 1933). In 1946 Doubleday, Doran reverted all rights in *Casuals of the Sea* to McFee and sold him the plates for \$70. The ML signed a new contract with McFee and paid him \$70 for the plates. Half of McFee’s royalties were to be applied toward amortization of the cost of the plates; once the plates were paid for, McFee was to receive full royalties of 10 cents a copy (Maule to McFee, 7 October 1946).

> Front flap:<br> After centuries, the derisive phrase “It’s a Marco Polo,” to indicate a gross exaggeration, has been revised to convey the highest tribute for accuracy and veracity.

The record of his adventures and explorations is as fabulous as the truth. His is a travel book that time has substantiated. Readers have enjoyed it with a zest worthy of the Venetian nomad himself.

> Front flap:<br> Since H. G. Wells wrote *Tono-Bungay*, his forays into prophecy and history have made him world famous. Yet it is doubtful whether his later fame was as firmly grounded as the first spontaneous outburst of acclaim given to *Tono-Bungay*. With its appearance, H. G. Wells forced immediate recognition as a major figure in contemporary English letters. Neither time nor all the subsequent writings of the prolific and indefatigable Mr. Wells has dimmed the sparkle and vivacity of this chronicle of chicanery and human credulity. (*Fall 1933*)  

Originally published in U.S. by Duffield & Co., 1909. ML edition (225.1, pp. [*5-6*], [1]–460) printed from Duffield & Green plates. Published December 1931. *WR* 26 December 1931. First printing: 6,000 copies. Discontinued 1970/71.  

Cerf expressed interest in *Tono-Bungay* in 1929 when he offered Duffield & Green a \$3,000 advance against royalties of 10 cents a copy. He indicated that the offer would stand indefinitely, and these appear to be the terms under which the ML edition was published two years later. The plates became the property of Dodd, Mead & Co. when Dodd, Mead bought Duffield & Green in 1934.  

By June 1936 ML printings totaled 12,000 copies and sales totaled 10,675 copies. *Tono-Bungay* sold 4,382 copies during the eighteen-month period May 1942–October 1943, placing it in the third quarter of ML and Giant titles.

An internal RH memo (Regina Spirito to Manny Harper, 5 May 1945) indicates that new plates were being made for *Tono-Bungay* along with Maugham’s *Of Human Bondage* (199), Buck’s *The Good Earth* (266) and Maugham’s *Moon and Sixpence* (283). By eliminating running heads, printing more text on each page, and beginning new chapters on the same page as the ending of the preceding chapter, the total number of pages of *Tono-Bungay* was reduced from 460 to 400. Although Germany surrendered to the Allies the day before Spirito’s memo was written, the war with Japan continued for another four months. Publishers were subjected to increasingly severe paper rationing during the Second World War, and the crowded typesetting is typical of many books of the period. It is not clear why the table of contents is paginated xix–xii.  

The new typesetting of *The Good Earth* was also about 60 pages shorter than the earlier edition. *Of Human Bondage* was only 6 pages shorter, and the new typesetting of *Moon and Sixpence* was 27 pages longer.

> Front flap:<br> The revolutionary change of attitude toward sex within the last two decades has given great impetus to scientific investigation into a subject which had been taboo for centuries. This volume brings together the most modern and enlightened views of men whose knowledge and authority are internationally recognized. Havelock Ellis, Sigmund Freud, Bertrand Russell, C. G. Jung, Franz Boas and Alfred Adler, to name only a few of the contributors, are represented in a symposium as candidly outspoken about sex as it is comprehensive and accurate. (*Spring 1937*)

> Front flap:<br> Merejkowski’s famous historical trilogy, collectively entitled *Christ and Anti-Christ*, begins with the volume *The Death of the Gods* (No. 153), continues with the biographical novel, *The Romance of Leonardo Da Vinci* (No. 138), and comes to a conclusion with *Peter and Alexis*. Each panel of this triptych is complete and self-contained, yet it links together three epochal periods of world history: the 4th century, the Renaissance and 18th century Russia. *Peter and Alexis* becomes the climax of the entire work and thus one of Merejkowski’s most absorbing novels. (*Fall 1935*)  

Originally published in U.S. as *The Romance of Peter the Great* by G. P. Putnam’s Sons, 1906, in a different translation. Guerney’s translation was commissioned and originally published by the ML. Publication originally announced for August 1930. Published December 1931. *WR* not found. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1 January 1941.  

The ML edition was published more than a year after its announced publication date. Guerney (as usual) took longer than he anticipated to complete the translation, and Cerf (as usual) expressed frustration and irritation at the delay. Cerf indicated hopefully in February 1931 that the translation was almost finished and that the book should be ready around the first of May (Cerf to Crowder, 11 February 1931). Ten days later he noted, “We have had a lot of trouble having the translation of this book completed” (Cerf to Hugh Eayrs, Macmillan Co. of Canada, 21 February 1931). A letter in June indicated, “. . . at present we do not know when it will be finished and ready for publication” (ML to John D. Rollo, Macmillan Co. of Canada, 9 June 1931).
