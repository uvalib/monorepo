# MODERN LIBRARY SERIES 1957 

## 1957 

### General 

As costs rose steadily in the years following the war, retail prices inevitably had to be increased. Publishers at this period, however, feared adverse public reaction to higher prices and generally held off raising prices until the inroads into their profit margins left them no alternative. The \$1.25 price for the regular Modern Library volumes remained in effect for seven years, from April 1947 through March 1954. It increased to \$1.45 on 1 April 1954. Less than three years later, on 1 January 1957, the price rose again, this time to \$1.65. 

As long as the ninety-five cent price for the regular Modern Library volumes remained in effect—as it did for more than twenty-five years—the Modern Library’s reprint contracts specified a royalty of so many cents per copy. Royalties were not expressed in terms of a percentage of the retail price. When retail prices began to rise, authors and publishers to whom these royalties were paid began to ask whether their royalties were going to be increased as well. The Modern Library established no general policy on this issue. Whenever possible, royalties continued to be paid at the old rate. They were increased on an ad hoc basis only when pressure from individual authors and publishers left no alternative. 

In 1957, among those who petitioned Random House for an increase in royalties were Arthur Pell of Liveright and Arthur Thornhill, Jr. of Little, Brown. Both were successful in their petitions. 

Random House’s printed contracts for its own authors included a clause concerning the royalty to be paid should the work later be issued in the Modern Library. During the early 1950s that royalty changed from a fixed figure to a percentage of the retail price, protecting Random House’s own authors in the event of price increases. 

Sales for the regular Modern Library series, which had been increasing steadily since the mid-1950’s, broke the one-million ($1,024,897) mark for the first time in 1957. 

### Number of titles 

Ten titles were added and six discontinued, bringing the total number of titles to 309. Molière’s *Plays* (1924) and Ibsen’s *Doll’s House, Ghosts, An Enemy of the People* (1917) were superseded. 

### Format 

All new titles were published in the standard 7¼ by 4⅞ inch format with the Blumenthal binding, stained top edges, and Kent endpapers in gray. The binding cloth was red, blue, green or gray with lettering on inset panels in black on the front cover and spine. 

### Price 

\$1.65. The new retail price went into effect on 1 January, along with higher prices for ML Giants and other RH publications such as Landmark Books and *The American College Dictionary*.

Unsigned. 

> Front flap:<br> For more than half a century, readers who favor tales of romantic adventure have found deep and lasting enjoyment in the novels of H. Rider Haggard. Two of his best-known and most popular novels, *She* and *King Solomon’s Mines*, are presented complete and unabridged in this volume. 
> *She* is the strange story of an immortal white sorceress deep inside Africa, sought out by an Englishman intent upon avenging an ancient crime, thrillingly told against a backdrop of a lost civilization, of savage rites, and the mystery of an unknown land. 
> *King Solomon’s Mines* is an account of the search for the fabled lost diamond mines and treasures of King Solomon—an unforgettable story of suspense-filled adventures. (*Spring 1957*) 

*King Solomon’s Mines* originally published in London by Cassell & Co., 1885; *She* originally published in London by Longmans, Green & Co., 1887. ML edition printed from plates made from a new typesetting. Published April 1957. *WR* 29 April 1957. First printing: 6,000 copies. Discontinued 1970/71. 

*King Solomon’s Mines* and *She* were published in the U.S. several years before the U.S. Copyright Act of 1891 extended the possibility of copyright protection to works by foreign authors, and both were permanently in the U.S. public domain. Both works appeared in the U.S. in numerous unauthorized editions. 

Cerf had discussed including *She* or *King Solomon’s Mines* in the ML in 1930, but no decision was reached at that time (Cerf to J. Ray Peck, Longmans, Green, 25 September 1930; Peck to Cerf, 30 September 1930).

> Front flap:<br> Few figures in the history of man have had more to do with the shaping of our present civilization than Julius Caesar. A towering political leader, a military genius, and a skilled writer, he deserves a fate better than that of being a subject of an unwilling schoolboy’s Latin lesson. Those readers who have long forgotten their Latin will find in this book new and sound perspectives on this important man, for there are few books that provide a better, more interesting picture of mankind at a historic crossroad.

> Front flap:<br> As more and more we look westward across the Pacific, the writings of James A. Michener take on increased interest and importance as informative, compassionate guides to understanding Asia in flux. 
> The magnificently rich and profound past of the Far East is woven through the uncertain and hope-filled present of the peoples of Asia—all skillfully reflected in the novels, stories, and essays by Michener. No one’s knowledge of that part of our world is complete without the advantages of Michener’s remarkable skill as an observer, his insight into the nature of people, his broad perspective of Asia in rebirth. 
> In this volume are selections from *Tales of the South Pacific*, *Return to Paradise*, *The Voice of Asia*, and the complete text of *The Bridges at Toko-Ri*. (*Spring 1957*) 

Original ML collection selected from *Tales of the South Pacific* (Macmillan, 1947), *Return to Paradise* (RH, 1951), and *The Voice of Asia* (RH, 1951), with the complete text of *The Bridges of Toko-ri* (RH, 1953). Published April 1957. *WR* 29 April 1957. First printing: 7,500 copies. Discontinued 1986. 

In the Foreword to the ML edition Michener notes that the first edition of his first book, *Tales of the South Pacific*, “shows how little the publisher and I thought of its prospects. We knew it didn’t stand a chance, so we published it on the cheapest paper available, with the poorest binding, and in order to save a few cents we didn’t even start new chapters at the tops of new pages” (p. vii). He also states: 

> One important change has been made in the text here offered, and another of equal importance has been evaded. When I first wrote about Asia I was not aware that citizens of that continent, because of long humiliation by white men, had grown to despise and resent the word *Asiatic* when used to describe themselves. I have changed this word to *Asian*. Nor did I know that citizens of China resent with perhaps even greater fervor the word *Chinaman*. After my first several books appeared I formed close friendships with many Chinese and learned what I had not known before. In various places in this reissue of my work I have corrected this offensive word to *Chinese*; but in certain stories in which local idiom is employed in narrating a story, I have retained the original term. If I were rewriting these stories today, I would not use the word except where dialogue required (pp. x–xi). 

Michener moved from Macmillan to Random House after the publication of *Tales of the South Pacific*. He signed with Random House on 19 April 1948 (Cerf Diary; information supplied by Gayle Feldman, 30 August 2010). His second book, *The Fires of Spring*, was published by Random House in 1949, and he remained with the firm for the rest of his long and highly successful career. In a condolence letter to the widow of Saxe Commins, his editor at Random House, Michener states that he chose the firm “because I liked Saxe and because Random House had the guts to use a Negro girl as their receptionist. Whatever money Random House has made from my writing is credited to those two facts” (Michener to Dorothy Commins, 11 March 1970; Saxe Commins Papers, Box 6, Princeton University Library). The receptionist, Betty Lee March, is shown in a 1946 photograph of the entrance hall of the Random House offices at Madison Avenue and 51st Street (“Random House Moves into an Old Mansion,” *PW*, 13 July 1946, p. 174). 

Inconsistencies in the capitalization of *The Bridges at Toko-ri* are reproduced. Michener spells “Toko-ri” with a lower case “r.” The 494a jacket flap (spring 1957) refers to the title as “The Bridges of Toko-Ri”; the 494c jacket flap (1978) uses the spelling “Toko-ri.”

*Jacket:* Pictorial in black, vivid red (11), brilliant yellow (83), strong orange (50) and light grayish yellowish brown (79) on coated white paper with Thurber drawing of couple viewed through a keyhole; title lettering in vivid red, brilliant yellow, strong orange and light grayish yellowish brown, other lettering in reverse and brilliant yellow, all against black background. 

> Front flap:<br> Anyone who tries to define the unique genius of James Thurber is bound to end up in contradictory phrases. Even the rarely-at-a-loss-for-words *London Times* concluded a long discussion of his humor in helpless frustration, saying, “Thurber is Thurber.” 
> Perhaps it is best for us to state simply that this is a collection of some of his best writings and drawings. We believe every reader will share our opinion that Thurber is - - - well, is Thurber. (*Fall 1957*) 

Originally published by Harper & Bros., 1945. ML edition (pp. [1]–369) printed from offset plates photographically reduced from the Harper edition with Thurber’s dedication and foreword omitted, table of contents partially reset, and the preface on pp. 9–11 updated, re-titled (from “My Fifty Years with James Thurber”) and reset. The drawing on the title page is shifted from the half title of the Harper edition. Published November 1957. *WR* 2 December 1957. First printing: 15,000 copies. 

Cerf had been trying to get *The Thurber Carnival* since 1946, when he offered a \$6,000 advance to include it in the Giants (Cerf to William Rose, Jr., Harper & Bros., 24 January 1946). Harper’s finally offered the ML reprint rights as part of an inducement for Cerf to edit *Reading for Pleasure*, an anthology published by Harper & Bros. in 1957. As Cerf told it, “Harper’s have been after me to do this book for them for a long, long time, and they finally threw in a piece of bait that I found irresistible: a long-withheld permission to do Huxley’s BRAVE NEW WORLD and Thurber’s CARNIVAL in the Modern Library. Both of these books I have been pleading for in vain for years, so when the offer came, I melted” (Cerf to Irwin Shaw, 27 August 1956). The ML paid royalties of 10 percent of the retail price. *Brave New World* (485) was published in the ML in fall 1956. 

Bowden (p. 60) notes that the ML’s offset plates were made from state D of the Harper typesetting, which was printed by the Book-of-the-Month Club using duplicate plates supplied by Harper & Bros. In his list of variations that distinguish state D (p. 55), however, the nose of the dog on the fly title (p. [1]) is indicated as absent. The dog’s nose is present in all ML printings examined. 

Thurber’s original preface was titled “My Fifty Years with James Thurber” and dated “December 6, 1944.” The re-titled preface in the ML edition, “My Sixty Years with James Thurber,” is identical to the original version except for changes in the first and next-to-last paragraphs.

Original ML anthology. Published November 1957. *WR* 2 December 1957. First printing: Not ascertained. Discontinued 1971/72. 

Stein had been considering an anthology like *Medieval Romances* for several years. In 1952 he wrote Haskell Block of the University of Wisconsin, “In a very tentative way I have thought of the possibility of our doing a little collection of epic and romance in the Modern Library some day. I don’t know whether such a thing would ever go, but I have been asking people for suggestions as to contents . . .” (Stein to Block, 31 October 1952). 

Roger Sherman Loomis and Laura Hibbard Loomis initially received royalties of 5 cents a copy. In 1961, when ML books were selling for \$1.95, Roger Sherman Loomis protested that the 5-cent royalty was based on a retail price of \$1.45. (*Medieval Romances* was published at \$1.65, but the contract may have been signed when the retail price was still \$1.45.) Random House usually rejected requests for higher royalties on these grounds, but the Loomis’s royalties were increased to 10 cents a copy.

>The second paragraph of flap text was updated as follows: “The editors of this book, Roger Sherman Loomis, of Columbia University, and Laura Hibbard Loomis, have skillfully . . . ” (*Fall 1962*) *Note:* The earliest reported printing with Laura Hibbard Loomis’s affiliation omitted is spring 1962. 

When *Medieval Romances* was published both editors were affiliated with Columbia University. After Laura Hibbard Loomis’s death in 1960 her husband may have asked that her affiliation with Columbia University be removed from the title page and jacket. Roger Sherman Loomis’s affiliation with Columbia continued as professor emeritus from his retirement in 1958 until his death in 1966.

> Front flap:<br> “These notebooks,” says the editor in his Introduction, “are the treatment of a man who sought knowledge as a mystic seeks God; the record of a lifetime of observation and speculation, set down in five thousand manuscript pages . . . containing some of the most brilliant and far-ranging deductions that the mind of man has ever conceived.” 
> In this volume, the most absorbing and provocative parts of Da Vinci’s notebooks have been selected and grouped so that the modern reader can pleasurably share the amazement that all readers have felt on first dipping into this remarkable work by one of the most unusual men of all time. (*Fall 1957*) 

Original ML abridgment of *The Notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci*, arranged and translated by Edward MacCurdy and published in U.S. by Reynal & Hitchcock, 1938. ML edition published November 1957. *WR* 2 December 1957. First printing: 5,000 copies. Discontinued 1970/71. 

Reynal & Hitchcock merged with Harcourt, Brace & Co. after Eugene Reynal’s death in 1946. Linscott approached Harcourt, Brace in the mid 1950s for permission to publish a ML abridgement of *The Notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci* but was turned down. The translation appears to have been in the public domain, and Cerf wrote the following year offering Harcourt, Brace a courtesy fee of \$300 (Cerf to Jovanovich, 29 March 1956). A contract was signed, and the ML edition carries the statement, “Published by arrangement with Harcourt, Brace and Company” (p. [iv]). 

The translator Edward MacCurdy sometimes used the spelling McCurdy (OCLC authority record \#1622156). Linscott received a flat fee of \$1,350 for abridging the text and editing the ML edition. He told Cerf that the project was about twice the work he anticipated because of the poor editing of the complete edition. 

*The Notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci* was the first abridgment that Linscott made for the ML after his retirement from Random House. The others were Vasari’s *Lives of the Most Eminent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects* (1959: 515) and *The Journals of Ralph Waldo Emerson* (1960: 520).
