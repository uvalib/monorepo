## DEFINITIONS AND ABBREVIATIONS 

**anthology**: A volume consisting of the works of multiple authors  

**authorial paratext**: *See* paratext.  

**B&L**: Boni & Liveright  

**backstrip**:  Portion of a book jacket that covers the spine and remains visible when a book is shelved between other books. Backstrips of ML jackets commonly displayed the title running vertically toward the foot or bottom of the jacket. Author’s names were usually displayed horizontally at the top of the jacket, and the imprint “Modern Library” appeared horizontally at the foot, along with a Modern Library device. It was also common for titles to be displayed horizontally. The only ML jackets with titles running vertically toward the top were printed in England for the British publisher Hamish Hamilton, who imported a number of ML books in sheets in the late 1930s and sold them with tipped-in title pages and his own bindings and jackets.  

**bibliographical edition**: Bibliographers define all copies of a work printed from a given typesetting as part of the same edition. In the context of the Modern Library, which printed all of its books from plates, an edition can be defined as all copies of a work printed from plates made from the same typesetting. In this bibliography the source of the plates used by the ML is always indicated; thereafter for the sake of convenience this bibliography uses the phrase “Modern Library edition” to refer to families of Modern Library printings made from the same plates.  

**BOMC**: Book-of-the-Month Club  

**c**.: Circa (approximately), used with dates. Example c. 1940  

**cancel, cancellation**: These terms refer to the removal of one or more leaves from a printed book, usually because of errors in the text, censorship, or other legal issues. Canceled leaves are often replaced by newly printed leaves with altered text. Single replacement leaves and inserted folds are usually pasted to the stub of the canceled leaf; inserted gatherings may be sewn in.  

In the collation, canceled leaves are indicated by a minus sign; leaves that are canceled and replaced by newly printed leaves are indicated by the plus/minus sign (±). Leaves that are inserted/added without the cancellation of printed leaves are indicated by a plus sign. Cancels made prior to publication are usually found in all copies of the first printing. The first ML printing of Joyce, *Dubliners* (129.1a) appears to be an example of this. In all copies examined, the first leaf of the introduction to the ML edition has been cut out and replaced by a newly printed leaf.  

Cancels made following publication are usually found in the portion of the printing that remained in the publisher’s warehouse after the problem was discovered. See *Anthology of American Negro Literature* (183.a).  

**Cerf Papers**: Bennett Cerf Papers, Columbia University Rare Book and Manuscript Library.  

**cf**.: Abbreviation for Latin *confer* (compare).  

**chap**.: Chapter  

**cm**: Centimeter or centimeters  

**col**.: Color  

**collation**:  Collation formula  

**collection**:  A volume consisting of multiple works by a single author  

**conjunct**: Two leaves that consist of a single piece of paper folded in half to form two leaves; a sheet printed in octavo format (8 leaves, 16 pages) produces a gathering where the 1st and 8th leaves, the 2nd and 7th leaves, the 3rd and 6th leaves, and the 4th and 5th leaves are conjunct.  

**cont**.: Continue  

**d©**: International copyright symbol; transcribed in bibliographical descriptions when it appears as part of the copyright statement on the verso of the title page.  

**dates**: The date of an event that extends over the course of two or more years is indicated with an en dash, for example 2006–07; the date of an event that cannot be assigned to a specific year is dated as precisely as possible using a slash, for example 2006/07. Approximate dates are indicated by the abbreviation “c.” (circa).  

**dating key**: Beginning in fall 1925, current ML lists for spring or fall of a given year were printed on ML jackets and at the end of many ML books. Lists at the end of ML books were printed as part of the last gathering containing text; lists were not included when the last gathering did not have enough pages to accommodate them. The dating key indicates one title added in each season and one title (preceded by an *x*) that would not be added until the following season and thus makes it possible to date any ML jacket and any ML book that contains a list as having been printed by spring or fall of a given year. Important points to note in using the dating key include the following: (1) ML titles published in January usually have lists from the previous fall; (2) lists were not updated after spring 1967, so books with spring 1967 lists may have been printed later—and did not contain jackets with lists; (3) although jackets can be dated conclusively on the basis of their lists of ML titles, jackets were sometimes switched from one copy of a book to another, so the jacket cannot by itself conclusively date the book inside it, especially when the book has no list of its own. (4) books printed by offset lithography were often made from photographs of earlier editions and cannot be conclusively dated.  

**ed**.: Editor or edited by  

**edition**: A slippery term with multiple meanings. In bibliographical terms, all printings from a given typesetting are part of the same “edition.”  

**edition costs**: Cf. plant costs  

**endpapers**: Distinct from inserted fold. Of two types: paste-down endpaper and free endpaper.  

**first edition**: In popular usage, the first printing of a book. The first printings of most Modern Library titles published after the Boni & Liveright period include the statement “First Modern Library Edition” or “First Modern Library Giant Edition” on the verso of the title page; sometimes “First Printing.” Statement usually removed from the plates after the first printing, sometimes not. ML books printed from offset lithographic plates usually retained the “first” statement on all printings. Apart from transcribing “first” statements on the books, this bibliography refers to first printing as distinct from first edition.  

**fly title**:  Title or short title of a book that follows the preliminaries. The fly title normally lacks a printed page number and is counted as the first page of the text; its verso is usually blank and is counted as the second page of the text. When a fly title leaf is present, the first chapter normally begins on p. 3. In American usage, the fly title is often referred to as a second half title (*Chicago Manual of Style*) while British usage commonly prefers “fly title” (John Carter, *ABC for Book Collectors*). Since the half title is part of the preliminaries and the fly title is part of the text (or body of the text/numbered in Arabic not Roman numerals), I have chosen to distinguish them by using different terms.  

**folio**: A sheet of paper folded to form two leaves or four pages of a book  

**foot**: The bottom of a page; also the bottom of the spine  

**gathering**: Single large piece of paper that has been folded into leaves for binding  

**gravure**:  A type of intaglio printing process, in which an image is engraved onto a rotating copper cylinder.  

**half title**: Title or short title of a book that precedes the title page. Always on recto, usually of first leaf. The half title is part of the preliminaries that precede the body of the text. Cf. fly title.  

**head**: The top of a page; also the top of the spine  

**headline**: A heading consisting of a single line at the top of a page; usually/commonly printed in capital letters. *See also* “running head.”  

**GBN**: Gordon B. Neavill  

**IML**: Illustrated Modern Library, published 1943–48.  

**impression**: A given printing of a book; the term “printing” is used instead of “impression” in this bibliography.  

**imprint**:  Statement at the foot of the title page indicating the name of the publisher and commonly the place of publication. The year of publication may also be included in the imprint, though many publishers have relegated the year of publication to the verso of the title page or omitted it altogether, especially if there is a copyright date.  

**in**.: Inch or inches  

**inserted fold**: Two conjunct leaves (4 pages) added to a gathering, usually at the end  

**inserted leaf**: A single leaf (2 pages) added to a gathering, frequently but not always at the end of a gathering  

**ISBN**: International Standard Book Number. The ISBN, introduced in 1972, is an international standard that uniquely identifies specific editions of books. The ISBN originally consisted of ten digits in four fields separated by hyphens. The first field indicates the language area or country of publication; the second indicates the publisher; the third identifies a specific format in which a given work is available from a given publisher (for example, hardbound, paperback, different series, with different introductions, etc., or revised versions of a given work, translations); the fourth is a check digit that allows a computer to flag ISBN’s that have been entered incorrectly. Check digits range from 0 to 10; since the fourth field is limited to a single digit, “10” is represented by the Roman numeral “X”. Revised editions of a work have their own ISBN’s.  

Publishers began assigning 13-digit ISBN’s in 2006–07. These have a new prefix (978 or 979) that makes the ISBN consistent with the 13-digit system of bar codes known as EAN (International Article Number) that is used throughout the world. EAN originally stood for European Article Number, but the acronym was so well established that it remained in use after the 13-digit system of bar codes was adopted internationally.  

Most ML books with ISBN’s were published in the “reissue” format beginning in 1977. Some ML books with jackets designed by S. Neil Fujita in the late 1960s and early 1970s also have ISBNs. Nearly all ML books with ISBN’s printed them on the back panel of the jacket, beginning with the three digits (394) that indicated the publisher as Random House. The initial field (“0”) for the English-language area was usually omitted. These ISBN’s are recorded in complete form with the initial “0” added.  

ISBN’s today are printed on the verso of the title page. The only ML volume included in this bibliography with an ISBN on the verso of the title page is a late printing of Thomas Mann’s *Doctor Faustus* (582b). *See also* SBN.  

**issue**: A bibliographical term that is widely misused by non-bibliographers. An “issue” is created by an alteration of the text that affects the conditions of publication or sale of some copies of a particular printing. The alteration usually consists of a change in the title page. Issues occur only within printings; there cannot be a first issue without a second issue. For additional information and examples, see “Issue” under Bibliographical Procedures. The verb “issue” is sometimes used as a synonym for “publish.”  

**kraft paper**: Strong light brown paper made from pulp derived from wood chips; used for ML jackets between 1977 and the “relaunch” of the ML in 1992.  

**leaf**: A leaf has two pages: the recto, which is always an odd-numbered page, and the verso, which is always an even-numbered page. A leaf can be grasped between the thumb and forefinger; a page can be touched but not grasped. Properly speaking, the common phrase “turning the pages” should be “turning the leaves.”  

**letterpress**: A relief printing technology; the inked printing surface is raised from the printing plate or body of the type. Printing can be done directly from standing metal type or from relief printing plates cast from individual pages of standing type; there was a letterpress plate for each page of text. All ML books were printed from plates. Most ML books were printed from letterpress plates before the mid-1960s, when the cost of offset lithography dropped below that of letterpress printing. One side of a sheet was printed at a time. Except for the early Boni & Liveright period, each printed sheet consisted of eight or sixteen pages of text on each side. Printers had to position the plate for each page so that when the sheets were folded and trimmed, the printed pages would all be right side up and sequenced in the correct order. Between 1965 and 1967 the ML converted most of its titles from letterpress to offset.  

**linen paper**: Linen-finish white paper  

**lithography**: Printing technology based on the antipathy of oil and water. The printing surface of lithographic plates is neither raised, as in letterpress printing, nor recessed into the plate, as in engraving and etching. *See also* offset.  

**ML**: (a) Modern Library series, founded by Albert Boni and Horace Liveright in 1917 and acquired by Bennett Cerf in 1925. In partnership with Donald S. Klopfer, Cerf established a new publishing house, The Modern Library, Inc., to publish the series. The full name of the series was “The Modern Library of the World’s Best Books.” The short form is used consistently in this bibliography. In 1936, after Cerf and Klopfer had expanded their publishing program to include new trade books, the firm was reorganized under the name Random House, Inc., and the Modern Library became a subsidiary of its offspring. (b) Trade books like Joyce’s *Ulysses* published under the Random House imprint before 1936 were copyrighted by The Modern Library, Inc.  

***MLC***: *Modern Library Collector*, nos. 1–55 (1981–2008). Semi-annual newsletter edited by Alan Oestreich; nos. 4–55 include a column, “Bibliographical Notes and Queries,” by Gordon B. Neavill.  

**ML catalogue**: Published by Random House; listed new titles, titles dropped and other information about the series. Published 1925–40?  

**MLCE**: Modern Library College Editions, a paperbound series intended for textbook use in colleges and universities. The first was introduced by Random House in 1950. The books had introductions by noted academics. Edited by Jess Stein, who had come to the firm to work on the American College Dictionary.  

**MLG**: Modern Library Giants. A series of full sized volumes with hard covers introduced in fall 1931. The series was used initially for works like Tolstoy’s *War and Peace* (1931) that were too long to fit into the ML’s regular format and for substantial collections and anthologies such as *The Complete Novels of Jane Austen* (1933) and *The English Philosophers from Bacon to Mill* (1939). Several titles were published in both the regular ML and MLG.  

**MLP**: Modern Library Paperbacks, the series of “quality” or “trade” paperbacks published by Random House between 1955 and 1960. The series was thrown together quickly to give Random House a foothold in the emerging quality paperback market after the collapse of extended on-and-off negotiations with Allan Lane to acquire the American branch of Penguin Books. When Random House acquired Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., in 1960, the Knopf paperback series Vintage Books became Random House’s primary trade paperback imprint and Modern Library Paperbacks were phased out. The best MLP titles were added to Vintage Books and the rest were discontinued.  

**mm**: Millimeters  

**new bibliographical edition**:  *See* bibliographical edition  

**NYPL**: New York Public Library  

**OCLC**: Online Computer Library Center in Dublin, Ohio. The OCLC database of machine-readable bibliographic records, consisting of records created by the Library of Congress, other national libraries, and OCLC member libraries, is the largest single source of bibliographic records included in the online catalogs of libraries in the U.S. and many other countries. In June 2010 the OCLC database consisted of over 193 million bibliographic records, each of which is identified by a unique number. WorldCat, the public version of the OCLC database, is accessible through many libraries. OCLC includes a separate database of authority records which indicate the “authorized form” of personal, corporate, and other names that are used in library catalogs and identify variant forms of these names that can establish “see” and “see also” references as authorized forms.  

**offset**: A lithographic printing technology where the printing area of a plate is neither raised (as in letterpress printing) nor recessed into the plate (as in intaglio technologies such as engraving and etching). Offset lithography is based on the antipathy of oil and water. Commercial lithographic printing technologies are known as “offset lithography” or “offset” for short because the inked image on the plate is not printed directly to paper but “offset” to a third cylinder covered with a rubber blanket before being transferred to paper carried by a third cylinder. The ML printed occasional titles by offset lithography from the 1930s on, either because the original publisher’s letterpress plates were too large for the Modern Library’s compact format or because a work included a large number of illustrations that would have been too expensive to include otherwise. Printing by offset lithography was more expensive than letterpress before the 1960s, and the quality of printing was regarded as inferior. The cost of offset printing fell below that of letterpress printing in the mid-1960s. Between 1965 and 1967 the ML converted most of its titles from letterpress to offset. Many of the ML’s letterpress plates had become badly worn over the years. Random House employees were encouraged to search the secondhand book market for first or early printings of ML titles to photograph for the conversion to offset lithography. In some cases where use of the original publisher’s letterpress plates resulted in uncomfortably narrow margins, the ML reduced the size of the type page photographically, significantly improving the appearance of the text.  

Malraux, *Man’s Fate* (294), published in the ML in 1936, offers an example of a ML title that was printed initially by offset lithography so that the type page could be reduced photographically to fit the ML’s balloon cloth format, then from the original publisher’s letterpress plates after the introduction of the ML’s larger format in 1939, and finally in the mid-1960s by offset lithography, with the text reduced photographically from the original publisher’s edition to make the most aesthetically pleasing ML printings.  

**opp**.: Opposite  

**page**: One side of a leaf. The first side of a printed leaf is the *recto* and bears an odd page number; the second side is the *verso* and bears an even page number. It is possible to hide a dollar bill between the verso of one leaf and the recto of the following leaf but not between recto and verso pages.  

**paratext**: Introductions by the author that are unique to the ML edition, such as Virginia Woolf’s introduction to *Mrs. Dalloway* (1928) or F. Scott Fitzgerald’s introduction to *The Great Gatsby* (1934); can be referred to as authorial (or author’s) paratext.  

**perfect bound**: Binding where separate leaves are held together with glue, in contrast to a binding where folded gatherings are sewn with thread; ML reissues are perfect bound but earlier books are sewn  

**plant costs**: Cf. edition costs  

**preliminaries**: The leaves of a book that precede the text  

***PTLA***: *Publishers’ Trade List Annual*. This annual book trade publication consists of listings of in-print books organized by publisher. Modern Library listings in *PTLA* have been used to establish the approximate date that ML titles were discontinued in the 1970s and 1980s, after ML jackets discontinued the practice of including complete lists of ML titles that were updated each time the jacket was reprinted.  

**pub. note**: Publisher’s note  

***PW***: *Publishers’ Weekly* or *Publishers Weekly* (1872–) the trade journal of the U.S. book publishing industry; apostrophe dropped by 1975.  

**quality paperbacks**:  Paperbound books published by trade publishers and usually drawn heavily from a given publisher’s backlist, as opposed to mass-market paperbacks. Anchor Books, conceived by Jason Epstein and published by Doubleday beginning in 1953, was the first American quality paperback imprint. Most of the books were priced at 65 cents or 95 cents and up. “Quality” referred both to the physical format and the seriousness of the titles. Many of the early Anchor Books had covers designed by Edward Gorey. Quality paperbacks are also known as “trade paperbacks” because they are sold in bookstores rather than mass-market outlets. In the 1950s they were sometimes referred to as “egghead paperbacks.” In contrast, mass-market paperbacks such as Pocket Books, Bantam Books, Signet Books, and Dell then sold at retail prices of 25 or 35 cents in mass-market outlets such as drug stores and dime stores. Quality paperbacks drew heavily on publisher’s backlist titles, including many that had been long out of print. Quality paperbacks made many titles that had been out of print available at low prices. The ML lost a number of titles in the mid-1950s when publishers canceled the ML’s reprint contracts in order to add the titles to their quality paperback series.  

**recto**: *See* “page”  

**reissue**: RH referred to ML titles restored to the series between 1977 and 1986 in distinctive kraft paper jackets as ML reissues. New titles added to the series during this period were also published in the “reissue” format. The jackets, designed by R. D. Scudellari, the RH art director, came in two styles: 1) non-pictorial jackets with hand-lettered authors and titles, used beginning in 1977; 2) pictorial jackets featuring woodcuts by Stephen Alcorn on the front panel of the jacket with the title in reverse against a reddish rectangular panel. I have used the phrase “reissue format” to refer to printings in the two styles.  

“Reissue” is an inexact and slippery term and is unrelated to the technical bibliographical term “issue” (q.v.), which has a precise and clearly defined meaning but is also commonly used as a synonym for “publish.”  

**relaunch**: Term used by RH to refer to the revival of the ML that began in 1992. Harry Evans, the former editor of the *Sunday Times* (London) and the president of Random House in the 1990s was primarily responsible for reviving the ML. ML books published after 1991 are outside the scope of this bibliography.  

**RH**: Random House was established in 1927 by Bennett Cerf and Donald Klopfer; reorganization in 1936.  

**RHP**: Random House Papers, Columbia University, Rare Book & Manuscript Library. All citations to unpublished correspondence and other unpublished documents are to the Random House Papers unless indicated otherwise.  

**running head**: A headline, usually but not always printed in capital letters, that is repeated from page to page or leaf to leaf; the running head can be the title of the book, a part title, or a chapter title. The headline is included when referring to the number of printed lines on a page.  

**SBN**: Standard Book Number. Depending on the country, an 8 or 9-digit code in three fields developed in 1966 for uniquely identifying books. The first field identifies the publisher; the second identifies a specific edition of a book; and the third is a check digit that flags the SBN as invalid if any of the preceding digits have been entered incorrectly. Hardbound and paperbound formats of a given book have different SBN’s.  

The ML printed SBN’s on the back panel of many jackets in the late 1960s and 1970s—especially jackets for the “reissue” format introduced in 1976. Some ML books that continued to be sold in 1960s bindings and jackets also had SBN’s added to the back panel of the jackets. The SBN was superseded by the 10-digit International Standard Book Number (ISBN), introduced in 1972. It was common for ML books published in the 1970s and 1980s to print the 9-digit SBN on jackets; with rare exceptions, they did not include the ISBN on the verso of the title page. I have noted SBN’s printed on ML jackets between 1966 and 1972; for books published after 1972, I have converted the 9-digit numbers on jackets to ISBN’s and have identified them accordingly. *See also* ISBN.  

**short title**: The title proper of a work, excluding other title information such as a subtitle.  

**shoulder note**: A side-note in a printed or manuscript book, that is positioned in the outer margin at the top corner of the page. Also known as marginal note.  

***SRL***: *Saturday Review of Literature*, a weekly magazine devoted to literature and the arts that began publication in 1924; the title was shortened to *Saturday Review* in 1952. *SRL*’s “Trade Winds” column that began in the early 1940s was written by Bennett Cerf. For the sake of convenience, *SRL* is used to refer to both titles of the magazine.  

**state**: A bibliographical term that is widely misused by non-bibliographers. States are created by an alteration of the text in *some copies* of a particular printing (usually by stop-press correction or cancellation of leaves). States occur within printings; there cannot be a first state without a second state.  

**text block**: All of the folded printed sheets that comprise the content of a book/body of the text, including blank pages that are part of a printed sheet containing text or illustrations, together with any single or folded sheets that are inserted as part of the content. The text block does not include the binding or inserted endpapers. A blank leaf used as a free or paste-down endpaper is part of the text block if it is part of a gathering containing text or illustrations.  

**text page**: All of the printed elements on a page except the headline and page number; *see also* “type page.”  

**trade paperbacks**: *See* “quality paperbacks”  

**traveler**: A publisher’s sales representative; before the late 1940s, the travelers who sold ML and RH books were independent sales representatives who worked on commission and represented several publishers.  

**trim size**: Actual size of a book after excess material required for production has been cut.  

**type page**: All of the printed elements on a page, including the headline and page number; *see* *also* “text page.”  

**verso**: *See* “page”  

**vol., vols**.: Volume, volumes  

**WorldCat**: *See* OCLC  

***WR***:  “Weekly Record” (*Publishers’ Weekly*). A section of *Publishers’ Weekly*, the trade journal of the American publishing industry, which lists newly published books based on copies submitted by the publisher. A listing in the “Weekly Record” confirms that a book was in existence by a given date.
