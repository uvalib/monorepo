Mr. Johnson from the Committee on Grounds & Buildings submitted the following report.

Report of Committee on Buildings, Grounds &c.

The undersigned appointed Committee as aforesaid beg leave respectfully to report that they have given to the subject of consideration such attention as they deem necessary.

In as much as the Board has already taken action on several matters, the Committee think it proper only to report That the opening of an additional hotel renders it necessary that, that building be put in repair for use as early as practicable - they have not been able however to procure any estimate of the cost of the improvements or repairs, nor do they deem it essential and respectfully recommend that the Chairman of the Faculty, under the direction of the Executive Committee proceed as early as practicable to have the hotel put in proper serviceable condition.

Two of the Dawson buildings specially require roofing and the Committee recommend that the Chairman receive the same instructions in regard to them, subject however to the like control.

The Privies in and about the University particularly demand prompt attention. The drainage connected with them is very imperfect and the Committee see no means by which an adequate corrective can be made except by causing water to be conducted to them. They are now in a very obnoxious condition and but for the very abundant use of lime would be absolutely insufferable. An Epidemic may at any time arise from them and the Committee therefore recommend that a resolution be passed referring the subject to the Chairman of the Faculty with directions to repair and improve as soon as practicable.

The Board having referred the subject of Water, it is unnecessary to make further mention of it.

For the accommodation of Professors & students very many improvements & additions are desirable and would be noticed further but for the exhausted state of the finances of the University.

Specific action having been taken on other important matters, the Committee do not deem it necessary to say more than that they think the repairs may generally be done by the Chairman under such instruction as the Executive Committee may from time to time think proper to give.

In regard to the enlargement of accommodations for the Washington Society, the Committee that they would be pleased to favour the application, but that at present it cannot be done.

Respectfully submitted &c.

Marmaduke Johnson

R. W. Hughes.
