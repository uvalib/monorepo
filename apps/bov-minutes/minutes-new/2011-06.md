**Remarks by the President**

**Six-year Plan**

**President Sullivan reported on the six-year plan that is part of the Higher Education Opportunity Act. Colette Sheehy is the point person for the work on this plan. President Sullivan said the Six-Year plan has three parts: academic, financial, and enrollment. The Board has already approved the enrollment plan portion.**

**President Sullivan described the process and timeline for the plan.** **The plan must be submitted to the state by July 1. The state provides feedback to each institution by September 1, with revisions due by October 1.**

**There are four mandatory objectives every institution must address. The first is a plan for providing financial aid to mitigate the impact of tuition and fee increases on low-income and middle-income students and their families. The University strategy for this objective will be the AccessUVa program as modified by the Board.**

**The second objective is a plan for optimal year-round use of the institution’s facilities and instructional resources to improve student completions and cost efficiencies. The University’s strategy for this objective includes increasing enrollment in J-Term and Summer Session, and employing best practices in scheduling academic facilities, including standard start/stop times; extending the academic day and week; and centralized scheduling and control over instructional space.**

**The third objective is to develop an instructional resource-sharing program with other institutions. Strategies for this objective include the Commonwealth Graduate Engineering Program with George Mason, Virginia Tech, Virginia Commonwealth, and Old Dominion universities, and a new initiative called 4-Va, a consortium of institutions working with CISCO to employ advanced technology to expand access to higher education at lower cost, to increase research competitiveness, and to contribute to economic development.**

**The fourth objective is new programs or initiatives including quality improvements. Strategies for this objective include addressing competitive compensation for faculty and staff, improving the student/faculty ratio, and start-up packages for science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) faculty.**

**There are also 13 optional objectives to be addressed based on institutional mission, scope, and focus. Strategies include:**

*   *   *   **Enrollment growth plan to add more Virginia undergraduates;**
        *   **Expansion of the Bachelor of Interdisciplinary Studies (BIS) program to allow individuals with partial credit to complete their degrees;**
        *   **Identifying programs where students could earn bachelor’s and master’s degrees in four years;**
        *   **Increasing the number of VCCS transfer students through expansion of the PRODUCED in Virginia Engineering program;**
        *   **Exploring strategies/programs that could increase the graduation rate of Pell recipients;**
        *   **Deepening the applicant pool of students in STEM disciplines and focusing a certain amount of enrollment growth in SEAS and in the sciences;**
        *   **Identifying a limited number of pan-University research priorities;**
        *   **Continuing to develop research partnerships with private industry (e.g., Rolls Royce) and governmental entities; and**
        *   **Continuing to pursue cost containment, efficiency measures, and revenue generation.**

**Strategies for the College at Wise focus on student success by applying a retention risk assessment system, supplemental instruction for freshmen courses with high failure rates, and fine tuning admissions standards. The College at Wise will also focus on increasing production of STEM degrees by establishing a science consortium with public schools and industry.**

**The third area of emphasis for the College at Wise will be the efficient use of resources by expanding course offerings in the summer, establishing a January term, and enhancing key partnerships with the University.**

**President Sullivan said she would work closely with Board members as the plan is developed.**

**Presentation to Leonard Sandridge**

**President Sullivan read a letter from the Seven Society to Mr. Sandridge complementing him on his many years at the University. They said he served with courage and selflessness. She presented him with a wooden box to which Mr. Sandridge had been sent a key previously. With some difficulty, Mr. Sandridge was able to open the box, which contained a photograph book with pictures from throughout his life.**

**Gifts and Grants Report**

**The President said philanthropic giving to the University of Virginia and its related foundations is $189,324,500.16 for the fiscal year through April 30, 2011. This is an increase of $20,189,999.72, or 11.94% above the results of the previous fiscal year.**

**Report by Governor Gerald L. Baliles, Director of the Miller Center**

**The Honorable Gerald Baliles, former Governor of Virginia and Director of the Miller Center for Public Affairs, spoke about the work of the Miller Center. Governor Baliles said Burkett Miller conceived of the Miller Center as a place to talk about the great issues of the day and issue reports; ever since, the Miller Center has been the leading institution nationwide focused on the American presidency. The Miller Center has conducted official presidential histories from Carter through George W. Bush, and transcribes and annotates the Oval Office tapes which date back to Eisenhower, Nixon, and forward.**

#### History, policy, and impact are three words that sum up the Miller Center. Major national conferences are held on issues of importance today. Following up on scholarly work and their report on infrastructure investment, the Miller Center will be convening a national conference on transportation later this year. The Miller Center has the power to convene the most influential people to look at these issues. Three years ago they convened a War Powers Commission and developed a report, and an op-ed on this subject was just published in the Washington Post.

**Governor Baliles played three taped conversations from their archives: General Eisenhower and President Kennedy discussing the Cuban Missile Crisis; President Johnson and Martin Luther King talking by telephone immediately following President Kennedy’s assassination; and a video of President Obama commending the infrastructure report issued by the Miller Center at a press conference on the White House lawn.**

**Governor Baliles finished by mentioning that they plan to look at the presidential appointments process.**
