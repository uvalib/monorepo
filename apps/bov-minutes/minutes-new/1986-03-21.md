GIFTS, GRANTS AND CONTRACTS
---------------------------

A report on gifts, grants and contracts showed that private gifts to the University and its Foundation amounted to $3,075,600 for the period January 1, 1986 to February 28, 1986, and that restricted grants and contracts for the same period totaled $8,537,818.

The President spoke of the University's roll in matters of research funding, which he said should be content neutral. He said that there has recently been concern at many universities, including this one, about research sponsored by the Strategic Defense Initiatives Office -- the so-called Star Wars project. Some faculty here and elsewhere have made clear their desire not to accept support from that source, and have given their reasons. Such opposition is not always a rejection of SDIO as such, but rather reflects resentment at the occasional practice of refunding under SDIO continuing research which has been funded (and for which renewal was sought) from another agency such as the National Science Foundation. When renewal comes back marked as SDIO, the faculty concern -- even among those who might have accepted SDIO support had it been explicit -- is understandable.

Such a statement seems to me an entirely appropriate expression of faculty view, on scientific far more than political grounds. He contrasted such statements with efforts that have been made at a few universities to compel an institutional policy forbidding even willing faculty from accepting SDIO support. He said we should resist such pressures, and for much the same reason as we appreciate statements of individual faculty preference.

He said it is our task to make sure that procedural conditions and guidelines have been complied with -- that research grants will respect the rights of human subjects and of laboratory animals, and will ensure nondiscrimination in all facets of the project. To these guidelines he added classified research, since he believes it is the principal investigator and not a government agency that should make the final judgment about publication and sharing of research findings. That last issue is now under review in a committee of faculty.

He said that with limited exceptions individual faculty should be free to seek (or not seek) funding from various sources. The University should not sit in judgment on the content of research, or the uses to which results might be put, or the mission of the sponsoring agency. He concluded that in this as in other areas of university life, faculty are the best judges and the judgments are largely individual and personal.

The Board covenants that so long as the Bonds are outstanding, the University will pay to the Treasurer of Virginia not less than 30 days before each interest or principal and interest payment date, the amount certified by the Treasurer of Virginia to be due and payable on such date as principal and interest on that portion of the Bonds issued on behalf of the University to finance the Projects.

Section 10. The Board covenants that the University will pay from time to time its proportionate share of all expenses incurred in connection with the sale and issuance of the Bonds and all expenses thereafter incurred in connection with the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Bonds all as certified by the Treasurer of Virginia to the University.

Section 11. The Board covenants that the University (a) within thirty days of the issuance of the Bonds, will spend at least five percent of the net proceeds derived from the sale of that portion of the Bonds issued to finance each Project for costs associated with the construction of that Project, and (b) within six months of the date of the issuance of the Bonds will spend all of the proceeds derived from the sale of that portion of the Bonds issued to finance the Projects for costs associated with the Projects, unless the Treasurer of Virginia permits a longer period of time (not to exceed three years) in which to spend such proceeds. The Board further covenants that the University, either alone or in conjunction with the Treasurer of Virginia, will, to the extent permitted by Virginia law, take all other actions necessary to maintain the tax-exempt status of interest on the Bonds under Federal and Virginia law and, unless advised in writing by bond counsel for the issuance of the Bonds that such compliance is not necessary in order to maintain such tax-exempt status, to comply with the provisions contained in the Tax Reform Act of 1985 (H.R. 3838) (which Act has been adopted by the House of Representatives, is being considered by the Senate and contains an effective date of January 1, 1986) including (a) limiting the investment of Bond proceeds in higher yielding investments or nonpurpose obligations, (b) restricting the yield on any investment property if the proceeds derived from the sale of that portion of the Bonds issued to finance the acquisition of property for the Projects is not spent within thirty days of the issuance of the Bonds or all of the proceeds of the Bonds allocable to the Projects are not spent within six months of the issuance of the Bonds, or such longer period (not to exceed three years) as may be permitted by the Treasurer of Virginia, (c) refunding any obligations previously issued to finance the Projects within 30 days of the issuance of the Bonds (unless the Treasurer of Virginia permits a longer period of time), and (d) paying any required rebate to the United States, all as may be directed by the Treasurer of Virginia.

Section 12. The Board covenants that for so long as the Bonds are outstanding the University will not enter into any operating lease, management contract or similar agreement with any person or entity other than a governmental unit, for all or any portion of any or all of the Projects, nor will it reserve any parking places in the Parking Project for the use of a non-governmental entity, without first obtaining the written approval of the Treasurer of Virginia and bond counsel for the issuance of the Bonds.

The University is planning construction of a new Student Health facility to be located near the Medical Center. The facility is scheduled to be completed in September, 1984 at a cost of $3,512,000 including utilities. We have requested approval of the total project by the General Assembly, and we would like $2,000,000 of the project cost to be included in a revenue bond issue for permanent financing. The remaining portion of the project cost will be funded from auxiliary enterprise balances ($300,000) and private gifts ($1,212,000).

The Student Health Department, a component of the division of student affairs, is the organization responsible for all aspects of the health care of University students. Currently, the department occupies a building which is seriously deficient in two major areas. First, the present building is too small to accommodate a Student Health Service handling as many patients as are being seen. Thus, there is severe overcrowding. Second, the current building is poorly designed for use as a health care facility, and the physical condition of the structure itself is very bad. Presently, students make use of the Student Health Service approximately 50,000 times each year for purposes ranging from allergy treatments to gynecological services. The same services that are offered in the current Student Health facility will be offered in the new building. One additional service will be offered in the new facility (radiology) because of the distance of the proposed site from the existing Medical Center radiology department. It is expected that the number of students and thus the number of patient visits from students will remain at current levels. Since the control of disease and the maintenance of a healthy student body is essential to the effectiveness of the University's educational mission, a new facility is needed.

Student Health is an auxiliary enterprise, operating as a prepaid health plan. The Student Health fee is automatically included in comprehensive fees collected along with tuition. Payment of the debt will be from the Student Health fee assessed to all full-time, regular session students in the amount of $27 per session (part-time, regular session students pay a pro-rata amount). In calculating the debt payment schedule, an interest rate of 12% was used, and the payments were extended over 20 years resulting in a coverage of approximately 110%.

The University is planning construction of a recreational facility located on the North Grounds of the University. This facility would serve the approximately 2300 students attending classes and living on North Grounds. These students currently must travel several miles to use already crowded recreational facilities. The proposed center will compliment the Memorial Gym and Slaughter Recreation Center facilities on the Central Grounds. We have requested approval of the total project by the General Assembly and we would like the project to be included in a revenue bond issue for permanent financing.

The facility is expected to be completed in June, 1986, at a total cost of $3,079,100, including outside utilities. Revenue bonds will be used to finance $2,579,100. Student fees will pay for the debt service and operating costs of the facility, which total $350,000 per year. Students currently pay $12 per year for debt service on the Slaughter recreational facility which will be paid off in 1984. This fee will be increased to $18 per year and supplemented by $104,000 per year in student commons fees.

The recreational facility is needed to serve the North Grounds residents and graduate students as well as some 2600 students living off-grounds to the North and West of the University. The State guidelines for determining space needs indicate that the 1980-82 FTE enrollment of 14,431 students allows the University to have 144,310 square feet of physical education space. The total inventory of net assignable square feet for this purpose is currently 113,503. This allows the University to build a facility that has a net assignable square footage area of 30,807. The proposed facility is within the State guidelines.

The attached debt service schedule is calculated at 9% covering 20 years with 110% coverage of the debt service payments.

Estimated Revenues Full Time Student Fees 15,000 x $18/yr. $270,000 Part-Time Student Fees 1,000 x $3/yr. 3,000 Student Commons Fees (See Note A) 104,000 -------- Total Estimated Revenues 377,000 Estimated Expenditures Personal Services 40,000 Other Operating Expense 25,000 -------- Total Estimated Expenditures 65,000 -------- Total Net Revenues $312,000

Note A: The current student fee structure includes an amount which is being applied to the construction of Newcomb Hall and the Student Activities Building.

The University is planning construction of a parking garage for 642 cars at the University of Virginia Hospital. This garage will replace 465 parking spaces that will be lost when the replacement hospital is constructed.

The project has been appropriated by the 1984 General Assembly under Chapter 754, item -13 at a cost of $5,850,000 (including outside utilities) of which $1,400,000 was to be provided by Revecue Bonds with the lance coming from Hospital revenues. The University is submiting an to the 1985 General Assembly requesting a change in the amount of funds provided from Revenue Bonds to $5,000,000 with the balance of $850,000 funded from Hospital Revenue. The project is expected to be completed in December 1985.

Parking support for the current medical center complex is not adequate to meet the needs of today's staff levels. Completion of a 363 space parking deck devoted to patient and visitor parking has been able to meet the demands for that category. Parking for faculty and staff remains marginal, hence a number of staff must utilize peripheral lots or depend on bus service from outlying areas. Presently, there are waiting lists totaling 514 faculty, resident staff, nurses and other staff personnel desiring parking facilities near the medical center. Should this project not be completed and in service in the early stages of the major hospital construction, the parking support for current medical activities will be significantly impaired.

It is expected that 500 spaces in the arage will be allocated to permit parking and will be sold at a projected monthly cost of $20 per space. The remaining spaces will be used for patient and visitor parking on an hourly basis. Because of a decision to relocate the garage down the street from the existing Medical Center parking garage the addition of one full-time employee will be required to operate the facility at an annual cost of $14,000. Other operating costs are expected to be $21,000 annually. In addition to the net revenues generated by the garage, a subsidy of $407,536 annually will be provided by other parking and transportation units, primarily parking permits and traffic fines.

In calculating the debt schedule, interest rate of was sed and payments were extended over 20 years with debt serte coverage of 1107.

Estimated Revenues 500 spaces X $240/yr. = $120,000 142 spaces X $792/yr. = $112,464 Estimated Expenditures Other Operating Expenses 35,000 Net Revenues Generated $197,464 Subsidy from Other Parking and Tranait Operations (See Note A) 407,536 -------- Total Net Revenues $605,000

Note A: Additional revenues will need to be generated by Parking and Transportation for the 642 Car Parking Garage in the amount of $407,536. These additional revenues will be raised by a $2/month increase in reserve and oversold parking spaces. This will generate $127,824 annually (5,326 X $24). Student parking rates will be increased from $18 to $50 per year and will generate an additional $150,080 annually (4,690 X $32). The remaining $129,632 will come from Traffic Fines and Visitor Parking revenues previously committed to renovation and replacement reserves.

The University is planning to acquire Housing for 650 students. The Structure will be completed in 1983-84 at a cost of $13,615,000. We have requested approval of the total project by the General Assembly, and we would like to include $11,500,000 in House Bill 36 as a revenue bond issue for permanent financing. A total of $1,365,000 will be provided from the University unrestricted general fund, primarily to prepare the site.

The Student Housing Division is a self-supporting auxiliary enterprise, acting in direct support of the education mission of the University of Virginia. The housing of students has been the concern of the University since its founding. The University has two main goals in providing students with housing accommodations on the Grounds. The first is to furnish students with a variety of housing arrangements at reasonable cost. The second is to provide an environment in which each student may achieve the maximum realization of his or her potential--intellectually, socially, and physically. It is expected that attributes such as self-discipline, concern for the rights of others, mental and social maturity, and respect for public and private property will be fostered in group residence situations.

As a part of the University's orientation and advisory system, all students entering one of the undergraduate schools directly from secondary school are required to live in one of the residence houses during their first year. After the first year in residence, a student may live in University housing, provided space is available. At the present time, University accommodations for single upperclass students are severely limited.

The rapid growth of the University during the last decade has created a critical need for student housing, undergraduate and graduate, and although some 1,400 student spaces have been added to bring the University's housing accommodations to 5,103, the student population has grown from 8,500 to 16,400. The University has an objective of providing housing for 50% of the student body.

Private enterprise has responded to the University's inability to provide sufficient housing for its student population by building increasing numbers of apartment units in close proximity to the Grounds. However, the profit motive and inflation have combined to make many of these units beyond the financial resources of the average student. The University has resorted to a "lottery" system for other than first-year students to compete for available spaces. Competition among upperclass students resulted in 4,550 students applying, through a recent lottery, for 1,270 available spaces. The situation is not expected to improve in the foreseeable future.

To alleviate the immediate student housing shortage, an additional 650 beds are needed by the fall of 1983. this addition will bring our student spaces to 5,753 with a student body of at least 16,400.

Payment of the debt will be from revenue received from room rent. Rates are projected for the new facility at $1,300 per student during the academic session. In addition, summer conferences are expected to generate an additional $125,000 in revenues per year. It will be necessary to subsidize the facility from the existing housing system in an approximate amount of $1,180,000.

RE: 2.25 Acres on Park Place to 321 Park Place and 308 Park Place to 318 Park Place, Charlottesville, Virginia (Charlottesville City Tax Map 10, Parcel 136); and "Westover," Consisting of Approximately 325 Acres in Albemarle County

Dear Hovey:

The purpose of this Letter of Intent is to outline the terms and conditions under which the University of Virginia will request a related foundation or affiliate to pursue the acquisition of the above captioned properties. This letter is not an offer or contract to purchase, and is not a promise to enter into a contract to purchase. Any contract for purchase of the properties would only be made by execution of a sale and acquisition agreement. (In this letter, "Seller" refers to each of the sellers shown at the end of this letter, with regard to their respectively owned properties.) The Seller understands that one of the steps the prospective buyer of the properties will need to take in pursuing acquisition of the properties is obtaining, at no expense to the Seller, a satisfactory appraisal of the properties.

The price which would be paid for the properties at closing is $6,700,000.

With respect to the Park Place property (and not Westover), it would be Hunter Faulconer Sr.'s intent to claim the difference between the appraised market value and the purchase price as a charitable gift. The sales contract would acknowledge the difference between the sales price and the asking price of the properties, and would acknowledge Hunter Faulconer Sr.'s desire to make a charitable contribution. The donee would complete the portion of the IRS Form 8283 applicable to the donee. The Buyer would not condition signature of a sale and acquisition contract upon the agreement of Mr. Faulconer on such a tax related gift arrangement.

4\. During his residence at Westover, direct access to Old Garth Road would be maintained over the existing entrance road or a comparable substitute to Old Garth Road.

5\. The Buyer of the Westover property would not resell any of that property during the three years after conveyance to the Buyer. Excluded from this provision would be a conveyance of not more than 100 acres of Westover bordering Barracks Road to S. W. Heischman in exchange for the 68 acres owned by Heischman on Ivy Road.

6\. Costs for title examinations, surveys, and recordation of necessary legal documents would be paid by the Buyer. Each party would bear its own legal expenses. There would be no brokers or agents who are entitled to a commission or other fee.

7\. Buyer agrees to lease to Hunter Faulconer, Sr. the balance of Westover not included with the life estate and not conveyed to Mr. Heischman. Such lease would be for the purpose of conducting farming operations on Westover and shall be "net-net." Hunter Faulconer, Sr. would pay all expenses including taxes and insurance and perform any necessary maintenance on the leased property. Either party would have the right to terminate this lease, in whole or as to portions of the property, upon reasonable notice to the other, which notice in the case of the Buyer must contain a certification of its intent to develop the portions of the property as to which the lease is to be terminated. After termination of such lease as to any portion of the property, Buyer shall maintain the portions released from the lease in a neat and mown condition, UNTIL COMMENCEMENT OF CONSTRUCTION.

The Seller and the Buyer would agree to cooperate in all matters relating to the generation and approval of all required information and in the continuation of general processing of the properties toward sale or development potential.

For the purpose of these matters the Seller may be contacted care of Mr. Hovey Dabney, Jefferson National Bank, 123 East Main Street, Charlottesville, Virginia 22901 and the University may be contacted care of Mr. Ray C. Hunt, Jr., Vice President for Business and Finance, University of Virginia, P. O. Box 9014, Charlottesville, Virginia 22906-9014.

The Seller and the University agree to pursue in good faith a sale and acquisition agreement with a University-related foundation or affiliate as described in this letter.

As of the date of signing this Letter of Intent, the Seller agrees he will not continue or initiate negotiations with any potential buyer for all or a part of the properties other than the University or a related foundation or affiliate. The Seller will not be bound by this statement if a sale and acquisition agreement has not been signed by March 31, 1986. Such sale and acquisition agreement shall provide for a closing date no later than April 30, 1986, and shall have no contingencies other than for title defects revealed by the title commitment or survey which materially adversely affect marketability of the property. The parties agree to attempt to satisfy such title contingency prior to execution of the sale and acquisition agreement.
