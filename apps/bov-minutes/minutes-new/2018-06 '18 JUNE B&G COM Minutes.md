RESOLVED, Goody Clancy of Boston, MA is approved for the performance of architectural services for the renewal of the Physics Building.

**Action Item: 2018 Multi-Year Major Capital Plan**

Ms. Sheehy said the University’s multi-year capital plan is revised annually. The 2018 plan adds 11 projects to the 2017 plan and removes four. Except for cost estimate adjustments, no changes have been made to the draft plan reviewed by the committee at its March meeting. The project costs for the 2017 plan totaled $2.8 billion. The total for the 2018 plan is $3.3 billion with new construction projects accounting for 65%, renovations for 29%, and infrastructure projects for 6%. The plan adds 3.1 million new square feet and renovates 2.3 million square feet. After reviewing the new projects, Ms. Sheehy reviewed a list of current land-use and space needs studies.

On motion, the committee approved the following resolution and recommended it for Board approval:

**2018 MULTI-YEAR MAJOR CAPITAL PLAN FOR THE ACADEMIC DIVISION, HEALTH SYSTEM, AND COLLEGE AT WISE**

WHEREAS, in accordance with the capital projects approval process endorsed by the Buildings and Grounds Committee in November 2015, major capital projects are vetted by the Space Leadership Committee and executive leadership, as well as by appropriate committees of the Board of Visitors, to ensure alignment with institutional priorities; and

WHEREAS, the projects included in the proposed 2018 Major Capital Plan are arrayed across a six-year plus timeframe based on the anticipated work related to each project; and

WHEREAS, the University is also engaging in several major capital planning studies that will result in specific projects in the future;

RESOLVED, the 2018 Multi-Year Major Capital Plan for the Academic Division, the Health System, and the College at Wise is approved.

**Action Item: Schematic Design Approval: Ivy Mountain Musculoskeletal Center**

Ms. Raucher presented this item. She reviewed 1) the updated site plan which moved the building closer to Ivy Road, 2) a north-south building section showing how the building was terraced into the land to minimize its impact on the neighborhood, 3) a building diagram highlighting sustainability elements, 4) perspectives from the west and east illustrating the façade treatment and major landscape elements, and 5) a view of the entry lobby,

On motion, the committee approved the following resolution:

**SCHEMATIC DESIGN FOR THE IVY MOUNTAIN MUSCULOSKELETAL CENTER**

RESOLVED, the schematic design for the Ivy Mountain Musculoskeletal Center, prepared by ZGF Architects in collaboration with the Architect for the University and representatives of the Health System and Facilities Management, is approved for further development and construction.

**Schematic Design Review: Alderman Library Renewal**

Ms. Sheehy said the presentation includes design options for the building’s north façade. She gave the floor to Ms. Raucher who began with a review of the design goals, which are to create a sense of arrival from the Ivy Corridor, to frame the views to Nameless Field and Carr’s Hill, to create an address and entry on University Avenue, to improve connectivity and accessibility for all users, to provide a seamless connection to Clemons Library, and to improve access in Alderman. She showed photographs of the original north façade and the façade after the construction of the 1967 addition. The project replaces the 1937 and 1967 stacks with a new addition. The proposed design turns the existing light wells into gathering and study spaces and improves access around the building including the west side. Work on Alderman’s south façade will be limited to restoration and to the addition of two new entry doors flanking the existing doors.

Ms. Raucher concluded with a review of four design options for the east and north facades of the addition. Option A restates Alderman’s the south elevation with the new reading room designated by double height white columns, arched windows, and flanking brick piers. Option B restates Alderman’s original north façade. Option C uses square windows and brick piers to identify the reading room. Option D is a more significant design departure with the reading room seen as an almost transparent volume with thin white pilasters. The committee favored Option B.

Committee discussion focused on topics such as faculty and student use, book capacity, and the types of spaces. Mr. Unsworth, the dean of libraries and university librarian, said seating for students would increase from 850 to 1,200. There would be good mix of quiet and active spaces including seminar rooms. Alderman’s current document capacity is 2.5 million. The proposed capacity is projected to range between 1.7 million if compact shelving is used to under a million with fixed shelving. Between Clemons and Alderman Libraries, the total capacity would be 1.5 to 2.2 million. Mr. Nigro said print collections and study spaces are a priority for students. While students want group study spaces, they also want quiet spaces. Mr. Unsworth said the process used to develop the space plan included discussions with staff, faculty, students, and library occupants, a round of public sessions with the architects, and one-on-one meetings. The library continually provides information and updates through the media and its website. Mr. Katsouleas said the project committee was charged with optimizing the new library to meet the needs of scholars, students, and the broader community within the context of the University’s library system.

**Schematic Design Review: Student Health and Wellness Center**

Ms. Raucher reviewed the proposed site and landscape plan in the context of the overall plan for Brandon Avenue. The Center will have its primary entrance on Brandon Avenue. Loading and service areas and two levels of parking under the building will be accessed from Monroe Lane. Red brick and cast stone will be used on the building’s façade. The building’s scale will be reduced by making it appear as a three story building with a set back fourth story attic. A glazed section will be used to break up the building’s length.

There were no design comments from the committee, but during the discussion a question was asked about the annual maintenance cost. Mr. Hogan said it would be approximately $1.5 million, which has been included in the operating model.

**Schematic Design Review: Softball Stadium**

Ms. Raucher presented the site plan, numerous perspectives, and a sustainability overview. She said the field’s original northeast orientation has been changed to a southeast orientation. The new orientation is functionally viable, better serves the master plan by locating the player development center, which will be built in phases, along Massie Road, and optimizes views from the stadium. The goal is to have a great stadium with an emphasis on fan engagement. The design is influenced by adjacent athletics facilities and by Memorial Gymnasium’s bay system.

The committee’s comments on the design were positive.

**Committee Discussion: Athletics Precinct Master Plan**

The chair provided an overview before giving the floor to Ms. Raucher, who began with a review of the master plan’s goals which are to:1) assess existing facilities and programs; 2) establish future needs and program growth; 3) propose a sequence to achieve priorities; and 4) maximize pedestrian connectivity. She reviewed existing and interim conditions pointing out the replacement of University Hall with playing fields. She also reviewed a diagram of major pedestrian path systems. Main priorities include a new football building, a facility for the Olympic sports programs previously housed in University Hall, and the renovation of McCue Center. The plan envisions these faculties as a new athletics complex with the football building located between the Welsh Indoor Practice Facility and a combined McCue Center and Olympic sports facility on Massie Road. The near term master plan includes this athletic complex with adjacent fields and the new softball stadium. The long-term plan includes the relocation of field hockey, sites for future buildings, and a pedestrian promenade.

Discussion topics included the need for safe pedestrian connections to the Central Grounds. Ms. Raucher was asked to study options to improve pedestrian connections at Ivy Road and Emmet Street.

**Lawn Accessibility Project**

Mr. Clements reported that members of the Jeffersonian Grounds Initiative (JGI) Board have expressed concerns about the ramps approved by the committee at its September 2017 meeting. The purpose of these ramps, which will be located at Pavilions V and IX, was to provide ADA access. The JGI board members felt the ramps protruded too far into the Lawn and asked for the consideration of other options, such as lifts. The University does not believe lifts or elevators are workable because their installation would impact adjacent historic structures. In addition, a survey of disabled students indicated they felt lifts were demeaning and that they preferred to get to the Lawn under their own power. The ramp options presented to the committee were the most compact and did not impact adjacent historic structures. The ramp proposed at Pavilion V would also remove a brick retaining wall, which is not historic. Additionally, if the ramps are not needed in the future, they can be removed and the Lawn restored. Mr. Conner asked interested committee members to spend the next 10 days considering other options. If a better option is not identified by the end of the 10-day period, the University would proceed with the approved concept.

Ms. Sheehy concluded the presentations by directing the committee’s attention to the sustainability report in the committee materials.

The chair adjourned the meeting at 3:20 p.m.
