The President stated that it would be necessary to increase the faculty salary schedule for teaching in Summer School in order that the University might remain competitive in this respect and also for the purpose of bringing that schedule more in line with the salary schedule prevailing for the academic session since 1 September 1962.

\[The Committee on Educational Policy was established by the Board of Visitors on 29 September 1962 (Minutes, Board of Visitors, University of Virginia, No. 12, 29 September 1962, p. 363)\]

The President reported that the speed and capacity of the present computer are insufficient to provide for the research needs of the University. He proposed, therefore, that he be authorized to seek a State appropriation and a matching grant from the National Science Foundation to procure a new and enlarged computer. Accordingly, he proposed, and the Board adopted the following resolution

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the President be and he is hereby authorized to seek funds to purchase a new and enlarged computer

The President reported that, effective for those entering as undergraduate students in September 1964, the School of Education would no longer admit undergraduate students in the first and second year but instead these students would be enrolled in the College of Arts and Sciences and would transfer to the School of Education at the beginning of their third year of undergraduate study. The President noted that this proposal did not represent a basic change of policy since all undergraduate students in the first two years in the School of Education are now taking all their courses in the College of Arts and Sciences. He also stated that this change would place the School of Education on the same basis as the School of Commerce which does not admit students until the beginning of their third year

The President stated that funds had been obtained to purchase a Van de Graef accelerator and that it was now necessary to plan for the location and the type of building that would be needed to house the accelerator. At a meeting of the Buildings and Grounds Committee on the preceding day, 7 December 1962, the Committee had unanimously approved for submission to the full Board a proposal that the firm of Rawlings and Wilson of Richmond, Virginia, be employed as the architects.

The following resolution was adopted

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the President be and he is hereby authorized to employ the firm of Rawlings and Wilson of Richmond, Virginia, as architects for the proposed Van de Graef Accelerator Building

The President reminded the Board of the adoption of a resolution on 10 December 1960 (Minutes, Board of Visitors, University of Virginia, No. 12, 10 December 1960, p. 363) authorizing a contribution by the University to the Alumni Association of $20,000 a year, the funds for such grant to be derived from revenues received by the University from the Atlantic Coast Conference. Since the income from the Atlantic Coast Conference has declined and the reserve from this source will have been expended during the current fiscal year, it will be necessary, the President stated, to change the resolution adopted in 1960

After discussion, the following resolution was adopted

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that, effective with the fiscal year beginning 1 July 1963, the University will contribute annually to the Alumni Association, from revenue derived from the Atlantic Coast Conference and from radio broadcasts of University athletic events, the sum of $15,000 or in any year in which the revenue from these sources is less than $15,000, the amount of such revenue, this contribution to aid the Alumni Association in covering the cost of printing and distributing the Alumni News, and to assist the Association with general printing and with repairs to Alumni Hall

The President reminded the Board of the strong support the University had given to the Virginia Department of Highways in obtaining the construction of a section of the by-pass which would connect U. S. 250 West with U. S. 29 South and thus sharply reduce the amount of heavy traffic now flowing through the University on Emmet Street on present U. S. 29 (Minutes, Board of Visitors, University of Virginia, No. 12, 10 December 1960, pp. 245-246). The Department of Highways had requested of the University the grant of some land to the south of Piedmont which was necessary for the construction of an interchange to connect the by-pass with the existing U. S. 29 South. The land needed, amounting to 2.68 acres, was land owned by the University prior to 1900 and therefore, by statute, could not be transferred to ownership of the Department of Highways without the approval of the General Assembly. Special Counsel, Mr. C. Venable Minor, had advised the President, however, that an easement could be granted which would serve the present purposes and thus not delay action on this project until the next regular meeting of the General Assembly in 1964. The proposal had been presented to the Buildings and Grounds Committee at its meeting on the preceding day, 7 December 1962, and that Committee had unanimously recommended that the easement be granted and that the President be authorized subsequently, if necessary, to seek approval of the transfer of title of the land from the General Assembly if that were needed

After discussion, the following resolution was adopted

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the President be and he is hereby authorized and empowered to execute, in the name and on behalf of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, such grants of easement of right of way over lands of the University of Virginia necessary to enable the Commonwealth of Virginia to construct a by-pass from Route 250 West to Route 29 South,

RESOLVED, further, that if necessary in the discretion of the President, and subject to the approval of the General Assembly of such conveyance, the President be, and he is hereby authorized and empowered to execute a deed to the Commonwealth of Virginia conveying the fee simple title to such lands of the University of Virginia as may be required to enable the Commonwealth of Virginia to construct such by-pass,

RESOLVED, further, that the Secretary be and he is hereby authorized and empowered to affix the corporate seal of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia to any such grant of easement or deed, and to attest the same

The Rector called to the attention of the Board a letter he had received from Mr. Henry S. Haight, dated 14 November 1962, a copy of which had been sent to each member of the Board. In his letter, Mr. Haight requested that he, accompanied by his attorney, be granted a hearing before the Board at its earliest convenience, with respect to the dismissal of his son as a result of a breach of the Honor System, such dismissal being effective 31 October 1961

Upon consideration of the letter the Board noted that the Honor Code, to which Henry S. Haight, Jr. subscribed upon admission to the University, provides that there shall be no such review as is now requested of a dismissal by the Honor Committee and, therefore, it was

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the request contained in said letter be and it is hereby denied

The President reminded the Board of the discussion at the meeting on 29 September 1962 (Minutes, Board of Visitors, University of Virginia, No. 12, 29 September 1962, p. 363) concerning the delays that had been encountered in certain phases of the University's construction program. The President had obtained the preparation of a very detailed report on the status of the construction schedule for each of the major projects now underway. He commented briefly on one or two aspects of this report and announced he would send a copy to each member of the Board in the very near future

The Board heard with regret the announcement of the illness of Hunter Faulconer, which had prevented him from attending this meeting of the Board and unanimously adopted the following resolution

WHEREAS we have learned with distress of the illness of our fellow Visitor, Hunter Faulconer,

NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that we wish for Mr. Faulconer a speedy and complete recovery in order that he may rejoin us in our deliberations from which he is sorely missed

The President announced the following gifts and grants

The President proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution

WHEREAS Mrs. Ida Elizabeth Merchant Tardy has made a gift of $1,000 to Mary Washington College of the University of Virginia to establish the Thomas Howard and Elizabeth Merchant Tardy Endowment Fund and has expressed her intention to include in her will a bequest of $24,000 to The Rector and Visitors to be added to that Fund,

AND WHEREAS these funds are to be used to assist in paying the expenses of certain women students at Mary Washington College,

NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that we express our deep appreciation to Mrs. Tardy for her gift of $1,000 and for her intention subsequently to leave a bequest to Mary Washington College of $24,000 and direct the Secretary of the Board to send a copy of this resolution to Mrs. Tardy as an expression of our gratitude

The President announced the following appointment

Mrs. Anne M. Hughes as Acting Librarian, part-time, for one year, effective 1 October 1962

On motion the meeting was then adjourned at 12:10 p.m.
