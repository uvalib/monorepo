**Governor’s Commission on Higher Education Reform, Innovation, and Investment**

**The Rector asked President Sullivan to review the recommendations expected from the Commission on Higher Education Reform, Innovation, and Investment, and the University’s response. Ms. Sullivan said University administrators know what to expect because the Commission presented a list of “major recommendations under consideration” on October 12.**

**Ms. Sullivan said the recommendations include increased enrollments of Virginians in public and private colleges and universities; increased production of graduates with STEM degrees; options for expediting degree attainment; optimized use of facilities; increased research collaboration among colleges and universities; and, greater use of technology-enhanced instruction to reach larger numbers of students. These are just some of the recommendations. She said the Commission has been asked to submit an interim report to the Governor by November 30, and so we will know more at that time.**

**Ms. Sullivan said many of the Commission’s “recommendations under consideration” align well with suggestions University officials have made to the Commission about ways in which the University can support the Governor’s priorities. The University suggested increasing enrollment of in-state students, especially students who enroll in the STEM fields; offering programs for accelerated bachelor’s degree completion in three years, with an option for a master’s degree in a fourth year (3+1); increased use of University facilities year-round, especially during summer and January terms; additional enrollment of adult students in Richmond, Southside, and Southwest Virginia; and, increased investments in technology-enhanced education.** 

**As the University makes its own plans in anticipation of the Commission’s recommendations, she said she is operating on a few assumptions, including that the Board intends to protect the current in-state/out-of-state student ratio (70:30).  If this is the case, enrollment will have to increase modestly to produce more spaces for Virginians: possibly 1,400 undergraduate and 100 graduate students over 4-5 years, on top of the current enrollment projections. She said the assumption is that the Board will not condone this growth without assurances that the University has adequate housing, dining, recreation spaces, need-based financial aid, and faculty and staff to serve the new students and protect the undergraduate experience.  She explained that the University expects the Commonwealth to provide appropriate funding for the additional Virginia students, and this has been made clear in the suggestions to the Commission and in discussion with members of the General Assembly.** 

**Ms. Sullivan said many Board members have thought long and hard about enrollment issues. She asked the Board Members to provide their views on enrollment so the administration has a sense of the Board’s position. She said she believes legislators will expect the University to tell them how it plans to accommodate more Virginians.**

**The Rector said the Governor seeks 100,000 new degrees and will expect the University to do its part. He said two Board committees are working together to study the student experience: Educational Policy and Student Affairs and Athletics. He reminded the Board that the state’s base budget adequacy figures were for an average state university, which is not the correct grouping for the University of Virginia. The University needs adequate funding to maintain its standing within its peer group, which is the top public and many of the private universities in the country. He said the University wants to do not only its fair share, but to be innovative in its approach to these issues. He said he hopes to come out of the process with a better understanding of how the Commonwealth views the University; does the Commonwealth want to support a flagship university?**

**President Sullivan remarked that the University cannot expand capacity without more faculty, and that is expensive. Faculty in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields require upwards of $600,000 in start-up costs.**

**The Rector asked the Board Members to hold January 28, 2011 on their calendars for a special meeting, if needed, to work through these issues.**

**Mr. Fralin said focusing on STEM fields and promoting research can be a real positive for the University and the Commonwealth, and the Commonwealth needs to find a dedicated funding source for higher education or create a “rainy day” fund for colleges and universities to maintain a certain level of funding every year. Mr. Diamonstein and Mr. Payne also commented on the need for the Commonwealth to commit to funding higher education.**

**In response to a question, Mr. Sandridge explained how they decided an increase of 1400 in undergraduate enrollment was the right number. He said, with some minor changes, the University’s infrastructure can accommodate that level of growth. He also said if the 70:30 in-state, out-of-state ratio was changed to 75:25 and enrollment stayed on its current trajectory, the increase in the number of in-state students would be about the same as if the University increased undergraduate enrollment by 1400 and maintained the 70:30 ratio. A 75:25 ratio would be very damaging to the University’s financial position.**

**Mr. Kirk remarked that there was a lack of appreciation among the body politic for the economic development potential of a flagship university. He thought the University may be too complacent about articulating its message; the University of Virginia has a unique message to tell.**

**President’s Report**

**The Rector asked President Sullivan to give her report.**

**Ms. Sullivan said she recently announced the members of the search committee that will be charged with identifying candidates to succeed Leonard Sandridge as Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. The committee represents a wide range of University constituencies. Vice Rector Helen Dragas and Board Member Heywood Fralin are on the committee. McIntire School of Commerce Dean Carl Zeithaml is the chair. The committee has met twice, and will continue its work this fall.**

**Ms. Sullivan said she has appointed a Faculty Budget Advisory Committee (FBAC) to work with administrators on financial and budgetary issues. She complimented the capable financial staff, but said it will benefit them to have more faculty expertise brought to bear on financial issues. The new committee’s work will begin in a couple of weeks.**

**Susan Carkeek has formed two new advisory committees. One will guide the planning of a staff survey. The timeline is to develop the questionnaire by the end of this semester, and begin data collection in early 2011. The final report will come out in the spring.**

**The second committee is charged with drafting a respectful workplace policy. In addition to developing this policy, the committee will identify competencies and specific behaviors that encourage civility and respectful interactions in the workplace. These competencies and behaviors will be incorporated into the performance evaluation process. This committee will begin meeting next month.**

**President Sullivan turned to the Gifts and Grants report.**

**Gifts and Grants Report**

**Philanthropic giving to the University of Virginia and its related foundations is $52,446,157.41 for the fiscal year through October 31, 2010. This is a decrease of $810,778.29, or 1.52% below the results of the previous fiscal year.**

**PREAMBLE**

The University of Virginia (the “University”) established the Optional Retirement Plan for Employees of the University of Virginia (formerly, the “Defined Contribution Plan for the General Faculty of the University of Virginia”) (the “Plan”) effective July 1, 1989. The Plan is a money purchase pension plan and was adopted to replace a defined contribution 403(b) plan that the University had provided general faculty prior to July 1, 1989. The Plan was originally a 403(a) plan funded solely through annuity contracts. However, the Plan was amended and restated effective January 1, 1996 to add the Trust for the Defined Contribution Plan for the General Faculty of the University of Virginia (the “Trust”) to provide an alternative form of funding Participants’ benefits. Various other changes were made in 1996 including amending the employer contribution formula. As a result of the 1996 restatement, the Plan is currently intended to be a qualified plan under 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), funded by both annuities that qualify under Code section 403(a) and a tax exempt 501(a) trust. The Plan was amended and restated effective January 1, 2010 to reflect technical changes and the establishment of a separate qualified excess benefit arrangement plan and to rename the Plan. The Plan is a governmental plan as described in Code section 414(d).

The Mandatory Employee Contributions shall be treated as paid by the Employer for the purpose of Code section 414(h)(2), but shall be treated as “member contributions” paid by Participants for the purpose of Virginia Code section 51.1-126.F.1.  
          
        A Participant to whom Section 3.1(c) applies shall continue to make the Mandatory Employee Contribution while receiving benefits under the Employer’s long term disability plan and while on a paid Educational Leave of Absence. Mandatory Employee Contributions shall not be made while a Participant is on an unpaid Educational Leave of Absence.

        1.  Participation In More Than One Plan

If the Employer maintains one or more qualified defined contribution plans, as defined in Code section 414(i), for Employees, some or all of whom may be Participants in this Plan, then the contributions made on behalf of a Participant in such other plans shall be aggregated with the contributions made on behalf of the Participant derived from this Plan for purposes of the limitation in Section 3.4(a) above. In the event that the Participant’s aggregate annual additions exceed the contribution limit in Section 3.4(a) for any Limitation Year, the annual additions under this Plan shall be reduced to the maximum extent necessary and reallocated in accordance with the terms found in the Qualified Governmental Excess Benefit Arrangement.

*   *   1.  No Exceeding 415 Limit

If a Participant is in qualified military service, as that term is defined under USERRA, and he returns to employment with the Employer within ninety (90) days of the end of his military leave (or such longer period of time as his reemployment rights are protected by law), the Employer shall make the contributions described in Section 3.1 above on behalf of the Participant that he otherwise would have been entitled to but for his absence due to the military leave and the Participant shall be entitled to make an irrevocable election to have his salary reduced to make the contributions described in Section 3.2 above that he otherwise would have been required to make but for his absence due to the military leave. For each period of qualified military service, the Participant may make only one irrevocable election to reduce his salary to make the contributions described in Section 3.2; such contribution shall be paid by the Employer in lieu of employee contributions and shall be treated as paid by the Employer for the purpose of Code section 414(h)(2).

*   *   1.  Limitations

Contributions made pursuant to (a) above shall not be counted for purposes of Section 3.3 during the Plan Year (Limitation Year) when they are made. Rather such contributions shall be counted for purposes of Section 3.3 in the Plan Year to which the contributions relate.

*   *   1.  Compensation

For purposes of (a) and (b) above, the Administrator shall treat the Participant as receiving Compensation during the period of qualified military service equal to the amount of Compensation the Participant would have received from the Employer during such period, based on the rate of pay the Participant would have received from the Employer but for the absence due to military service, or, if such rate of pay is not reasonably certain, the Participant’s average Compensation during (I) the twelve (12) month period immediately before the qualified military service or, (II) if shorter, the period of employment immediately before the qualified military service.

*   *   1.  Crediting of Earnings

        2.  a qualified trust as described in Code section 401(a).

When first applying to become a Participant in the Plan, as described in Section 2.1, the Eligible Employee shall also designate on the Plan application form prescribed by the Administrator whether Plan contributions should be invested in an annuity contract or the Trust. A Participant may change the investment allocation at such time or times as the Administrator may prescribe.

*   1.  Annuity Contract

The Administrator may offer one or more annuity contracts described in Section 5.1(a) above among which a Participant may choose to allocate contributions made to the Participant’s Accumulation Account. The nature and the quality of the investments offered under each of these contracts shall be determined by the Administrator. To the extent a Participant may choose among various investments offered under an annuity contract, any communication regarding such investment shall be between the sponsor of the annuity contract and the Participant. Once a Participant chooses an annuity contract to which to allocate Plan contributions, the University shall have no further responsibility regarding such contributions.

*   1.  Qualified Trust
        1.  Individual Accounts

The Administrator shall establish and maintain an Accumulation Account in the name of each Participant to which there shall be credited (or debited) a Participant’s contributions made in accordance with Sections 3.1, 3.2 or 3.3 above that the Participant has designated are to be allocated to the Trust pursuant to Section 5.1(b) above. The Administrator shall adjust, as of each Valuation Date, the balance of each Participant’s account to reflect the current market value of the Investment Funds in which each Accumulation Account was invested. A Participant’s interest in any Investment Fund shall be determined and accounted for based on his beneficial interest in any such Fund, and no Participant shall have any interest in or rights to any specific asset of any Investment Fund.

*   *   1.  Investment of Accounts
            1.  The balance held for the benefit of each Participant in his Accumulation Account shall be invested at the direction of each Participant among one or more of the Plan’s Investment Funds. The nature and the quality of the investments in each of these Funds shall be determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion. There will be at least three Investment Funds to which a Participant may allocate his Accumulation Account and each of these Funds will have a different one of the following primary objectives:
                1.  The generation of the highest level of income consistent with the preservation of capital over the long term;
                2.  Capital appreciation; and
                3.  A balance between capital appreciation and preservation of capital and generation of income.
            2.  The Administrator shall provide Participants with directions as to how to obtain information sufficient to enable Participants to make informed investment directions. Neither the Administrator nor the Trustees, however, shall provide investment advice to a Participant with respect to an investment.
            3.  Each Participant shall be responsible for directing the investment of all contributions in his Accumulation Account.

Investments shall be made in one (1) or more of the Investment Funds made available under subsection (i) hereof.
            4.  Subject to the terms and limitations of the various Investment Funds, each Participant may direct at such time or times as the Administrator may prescribe that amounts held in one or more of the Investment Funds described in subsection (i) hereof, may be transferred to, from or between such Investment Funds.
        2.  Allocations of Earnings and Losses

The dividends, capital gains distributions, and other earnings received on any share or unit of an Investment Fund that is specifically credited or earmarked to a Participant's Accumulation Account under the Plan in accordance with the directed investment provisions of this Section 5.3 shall be allocated to such account and immediately reinvested, to the extent practicable, in additional shares or units of such Investment Fund.
            2.  To the extent not otherwise provided in paragraph (i) above, the assets of each Investment Fund shall be valued by the Trustee at their current fair market value of as each Valuation Date, and the earnings and losses of the Investment Fund since the immediately preceding Valuation Date shall be allocated to the Accumulation Accounts of all Participants with interests in that Investment Fund in the ratio that the fair market value of each such interest as of the immediately preceding Valuation Date, reduced by any distributions or withdrawals therefrom since such preceding Valuation Date, bears to the total fair market value of all such interests as of the immediately preceding Valuation Date, reduced by any distributions or withdrawals therefrom since such preceding Valuation Date.
        
        1.  Allocation to Individual Accounts

The Accumulation Account of each Participant shall be adjusted as of each Valuation Date by (I) reducing such accounts by any payments made therefrom since the preceding Valuation Date, and then (II) increasing or reducing such accounts by the Participant's share of earnings and losses, determined pursuant to (c) above, and the expense of administering the Investment Funds since the preceding Valuation Date, and (III) crediting such accounts with any contributions allocated thereto since the preceding Valuation Date.

*   *   1.  Valuation for Withdrawal and Distribution

For purposes of paying the amounts to be withdrawn or distributed to a Participant or beneficiary pursuant to Section 6.2 below, the value of the Participant's Accumulation Account allocated to the Trust shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of this Section 5.3 as of the Valuation Date that is on or immediately preceding the date the distribution is made, except as otherwise determined in accordance with Section 6.3.

*   1.  Reallocation Among Annuity Contracts and the Trust

A Participant may reallocate all or a portion of his or her Accumulation Account invested in annuity contracts to the Trust, or vice versa, to the extent permitted, if at all, by the sponsor of the annuity and the Administrator.

Such request shall be made on a written form prescribed or approved by the Administrator.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Participant who is employed by any other entity controlled by the Board and who remains a Participant by virtue of a declaration of the University may receive benefits as described in the preceding paragraph only on or after the day he separates from service with that entity.

*   *   *   1.  Eligible Retirement Plan

An eligible retirement plan is (1) an individual retirement account described in Code section 408(a); (2) an individual retirement annuity described in Code section 408(b); (3) an individual retirement annuity described in Code section 403(a); (4) a qualified retirement plan described in Code section 401(a) that accepts the distributee’s eligible rollover distribution; (5) an eligible deferred compensation plan described in Code section 457(b) maintained by an eligible employer described in Code section 457(e)(1)(A) that separately accounts for eligible rollover distributions; (6) an annuity contract described in Code section 403(b); or (7) effective January 1, 2008, a Roth IRA described in Code section 408A(b) (subject to the rules and provisions set forth in Code section 408A(e) and any regulations thereunder). For a non-spouse beneficiary described in the last sentence of Section 6.4(b)(iii) an eligible retirement plan shall include only an individual retirement plan or annuity described in (1), (2), or (7) above, that is treated as an inherited IRA of the beneficiary.

*   *   *   1.  Distributee

A distributee includes a Participant or former Participant. In addition, the Participant’s or former Participant’s surviving spouse and the Participant’s or former Participant’s spouse or former spouse who is the alternate payee under an administrative domestic relations order are distributees with regard to the interest of the spouse or former spouse. Effective January 1, 2010, a Participant or former Participant’s non-spouse beneficiary is a distributee with respect to any otherwise eligible rollover distribution that is paid to the beneficiary.

*   *   *   1.  Direct Rollover

A direct rollover is a payment by the Plan to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee.

*   1.  Reemployment of Participant

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, if a Former Participant returns to the service of the Employer as an Eligible Employee after distribution of his or her benefits has begun, such distributions shall immediately cease and no benefits shall be paid until such Participant again becomes entitled to benefits under the terms of this Plan.

*   1.  Payments Made Pursuant to an Administrative Domestic Relations Order

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, the Administrator may direct the distribution of any portion of the Participant’s Accumulation Account payable to an alternate payee (as defined in Code section 414(p)(8)) pursuant to an administrative domestic relations order (as determined by the Administrator in accordance with Code section 414(p)(11)) prior to the date on which the Participant attains his or her earliest retirement age (as defined in Code section 414(p)(4)), provided that the Administrator has properly notified the affected Participant and each alternate payee of the order and has determined that the order is an administrative domestic relations order. The alternate payee shall be paid his or her separate accounts or his or her percentage of the Participant’s Accumulation Account in a lump sum payment unless the domestic relations order specifies a different manner of payment permitted by the Plan. The alternate payee shall not be required to consent to such lump sum payment.

1.  AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION
    1.  Amendment

The University reserves the right to amend the Plan, through affirmative action by the Board at any time and from time to time, in whole or in part, including, without limitation, retroactive amendments necessary or advisable to qualify the Plan and Trust under the provisions of Code sections 401(a) and 403(a). The Board may delegate its authority to amend the Plan to one or more officers of the University. Except as set forth in Section 7.3, no such amendment shall (1) cause any part of the assets of the Plan and Trust to revert to or be recoverable by the University or be used for or diverted to purposes other than the exclusive benefit of Participants, Former Participants, and beneficiaries; (2) deprive any Participant, Former Participant, or beneficiary of any benefit already vested; (3) alter, change, or modify the duties, powers, or liabilities of the Trustee without its written consent; or (4) permit any part of the assets of the Plan and the Trust to be used to pay premiums or contributions of the University under any other plan maintained by the University for the benefit of its Employees. No amendment to the vesting schedule shall deprive a Participant of unforfeitable rights to benefits accrued to the date of the amendment.

*   1.  Termination, Partial Termination, or Complete Discontinuance of Contributions

Although the Employer has established the Plan with the intention and expectation that it will make contributions indefinitely, nevertheless the Employer shall not be under any obligation or liability to continue its contributions or to maintain the Plan for any given length of time. The Employer may in its sole and absolute discretion through an affirmative action by its Board discontinue contributions or terminate the Plan in whole or in part in accordance with its provisions at any time without any liability for the discontinuance or termination. However, the Trust shall continue until the portions of Participants’ Accumulation Accounts that have been allocated to the Trust have been completely distributed to or for the benefit of such Participants in accordance with the Plan.

*   1.  Permissible Reversions
        1.  Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan:
            1.  No Participant nor beneficiary shall have any right or claim to any assets of the Trust or to any benefit under the Plan before the Internal Revenue Service determines that the Plan and Trust qualify under the provisions of Code section 401(a), or any statute of similar import, other than any vested rights or benefits accrued represented by any assets transferred from the VRS, to the extent vested upon transfer to this Plan and Trust from the VRS. Upon the distribution to the Participants of any vested amounts or benefits transferred from the VRS and the return of any remaining contributions to the Employer following the denial of initial qualification of the Plan and Trust under the provisions of Code section 401(a), the Trust provided for in this Plan shall be terminated and the Trustees shall be discharged from all obligations hereunder.
            2.  To the extent the Employer's contributions are made by reason of a mistake of fact, they may be returned to the Employer within one (1) year from the date of contribution.
        2.  The amounts that may be returned to the Employer under Section 7.3(a)(ii) above shall be the excess of the amounts contributed over the amounts that would have been contributed had there not been a mistake of fact. No earnings on the mistaken contributions may be returned to the Employer and losses sustained by the Trust after the date of contribution shall proportionately reduce the amount that may be returned to the Employer.

1.  CLAIMS

A Participant’s (or beneficiary’s) claim for benefits for the portion of the Participant's Accumulation Account allocated to an annuity contract shall be resolved by the sponsor of the annuity contract based on procedures it has established.

Nor shall any employee of the Administrator be liable for the wrongful or negligent conduct of any other or any person having fiduciary responsibilities with respect to the Plan unless the employee (i) knowingly participates in or undertakes to conceal an act or omission of such other person knowing the act or omission is a breach of fiduciary duty, (ii) by failing to act solely in the interests of Participants and beneficiaries or to exercise the care, skill, prudence and diligence under the circumstances prevailing from time to time that a prudent man acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would exercise, has enabled the other fiduciary to commit a breach, or (iii) has knowledge of a breach by the other fiduciary and does not make reasonable efforts under the circumstances to remedy it. The University shall indemnify any employee and hold him or her harmless from loss, liability and expense in respect of the Plan for actions taken within the scope of his or her duties, including the legal cost of defending claims and amounts paid in satisfaction or settlement thereof provided only that no indemnification is intended that would be void as against public policy or the laws of the Commonwealth. **\[Internal MLB Note: Is this type of indemnification permissible under state law?\]**

In no event shall any portion of the corpus or income of the Trust Fund be used for or diverted to purposes other than the exclusive benefit of Participants and their beneficiaries.

1.  MISCELLANEOUS
    1.  Limitation of Rights; Employment Relationship

*   1.  Merger; Transfer of Assets
        1.  If the Employer merges or consolidates with or into another entity, or if substantially all the assets of the Employer are transferred to another entity, the Plan shall terminate on the effective date of the merger, consolidation, or transfer. However, if the surviving entity resulting from the merger or consolidation, or the entity to which the assets have been transferred, adopts this Plan, the Plan shall continue and the successor entity shall succeed to all rights, powers, and duties of the Employer under the Plan, and the employment of any Employee who is continued in the successor entity's employ shall not be deemed to have been terminated for any purpose under the Plan.
        2.  This Plan shall not be merged or consolidated with any other employee benefit plan, nor shall there be any transfer of assets or liabilities from this Plan to any other plan, unless, immediately after the merger, consolidation, or transfer, each Participant's benefits, if the other plan were then to terminate, are at least equal to the benefits to which the Participant would have been entitled had this Plan been terminated immediately before the merger, consolidation, or transfer.
    2.  Prohibition Against Assignment
        1.  Except as provided below, the benefits provided by this Plan may not be assigned or alienated. Neither the University nor the Trustees shall recognize any transfer, mortgage, pledge, hypothecation, order, or assignment by any Participant or beneficiary of all or part of his or her interest under the Plan, and the interest shall not be subject in any manner to transfer by operation of law and shall be exempt from the claims of creditors or other claimants from all orders, decrees, levies, garnishment, and/or executions, and other legal or equitable process or proceedings against the Participant or beneficiary to the fullest extent that may be permitted by law.
        2.  This provision shall not apply to the extent a Participant or beneficiary is indebted to the Plan, for any reason, under any provision of this Agreement. At the time a distribution is to be made to or for a Participant's or beneficiary's benefit, such proportion of the amount distributed as shall equal such indebtedness, shall be paid by the Trustees to the Trustees or the Administrator, at the direction of the Administrator, to apply against or discharge such indebtedness. Prior to making a payment, however, the Participant or beneficiary must be given written notice by the Administrator that such indebtedness is to be so paid in whole or in part from his account. If the Participant or beneficiary does not agree that the indebtedness is a valid claim against his vested Accounts, he shall be entitled to a review of the validity of the claim in accordance with procedures provided in Section 8.
        3.  This provision shall not apply to an administrative domestic relations order defined in Code section 414(p), and those other domestic relations orders permitted to be so treated by the Administrator under the Code. To the extent provided under an administrative domestic relations order, a former spouse of a Participant shall be treated as the spouse or surviving spouse for all purposes under the Plan.
    3.  Applicable Law; Severability

This Plan shall be construed, administered, and governed in all respects in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth, provided, however, that if any provision is susceptible to more than one interpretation, it shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with the Plan’s being a qualified plan within the meaning of the Code. If any provision of this instrument shall be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Plan shall continue to be fully effective.

*   1.  Reliance Upon Copy of Plan

Any person dealing with the Trustees may rely upon copies of the Plan and the Trust Agreement, and any amendments thereto, certified by the Administrator to be true and correct copies.

*   1.  Gender and Number; Captions or Headings

**PREAMBLE**

The University of Virginia Medical Center (the Medical Center) originally established the Defined Contribution Plan for Health Care Professionals (the HCP Plan) effective July 1, 1993 to provide retirement benefits to a limited group of Medical Center employees who were not covered by the Defined Contribution Retirement Plan for the General Faculty of the University of Virginia (since renamed the Optional Retirement Plan for Employees of the University of Virginia). Effective January 1, 1999 the Medical Center expanded the coverage of the HCP Plan to generally include all full time salaried employees of the Medical Center. With the expansion of coverage, the HCP Plan was renamed the Defined Contribution Plan for Employees of the University of Virginia Medical Center (the "Plan") and was amended and restated effective January 1, 1999. The Plan is intended to be a qualified plan under section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), funded by both annuities that qualify under Code section 403(a) and a tax exempt Code section 501(a) trust. The Plan was amended and restated effective January 1, 2010 to reflect technical changes and the establishment of a separate qualified governmental excess benefit arrangement. The Plan is a governmental plan as described in Code section 414(d).

However, except as set forth in Section 8.3, no such amendment shall (1) cause any part of the assets of the Plan and Trust to revert to or be recoverable by the Medical Center or be used for or diverted to purposes other than the exclusive benefit of Participants, Former Participants, and beneficiaries; (2) deprive any Participant, Former Participant, or beneficiary of any benefit already vested; (3) alter, change, or modify the duties, powers, or liabilities of the Trustee without its written consent; or (4) permit any part of the assets of the Plan and the Trust to be used to pay premiums or contributions of the University or the Medical Center under any other plan maintained by the University or the Medical Center for the benefit of its employees. No amendment to the vesting schedule shall deprive a Participant of unforfeitable rights to benefits accrued to the date of the amendment.

*   1.  Termination, Partial Termination, or Complete Discontinuance of Contributions

Although the Medical Center has established the Plan with the intention and expectation that it will make contributions indefinitely, nevertheless the Medical Center shall not be under any obligation or liability to continue its contributions or to maintain the Plan for any given length of time. The Medical Center may in its sole and absolute discretion through an affirmative action by its Board discontinue contributions or terminate the Plan in whole or in part in accordance with its provisions at any time without any liability for the discontinuance or termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon termination of the Plan or complete discontinuance of contributions to the Plan, the Accumulation Accounts of all Participants shall thereupon be and become fully vested and nonforfeitable to the extent then funded, and the Trust shall continue until the portions of Participants’ Accumulation Accounts that have been allocated to the Trust have been completely distributed to or for the benefit of such Participants in accordance with the Plan.

*   1.  Permissible Reversions
        1.  Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan:
            1.  No Participant nor beneficiary shall have any right or claim to any assets of the Trust or to any benefit under the Plan before the Internal Revenue Service determines that the Plan and Trust qualify under the provisions of Code section 401(a), or any statute of similar import, other than any vested rights or benefits accrued represented by any assets transferred from the VRS, to the extent vested upon transfer to this Plan and Trust from the VRS. Upon the distribution to the Participants of any vested amounts or benefits transferred from the VRS and the return of any remaining contributions to the Medical Center following the denial of initial qualification of the Plan and Trust under the provisions of Code section 401(a), the Trust provided for in this Plan shall be terminated and the Trustees shall be discharged from all obligations hereunder.
            2.  To the extent the Medical Center's contributions are made by reason of a mistake of fact, they may be returned to the Medical Center within one (1) year from the date of contribution.
        2.  The amounts that may be returned to the Medical Center under Section 8.3(a)(ii) above shall be the excess of the amounts contributed over the amounts that would have been contributed had there not been a mistake of fact. No earnings on the mistaken contributions may be returned to the Medical Center and losses sustained by the Trust after the date of contribution shall proportionately reduce the amount that may be returned to the Medical Center.

1.  CLAIMS
    1.  Claims for Benefits Under an Annuity Contract

A Participant's (or beneficiary's) claim for benefits for the portion of the Participant's Accumulation Account allocated to an annuity contract shall be resolved by the sponsor of the annuity contract based on procedures it has established.

*   1.  Claims for Benefits Under the Trust

A Participant's (or beneficiary's) claim for benefits for the portion of the Participant's Accumulation Account invested in the Trust may be presented in writing by the Participant to the Administrator.

If the claim for benefits is wholly or partially denied, the Administrator shall notify the Participant (or beneficiary) in writing of such denial of benefits within sixty (60) days of receipt of the claim.

        2.  the specific provisions of the Plan on which the denial is based;
        3.  any additional material or information necessary for the Participant (or beneficiary) to perfect the claim and an explanation of why such material or information is necessary; and
        4.  the steps which the Participant (or beneficiary) must take to have the claim reviewed.

A Participant (or beneficiary) whose claim has been denied may file a written request for a review by the Administrator of the denial of this claim. Such written request for review must be filed within sixty (60) days after receipt of written notification of the denial of this claim. The Administrator shall review the written comments and any submissions of the Participant (or beneficiary) and render its decision regarding the appeal within sixty (60) days of receipt of such appeal. Such decision shall be in writing setting forth the specific reasons and specific Plan provisions on which the Administrator based its decision.

Pursuant to Title 23 of the Code of Virginia of 1950, as amended, the University is classified as an educational institution of the Commonwealth.

By Chapter 4.10, Title 23 of the Code of Virginia of 1950, as amended (the "Act"), the University entered into a management agreement with the Commonwealth of Virginia which was enacted as Chapter 3 of Chapter 933 of the 2006 Virginia Acts of Assembly, as amended, pursuant to which the University is classified as a public institution of higher education and the University is empowered with the authority to undertake and implement the acquisition of any interest in land, including improvements on the acquired land at the time of acquisition, new construction, improvements or renovations and to borrow money and make, issue and sell bonds of the University for such purposes, including the refinancing of any such facilities. 

Pursuant to a resolution adopted on November \_\_, 2010 (the "Authorizing Resolution"), the Board determined to refinance capital improvements to the University's educational facilities located in the City of Charlottesville, Albemarle County and Wise County, Virginia, including certain capital improvements identified therein and including the refunding of all or a portion of the outstanding principal amount of the University's Commercial Paper General Revenue Pledge Notes, Series A (Tax-Exempt) and Series B (Taxable) (the "Refunded Commercial Paper") issued to finance a portion of such capital improvements, and to refund all or a portion of the outstanding principal amount of the University's General Revenue Pledge Bonds, Series 2003B (the "Refunded Bonds" and together with the Refunded Commercial Paper, the "Refunded Indebtedness") (collectively, the "Project"), and delegated to certain officers of the University pursuant to the University's Board-approved debt and interest rate risk management policies the power to approve the final terms of such financing, within certain stated parameters.

For the purpose of financing capital improvements and other projects for the University, the University previously issued the Refunded Commercial Paper in a program dated June 15, 2006, pursuant to various resolutions adopted by the Board, including an Amended and Restated Resolution adopted February 9, 2007.

For the purposes of financing or refinancing capital improvements and other projects of the University, the University previously issued the Refunded Bonds pursuant to resolutions adopted by the Board on February 1, 2003 and by the Executive Committee of the Board on March 5, 2003.

For the purpose of providing funds, together with other available funds, to refund the Refunded Indebtedness, the Board, pursuant to the powers granted it under Section 23-75 of the Code of Virginia of 1950, as amended, has determined to adopt this resolution authorizing the issues of general revenue pledge refunding bonds of the University as Series 2010 Bonds (the "Series 2010 Bonds").

All the Series 2010 Bonds shall bear interest (a) from their dated date, if authenticated prior to March 1, 2011, or (b) otherwise from the September 1 or March 1 that is, or that immediately precedes, the date on which such Bond is authenticated (unless payment of interest is in default, in which case such Bond shall bear interest from the date of which interest has been paid).

Principal of the Series 2010 Bonds shall be payable upon presentation and surrender of the Series 2010 Bonds as they become due at the designated office of the Paying Agent.

Nothing herein shall be construed as prohibiting the University from issuing any maturity of the Series 2010 Bonds as one fully registered bond for the purpose of qualifying such Bonds for book entry registration by a Securities Depository or any similar arrangement whereby investors may hold a participation interest in such maturity of the Series 2010 Bonds.

In case any of the officers who shall have signed or attested any of the Series 2010 Bonds shall cease to be such officer or officers of the University before the Series 2010 Bonds so signed or attested shall have been issued by the University, such Series 2010 Bonds may nevertheless be delivered and issued and, upon such delivery and issue, shall be as binding upon the University as though those who signed and attested the same had continued to be such officers of the University. Any Series 2010 Bonds may be signed and attested on behalf of the University by such persons as at the actual date of execution of such Series 2010 Bonds shall be the proper officers of the University although at the nominal date of such Series 2010 Bonds any such person shall not have been such officer of the University.

Only such of the Series 2010 Bonds as shall bear thereon a certificate of authentication, manually executed by the Registrar, shall be valid or obligatory for any purpose or entitled to the benefits of this Bond Resolution, and such certificate of the Registrar shall be conclusive evidence that the Series 2010 Bonds so authenticated have been duly executed, authenticated and delivered hereunder and are entitled to the benefits of this Bond Resolution.

*   1.  **Transfer of the Series 2010 Bonds**. Any Series 2010 Bonds may, in accordance with its terms, be transferred, upon the books required to be kept pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.7, by the person in whose name it is registered, in person or by his duly authorized attorney, upon surrender of such Series 2010 Bonds for cancellation, accompanied by delivery of a written instrument of transfer, duly executed in a form approved by the Registrar. The Registrar shall not be required to transfer or exchange any Series 2010 Bond selected or called for redemption pursuant to the provisions therein or from a Record Date through the next succeeding Interest Payment Date.

Whenever any Series 2010 Bonds shall be surrendered for registration of transfer, the University shall execute and the Registrar shall authenticate and deliver a new Series 2010 Bonds, of authorized denominations of the same maturity and interest rate and for a like aggregate principal amount. Such transfer shall be without charge to the Bondholder, except that the Registrar shall require the Bondholder requesting such transfer to pay any tax or other governmental charge required to be paid with respect to such transfer.

*   1.  **Exchange of the Series 2010 Bonds**. The Series 2010 Bonds may be exchanged at the office of the Registrar for a like aggregate principal amount of the Series 2010 Bonds of other authorized denominations of the same maturity and interest rate.

    2.  **Bond Register; Notices; Persons Treated as Owners**. The Registrar will keep or cause to be kept, at its office in Richmond, Virginia, sufficient books for the registration and transfer of the Series 2010 Bonds, which shall at all times during regular business hours upon reasonable prior written notice be open to inspection by the University; and, upon presentation for such purpose, the Registrar shall, under such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, register or cause to be registered, on such books, the transfer or exchange of the Series 2010 Bonds as hereinbefore provided. Notices sent to Bondholders pursuant to this Bond Resolution shall be sent to the addresses shown on the registration books maintained by the Registrar or such other address as may be filed with the Registrar for such purpose. All notices required to be given by mail shall be given by first class mail, postage prepaid.

In addition to the other obligations imposed on the Registrar hereunder, the Registrar shall agree to deliver upon request a list of the names and addresses of the registered owners of the Series 2010 Bonds, as follows:

*   *   *   1.  to any Bondholder, if an Event of Default (as hereinafter defined) shall have occurred and be continuing; and
            2.  to the Holders of 25% or more in aggregate principal amount of the Series 2010 Bonds then outstanding, at any time.

Prior to due presentment for registration of transfer of any Bond, the Registrar shall treat the registered owner as the person exclusively entitled to payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest and the exercise of all other rights and powers of the owner, except that interest payments shall be made to the person registered as owner on the registration books of the Registrar as of the Record Date.

*   1.  **Temporary Series 2010 Bonds**. The Series 2010 Bonds may be issued in temporary form exchangeable for definitive Series 2010 Bonds when ready for delivery. Any temporary Bond may be printed, lithographed or typewritten, shall be of such denomination as may be determined by the University and may contain such reference to any of the provisions of this Bond Resolution as may be appropriate. A temporary Bond may be in the form of a single Bond payable in installments, each on the date, in the amount and at the rate of interest established for the Series 2010 Bonds maturing on such date. Every temporary Bond shall be executed by the University and be authenticated by the Registrar upon the same conditions and in substantially the same manner as the definitive Series 2010 Bonds. If the University issues temporary Series 2010 Bonds it will execute and deliver definitive Series 2010 Bonds as promptly thereafter as practicable, and thereupon the temporary Series 2010 Bonds may be surrendered, for cancellation, in exchange therefor at the designated office of the Registrar and the Registrar shall authenticate and deliver in exchange for such temporary Series 2010 Bonds an equal aggregate principal amount of definitive Series 2010 Bonds of authorized denominations of the same maturity or maturities and interest rate. Until so exchanged, the temporary Series 2010 Bonds shall be entitled to the same benefits under this Bond Resolution as definitive Series 2010 Bonds authenticated and delivered hereunder.
    2.  **Series 2010 Bonds Mutilated, Lost, Destroyed or Stolen**. If any Series 2010 Bond shall become mutilated, the University, at the expense of the Bondholder of such Series 2010 Bond, shall execute, and the Registrar shall thereupon authenticate and deliver, a new Series 2010 Bond of like tenor bearing a different number in exchange and substitution for the Series 2010 Bond so mutilated, but only upon surrender to the Registrar of the Series 2010 Bond so mutilated. Every mutilated Series 2010 Bond so surrendered to the Registrar shall be canceled by it and shall be delivered to, or upon the order of, the University. If any Series 2010 Bond shall be lost, destroyed or stolen, evidence of the ownership thereof and of such loss, destruction or theft may be submitted to the University, and the Registrar and, if such evidence be satisfactory to both of them and indemnity satisfactory to them shall be given, the University, at the expense of the Bondholder, shall execute, and the Registrar shall thereupon authenticate and deliver, a new Series 2010 Bond of like tenor bearing a different number in lieu of and in substitution for the Series 2010 Bond so lost, destroyed or stolen (or if any such Series 2010 Bond shall have matured or shall be about to mature, instead of issuing a substitute Series 2010 Bond, the Paying Agent may pay the same without surrender thereof). The University may require payment of a sum not exceeding the actual cost of preparing each new Series 2010 Bond issued under this Section and of the related expenses which may be incurred by the University, the Registrar, and the Paying Agent. Any Series 2010 Bond issued under the provisions of this Section in lieu of any Series 2010 Bond alleged to be lost, destroyed or stolen shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation on the part of the University whether or not the Bond so alleged to be lost, destroyed or stolen be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to the benefits of this Bond Resolution with all other Series 2010 Bonds secured by this Bond Resolution.
    3.  **Terms and Conditions for Issuance and Delivery of the Series 2010 Bonds**. The Series 2010 Bonds authorized by this Bond Resolution shall be executed in the form and manner hereinabove set forth and shall be deposited with the Registrar for delivery to the Underwriters pursuant to the Bond Purchase Agreement, but before the Series 2010 Bonds shall be delivered by the Registrar, there shall be filed with the Registrar the following:
        1.  a copy, certified by the Secretary of the Board, of this Bond Resolution;
        2.  an opinion of Bond Counsel stating that the Series 2010 Bonds have been duly authorized, executed and delivered in accordance with the Act and this Resolution and constitute valid and binding limited obligations of the University, payable solely from the Pledged Revenues and other property pledged therefor under this Resolution.

When the documents mentioned above in this Section shall have been filed with the Registrar and when the Series 2010 Bonds shall have been executed as required by this Bond Resolution, the Registrar shall deliver such Bonds to or upon the order of the Underwriters pursuant to the Bond Purchase Agreement, but only upon payment to the Custodian of the purchase price of such Bonds. The Registrar shall be entitled to rely upon such Bond Purchase Agreement as to the names of the purchasers and the amount of such purchase price.

The proceeds of such Bonds shall be deposited as described by the Custodian in Section 4.1.

*   1.  **Book Entry Provisions**. The provisions of this Section 2.11 shall apply to the Series 2010 Bonds so long as all of the Series 2010 Bonds shall be maintained in book-entry form with a Securities Depository, any other provisions of this Bond Resolution to the contrary notwithstanding.
        1.  The principal or redemption price of and interest on the Series 2010 Bonds shall be payable to the Securities Depository, or registered assigns, as the registered owner of the Series 2010 Bonds, in same day funds on each date on which the principal of, and premium, if any, or interest on the Series 2010 Bonds is due as set forth in this Bond Resolution and in the Series 2010 Bonds. Such payments shall be made to the offices of the Securities Depository specified by the Securities Depository to the University and Paying Agent in writing. Without notice to or the consent of the beneficial owners of the Series 2010 Bonds, the University and the Securities Depository may agree in writing to make payments of principal and interest in a manner different from that set out herein. If such different manner of payment is agreed upon, the University shall give the Paying Agent written notice thereof, and the Paying Agent shall make payments as if set forth herein. Neither the University nor the Paying Agent shall have any obligation with respect to the transfer or crediting of the appropriate principal, premium, if any, and interest payments to participants of the Securities Depository or the beneficial owners of the Series 2010 Bonds or their nominees.
        2.  The Paying Agent at the written direction of the University may replace any Securities Depository as the depository for the Series 2010 Bonds with another qualified securities depository or discontinue the maintenance of the Series 2010 Bonds in book-entry form at any time if the University determines to do so. Notice of any determination above shall be given to such Securities Depository at least 30 days prior to any such discontinuation (or such fewer number of days as shall be acceptable to such Securities Depository). The University may undertake to locate a qualified replacement Securities Depository and/or may discontinue the book-entry system of evidencing ownership of the Series 2010 Bonds.
        3.  If the University discontinues the maintenance of the Series 2010 Bonds in book-entry form, the University will issue replacement Series 2010 Bonds directly to the participants in the former Securities Depository or, to the extent requested by any such participant, to the beneficial owners of the Series 2010 Bonds as further described in this Section. At the written direction of the University, the Paying Agent shall notify participants and the beneficial owners of the Series 2010 Bonds, by mailing an appropriate notice to the Securities Depository, or by other means deemed appropriate by either the Securities Depository or the Paying Agent, that the University will issue replacement Series 2010 Bonds directly to the participants shown on the records of the Securities Depository or, to the extent requested by any participant, to beneficial owners of the Series 2010 Bonds shown on the records of such participant, as of a date set forth in such notice, which shall be a date at least 10 days after receipt of such notice by the Securities Depository (or such fewer number of days as shall be acceptable to the Securities Depository).

In the event that replacement Series 2010 Bonds are to be issued to participants in the Securities Depository or to beneficial owners of the Series 2010 Bonds, the University shall promptly have prepared replacement Series 2010 Bonds registered in the names of the participants as shown on the records of the former Securities Depository or, to the extent requested by any participant, in the names of the beneficial owners of Series 2010 Bonds shown on the records of such participant, as of the date set forth in the notice delivered in accordance with the immediately preceding paragraph. Replacement Series 2010 Bonds issued to participants in the Securities Depository or to beneficial owners shall be in fully registered form substantially in the form of Exhibit A. The form set forth in Exhibit A may be modified to include any variations, omissions or insertions that are necessary or desirable in the delivery of replacement certificates in printed form. In delivering replacement certificates, the Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely, without independent investigation, on the records of the former Securities Depository as to its participants and the records of the participants acting on behalf of the beneficial owners. The Series 2010 Bonds will thereafter be registrable and exchangeable as set forth in Sections 2.6 and 2.7.

*   *   1.  So long as there is a Securities Depository for the Series 2010 Bonds, (1) such Securities Depository shall be the registered owner of the Series 2010 Bonds, (2) transfers of ownership and exchanges shall be effected on the records of the Securities Depository and its participants pursuant to rules and procedures established by such Securities Depository and its participants, and (3) references in this Bond Resolution to Bondholders, Holders or registered owners of the Series 2010 Bonds shall mean the Securities Depository and shall not mean the beneficial owners of the Series 2010 Bonds.
        2.  If the University replaces any Securities Depository as the depository for the Series 2010 Bonds with another qualified Securities Depository, replacement Series 2010 Bonds issued to such replacement Securities Depository shall have the same terms, form and content as the Series 2010 Bonds initially registered in the name of the predecessor Securities Depository or its nominee except for the name of the registered owner.
        3.  Each Securities Depository and the participants thereof and the beneficial owners of the Series 2010 Bonds, by their acceptance of the Series 2010 Bonds, agree that the University and the Paying Agent shall have no liability or responsibility with respect to (1) the accuracy of any records maintained by such Securities Depository or any Securities Depository participant; (2) the payment by such Securities Depository to any Securities Depository participant or by any Securities Depository participant to any beneficial owner of any amount due in respect of the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on the Series 2010 Bonds; (3) the delivery or timeliness of delivery by such Securities Depository to any Securities Depository participant or by any Securities Depository participant to any beneficial owner of any notice which is given to Bondholders; (4) the selection of the beneficial owners to receive payment in the event of any partial redemption of the Series 2010 Bonds; or (5) any consent given or other action taken by such Securities Depository or any nominee of such Securities Depository, as Bondholder.

On or before the 70th day next preceding any mandatory sinking fund redemption date, the University may apply as a credit against its mandatory sinking fund redemption obligation for any Series 2010 Bonds maturing on such date, any Series 2010 Bonds that previously have been optionally redeemed or purchased and canceled or surrendered for cancellation by the University and not previously applied as a credit against any mandatory sinking fund redemption obligation for such Series 2010 Bonds. Each such Series 2010 Bond so purchased, delivered or previously redeemed shall be credited at 100% of the principal amount thereof against the principal amount of the Series 2010 Bonds required to be redeemed on such mandatory sinking fund redemption date. Any principal amount of Series 2010 Bonds so purchased, delivered or previously redeemed in excess of the principal amount required to be redeemed on such mandatory sinking fund redemption date shall similarly reduce the principal amount of the Series 2010 Bonds to be redeemed on future mandatory sinking fund redemption dates, as selected by the Chief Operating Officer or the Chief Financial Officer.

*   *   1.  The Series 2010 Bonds shall also be subject to redemption in whole or in part on any date, at the option of the University, from the proceeds of casualty insurance or condemnation awards, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed, without premium, plus accrued interest to the redemption date, if all or any part of the Project financed or refinanced with the Series 2010 Bonds is damaged or destroyed or taken through the exercise of the power of eminent domain and the Chief Operating Officer or Chief Financial Officer has delivered a certificate to the Custodian to the effect that the University has determined not to use such proceeds to replace or rebuild the damaged, destroyed or taken property. In the event of a redemption in part pursuant to this paragraph, the University shall redeem the Series 2010 Bonds from each maturity then outstanding, to the extent practicable, in the proportion that the principal amount of the Series 2010 Bonds of such maturity bears to the total principal amount of the Series 2010 Bonds then outstanding.
        2.  Subject to applicable procedures of the Securities Depository while the Series 2010 Bonds are held in book-entry only form by the Securities Depository, if less than all of the Series 2010 Bonds are to be called for redemption, the Series 2010 Bonds to be redeemed shall be selected by the University in such manner as the University in its discretion may determine.
    
    1.  **Notice of Redemption**. Whenever the Series 2010 Bonds are to be redeemed under the provisions of this Bond Resolution, the Paying Agent shall, not less than thirty (30) nor more than sixty (60) days prior to the redemption date, mail notice of redemption to all registered owners of all Series 2010 Bonds to be redeemed at their registered addresses. The Paying Agent shall also mail a copy of any such notice of redemption to any Rating Agency. Any such notice of redemption shall identify the Series 2010 Bonds to be redeemed, shall specify the redemption date and the redemption price, and shall state that on the redemption date the Series 2010 Bonds called for redemption will be payable at the designated office of the Paying Agent and that from that date interest will cease to accrue. The Paying Agent may use "CUSIP" numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Bondholders, provided that any such notice shall state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Series 2010 Bonds or as contained in any such notice.
        1.  If at the time of mailing of notice of any optional redemption the University shall not have caused to be deposited with the Paying Agent money sufficient to redeem all the Series 2010 Bonds called for redemption, such notice may state that it is conditional in that it is subject to the deposit of such moneys with the Paying Agent not later than the redemption date, and such notice shall be of no effect unless such moneys are so deposited. Failure by the Paying Agent to give any notice of redemption or any defect in such notice as to any particular Bonds shall not affect the validity of the call for redemption of any Bonds in respect of which no such failure or defect has occurred. Any notice mailed as provided in this Bond Resolution shall be conclusively presumed to have been given whether or not actually received by any Holder.
    2.  **Effect of Calling for Redemption**. On the date designated for redemption, notice having been mailed in the manner and under the conditions hereinabove provided and moneys for payment of the redemption price being held in separate accounts by the Paying Agent in trust for the Holders of the Series 2010 Bonds to be redeemed, all as provided in this Bond Resolution, the Series 2010 Bonds so called for redemption shall become and be due and payable at the redemption price provided for redemption of such Bonds on such date, interest on the Series 2010 Bonds so called for redemption shall cease to accrue, such Bonds shall cease to be entitled to any benefit or security under this Bond Resolution and the Holders or registered owners of such Bonds shall have no rights with respect thereto except to receive payment of the redemption price.
    3.  **The Series 2010 Bonds Redeemed Not Deemed Outstanding**. The Series 2010 Bonds which have been duly called for redemption under the provisions of this Article, or with respect to which irrevocable instructions to call for redemption have been given by the Board to the Paying Agent in form satisfactory to him or her, and for the payment of the redemption price of which moneys shall be held in separate accounts by the Paying Agent in trust for the Holders of the Series 2010 Bonds to be redeemed, all as provided in this Bond Resolution, shall not thereafter be deemed to be outstanding under the provisions of this Bond Resolution.

    REVENUES AND FUNDS
    1.  **Debt Service Fund**. A fund shall be created by the Paying Agent designated "The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia General Revenue Pledge Refunding Bonds, Series 2010, Debt Service Fund" (the "Debt Service Fund"). All accrued interest, if any, received from the purchasers of the Series 2010 Bonds, as provided in Section 4.1, shall be transferred to the Paying Agent to the credit of the Debt Service Fund. On or before the day preceding each date on which payments of interest, premium or principal shall be due and payable on the Series 2010 Bonds (a "Payment Date"), the University shall transfer or cause to be transferred to the Paying Agent for deposit an amount of money sufficient to cause the amount held in the Debt Service Fund to be equal to the interest, premium and principal due on the Series 2010 Bonds on such Payment Date. The Paying Agent shall cause payment of the amounts due on the Series 2010 Bonds on each such Payment Date.
    2.  **Payments to Bondholders**. The Paying Agent shall, at appropriate times on or before each Payment Date, withdraw from the Debt Service Fund the amounts needed on such date to pay the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on the Series 2010 Bonds and shall pay or cause the same to be paid to the Bondholders as such principal, premium and interest become due and payable.
    3.  **Pledge of Funds and Accounts**. The moneys in the Debt Service Fund shall be held in trust and applied as herein provided and, pending such application, shall be pledged to, and subject to a lien and charge in favor, of the Holders of the Series 2010 Bonds issued and outstanding under this Bond Resolution and for the further security of such Holders until paid out or transferred as herein provided.
    4.  **Moneys Held in Trust**. All moneys from the funds of the University or that the University shall have received from any other source and set aside or deposited with any Paying Agent for the purpose of paying any of the Series 2010 Bonds hereby secured, either at the maturity thereof or upon call for redemption, shall be held in trust for the respective Holders of such Bonds. Any moneys which shall be so set aside or deposited and which shall remain unclaimed by the Holders of such Bonds for the period of five (5) years after the date on which such Bonds shall have become due and payable shall be disposed of by the University and the Paying Agent in accordance with The Uniform Disposition of Unclaimed Property Act, Chapter 11.1, Title 55, Code of Virginia of 1950, as amended (the "Unclaimed Property Act"). The Paying Agent shall be entitled to act in good faith in reliance on written direction from the University or its counsel in complying with the Unclaimed Property Act, absent the Paying Agent's negligence or willful misconduct.
    5.  **Cancellation of the Series 2010 Bonds Upon Payment**.

*   1.  **Reserved**.
    2.  **Additional Indebtedness and Encumbrances.** Except as otherwise provided in this Section, nothing in this Bond Resolution shall be construed as prohibiting or limiting in any way the right of the University to incur other Credit Obligations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, the University may only incur the following types of Credit Obligations in the event the conditions set forth below are met in each instance:
        1.  Limitation on Parity Credit Obligations. The University may incur, assume, guarantee or otherwise become liable on any Parity Credit Obligation, but only if, prior to the incurrence of each such Parity Credit Obligation, an Authorized Officer of the University certifies in writing that (1) taking into account the incurrence of such proposed Parity Credit Obligation (i) the University will have sufficient funds to meet all of its financial obligations, including its obligations to pay principal of and interest on all Credit Obligations, for all Fiscal Years to and including the second full Fiscal Year after the later of (A) the issuance of such Parity Credit Obligation and (B) the completion of any facility financed with the proceeds of such Parity Credit Obligation, and (ii) such Authorized Officer has no reason to believe that the University will not have sufficient funds to pay all amounts due under all indebtedness of the University during the term of such proposed Parity Credit Obligation, and (2) to the best of his or her knowledge, the University is not in default in the performance and observance of any of the provisions of this Bond Resolution. Any such Parity Credit Obligation shall be secured by a pledge of Pledged Revenues on a parity with the pledge of Pledged Revenues herein, unless expressly subordinated to the pledge hereof.
        2.  Limitation on Section 9(c) Credit Obligations. The University may incur, assume, guarantee or otherwise become liable on any Credit Obligation pursuant to the provisions of Article X, Section 9(c) of the Constitution of Virginia, as such section may be amended from time to time, and may pledge and apply such portion of the Pledged Revenues as may be necessary to provide for the payment of any such Credit Obligation, the funding of reasonable reserves therefor, or the payment of operating and other reasonable expenses of the facilities financed in whole or in part with the proceeds of such Credit Obligation or facilities reasonably related to such facilities, and such pledge shall be senior and superior in all respects to the pledge of Pledged Revenues securing the Series 2010 Bonds and any other Parity Credit Obligations, but only if, prior to the incurrence of each such Credit Obligation, an Authorized Officer of the University certifies in writing that (1) taking into account the incurrence of such proposed Credit Obligation (i) the University will have sufficient funds to meet all of its financial obligations, including its obligations to pay principal of and interest on all Credit Obligations, for all Fiscal Years to and including the second full Fiscal Year after the later of (A) the issuance of such proposed Credit Obligation and (B) the completion of any facility financed with the proceeds of such proposed Credit Obligation, and (ii) such Authorized Officer has no reason to believe that the University will not have sufficient funds to pay all amounts due under all indebtedness of the University during the term of such proposed Credit Obligation, (2) to the best of his or her knowledge, the University is not in default in the performance and observance of any of the provisions of this Bond Resolution, and (3) in connection with the issuance of such proposed Credit Obligation, the University has received an opinion of Bond Counsel to the effect that such proposed Credit Obligation has been validly issued under Article X, Section 9(c) of the Constitution of Virginia.
        3.  Limitation on Other Credit Obligations, Including Section 9(d) Credit Obligations. The University may incur, assume, guarantee or otherwise become liable on any Credit Obligation not described elsewhere in this Section 6.3, including any Credit Obligation incurred pursuant to the provisions of Article X, Section 9(d) of the Constitution of Virginia, as such section may be amended from time to time, and may pledge and apply such portion of the Pledged Revenues as may be necessary for the payment of any such Credit Obligation, the funding of reasonable reserves therefor, or the payment of operating and other reasonable expenses of the facilities financed in whole or in part with the proceeds of such Credit Obligation or facilities reasonably related to such facilities and such pledge shall be senior and superior in all respects to the pledge of Pledged Revenues securing the Series 2010 Bonds and any other Parity Credit Obligations, but only if, prior to the incurrence of each such Credit Obligation, an Authorized Officer of the University certifies in writing that (1) taking into account the incurrence of such proposed Credit Obligation (i) the University will have sufficient funds to meet all of its financial obligations, including its obligations to pay principal of and interest on all Credit Obligations, for all Fiscal Years to and including the second full Fiscal Year after the later of (A) the issuance of such proposed Credit Obligation and (B) the completion of any facility financed with the proceeds of such proposed Credit Obligation, and (ii) such Authorized Officer has no reason to believe that the University will not have sufficient funds to pay all amounts due under all indebtedness of the University during the term of such proposed Credit Obligation, (2) to the best of his or her knowledge, the University is not in default in the performance and observance of any of the provisions of this Bond Resolution, and (3) the University has received an opinion of Bond Counsel to the effect that such proposed Credit Obligation has been validly issued under the relevant provisions of the Constitution of Virginia.
        4.  Limitation on Issuance of Indebtedness on a Parity with Qualifying Senior Obligations. Except for Credit Obligations issued pursuant to subsections (b) or (c) above or to refund any Qualifying Senior Obligation as described in subsection (e) below, no additional bonds or other obligations may be issued or incurred by the University on a parity with any Qualifying Senior Obligation.
        5.  Limitation on Additional Encumbrances. The University shall not encumber the Pledged Revenues in any manner (except as permitted in connection with Credit Obligations issued pursuant to subsections (a), (b) or (c) above or to refund any Qualifying Senior Obligation as described below), unless any such encumbrance is made junior and subordinate in all respects to the liens, pledges, covenants and agreements of this Bond Resolution. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, however, the University may issue bonds to refund any Qualifying Senior Obligation and to secure such refunding bonds with the same source of revenues securing the Qualifying Senior Obligation being refunded. Upon the defeasance of the refunded Qualifying Senior Obligation pursuant to any such refunding, the refunding bonds will be considered Qualifying Senior Obligations for all purposes.
    3.  **Disposition of Assets**. The University may convey, sell or otherwise dispose of any property of the University as long as (1) such conveyance, sale or encumbrance is in the ordinary course of business, or (2) an Authorized Officer certifies in writing that, taking into account the conveyance, sale or other disposition of such property (i) the University will have sufficient funds to meet all of its financial obligations, including its obligations to pay principal of and interest on all Credit Obligations for all Fiscal Years to and including the second full Fiscal Year after such conveyance, sale or other disposition and (ii) such Authorized Officer has no reason to believe that the University will not have sufficient funds to pay all amounts due under all indebtedness of the University then outstanding.
    4.  **Insurance**. The University covenants that it will at all times carry or cause to be carried insurance policies with a responsible insurance company or companies, qualified to assume the risks thereof, or that it will maintain an adequate program of self-insurance, in either case sufficient to provide the University with insurance in such amount and covering such risks as the University shall deem to be reasonable and desirable.
    5.  **Rights of Bondholders Not to Be Impaired**. Except as otherwise set forth herein, the University covenants that no contract or contracts will be entered into or any action taken which might impair or diminish the rights of the Bondholders.
    6.  **Further Instruments and Actions**. The University covenants that it will, from time to time, execute and deliver such further instruments and take such further action as may be required to carry out the purposes of this Bond Resolution.
    7.  **Accurate Records and Accounts**. The University covenants that it will keep accurate records and accounts of all items of cost and of all expenditures relating to Pledged Revenues collected and the application of such Pledged Revenues.
    8.  **Recognized Accounting Principles**. The University covenants that all of the accounts and records of the University will be kept according to generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied.
    9.  **Tax Covenants**. The University shall not use or permit the use of any proceeds of Series 2010 Bonds or any other funds of the University, directly or indirectly, to acquire any securities or obligation, and shall not use or permit the use of any amounts received by the University or the Custodian with respect to the Series 2010 Bonds in any manner, and shall not take or permit to be taken any other action or actions, which would cause any Bond to be an "arbitrage bond" within the meaning of Section 148 of the Code. If at any time the University is of the opinion that for purposes of this subsection it is necessary to restrict or limit the yield on the investment of any moneys held under this Bond Resolution the University shall so instruct the Custodian, any trustee or the Paying Agent in writing, and such Custodian, trustee or Paying Agent shall take such action as may be reasonably necessary in accordance with such issuance.
        1.  The University shall not use or permit the use of any proceeds of Series 2010 Bonds or any other funds of the University, directly or indirectly, in any manner, and shall not take or permit to be taken any other action or actions, which would result in any of the Series 2010 Bonds being treated as an obligation not described in Section 103(a) of the Code by reason of classification of such Bond as a "private activity bond" (except for those Series 2010 Bonds which the University has designated or allocated as "private activity bonds" benefiting a 501(c)(3) organization) or an "arbitrage bond" or "bond not in registered form" within the meaning of Section 103(b) of the Code.
        2.  The University shall at all times do and perform all acts and things permitted by law and this Bond Resolution which are necessary or desirable in order to ensure that interest paid on the Series 2010 Bonds or any of them will be excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes and shall take no action that would result in such interest not being excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes.
        3.  The University covenants that it shall file the information report with respect to the Series 2010 Bonds required by Section 149(e) of the Code (currently Form 8038-G) within the time period provided in such Section.
        4.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the University may amend this section or alter or eliminate any actions or restrictions allowed or required by this section, if it receives an opinion of Bond Counsel that such amendments, alterations or eliminations would not alter the Bondholders' U.S. federal income tax treatment of principal and interest payments on the Series 2010 Bonds.

    EVENTS OF DEFAULT AND REMEDIES
    1.  **Events of Default**. Each of the following events is hereby declared to be an "Event of Default" under this Bond Resolution:
        1.  due and punctual payment of the principal, purchase price or redemption premium, if any, of any of the Series 2010 Bonds is not made when the same become due and payable, either at maturity or by proceedings for redemption or otherwise;
        2.  due and punctual payment of any interest on any of the Series 2010 Bonds is not made when the same becomes due and payable;
        3.  the University, for any reason, is rendered incapable of fulfilling its obligations hereunder;
        4.  an order or decree is entered, with the consent or acquiescence of the University, appointing a receiver or receivers of the University or any part thereof or of the revenues thereof, or if such order or decree, having been entered without the consent or acquiescence of the University, is not vacated or discharged or stayed on appeal within sixty (60) days after the entry thereof;
        5.  any proceeding is instituted, with the consent or acquiescence of the University, for the purpose of effecting a composition between the University and its creditors or for the purpose of adjusting the claims of such creditors pursuant to any federal or state statute now or hereafter enacted; or
        6.  the University defaults in the due and punctual performance of any other of the covenants, conditions, agreements and provisions contained in the Series 2010 Bonds or in this Bond Resolution on the part of the University to be performed, and such default continues for thirty (30) days after written notice specifying such default and requiring same to be remedied is given to the Board by any Bondholder, provided that if such default is such that it can be corrected but cannot be corrected within such thirty (30) day period, it shall not constitute an Event of Default if corrective action is instituted by the University within such period and is diligently pursued until the default is corrected.
    2.  **Remedies**. Upon the happening and continuance of an Event of Default, hereunder, the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Series 2010 Bonds, by instrument or instruments filed with the University and proved or acknowledged in the same manner as a deed to be recorded, may appoint a trustee to represent the Holders of the Series 2010 Bonds for the purposes herein, which trustee may be the State Treasurer and shall be the same trustee so appointed with respect to all other outstanding Parity Credit Obligations. Such trustee may, and upon written request of the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Series 2010 Bonds then outstanding shall, in its own name:

by mandamus or other suit, action or proceeding at law or in equity enforce all rights of the Holders of the Series 2010 Bonds, including the right to require the University and its Board to collect fees, rents, charges or other revenues adequate to carry out an agreement as to, or pledge of, such revenues, and to require the University and Board to carry out any other agreements with the Holders of the Series 2010 Bonds and to perform it and their duties under the Act;

bring suit upon the Series 2010 Bonds;

by action or suit in equity, require the University to account as if it were the trustee of an express trust for the Holders of the Series 2010 Bonds; or

by action or suit in equity, enjoin any acts or things which may be unlawful or in violation of the rights of the Holders of the Series 2010 Bonds.

*   *   1.  Any such trustee, whether or not all such Series 2010 Bonds have been declared due and payable, shall be entitled as of right to the appointment of a receiver who may enter and take possession of any property of the University any of the revenues from which are pledged for the security of the Series 2010 Bonds and operate and maintain the same and collect and receive all fees, rents, charges and other revenues thereafter arising therefrom in the same manner as the University itself might do and shall deposit all such moneys in a separate account and apply the same in such manner as the court appointing such receiver shall direct. In any suit, action or proceeding by the trustee the fees, counsel fees and expenses of the trustee and of the receiver, if any, shall constitute taxable costs and disbursements and all costs and disbursements allowed by the court shall be a first charge on any fees, rents, charges and other revenues of the University pledged for the security of the Series 2010 Bonds.

Such trustee shall, in addition to the foregoing, have and possess all of the powers necessary or appropriate for the exercise of any functions specifically set forth herein or incident to the general representation of the Holders of the Series 2010 Bonds in the enforcement and protection of their rights.

*   *   1.  To the extent permitted by law, upon the happening and continuance of any Event of Default, then and in every such case any Bondholder may proceed, subject to the provisions of Section 7.5, to protect and enforce the rights of the Bondholders by a suit, action or special proceeding in equity or at law, either for the specific performance of any covenant or agreement contained herein or in aid or execution of any power herein granted or for the enforcement of any proper legal or equitable remedy as such Bondholder shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce such rights.
    
    1.  **Pro Rata Application of Funds**. Anything in this Bond Resolution to the contrary notwithstanding, if at any time the moneys available in the Debt Service Fund shall not be sufficient to pay the interest on or the principal of the Series 2010 Bonds as the same shall become due and payable, such moneys, together with any moneys then available or thereafter becoming available for such purpose, whether through the exercise of the remedies provided for in this Article or otherwise, shall be applied as follows:
        1.  If the principal of all the Series 2010 Bonds shall not have become due and payable, all such moneys shall be applied:

first: to the payment to the persons entitled thereto of all installments of interest then due and payable in the order in which such installments became due and payable and, if the amount available shall not be sufficient to pay in full any particular installment, then to the payment, ratably, according to the amounts due on such installment, to the persons entitled thereto, without any discrimination or preference except as to any difference in the respective rates of interest specified in the Series 2010 Bonds; and

second: to the payment to the persons entitled thereto of the unpaid principal of any of the Series 2010 Bonds which shall have become due and payable (other than Series 2010 Bonds called for redemption for the payment of which moneys are held pursuant to the provisions of this Bond Resolution), in the order of their due dates, with interest on the principal amount of such Series 2010 Bonds at the respective rates specified therein from the respective dates upon which such Series 2010 Bonds became due and payable, and, if the amount available shall not be sufficient to pay in full the principal of the Series 2010 Bonds due and payable on any particular date, together with such interest, then to the payment first of such interest, ratably, according to the amount of such interest due on such date, and then to the payment of such principal, ratably, according to the amount of such principal due on such date, to the persons entitled thereto without any discrimination or preference.

*   *   1.  If the principal of all the Series 2010 Bonds shall have become due and payable, all such moneys shall be applied to the payment of the principal and interest then due and unpaid on the Series 2010 Bonds, without preference or priority of principal over interest or interest over principal, or of any installment of interest over any other installment of interest, or of any Bond over any other Bond, ratably, according to the amounts due, respectively, for principal and interest, to the persons entitled thereto, without any discrimination or preference.

Whenever moneys are to be applied by the trustee pursuant to the provisions of this Section, such moneys shall be applied by the trustee at such times, and from time to time, as the trustee in his or her sole discretion shall determine, having due regard to the amount of such moneys available for application and the likelihood of additional moneys becoming available for such application in the future; the deposit of such moneys with any Paying Agent, or otherwise setting aside such moneys, in trust for the proper purpose shall constitute proper application by the trustee; and the trustee shall incur no liability whatsoever to the Board, to any Bondholder or to any other person for any delay in applying any such moneys, so long as the trustee acts with reasonable diligence, having due regard to the circumstances, and ultimately applies the same in accordance with such provisions of this Bond Resolution as may be applicable at the time of application by the trustee. Whenever the trustee shall exercise such discretion in applying such moneys, he or she shall fix the date (which shall be an Interest Payment Date unless the trustee shall deem another date more suitable) upon which such application is to be made and upon such date interest on the amounts of principal to be paid on such date shall cease to accrue. The trustee shall give such notice (or shall cause the Paying Agent to give such notice) as he or she may deem appropriate of the fixing of any such date and shall not be required to make payment to the Holder of any Bond until such Bond shall be surrendered to the trustee or any Paying Agent for appropriate endorsement, or for cancellation if fully paid.

Notwithstanding anything in this Bond Resolution to the contrary, this Section 7.3 shall be interpreted so that term "Series 2010 Bonds" or "Bonds" shall include the Series 2010 Bonds and any Parity Credit Obligations. In each resolution authorizing the issuance of any Parity Credit Obligation, the University agrees to provide for the trustee or paying agent thereunder to be the same entity as under this Bond Resolution, and further agrees to include provisions substantially identical to those contained in this Section 7.3.

*   1.  **Effect of Discontinuance of Proceedings**. In case any proceeding taken by any Bondholder on account of any Event of Default shall have been discontinued or abandoned for any reason, then and in every such case the University and the Bondholders shall be restored to their former positions and rights hereunder, respectively, and all rights and remedies of the Bondholders shall continue as though no such proceeding had been taken.
    2.  **Proceedings for Equal Benefit of All Bondholders**. No Bondholder shall have any right in any manner whatever to affect, disturb or prejudice the security of this Bond Resolution or to enforce any right hereunder, except in the manner herein provided, and all proceedings at law or in equity shall be instituted, had and maintained for the equal benefit of all Bondholders.
    3.  **No Remedy Exclusive**. No remedy herein conferred on the Bondholders is intended to be exclusive of any other remedy or remedies, and each and every remedy conferred shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to every other remedy given hereunder and under the Act or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute.
    4.  **No Delay or Omission Construed to Be a Waiver**. No delay or omission of any Bondholder to exercise any right or power accruing upon any Event of Default occurring and continuing as aforesaid shall impair any such right or power or shall be construed to be a waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence therein; and every power and remedy given by this Article to the Bondholders may be exercised from time to time and as often as may be deemed expedient.

1.    
      
    EXECUTION OF INSTRUMENTS BY BONDHOLDERS AND  
    PROOF OF OWNERSHIP OF THE SERIES 2010 BONDS

Any request, direction, consent or other instrument in writing required or permitted by this Bond Resolution to be signed or executed by Bondholders may be in any number of concurrent instruments of similar tenor and may be signed or executed by such Bondholders or their attorneys or legal representatives. Proof of the execution of any such instrument and of the ownership of the Series 2010 Bonds shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Bond Resolution and shall be conclusive in favor of the University and the Paying Agent with regard to any action taken by them under such instrument if made in the following manner:
        1.  The fact and date of the execution by any person of any such instrument may be proved by the verification of any officer in any jurisdiction who, by the laws thereof, has power to take affidavits within such jurisdiction, to the effect that such instrument was subscribed and sworn to before him or her, or by an affidavit of a witness to such execution. Where such execution is by an officer of a corporation or association or a member of a partnership on behalf of such corporation, association or partnership such verification or affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of his or her authority.
        2.  The fact of the holding of the Series 2010 Bonds hereunder by any Bondholder and the amount and the numbers of such Series 2010 Bonds and the date of its holding the same shall be proved by the registration books kept under the provisions of Section 2.7.

PRINCIPAL AMOUNT: ONE HUNDRED FORTY-FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ($145,000,000)

The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia (the "University"), an educational institution established by the Commonwealth of Virginia, for value received, hereby promises to pay, solely from the revenues provided therefor, as hereinafter set forth, to the registered owner named above, on the maturity date set forth above (or earlier as hereinafter set forth), upon the presentation and surrender hereof, the principal sum set forth above and to pay, solely from such revenues, interest thereon from the date hereof at the rate per annum set forth above, until payment of said principal sum. Both the principal of and the interest on this Series 2010 Bond are payable in any coin or currency of the United States of America which on the respective dates of payment thereof is legal tender for the payment of public and private debts. The principal or redemption price of this Series 2010 Bond shall be payable, upon surrender of this Series 2010 Bond, at the office of The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., Richmond, Virginia, as Paying Agent, or at the designated corporate trust office of any successor Paying Agent appointed pursuant to the Series 2010 Resolutions (hereinafter defined). Payment of interest on this Series 2010 Bond shall be made by check or draft mailed on the applicable Interest Payment Date to the registered owner as of the close of business on the 15th date of the month immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date (a "Record Date") at its address as it appears in the registration books of the Registrar appointed pursuant to the Series 2010 Resolutions. The term "Interest Payment Date" with respect to the Series 2010 Bonds means each March 1 and September 1, commencing March 1, 2011.

This Series 2010 Bond shall bear interest from the Interest Payment Date next preceding the date on which it is authenticated, unless this Series 2010 Bond is (a) authenticated before the first Interest Payment Date following the initial delivery of the Series 2010 Bonds, in which case it shall bear interest from its dated date, or (b) authenticated upon an Interest Payment Date, in which case it shall bear interest from such Interest Payment Date; provided, however, that if at the time of authentication of this Series 2010 Bond interest is in default, this Series 2010 Bond shall bear interest from the date to which interest has been paid. Interest on this Series 2010 Bond shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.

The University shall not be obligated to pay the principal of or interest on this Series 2010 Bond except from the Pledged Revenues of the University and other legally available moneys, all as provided in the Series 2010 Resolutions. "Pledged Revenues" are all of the revenues now or hereafter lawfully available to the University which are not required by law, by binding contract entered into prior to the adoption of the Series 2010 Resolutions or, in certain circumstances described in the Series 2010 Resolutions, by binding contract entered into subsequent to the date of the Series 2010 Resolutions, to be devoted to some other purpose. This Series 2010 Bond and the interest hereon shall not be deemed to constitute a debt or liability of the Commonwealth of Virginia, legal, moral or otherwise. Neither the Commonwealth of Virginia nor the University shall be obligated to pay the principal of or interest on this Series 2010 Bond or other costs incident hereto except from the sources noted above, and neither the faith and credit nor the taxing power of the Commonwealth of Virginia are pledged to the payment of the principal of or interest on this Series 2010 Bond or other costs incident hereto.

This Series 2010 Bond is one of a duly authorized issue of Bonds of the University aggregating ONE HUNDRED FORTY-FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ($145,000,000) in principal amount, known as "General Revenue Pledge Bonds, Series 2010" (the "Series 2010 Bonds"), issued pursuant to resolutions adopted by the Board of Visitors of the University (the "Board") on November \_\_, 2010 (the "Series 2010 Resolutions"). This Series 2010 Bond is issued and the Series 2010 Resolutions were adopted under and pursuant to the Constitution and laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, particularly Chapter 4.10, Title 23, Code of Virginia of 1950, as amended (the "Act") to refinance the costs of certain capital improvements at the University and to refund certain outstanding indebtedness of the University. Reference is hereby made to the Series 2010 Resolutions for the provisions, among others, with respect to the custody and application of the proceeds of Bonds issued under the Series 2010 Resolutions, the funds charged with and pledged to the payment of the interest on and the principal of the Series 2010 Bonds, the nature and extent of the security, the terms and conditions on which the Series 2010 Bonds are or may be issued, the rights, duties and obligations of the University and the rights of the holders of the Series 2010 Bonds. Capitalized terms not defined herein shall be as defined in the Series 2010 Resolutions. By the acceptance of this Series 2010 Bond, the Holder hereof assents to all of the provisions of the Series 2010 Resolutions.

The Series 2010 Bonds maturing on or after March 1, \_\_\_\_, are subject to optional redemption by the University on or after March 1, \_\_\_\_, in whole or in part at any time (in any integral multiple of $5,000) at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of Series 2010 Bonds to be redeemed plus accrued interest to the redemption date.

The Series 2010 Bonds maturing on March 1, \_\_\_\_, are subject to mandatory redemption by the University at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount of Series 2010 Bonds to be redeemed, plus accrued interest, on March 1 in the following years and in the following amounts:

\* Final Maturity

This Series 2010 Bond is also subject to redemption in whole or in part on any date, at the option of the University, from the proceeds of casualty insurance or condemnation awards, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed, without premium, plus accrued interest to the redemption date, if all or any part of the Project is damaged, destroyed or taken through the exercise of the power of eminent domain and the University has determined not to use such proceeds to replace or rebuild the damaged, destroyed or taken property.

Subject to applicable procedures of the Securities Depository while the Series 2010 Bonds are held in book-entry only form by the Securities Depository, if less than all of the Series 2010 Bonds are to be called for redemption, the Series 2010 Bonds to be redeemed shall be selected by the University in such manner as the University in its discretion may determine.

If any of the Series 2010 Bonds or portions thereof are called for redemption, the Paying Agent shall mail a notice of the call for redemption, identifying the Series 2010 Bonds or portions thereof to be redeemed, not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date, to the registered owner of each Series 2010 Bond to be redeemed, at its address as it appears on the registration books kept by the Registrar. Provided funds for their redemption are on deposit at the place of payment on the redemption date, all Series 2010 Bonds so called for redemption shall cease to bear interest on such date, shall no longer be secured by the Pledged Revenues and shall not be deemed to be outstanding under the terms of the Series 2010 Resolutions. If a portion of this Series 2010 Bond is called for redemption, a new Series 2010 Bond in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion hereof will be issued to the registered owner upon the surrender hereof.

This Series 2010 Bond is transferable by the registered owner, in person or by its attorney duly authorized in writing, at the designated office of the Registrar, upon presentation of a written instrument of transfer and surrender of this Series 2010 Bond to the Registrar for cancellation. Upon the transfer, a new Series 2010 Bond or Bonds of the same aggregate principal amount, maturity date and interest rate will be issued to the transferee. No transfer will be effective unless represented by such surrender and reissue. This Series 2010 Bond may also be exchanged at the designated office of the Registrar for a new Series 2010 Bond or Bonds of the same aggregate principal amount, maturity date and interest rate without transfer to a new registered owner. Exchanges and transfers will be without expense to the holder except for applicable taxes or other governmental charges, if any. The Registrar shall not be required to transfer or exchange any Series 2010 Bond selected or called for redemption pursuant to the provisions hereof or from a Record Date through the next succeeding Interest Payment Date. All Bonds delivered in exchange or transfer shall be dated so that neither gain nor loss results from the transfer or exchange.

The University, the Paying Agent and the Registrar may treat the registered owner as the absolute owner of this Series 2010 Bond for all purposes, notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.

Neither the members of the Board nor any person executing this Series 2010 Bond are liable personally hereon or subject to any personal liability or accountability by reason of the issuance hereof.

This Series 2010 Bond will not be valid until the Certificate of Authentication has been signed by the Registrar.

The holder of this Series 2010 Bond shall have no right to enforce the provisions of the Series 2010 Resolutions or to institute action to enforce the covenants therein, or to take any action with respect to any Event of Default under the Series 2010 Resolutions, or to institute, appear in or defend any suit or other proceeding with respect thereto, except as provided in the Series 2010 Resolutions.

All acts, conditions and things required by the Constitution and laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia and by the rules and regulations of the Board to happen, exist and be performed precedent to and in the issuance of this Series 2010 Bond have happened, exist and have been performed as so required.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia has caused this Series 2010 Bond to be issued and caused this Series 2010 Bond to bear the manual or facsimile signatures of its Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer and its official seal to be impressed, imprinted, reproduced or lithographed hereon, all as of the dated date hereof.
