WHEREAS, since the last meeting of this Board, sundry gifts have been made to the University, as enumerated above, therefore be it

RESOLVED: That the President be and he is hereby requested to make to each of said donors, in the name of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, suitable acknowledgment of and thanks for said gifts.

President Alderman announced to the Board the death of Dr. Richard H. Whitehead, Dean of the Medical School, on February 6th. Whereupon, a committee consisting of the President, Mr. Michie, and Judge Norton was appointed to draw appropriate resolutions touching the death of Dr. Whitehead, to be apread on the minutes of the Board.

President Alderman announced that the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching had granted to Mrs. R. H. Whitehead a pension of $915. per annum, to become effective from Feb. 7th, and suggested to the Board that the salary of Dr. Whitehead be continued to his widow until September 1st, 1916; whereupon, Mr. Craddock offered the following resolution, which was adopted:

RESOLVED, That the salary of the late Dr. R. H. Whitehead, be continued and paid to his widow until September 1, 1916; but this action on the part of the Board shall not be construed as establishing a precedent in such cases.

President Alderman announced the appointment of Dr. Theodore Hough as Acting Dean of the Medical School, to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Dr. Whitehead. This appointment was approved.

Upon the recommendation of President Alderman, the following promotions were made:

Associate Professor George B. Eager to Full Professor of Law.

Associated Professor A. L. Hall-Quest to Full Professor of Education.

Adjunct Professor A. G. A. Balz to Associate Professor of Philosophy,

Instructor L. S. Pratt to Adjunct Professor of Chemistry.

Upon the recommendation of President Alderman, the following adjunct professorships were created: in the School of Mathamatics one, in the School of Romance Languages one, and in the School of Philosophy one.

Upon the recommendation of President Alderman, Dr. John J. Luck was elected Adjunct Professor of Mathematics; his services to begin with the session of 1916-17, at a salary of $1,500.

President Alderman announced the resignation of Adjunct Professor Justus H. Cline in the School of Ceology, to take effect with the close of the present session, June 15th, which was accepted.

Applications for the Mallet residence were presented from Messrs. Newcomb, Goodwin and Dobie, the present occupants, and also from Prof. Ivey F. Lewis, the Miller Professor of Biology. The applications were carefully considered, and the present occupants were again granted the use of the house, as the Board did not feel itself justified in refusing the application of the present occupants for re-rental.

Application of the Beta Theta Pi Fraternity for a site on University land on which to erect a chapter house, was granted, subject to selection by a committee consisting of the President, Mr. Michie, and Dr. Lambeth.

The High School Literary and Athletic League was granted the use of the Board House for the purpose of accommodating some of the visiting boys attending the Literary and Athletic contests.

E. N. Cox presented a claim against the University for a sum due him by reason of the failure of a sub-contractor in the rebuilding of the University after the fire in

The Board declined to consider the application as there is no legal or moral obligation resting on the University.

In connection with certain gifts in the list heretofore recorded in this meeting, the following letters are recorded:

I am turning to you again as one turns to a strong and trusted friend whose kindness and good will have been the source of strength and comfort to me and to the University in the past. The gifts which you have hitherto so generously given have been devoted, as you know, to the purpose of inaugurating a beautiful and satisfactory grounds and road system throughout the University, including gateways and such road building as tend to make the Institution more beautiful and modern in appearance. This is a unique and distinguished form of benefaction to the University which no one else has thought of, much less attempted. We have made, I think, economical and successful use of your last gift of $10,000, and the roads put down are wonderful in their detail and in their effect. They are, however, quite expensive. The soil basis here is stiff red clay, and nothing will conquer it for all time except the best and most enduring form of Travia road. It is really a great macadam tied and made solid by the use of tar. It is such a road as you find in the finest roads in the north. This road now extends from the western gateway almost to the Fry's Spring road where we hope to put another gateway. It branches off towards the gardens and the Lawn. It covers nearly all of the East Range road. As a matter of fact, however, the work cannot be completed by that gift. In order to make the situation what it ought to be, and worthy of the beginning, made possible by your beneficience, I estimate that the sum of $15,000 will be necessary. This, of course, might extend over a number of years. I am wondering if it would be possible for you to make us another gift of $10,000 for 1916-'17, which would enable us to come very near completing the scheme in mind. As I have indicated, it need not be given in one sum, or it might be given in any set of payments that suit your convenience, but if we had the knowledge of it, we could go about consummating the work we have set our hands to under your great generosity. I think the standard of dignity would then be insured here for all time. A new gateway somewhat in harmony with the one at the front entrance would also then be placed at the Southern entrance where the new Chemical Laboratory is to go which will make the main highway of the University handsomely cared for.

It would make me very happy and give to the University great satisfaction if this announcement could be made at our Founder's Day celebration on April 13. I remember you gave us the great honor to be present on that occasion one year ago. I heartily wish you would give us this great pleasure again. I want to come to New York in the later spring and give myself the pleasure of seeing you and being with you and talking over many things. I have had a hard and trying year which has greatly taxed me and makes it a little difficult for me to run hither and thither as I formerly did.

Trusting that I am not taking a liberty in bringing this matter to your kindly thought, I am,

I am very glad to learn that your system of roads is progressing so well, and I would like to complete the work as you have outlined it in your letter, in memory of Mr. Senff.

I will give you Ten Thousand Dollars as you need it in the next few months, and you can announce the gift on Founder's Day. I would like for the new gateway to bear the same inscription which is on the present gates. I will, if I see my way clear, give you that additional Ten Thousand Dollars next year to complete the gateway and roads. I thank you for your invitation to be present on Founder's Day, but I cannot get down this year.

I am very much interested in your work at the University, and wish very much if you and Mrs. Alderman come to New York, you would stop with me, so I might ask Dr. and Mrs. Butler, Miss Gildersleeve, and some of my friends to meet you at dinner. I go to Long Island May 1st, and a visit from you to my Long Island home would also be a pleasure to me,—;to hear about your work would be a great pleasure also.

May I add that if you could get a good gardener to work up the grass on the University grounds, and keep the bare spots green, and put out some more shrubs, that would greatly improve your grounds. I would like to be interested in this, as grounds give a great impression to the outside world, and the influence on the country around would be greatly benefited I think by your example. —; Please forgive me if I am speaking too frankly, but I am so interested.

(signed) G. A. Senff.

The new wing of the hospital, made possible by your beneficence is about completed. It is the handsomest thing in its way in the whole University and makes of the hospital a really efficient and powerful agency in our life. I want to put a tablet on the inner walls simply recording the facts of its gift by you, and adding any name or memorial tribute that you would care to have on it. Would you mind telling me just what you would like to have it called, and any wording of the tablet that might suggest itself to you. I want to send you a photograph of the building as soon as the builder's debris is removed from about it.

I wonder if I might dare to make this suggestion. Every cent of the money and a little more has been necessary to complete the building. I had hoped that the Legislature of Virginia would give us the money to equip it. We felt they owed it to the generosity of private beneficence which had made it possible. The financial condition of the State, however, owing to a bad tax system has prevented them from giving us the money necessary to equip it. We asked for $10,000. for that purpose, for it would need about that sum to put it into scientific and modern condition for use. I am being bold enough to express the hope that you might be able to help us out to that extent in order that the overcrowded condition of the institution may be relieved at as early a date as possible.

Our Founder's Day, April 13, is the day on which such gifts are made public. It is a notable day here with us, and I cherish the hope that you may be able to gratify me and serve the University by enabling me to announce the practical completion of the whole big scheme.

I have your letter of March 24th, and I shall be very glad to give you ten thousand dollars more in order to equip the Hospital.

With reference to any name or memorial in connection with the new wing, I have no desire except to do whatever you prefer. I should have no objection whatever to your suggestion of a very small tablet on the inner wall recording the fact of the gift, but my personal preference would be to have whatever is done made as simple and inconspicuous as possible. If the building shall prove to be of some real use, I should ask for nothing further.

Let me know when you want the additional money, and I shall be glad to send you a check.

Wishing you every success, believe me,

I hope you won't think me impudent or bold, or lacking in delicacy if I bring this matter to your attention.

The plans, made possible by your beneficence, for the Chemical Laboratory are perfected, and I am sending you shortly the elevation in order that you may see just what the building is to look like. We have tried to build the building and save money enough to have this equipped. We have not been able to make both ends meet in that direction, however. I appealed to the Legislature for money for its equipment, but the fiscal condition of the State was so chaotic and rigid that I had to choose between extra annual maintenance appropriation, which is more vital, and special appropriations of this character. We find that we are about $5,000. short of equipping the building for its immediate and effective use. I have just wondered whether or not I should not make this statement to you in the hope that you might be able to help us out to that further extent. You are under no sort of obligations, of course, to think of it, much less do it, but I fought so hard for it all and I have such pride in it, and the failure of the State to help me disappointed me so greatly that I am impelled to make this statement, confident that you will understand that if you are not in a position to help further, I will appreciate the situation perfectly. We are already under a mountain of obligation to you.

I cannot see the slightest bit of impropriety in your writing me of your need of $5,000. in order to equip the new laboratory for "immediate and effective use." On the contrary, I am very glad you did write me and I cheerfully subscribe the $5,000. and will send it when you let me know it is needed.

Really, I have considered writing you inquiring whether the General Assembly met, what seemed to me, your very reasonable request for the University's needs. As the weeks went on I finally decided not to write you because of the expectation of seeing you. When you come down on the 4th of April we can talk further about the matter and I shall be very glad to receive at any time the plans showing the appearance of the building which you offer to send me.

You may be sure I was deeply touched and more so than I could give owrds to by your expressed willingness to increase your gift for equipment to $10,000, if it were needed. In any event, of course, this equipment money will not be vitally needed until early next spring, when it will be necessary to make the building ready for use. In venturing to ask you for the additional gift for the equipment of the building, I naturally put the sum at the minimum, because I felt you had done so much that I had no right to suggest anything except a mimimum request; and, too, we are so accustomed to doing things here on the mimimum basis that I felt that was all I dare present to you. The extra $5,000 would, however, be of immense value to us in adding real fullness and power to our equipment, both in certain external phases as to approach and in certain internal machinery and equipment. We will spend nothing, of course, for mere frills. I have not mentioned the matter to any of my faculty, save to talk with them a little about their needs. They do not yet know of your gift of $5,000. I find that they feel that in Industrial Chemistry more money for equipment is needed than could possibly be covered by the sum of $5,000, which could only cover the needs of General Chemistry.

It would, of course, be tremendously encouraging and helpful if I could announce on Founder's Day, when all these announcements are made, a gift of $10,000 instead of $5,000 for this great purpose. It would be, of course, most wisely expended. I would not think of doing so without your permission, and I would not want to suggest for a minute that you give me that permission at this time, unless it is perfectly convenient and suits your desires in every way. As I have said, the actual money would not be needed for another year. Our Founder's Day is on Thursday of this week.

I took the liberty of telling Fuller about your great kindness in the matter of the $5,000 gift, and his reply was "Cobb is the salt of the earth" in which I most warmly agree.

I am happy at receiving your letter of the 10th inst., and am well pleased that you return home feeling rested.

I really prefer giving the $10,000.00 because I think you will need at least this amount for full equipment and finish for the Laboratory.

You may therefore consider this amount as pledged and at your call at any time.

We enjoyed every minute of your visit. With all good wishes.

My heart was deeply touched by your swift and generous accession to the suggestion born of your own purpose but coming from me in the second instance. There was long and grateful applause and deep appreciation of your action. The Board has not yet met to make formal acceptance of the gifts. They meet on the 18th of April. I know you know without words from me how deeply it all strengthens my mind and purpose.

Hoping to see you in New York before the Spring is over, I am,

About a year ago, I wrote regarding the establishment of a Scholarship in the University, by the National Society of the Colonial Dames of America, the scholarship being a tribute of our loyalty and gratitude to our President, Mrs. William Ruffin Cox of Richmond, Virginia.

This Scholarship is to be called the Kate Cabell Cox Scholarship, to be given for work in American History, preferably Colonial. If possible, it is to be given to a student from one of the Schools maintained for the education of the southern mountaineers.

The amount collected will be about $1,200.00.

Will you kindly write me if these terms are acceptable, and if I may send the amount immediately.

May I ask that the letter repeats the items as I have given them, if they are acceptable, so that I amy read it as a part of my report.

I shall take great pleasure in reporting to the Rector and Visitors, at their spring meeting, on April 18, the very generous action of the National Society of The Colonial Dames of America offering to establish at this University, as a tribute of their loyalty and gratitude to their former President, Mrs. William Ruffin Cox, of Richmond, Va., a scholarship in American History. I am quite sure that the Rector and Visitors will agree with me that this is a beautiful action on the part of the Society, and will accept this thoughtful gift with gratitude and appreciation. I take note of your statement that the work should be not only in American History but cover American Colonial History, and that wherever possible it should be given to a student from one of the schools maintained for the education of the youth of the mountain regions of the Southern States.

There will be no question, of course, about the grateful acceptance of this fine action, and I am warranted, I think, in sending you in advance of the meeting of our Board, the assurances of their gratitude and their high esteem.

I have a magnificent portrait of J. L. M. Curry, painted in Madrid by the Elder Madrazzo, when he was President of the Royal Academy. It is a work of art and appropriately and exquisitely framed in carved apple-wood. I find it too large for my house. It would give me pleasure to present it to the University of Virginia, thinking it might be hung in the hall used for the Curry School of Pedagogy. I remain,

Your letter received today, informing me of your purpose to present to the University a portrait of Dr. Curry gives me great delight and satisfaction. I have wanted a portrait of him ever since the completion of our splendid building which houses the Curry School of Education. There is a perfect place for its hanging, and the whole matter gives me very great pleasure. The Curry School of Education is growing in power and influence, and is just at the threshold of its usefulness. I venture to predict that it will be in the end one of the most permanent memorials to Dr. Curry's fame that could have been conceived of. It will be an inspiration to the young men to have knowledge of his face and form.

With my very deep appreciation and the gratitude of the Rector and Visitors of the University, I am,

At the request of Mr. J. M. Carlisle, Surviving Trustee of the late Mary W. Curry, I am shipping to you tomorrow, March 8th, by Adams Express, charges prepaid, and addressed as above, one box containing the portrait of the late Dr. J. L. M. Curry, painted by Mrazo. The portrait is insured for the sum of $5,000, and a valuation of $400 is placed upon the box with the express company, according with Mr. Carlisle's request.

The case has been packed with especial care and I trust it will reach you safely and promplty.

I should very much appreciate it if you will advise me of its safe arrival.

The President presented the following letter he had received from Miss Betty Young, with reference to Dr. Green's tombstone:

In reply to Miss Worrell's letter of Nov. 26th, will say that the work on the monument to Dr. Green, is well done. The family is very grateful to you for this gift to his memory.

Best wishes for yourself and the University, I remain,

The budget for the fiscal year 1916-17 was considered item by item and unanimously adopted as a whole, as follows:

\[see page 72 for Financial Budget\]

I am happy at receiving your letter of the 10th inst., and am well pleased that you return home feeling rested.

I really prefer giving the $10,000.00 because I think you will need at least this amount for full equipment and finish for the Laboratory.

You may therefore consider this amount as pledged and at your call at any time.

We enjoyed every minute of your visit. With all good wishes.

My heart was deeply touched by your swift and generous accession to the suggestion born of your own purpose but coming from me in the second instance. There was long and grateful applause and deep appreciation of your action. The Board has not yet met to make formal acceptance of the gifts. They meet on the 18th of April. I know you know without words from me how deeply it all strengthens my mind and purpose.

Hoping to see you in New York before the Spring is over, I am,

About a year ago, I wrote regarding the establishment of a Scholarship in the University, by the National Society of the Colonial Dames of America, the scholarship being a tribute of our loyalty and gratitude to our President, Mrs. William Ruffin Cox of Richmond, Virginia.

This Scholarship is to be called the Kate Cabell Cox Scholarship, to be given for work in American History, preferably Colonial. If possible, it is to be given to a student from one of the Schools maintained for the education of the southern mountaineers.

The amount collected will be about $1,200.00.

Will you kindly write me if these terms are acceptable, and if I may send the amount immediately.

May I ask that the letter repeats the items as I have given them, if they are acceptable, so that I amy read it as a part of my report.

I shall take great pleasure in reporting to the Rector and Visitors, at their spring meeting, on April 18, the very generous action of the National Society of The Colonial Dames of America offering to establish at this University, as a tribute of their loyalty and gratitude to their former President, Mrs. William Ruffin Cox, of Richmond, Va., a scholarship in American History. I am quite sure that the Rector and Visitors will agree with me that this is a beautiful action on the part of the Society, and will accept this thoughtful gift with gratitude and appreciation. I take note of your statement that the work should be not only in American History but cover American Colonial History, and that wherever possible it should be given to a student from one of the schools maintained for the education of the youth of the mountain regions of the Southern States.

There will be no question, of course, about the grateful acceptance of this fine action, and I am warranted, I think, in sending you in advance of the meeting of our Board, the assurances of their gratitude and their high esteem.

I have a magnificent portrait of J. L. M. Curry, painted in Madrid by the Elder Madrazzo, when he was President of the Royal Academy. It is a work of art and appropriately and exquisitely framed in carved apple-wood. I find it too large for my house. It would give me pleasure to present it to the University of Virginia, thinking it might be hung in the hall used for the Curry School of Pedagogy. I remain,

Your letter received today, informing me of your purpose to present to the University a portrait of Dr. Curry gives me great delight and satisfaction. I have wanted a portrait of him ever since the completion of our splendid building which houses the Curry School of Education. There is a perfect place for its hanging, and the whole matter gives me very great pleasure. The Curry School of Education is growing in power and influence, and is just at the threshold of its usefulness. I venture to predict that it will be in the end one of the most permanent memorials to Dr. Curry's fame that could have been conceived of. It will be an inspiration to the young men to have knowledge of his face and form.

With my very deep appreciation and the gratitude of the Rector and Visitors of the University, I am,

At the request of Mr. J. M. Carlisle, Surviving Trustee of the late Mary W. Curry, I am shipping to you tomorrow, March 8th, by Adams Express, charges prepaid, and addressed as above, one box containing the portrait of the late Dr. J. L. M. Curry, painted by Mrazo. The portrait is insured for the sum of $5,000, and a valuation of $400 is placed upon the box with the express company, according with Mr. Carlisle's request.

The case has been packed with especial care and I trust it will reach you safely and promplty.

I should very much appreciate it if you will advise me of its safe arrival.

In reply to Miss Worrell's letter of Nov. 26th, will say that the work on the monument to Dr. Green, is well done. The family is very grateful to you for this gift to his memory.

Best wishes for yourself and the University, I remain,

On motion, the Board then adjourned.

I am turning to you again as one turns to a strong and trusted friend whose kindness and good will have been the source of strength and comfort to me and to the University in the past. The gifts which you have hitherto so generously given have been devoted, as you know, to the purpose of inaugurating a beautiful and satisfactory grounds and road system throughout the University, including gateways and such road building as tend to make the Institution more beautiful and modern in appearance. This is a unique and distinguished form of benefaction to the University which no one else has thought of, much less attempted. We have made, I think, economical and successful use of your last gift of $10,000, and the roads put down are wonderful in their detail and in their effect. They are, however, quite expensive. The soil basis here is stiff red clay, and nothing will conquer it for all time except the best and most enduring form of Travia road. It is really a great macadam tied and made solid by the use of tar. It is such a road as you find in the finest roads in the north. This road now extends from the western gateway almost to the Fry's Spring road where we hope to put another gateway. It branches off towards the gardens and the Lawn. It covers nearly all of the East Range road. As a matter of fact, however, the work cannot be completed by that gift. In order to make the situation what it ought to be, and worthy of the beginning, made possible by your beneficience, I estimate that the sum of $15,000 will be necessary. This, of course, might extend over a number of years. I am wondering if it would be possible for you to make us another gift of $10,000 for 1916-'17, which would enable us to come very near completing the scheme in mind. As I have indicated, it need not be given in one sum, or it might be given in any set of payments that suit your convenience, but if we had the knowledge of it, we could go about consummating the work we have set our hands to under your great generosity. I think the standard of dignity would then be insured here for all time. A new gateway somewhat in harmony with the one at the front entrance would also then be placed at the Southern entrance where the new Chemical Laboratory is to go which will make the main highway of the University handsomely cared for.

It would make me very happy and give to the University great satisfaction if this announcement could be made at our Founder's Day celebration on April 13. I remember you gave us the great honor to be present on that occasion one year ago. I heartily wish you would give us this great pleasure again. I want to come to New York in the later spring and give myself the pleasure of seeing you and being with you and talking over many things. I have had a hard and trying year which has greatly taxed me and makes it a little difficult for me to run hither and thither as I formerly did.

Trusting that I am not taking a liberty in bringing this matter to your kindly thought, I am,

I am very glad to learn that your system of roads is progressing so well, and I would like to complete the work as you have outlined it in your letter, in memory of Mr. Senff.

I will give you Ten Thousand Dollars as you need it in the next few months, and you can announce the gift on Founder's Day. I would like for the new gateway to bear the same inscription which is on the present gates. I will, if I see my way clear, give you that additional Ten Thousand Dollars next year to complete the gateway and roads. I thank you for your invitation to be present on Founder's Day, but I cannot get down this year.

I am very much interested in your work at the University, and wish very much if you and Mrs. Alderman come to New York, you would stop with me, so I might ask Dr. and Mrs. Butler, Miss Gildersleeve, and some of my friends to meet you at dinner. I go to Long Island May 1st, and a visit from you to my Long Island home would also be a pleasure to me,—;to hear about your work would be a great pleasure also.

The new wing of the hospital, made possible by your beneficence is about completed. It is the handsomest thing in its way in the whole University and makes of the hospital a really efficient and powerful agency in our life. I want to put a tablet on the inner walls simply recording the facts of its gift by you, and adding any name or memorial tribute that you would care to have on it. Would you mind telling me just what you would like to have it called, and any wording of the tablet that might suggest itself to you. I want to send you a photograph of the building as soon as the builder's debris is removed from about it.

I wonder if I might dare to make this suggestion. Every cent of the money and a little more has been necessary to complete the building. I had hoped that the Legislature of Virginia would give us the money to equip it. We felt they owed it to the generosity of private beneficence which had made it possible. The financial condition of the State, however, owing to a bad tax system has prevented them from giving us the money necessary to equip it. We asked for $10,000. for that purpose, for it would need about that sum to put it into scientific and modern condition for use. I am being bold enough to express the hope that you might be able to help us out to that extent in order that the overcrowded condition of the institution may be relieved at as early a date as possible.

Our Founder's Day, April 13, is the day on which such gifts are made public. It is a notable day here with us, and I cherish the hope that you may be able to gratify me and serve the University by enabling me to announce the practical completion of the whole big scheme.

I have your letter of March 24th, and I shall be very glad to give you ten thousand dollars more in order to equip the Hospital.

With reference to any name or memorial in connection with the new wing, I have no desire except to do whatever you prefer. I should have no objection whatever to your suggestion of a very small tablet on the inner wall recording the fact of the gift, but my personal preference would be to have whatever is done made as simple and inconspicuous as possible. If the building shall prove to be of some real use, I should ask for nothing further.

Let me know when you want the additional money, and I shall be glad to send you a check.

Wishing you every success, believe me,

I hope you won't think me impudent or bold, or lacking in delicacy if I bring this matter to your attention.

The plans, made possible by your beneficence, for the Chemical Laboratory are perfected, and I am sending you shortly the elevation in order that you may see just what the building is to look like. We have tried to build the building and save money enough to have this equipped. We have not been able to make both ends meet in that direction, however. I appealed to the Legislature for money for its equipment, but the fiscal condition of the State was so chaotic and rigid that I had to choose between extra annual maintenance appropriation, which is more vital, and special appropriations of this character. We find that we are about $5,000. short of equipping the building for its immediate and effective use. I have just wondered whether or not I should not make this statement to you in the hope that you might be able to help us out to that further extent. You are under no sort of obligations, of course, to think of it, much less do it, but I fought so hard for it all and I have such pride in it, and the failure of the State to help me disappointed me so greatly that I am impelled to make this statement, confident that you will understand that if you are not in a position to help further, I will appreciate the situation perfectly. We are already under a mountain of obligation to you.

I cannot see the slightest bit of impropriety in your writing me of your need of $5,000. in order to equip the new laboratory for "immediate and effective use." On the contrary, I am very glad you did write me and I cheerfully subscribe the $5,000. and will send it when you let me know it is needed.

Really, I have considered writing you inquiring whether the General Assembly met, what seemed to me, your very reasonable request for the University's needs. As the weeks went on I finally decided not to write you because of the expectation of seeing you. When you come down on the 4th of April we can talk further about the matter and I shall be very glad to receive at any time the plans showing the appearance of the building which you offer to send me.

You may be sure I was deeply touched and more so than I could give owrds to by your expressed willingness to increase your gift for equipment to $10,000, if it were needed. In any event, of course, this equipment money will not be vitally needed until early next spring, when it will be necessary to make the building ready for use. In venturing to ask you for the additional gift for the equipment of the building, I naturally put the sum at the minimum, because I felt you had done so much that I had no right to suggest anything except a mimimum request; and, too, we are so accustomed to doing things here on the mimimum basis that I felt that was all I dare present to you. The extra $5,000 would, however, be of immense value to us in adding real fullness and power to our equipment, both in certain external phases as to approach and in certain internal machinery and equipment. We will spend nothing, of course, for mere frills. I have not mentioned the matter to any of my faculty, save to talk with them a little about their needs. They do not yet know of your gift of $5,000. I find that they feel that in Industrial Chemistry more money for equipment is needed than could possibly be covered by the sum of $5,000, which could only cover the needs of General Chemistry.

It would, of course, be tremendously encouraging and helpful if I could announce on Founder's Day, when all these announcements are made, a gift of $10,000 instead of $5,000 for this great purpose. It would be, of course, most wisely expended. I would not think of doing so without your permission, and I would not want to suggest for a minute that you give me that permission at this time, unless it is perfectly convenient and suits your desires in every way. As I have said, the actual money would not be needed for another year. Our Founder's Day is on Thursday of this week.

I took the liberty of telling Fuller about your great kindness in the matter of the $5,000 gift, and his reply was "Cobb is the salt of the earth" in which I most warmly agree.

I am happy at receiving your letter of the 10th inst., and am well pleased that you return home feeling rested.

I really prefer giving the $10,000.00 because I think you will need at least this amount for full equipment and finish for the Laboratory.

You may therefore consider this amount as pledged and at your call at any time.

We enjoyed every minute of your visit. With all good wishes.

My heart was deeply touched by your swift and generous accession to the suggestion born of your own purpose but coming from me in the second instance. There was long and grateful applause and deep appreciation of your action. The Board has not yet met to make formal acceptance of the gifts. They meet on the 18th of April. I know you know without words from me how deeply it all strengthens my mind and purpose.

Hoping to see you in New York before the Spring is over, I am,

About a year ago, I wrote regarding the establishment of a Scholarship in the University, by the National Society of the Colonial Dames of America, the scholarship being a tribute of our loyalty and gratitude to our President, Mrs. William Ruffin Cox of Richmond, Virginia.

This Scholarship is to be called the Kate Cabell Cox Scholarship, to be given for work in American History, preferably Colonial. If possible, it is to be given to a student from one of the Schools maintained for the education of the southern mountaineers.

The amount collected will be about $1,200.00.

Will you kindly write me if these terms are acceptable, and if I may send the amount immediately.

May I ask that the letter repeats the items as I have given them, if they are acceptable, so that I amy read it as a part of my report.

I shall take great pleasure in reporting to the Rector and Visitors, at their spring meeting, on April 18, the very generous action of the National Society of The Colonial Dames of America offering to establish at this University, as a tribute of their loyalty and gratitude to their former President, Mrs. William Ruffin Cox, of Richmond, Va., a scholarship in American History. I am quite sure that the Rector and Visitors will agree with me that this is a beautiful action on the part of the Society, and will accept this thoughtful gift with gratitude and appreciation. I take note of your statement that the work should be not only in American History but cover American Colonial History, and that wherever possible it should be given to a student from one of the schools maintained for the education of the youth of the mountain regions of the Southern States.

There will be no question, of course, about the grateful acceptance of this fine action, and I am warranted, I think, in sending you in advance of the meeting of our Board, the assurances of their gratitude and their high esteem.

I have a magnificent portrait of J. L. M. Curry, painted in Madrid by the Elder Madrazzo, when he was President of the Royal Academy. It is a work of art and appropriately and exquisitely framed in carved apple-wood. I find it too large for my house. It would give me pleasure to present it to the University of Virginia, thinking it might be hung in the hall used for the Curry School of Pedagogy. I remain,

Your letter received today, informing me of your purpose to present to the University a portrait of Dr. Curry gives me great delight and satisfaction. I have wanted a portrait of him ever since the completion of our splendid building which houses the Curry School of Education. There is a perfect place for its hanging, and the whole matter gives me very great pleasure. The Curry School of Education is growing in power and influence, and is just at the threshold of its usefulness. I venture to predict that it will be in the end one of the most permanent memorials to Dr. Curry's fame that could have been conceived of. It will be an inspiration to the young men to have knowledge of his face and form.

With my very deep appreciation and the gratitude of the Rector and Visitors of the University, I am,

At the request of Mr. J. M. Carlisle, Surviving Trustee of the late Mary W. Curry, I am shipping to you tomorrow, March 8th, by Adams Express, charges prepaid, and addressed as above, one box containing the portrait of the late Dr. J. L. M. Curry, painted by Mrazo. The portrait is insured for the sum of $5,000, and a valuation of $400 is placed upon the box with the express company, according with Mr. Carlisle's request.

The case has been packed with especial care and I trust it will reach you safely and promplty.

I should very much appreciate it if you will advise me of its safe arrival.

In reply to Miss Worrell's letter of Nov. 26th, will say that the work on the monument to Dr. Green, is well done. The family is very grateful to you for this gift to his memory.

Best wishes for yourself and the University, I remain,
