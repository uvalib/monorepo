**Comments by the Rector**

**The Rector reminded the Visitors of a special meeting of the Board to be held in January. He said there was an interest in a public comment period during Board meetings. He asked the Special Committee on Governance to study the issue, including gathering information on practices at other public universities in the state, and to make a recommendation to the Board in February.**

**The Rector also let everyone know the Board Office will be relocating to Pavilion II on November 20th. He pointed out that Pavilion II is the one next to the Rotunda on the east side.**

**A moment of silence was observed by the Board in memory of Hannah Graham and Conner Cormier, two students who passed away this fall.**

**Comments by the Student Member**

**Ms. Gould said she wanted to provide a review of how the Jeffersonian Dinners went the previous night. The dinners are built upon a concept created by University alumnus Jeff Walker, which are intended to bring together people from many different sectors, interests, backgrounds and experiences to enjoy a great dinner and have a focused, lively discussion about one topic in particular. She thanked everyone who planned and organized the dinners, and the Pavilion residents who opened their homes and also participated in the dialogue. Each dinner had one Sustained Dialogue moderator, present to facilitate conversation.**

**The five topics discussed at the dinners were very far-ranging, across goals, structures, and cultural elements of higher education. To illustrate the breadth and depth of the dialogues she listed a few topics of conversation. The Jeffersonian Dinner participants in Pavilion IV delved into the true meaning of globalization, civic apathy, and the quantitative perspective some people take to interacting with other cultures, as opposed to simply learning, recognizing, and understanding how to engage with other cultures. Pavilion VI dinner participants discussed the role of alcohol, introducing a few topics that the adults in the room had no idea about, discussing experiences and college culture, and a practical conversation of mechanisms to address these issues.**

**Pavilion IX hosted a great conversation about how to catalyze creativity, what hinders that enterprise, different ways to be technologically innovative, and that nothing can replace a fantastic, compelling teacher. The institutional and student aims dinner in Pavilion VIII touched on everything from particular moments of self-discovery, to the purpose of college to its community, faculty, and students as a means of social mobility or otherwise. Finally, the participants of the Pavilion V dinner on public and private good similarly touched on many ideas from national concerns of rising cost, the role of philanthropy at the funding level, and the responsibility to promote and prioritize education.**

**Ms. Gould said the last student report she gave was framed by tradition, touching on initiatives by students, collaborations across the University, and then the accessibility of tradition – practices that we believe permeate Grounds and want to be equally accessible by all. She said this one will be reflective of the past few months.**

**This has been a tumultuous semester – it has been a busy one, a dynamic one, but also quite emotionally difficult as students, faculty, staff and community members alike suffered the irreplaceable loss of two students. Over the course of these few months members of the community have hoped, hurt, and remembered together. Someone once said, “we have memories so that we may have roses in December.” Our memories of these individuals are providing us with so much more than roses; while we all still do grieve, the community has flowered with a heightened sense of weaving a closely-knit community even closer, with a stronger sense of accountability. She cited some examples, including the vigil and memorial organized for Hannah Graham, and the weekend Hack-a-Thon computer programming competition organized to celebrate Connor Cormier’s love of and skill in coding and engineering.**

**Ms. Gould said while it definitely has been a tough few months, many positive things were also happening: students have attended White House discussions on sexual misconduct and engaged with the national “It’s On Us” campaign while moving forward with the #HoosGotYourBack campaign; they have put forth innovative ideas in the 3-Day Start Up or Entrepreneurship Cup this year; Sustained Dialogue facilitated a school-wide critical conversation with the Honor Committee about the single sanction at Honor trials; and representatives of large organizations like Student Council, Honor, and UJC are more accountable to their constituents from a follow-up panel held by the Minority Rights Coalition.**

**Ms. Gould noted that students have watched the Rotunda construction go up wall by wall (by louder sound and louder sound), and the football team has been holding their own in what is a difficult line-up of other university teams.**

**She spoke more about the #HoosGotYourBack initiative continuing throughout the semester. President Sullivan said a safe environment isn’t enough if students are not taking safe behaviors. The positive changes include expansion of the late-night Safe Ride program and a police presence on the Corner, especially on weekends. Also, students have been holding more “One in Four” and “One Less” sexual misconduct awareness presentations, such as the one last week co-hosted by the Latino Student Alliance. And a sexual misconduct module is soon to be released with student drama actors. Finally, the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention team is gearing up for Substance Abuse Prevention Week, starting Monday, with the theme of “I’ll Remember My Last Home Game”, partnering with a number of students groups to prevent substance abuse and promote safe drinking habits among students.**

**She said this is only the beginning; there is so much more to do. Students, the university, and people in the Charlottesville community are taking actions, whether disparate or together. If we are taking action on safety, we must couple that action with the support students need, from strengthening CAPS and the Women’s Center for long-term and trauma support, to increasing the anticipatory actions that even student and University programs for mental health, sexual misconduct awareness, or substance abuse can provide for students before it gets to a dangerous point.**

**Support also means being responsible for improving everyone’s experiences at the University. She said students want to see increased financial aid, and want improved accessibility – but are also thinking as widely as using tuition money wisely to increase the number of ramps around Grounds available for students with handicaps.**

**Ms. Gould said she is constantly reminded of what this school offers – in classes, friendships, opportunities for growth, research skills, etc. – and she wanted to end with what she thought students want most: that each person attending this school has the chance to reap the no-strings-attached benefits of this ability to think and act.**

**Comments by the Faculty Senate Chair**

**Mr. Joe Garofalo, chair of the Faculty Senate, reported. He read an excerpt from the May 2013 Board minutes: “…The Board’s responsibilities, specified by state statute, include but are not restricted to the appointment of the University president; appointment, promotion, and granting of tenure; removal of members of the faculty; the prescription of faculty responsibilities; the setting of faculty salaries…” Mr. Garofalo said the faculty was very appreciative of the raise that was given this year. He mentioned another part of the excerpt – the prescription of faculty responsibilities. He said faculty members have voiced their desires to let the Board know exactly what it is that faculty members do with their time. Mr. Garofalo invited the Visitors to see what the faculty do; he listed the following as possible ways of observing faculty working:**

*   *   **School-level faculty meeting**
    *   **School-level Faculty Council meeting**
    *   **Department meeting**
    *   **Program Area meeting**
    *   **Center meeting**
    *   **Laboratory meeting**
    *   **Field Research team**
    *   **Performance team**
    *   **University-wide Faculty Committee**
    *   **Faculty Senate Committee**
    *   **General Faculty Council**
    *   **Individual Faculty Members**

**The question was asked if there was a master calendar so the Visitors could see the dates of meetings. Mr. Garofalo said there is not a master calendar with all of this information on it, but any Visitor could call him if they were interested in attending something and he would put them in touch with the right committee. Dr. Long said Visitors should consider teaching a class.**

**Comments by the President**

**President Sullivan gave a progress report on the Cornerstone Plan. She said the first cohort of the Meriwether Lewis Institute has been selected and the program will begin in the spring. It is a leadership program and Dean Zeithaml has been involved in developing the coursework.**

**Total Advising is progressing with more first-year seminars that combine advising and coursework, including in Engineering. There are a number of programs focused on career issues, including a first year course on creating an electronic portfolio. Internships have also been emphasized.**

**Research infrastructure improvements include collaborations with the Max Planck Institute in a couple of programs, and other collaborations with European laboratories.**

**In other global initiatives, The Center for Global Inquiry and Innovation has been launched; the University is a founding partner with the Department of State on a diplomacy lab; and the Global Studies major, which was approved by the Board last year, is underway.**

**President Sullivan introduced a video developed with the Charlottesville Chamber of Commerce and other area employers describing all that the Charlottesville area has to offer; she said this video should help recruit faculty and staff.**

**She spoke about the initiatives in staff leadership and excellence. Wrapping up, she said because of the Cornerstone Plan, certain goals should be achieved by 2018. A dashboard is in the Board materials.**

**Before presenting the Gifts and Grants Report, President Sullivan announced the $4 million challenge grant from John Griffin, a member of the Board of Visitors, to establish a new scholarship program to benefit undergraduate students who have exceptional promise and significant financial need, was met within the first nine months — far ahead of schedule — through the generosity of alumni, parents, and friends. Mr. Griffin met with the current Blue Ridge Scholars the night before. President Sullivan thanked Mr. Griffin again for his support and leadership, and congratulated Mr. Sweeney, Senior Vice President for Advancement, and his team on the quick match. She said this will give the University a great deal of momentum as we continue our efforts to raise significant funding to support student scholarships, which is one of the top fundraising priorities.**

**President Sullivan gave the Gifts and Grants Report.**

**On motion, the Meeting of the Full Board was adjourned for lunch at 11:40 p.m.**

**\- - - - - - - - -**

**The Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia reconvened in open session on Friday, November 14, 2014 at 1:35 p.m. in the Auditorium of the Albert & Shirley Small Special Collections Library of the Harrison Institute; George Keith Martin, Rector, presided.**

**The Rector called on Patrick D. Hogan to speak about the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission (JLARC) Study report. Mr. Hogan said quality was not a consideration in the JLARC study – there was no attempt to differentiate programs or schools on the basis of quality. He said there are good “takeaways” and some opportunities to improve efficiency. He introduced Colette Sheehy to explain the report’s findings.**

**Ms. Sheehy said the JLARC staff was directed to study the cost efficiency of the Commonwealth’s institutions of higher education and to identify opportunities to reduce the cost of public higher education in Virginia. This study was limited to the Commonwealth’s 15 four-year public institutions of higher education. Private institutions and the Virginia Community College System were not included in the charge.**

**Given the scope of this review, JLARC staff presented to the Commission a series of reports, with the final report presented on November 10. The five reports include general findings across all institutions in the Commonwealth and recommendations for reducing the cost of public higher education in Virginia. The staff found that there were no major areas of inefficiencies statewide. Therefore, the recommendations focus on those items that may provide the best opportunities to reduce cost and increase efficiency.**

**The reports culminated in a total of 32 recommendations and seven options for policy changes.**

**The first report in the series includes context that will be relevant to topics addressed in the subsequent JLARC reports on key topics, such as faculty activities and non-academic student fees and costs. Ms. Sheehy reviewed a few key points of interest included in this report. On average, instructional spending at Virginia institutions has accounted for about one-third of total spending, which is consistent across the nation. The remaining two-thirds of spending is based on a variety of other categories, such as research, academic and institutional support functions, and physical plant operations and maintenance. The University is slightly below the average at 30% spent on instructional activities in FY 2011. The average for the Carnegie group of very high research institutions is 31%.**

**Across all institutions, approximately 23% of total revenue was from tuition and fees. The University was below that average with 18% of total revenue from tuition and fees.**

**On average, 14% of total revenues were derived from auxiliary activities, which include dining, housing, athletics, etc. At the University, approximately 5% of total revenue comes from auxiliary enterprises.**

**In 1991, about 30% of all students used student loans. This varies greatly across institutions; however, the University has the lowest percentage of students using loans in the state, 29% in FY 2012, whereas 87% of students at VSU must borrow to attend school.**

**The University has the highest six-year graduation rate in the state at 93%. According to the report, the University graduates 10% more students than predicted when considering “key student and institutional characteristics”.**

**The second report focused on the major drivers of spending on non-academic services, more commonly referred to as auxiliary enterprises. These include athletics, recreation/fitness facilities, student housing and dining.**

**Auxiliaries receive no state funding. Auxiliaries are completely self-supporting, but it is also important to note that they are not profit centers for the institutions either. Auxiliaries pay overhead charges to institutions to fully cover the cost of support services and are subject to state actions with regard to salary increases and benefits, including actions that may divert revenue from its intended purpose such as the VRS reversions to the state general fund in 2011 and 2012.**

**Athletics are a major component of auxiliary operations even though only 3% of all students participate in athletics across all institutions. Overall, 12% of tuition and fees are used for athletics; at the University, this is only 5%. Institutions rely on student fees to support their athletic programs, some more heavily than others. The average mandatory athletics fee is $1,185 across all institutions, while it is $657 at the University. Eighty-four percent of the costs to operate athletic programs at the University are covered by revenues generated by athletics. The average across all institutions is 31%.**

**The third report addressed instructional and research spending, and included six recommendations.**

**Instructional Spending: in FY 2011, instructional spending per FTE student was at or below the national average for public institutions at most Virginia institutions. Between FY 2001 and FY 2011, the average instructional spending per student decreased by 6.9% at Virginia research institutions.**

**Research: Virginia was 37th per capita in total research expenditures in FY 2011 ($1.2 B). The University’s research expenditures totaled $292.1 million, second to Virginia Tech, which as a land grant institution had $450.1 million.**

**The fourth report focused on functions that support the primary mission of institutions, including academic support, student services, institutional support, and facilities operations. Although auxiliary enterprises also support the primary mission, they were excluded from this review since they were the focus of the second report.**

**In general, the report found that spending on support functions increased between 1991 and 2010 (more in the first decade than the second); Virginia institutions spend more on academic support than on other support functions; and institutions could reduce support costs through reviewing organizational structures, implementing more efficient procurement strategies, centralizing staff, and automating various processes.**

**Ms. Sheehy highlighted several of the efficiency opportunities identified by JLARC staff in this report and provided examples of current initiatives that the University has implemented based on the findings of the benchmarking study. She divided them into four major categories:**

*   1.  **General Support Functions**
    2.  **Procurement**
    3.  **Information Technology**
    4.  **Facilities Management**

**General Support Functions**

**Ms. Sheehy said the report found that average span of control at all Virginia institutions is below the generally accepted benchmark. To address this and identify areas for improvement, University Human Resources (UHR) has initiated a University-wide internal review to assess department/unit organizational structures and managerial effectiveness. This review includes a focus on determining the appropriate supervisor/subordinate staffing ratio. The end-goal is the implementation of a more efficiently designed organizational structure with appropriate spans of control and with the most effective managers in those roles.**

**The report notes that the University pays administrators more than similar public institutions. The University implemented a merit-based compensation program based on multiple survey sources which has allowed it to be competitive and recruit and retain the most talented employees.**

**Procurement**

**As noted in the report, institutions could better utilize various strategies, including cooperative procurements and institution-wide contracts, to reduce the cost of procurement. This is consistent with the results of the Organizational Excellence (OE) benchmarking study. To reduce procurement costs, the University is developing a multi-year, prioritized sourcing plan that includes a variety of tactics including strategic sourcing and standardization. Recently, the University implemented strategic sourcing of office supplies with a projected cost-savings of $540,000 annually; 10 additional categories of spend have been identified, analyzed, and prioritized. Once fully implemented, estimated savings will exceed $4M annually.**

**All Virginia public institutions are collaborating to establish a procurement cooperative that will provide a formal network and structure to aggregate and leverage higher education institutional procurement requirements and resources to obtain financial advantage from cooperative procurement. The cooperative will focus on strategic needs or those with best potential to create savings for all participating institutions. The University and 10 other institutions are members of the Virginia Association of State College and University Procurement Professionals (VASCUPP) which negotiates cooperative contracts for use by the member institutions.**

**Information Technology**

**The JLARC review also identified several IT-related strategies that may improve efficiency and reduce costs including automating processes, co-locating and virtualizing servers, and limiting procurements of hardware and software. This affirms the findings of the benchmarking study of IT functions. In response, the University is engaged in several projects to leverage technology for automating workflows, enhancing access to data, and ultimately decreasing the level of transactional activity while increasing our analysis and reporting capabilities.**

**Ms. Sheehy said Report 5 is the final report and presents options and recommendations to address the rising cost of public higher education in Virginia.**

**Net tuition revenue: institutions must rely more heavily on net tuition revenue. As of FY 2012, published in-state undergraduate tuition and mandatory E&G fees averaged $6,329 per year, increasing by $2,475, or 64%, since FY 1999 after accounting for inflation. Increases vary widely across all institutions, from 22% at ODU to 127% at William & Mary. The University’s increase – from $8,285 to $16,617 – is the 2nd highest in the state.**

**Cost sharing goal: the state’s goal, established in 2004, is to fund 67% of the cost of education for in-state students, with the remaining 33% paid through nongeneral funds. The goal is currently unmet at all public institutions. Statewide, institutions receive 16% less than the state’s goal; they would need an additional $533 million in operating funding to meet the goal.**

**Facilities Condition Index (FCI): the FCI measures the amount of deficiencies as a percent of facility replacement value. Poor FCI is greater than 10%; good FCI is less than 5%; fair FCI is between 5% and 10%. In FY 2011, the statewide FCI was 18.6% and the University’s was 9.4%. In December 2004, the Board established a goal of achieving an FCI of 5% or less – at the time, the FCI was 10.6%. Investments through maintenance operations, maintenance reserve, and major capital renewals have reduced the FCI to 6.6% as of June 30, 2013.**

**Monthly income for student loans: the median monthly student loan payment accounts for 8% ($222) of median monthly post-graduation income. The percentage ranged from 6% at three institutions to 13% at Norfolk State. For University students, 6% of monthly income is used to pay student loans.**

**Need met with grant aid: statewide, student aid from all sources met only 32% of financial need for in-state students in FY 2013. The percentage of financial need met ranged from 23% at Norfolk State to 60% at William and Mary. The variation primarily reflects the institutions’ differing student populations and institutional resource levels. The University met 58% of student need with grant aid in FY 2013, second only to William and Mary.**

**JLARC found that various issues contributed to the rising costs of public higher education in Virginia. Chief among these are:**

*   **Declining state funding per student**
*   **Rising institutional spending, primarily on non-academic services**
*   **Tuition and fees increase to compensate for declines in state funding**
*   **State-supported financial aid not meeting student need**

**Across all five reports, JLARC staff presented 32 recommendations to address rising costs of higher education and seven options (potential policy changes) to address institutional operational funding.**

**Ms. Sheehy said that the administration agrees with many of JLARC’s findings and observations over the course of the study. Many are consistent with the findings and opportunities identified through the recent benchmarking study. She said they have three primary concerns and explained those concerns as follows:**

1.  **Across-the-board recommendations: the staff’s directive was to examine the cost of public higher education in broad terms, and we applaud their thorough review and analysis, but as they acknowledged the recommendations cannot likely be implemented in the same way across all institutions given the diversity of the 15 public four-year institutions in terms of size, scope, complexity, and mission. Recommendations for change should be consistent with the respective institutional missions. As such, it may prove difficult for institutions to implement various recommendations proposed in the report while remaining competitive in their respective peer groups.**
2.  **Erosion of Restructuring authority: several recommendations would require legislative action and likely result in increased oversight and control by the state, which have the distinct potential to erode the autonomy achieved through Restructuring and the Management Agreement. The additional autonomy has allowed our operations to become more efficient, which we demonstrate biennially in the reporting of the financial and administrative performance measures. We remain committed to meeting the statewide goals and performing at the highest levels, which is evident with the recent certification by SCHEV, and hope that the General Assembly and Governor maintain their commitment to allowing institutions to operate as provided for in the Restructuring Act and resulting memoranda of understanding and management agreements.**
3.  **Quality is not a primary factor. Overall, quality was not considered as part of the study, but the first and final reports did recognize Virginia’s high graduation rates and noted that collectively institutions achieve the missions of educating and graduating students “better than most.” It is critical that members of JLARC and the General Assembly, as well as the citizens of the Commonwealth, be aware of the quality of public higher education in Virginia. This overall commitment to quality makes higher education in Virginia among the best in the country; however, improving the efficient and effective use of all resources is a top priority for the University, and we remain committed to continue targeting greater efficiencies while maintaining a high standard of academic excellence.**

**Following Ms. Sheehy’s report, Visitors had a number of comments and questions. Mr. Atkinson pointed out that the University was subject to the largest cut in state funding this year. The state is saying that the institutions who are able to do so are responsible for their own long-term financial stability—this is the first time that has been stated overtly.**

**Mr. Conner asked about outsourcing support services. Ms. Sheehy said many have regretted going in that direction because of quality issues. Ms. Harker said they have looked at a variety of opportunities for insourcing, i.e. centralizing services. Mr. Hogan expanded on this, and said more would be presented in the subcommittee session on Saturday. Streamlining Human Resources services is one area he cited. Ms. Sheehy said the College at Wise outsources much of their back office to the University.**

**Mr. Atkinson said spending some time with the JLARC staff might be useful. Mr. Griffin said there may be some services we could provide to other universities in the state. Mr. Hogan said we are pursuing some opportunities now, but we want to get to centers of excellence internally before we offer to others. IT and payroll processing are both potential areas to offer services to others.**

**Ms. Dragas said we hurt ourselves by our “exceptionalism” argument that these don’t apply to us because of our quality standards. We need to figure out how to deliver 120% of the quality at 80% of the cost. Ms. Harker said we are doing just that. Mr. Atkinson said he doesn’t hear the University making excuses; it is recognition that we have a position in the marketplace that other schools don’t have. We should not view it as a negative, but as an opportunity to work with others who don’t have the assets we have.**

**Mr. Fay said it is rare that public bodies are at the forefront of IT excellence. We may be able to offer services to other public bodies, not limited to colleges and universities.**

**Ms. Fried said some of the recommendations are operational and not within the purview of the Board, and she would not want to see the Board getting into these matters. She used the span of control discussion as an example.**

**Mr. Atkinson said we must be careful about some of the generalizations in the report. It is important to drill down on what the University does and doesn’t do; nevertheless, we need to take this to heart and understand it. He pointed out that JLARC criticizes the General Assembly also, and a listening tour is called for, to tap into the expertise of staffers.**

**Mr. Hogan said they would put together a quality scorecard based on some of these recommendations.**

Nor shall the President and the Executive Vice Presidents be prevented from consulting with the Chief Audit Executive as may be necessary to the execution of their duties.

**The Audit Department will give full consideration to scheduling special audit requests made by any department or activity. All requests should be in writing to the Chief Audit Executive and state the purpose and scope of the audit.**

**Independence**

**The Audit Department will be organizationally and functionally independent from all University operations and will have no responsibility for the departments and activities being audited while being responsive to their needs and requirements. Because the Audit Department must be independent in carrying out its responsibility to monitor and evaluate control procedures instituted by management, the extent of audit work to be performed with respect to those procedures is limited to the assessment of such procedures.**

**The Audit Department normally performs tests of underlying records and documentary support for transactions. Accordingly, objectivity would be lost if the Audit Department routinely participated in accumulating data or reconstructing records.**

Authorities and Limitations
===========================

**The Audit Department personnel will have complete, free, and unrestricted access to all University departments, activities, records, properties, and personnel, and is not to be restricted in their activities. Where appropriate, special arrangements will be made for the examination of confidential information.**

Systems Planning and Development
================================

**The Audit Department will participate in the planning, development, implementation, and modification of major computer-based and manual systems to ensure that:**

1.  **adequate controls are incorporated in the system;**
2.  **thorough system testing is performed at appropriate stages;**
3.  **system documentation is complete and accurate; and**
4.  **the resultant system is a complete and accurate implementation of the system specifications.**

**The Audit Department will conduct post-installation evaluations of major information technology systems to ensure that these systems meet their intended purpose and objectives. The department will also review computer operations supporting such systems to ensure that generally accepted standards for systems integrity and security, as well as system-specific controls, are being observed.**

**Security Investigations**

**The Audit, Risk Management and University Police Departments are to be notified if assets have been lost through defalcation or other security breaches. The Audit Department will perform sufficient tests and investigations to identify the weaknesses in procedures, which permitted the defalcation to occur. However, the investigation of the specific event with the objective of recovery and/or prosecution is the responsibility of the University Police Department, with the decision to prosecute being the responsibility of the appropriate Commonwealth’s Attorney.**

Coordination with External Auditing Agencies
============================================

**The Chief Audit Executive will coordinate the department’s audit efforts with those of the University’s independent public accountants or other external auditing agencies by participating in the planning and definition of the scope of proposed audits so the work of all auditing groups is complementary and their combined efforts provide comprehensive, cost-effective audit coverage for the University. Duplication of work will be avoided as much as possible.**

Reporting
=========

**Prior to the completion of a formal report, an exit conference will be conducted with the department or activity head. The conference will be a review of all findings, conclusions, and recommendations. A formal report will be issued at the conclusion of every audit, which will present a concise, clear and factual review of the conditions found, together with recommendations for improvement. A formal written response shall be issued to the Chief Audit Executive, or the Audit Director issuing the report_,_ within 30 days addressing each finding, recommendation, and exception included in the audit report. This response will include the department’s or activity’s plan for implementing the recommendations or a presentation of significant disagreement with the findings and/or recommendations.**

**A follow-up review of significant audit recommendations will be made by the Audit Department to establish that agreed-to recommendations have been adopted. A memorandum will be issued on the follow-up review to the President, the Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, the Executive Vice President and Provost, and the Executive Vice President for Health Affairs as appropriate.**

Distribution of Reports
=======================

**Audit reports will be issued to the Executive Vice President or Vice President most directly responsible for the department or activity involved. In addition, copies of all such reports will be distributed to the President, the Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, and the senior fiscal administrator having a functional interest in the subject matter.**

**All audit reports will be available for review by the Board of Visitors.**

**A summary of significant audit findings will be prepared for each Board meeting and submitted to the Board of Visitors, the President, the Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, the Executive Vice President and Provost, and the Executive Vice President for Health Affairs as appropriate.**
