The committee on the "Otts Lectureship" submitted its report which is as follows:

J. M. P. Otts in the form, in which it has been brought before them. They recommend therefore in lieu of such acceptance the adoption of the following resolutions:-

2\. That those members of the Faculty of the University, who desire to promote the plan fostered by Dr Otts, be and are hereby authorized to arrange for the custody of the endowment fund of the Otts Lectureship, on any other similar foundation, to invite suitable persons to lecture at this University under conditions of time and place approved by the Faculty, to provide from the income of the fund for the payment of the lectures and the publication of the lectures, and to do such other acts as are necessary for the successful execution of the plan.

3\. That a copy of these resolutions be forwarded by the Secretary of this Board to Dr Otts, with a suitable expression of the thanks of the Board for his liberal gift.

The Rector and Visitors of the University having received the resignation of Profr Wm M. Thornton as Chairman of the Faculty of the University in accepting the said resignation desire to put on record their appreciation of the services which Mr Thornton has rendered this institution.

For Eight-Years Mr Thornton has performed the duties of Chairman in addition to those of a full professor in which he has exhibited great ability and untiring zeal in promoting its interests.

Until default shall be made by the said Rector and Visitors, or their successors or assigns in the payment of any interest upon the said bonds hereinbefore mentioned and described, or upon some one or more of them, or in the payment of the principal of the said bonds, or of some one or more of them, the said Rector and Visitors, their successors and assigns, shall be suffered and permitted to remain in actual and exclusive possession, management and control of all of the said property hereinbefore mentioned and described, to take the rents, issues and profits thereof, and in all respects to use and control the same as fully and completely as though this indenture were not executed.

In case default shall have been made in the payment of any coupon for interest upon the said bonds, or any of them, and such coupon shall have remained unpaid and in arrears for the period of ninety days after demand, the principal of such, and every such of said bonds shall thereupon become due and payable, notwithstanding that the time limited for the payment thereof may not then have elapsed. And in such case, or in case default shall be made in the payment of the principal of the said bonds, or any thereof, at maturity, and the holders of one third of the whole amount then outstanding of the said bonds and coupons upon which default has been made, in writing so request, it shall be lawful for the said Trust Company, or its successors, or for the person or persons who shall for the time being be charged with the execution of the trust hereby created, with the assistance of any person or persons, and with or without, any proceeding in, or order or decree of any court, to enter in and upon the said property hereinbefore described, or which may then be subject to the lien of these presents in any place or places in which the said property, or any part thereof, may be, and to take possession of the said property, and of all property whatsoever which may then be subject to the lien created by these presents, and if need be to take and carry away, the said personal property, and to sell and dispose of all said property as a whole or in parcels, by public auction to the highest bidder, at the said University of Virginia, or elsewhere, at such time or times as the said Trust Company, or its successors, shall appoint, and upon such reasonable terms of sale as the said Trust Company may prescribe in regard to the time or times for the payment of the purchase money thereof and the mode of securing any deferred instalment of such purchase money; but prior to any such sale the said Trust Company shall give public notice thereof, and of the time and place at which the same is proposed to be made, by advertisement thereof in one newspaper of general circulation in each of the cities of Charlottesville and Richmond, Va, the same to be published for at least once a week for six consecutive weeks prior to the date at which such sale shall be advertised to take place.

And upon any such sale the said trustee for the time being shall make, execute and deliver to the purchaser or purchasers of the said property good and sufficient deeds, bills of sale, or such other further instruments as may be requisite to transfer to such purchaser or purchasers complete and absolute title to, and property in and to, the said lands and other estate of whatsoever description and every part and parcel thereof; except that in so far as the said two parcels of land first herein conveyed and described are concerned, such sale shall be made subject to the aforesaid deed of trust thereon, dated July 2nd, 1875, and to the payment of any balance remaining then unpaid upon the debt secured in the said deed.

And it is hereby expressly declared and agreed that any sale or sales that may be made as aforesaid shall be a perpetual bar both at law and in equity against the Rector and Visitors, their successors and assigns, and against any and all persons whomsoever claiming the property so sold, or any part thereof, by, from, through, or under the said Rector and Visitors, their successors or assigns, save and except as to any balance then remaining unpaid upon said lien of July 2nd, 1875, in so far as the same may then bind said real estate; and after deducting from the proceeds of any such sale the amount of all reasonable proper expenses and charges which may be made or incurred by the said Trust Company in taking, acquiring, or retaining possession of the said property, or any portion thereof, or in managing or controlling or transporting the same, or in preparing for, making and completing such sale or sales, and making conveyances to the purchasers, as well as the compensation allowed by the laws of Virginia to a trustee who sells, the trustee shall apply the purchase money and proceeds of such sale ratably and equally amongst all the holders of the bonds and past due coupons and interest herein secured except, and taking care that, if any of the holders of the said bonds have not received so much interest from the said Rector and Visitors as others, such bondholders shall, first, and before any distribution is made, be paid so much as will place them on an equal footing with the other bondholders; after which all shall share alike, without discrimination or difference as between principal and interest. And if after the payment in full of the principal and interest accrued upon each and all of the said bonds, a surplus of the proceeds of such sale or sales shall remain in the hands of the said Trust Company, it shall pay such surplus to the said Rector and Visitors, or their assigns, or as any court of competent jurisdiction shall lawfully direct.

And it is hereby expressly declared and agreed that the said Trust Company, or its officer, or agent, or attorney, acting for it may, in its or his discretion, adjourn any sale which they may make at the time and place appointed for such sale, and if so adjourned, such sale may be made at the time and place at and to which the same shall have been adjourned, and without further notice thereof.

And it is further declared and agreed that the receipt of the Trust Company, or of its officer, or agent, who shall make such sale, or cause the same to be made, shall be a sufficient acquittance to the purchaser of the prorerty which shall be sold as aforesaid for the purchase money-, and such purchaser shall not, after paying such purchase money and receiving such receipt, be liable in any way to see to see to the application of such purchase money upon, or for, the trust purposes by these presents provided for, no shall he be liable for any loss, or misapplication or non-application of such purchase money in part or in whole.

And it is further declared and agreed that upon any sale made under, or by virtue of these presents, the bonds intended to be secured hereby, and all overdue coupons thereupon, shall be received in payment of the purchase money for any property sold at such sale as equivalent to so much of the said purchase money as would be payable upon such bonds and overdue coupons.

In case default shall be made in the payment of the interest coupons upon the said bonds, or any thereof, after demand therefor, and such coupon or coupons shall remain so unpaid and in arrears for the period of ninety days, or in case default shall be made after demand in the payment of the principal of any of the said bonds, when the same by the terms thereof shall become due and payable, then, and in either of said cases, it shall be the duty of the said Trust Company to exercise the power conferred, and sell, or take proper legal proceedings to enforce the rights of the holders of the said bonds upon a requisition in writing to that effect being made upon the said trustee, signed by the holders of at least one third of the whole amount of the said bonds then outstanding, and upon a proper indemnification to the said trustee against all costs and expenses to be by it incurred in the premises.

At all times while the property hereinbefore described shall remain in the possession or under the control of the said Rector and Visitors, their successors or assigns, it shall be its, or their duty, to keep and maintain the same in good order and repair. And the said Rector and Visitors, or their successors or assigns, may from time to time make such additions or repairs in and about the same as it, or they, may deem advisable; provided, however, that such additions or alterations shall not impair or decrease the value of the said property.

It is mutually agreed by and between the parties hereto, that the said Trust Company shall be entitled to just and reasonable compensation for all the services which it may hereafter render in this trust, and the payment to it of all outlays and expenses incurred in the execution of this trust, to be paid by the said Rector and Visitors, their successors or assigns, and that the said Trust Company shall not be answerable for the default or misconduct of any agent by it with reasonable care appointed, nor for anything whatsoever in connection with this trust except willful misconduct, or failure to exercise ordinary care. And it shall be no part of the duty of the said Trust Company to see to the recording or filing of this deed of trust, or to the renewing thereof; nor to the making or renewal of any insurance on the property hereby conveyed, nor as to its amount or validity.

And it is further agreed that the said Trust Company, or any trustee hereafter appointed, may be removed by the votes of two thirds in interest of the holders of said bonds issued and outstanding at the time being, which vote for the removal of a trustee must be taken at a meeting of the said bondholders, and must be attested by the hands and seals of the Chairman and Secretary of such meeting, or by a statement in writing under the hands and seals of two-thirds in interest of the bondholders, duly acknowledged.

And it is further mutually agreed that the said Trust Company, or any trustee hereafter appointed, may resign and discharge themselves of the trust created by these presents, by giving notice to the said Rector and Visitors, in writing, at least three months before resignation shall take effect, or by giving such other notice as shall be accepted by the said Rector and Visitors, and upon the due execution and delivery of the conveyance hereinafter required. And it is hereby expressly declared and agreed, that, in case any time hereafter the said Trust Company, or any trustee hereafter appointed, shall die or resign, or be removed, or become incapable, or unfit to act in the said trust, then in case there is no existing default in the payment of the interest or principal of any of the said bonds secured hereby, the said Rector and Visitors shall, by an instrument under their corporate seal and recorded in the clerk's office of Albemarle County Court, appoint a successor or successors of such deceased, removed, or incapable trustee or trustees; but if there shall be any existing default in the payment of any such principal or interest, or if the said Rector and Visitors shall for six months decline or neglect to appoint such successor or successors, then in that case the holders of the bonds secured hereby, acting by a majority in interest, shall be, and they are hereby, authorized and empowered by an instrument or instruments, in writing under their respective hands and seals, duly acknowledged as aforesaid, at a meeting of the said bondholders, to appoint a successor or successors to such deceased, removed or incapable trustee or trustees.

And such successor or successors that are so appointed shall immediately upon his or their acceptance of the trust become vested with all the power, authority and estates held or possessed by the trustee trustees whom he or they shall have been appointed to succeed, without further assurance or conveyance.

And thereupon all the power and authority herein, and all the estate, right, title and interest in the property affected hereby of such resigned or removed trustee or trustees shall wholly cease or determine. But notwithstanding, the surving or continuing trustee, if there be such, and the trustee or trustees resigning or being removed, shall upon request in writing of the new trustee or trustees, execute and deliver to him or them all such conveyances or other instruments as shall be fitted or expedient for the purpose of assuring to such new trustee or trustees the legal estate in the premises.

And it is hereby declared and agreed that in the case the holders of said bonds shall fail or omit to appoint a new trustee or trustees in manner aforesaid, application may be made by the said Rector and Visitors, or by any holders of any of the said bonds, to any court of competent to entertain jurisdiction of the proceedings to enforce the lien of these presents, for the appointment of a new trustee or new trustees to be made upon such reasonable notice to the parties in interest as the said court shall deem proper.

And this indenture further witnesseth; that the said Rector and Visitors for and in consideration of the premises and for the sum of Ten Dollars, the receipt whereof, at and before the ensealing and delivery of these presents, is hereby acknowledged, covenants, promises and agrees, and by these presents does for itself and its successors covenant, promise and agree to and with the said Trust Company and its successors in the trust hereby created, that the said Rector and Visitors shall and will well and truly pay, or cause to be paid, unto the holders of the said bonds the principal and interest thereof as the same shall become payable according to the tenor of the said bonds, and the terms of such coupons as may be thereto annexed, and that they shall and will from time to time, and at all times thereafter, and as often as thereunto requested by the said Trust Company under this indenture, execute, acknowledge, and deliver all such other and further instruments, conveyances and assurances in law for the better assuring unto the said Trust Company, and its successors in this trust, the property herein mentioned and described, and all substituted property, as shall by the said Trust Company, or its counsel learned in the law, be devised, advised or required.

And it is further understood and agreed that the bonds for the registration of which provision has hereinbefore been made, shall be so registered on the books of the said Rector and Visitors, and while they shall remain so registered the principal thereof shall be payable only to the registered owners or to their legal representatives. And if at any time after the expiration of ten years from the date of said bonds the said Rector and Visitors shall determine to call in and redeem a portion, or a certain number of said bonds by way of investment of the sinking fund herein provided for, or otherwise, the bond or bonds so to be called in and redeemed shall be selected and determined upon by lot by the said Rector and Visitors.

And the said Rector and Visitors do hereby further covenant to and with the said Trust Company and to and with the said parties of the third part, that they, the said Rector and Visitors, will keep the said buildings upon the said University premises, or the more important portion of them, insured in one or more reputable fire insurance companies for the aggregate sum of not less than One hundred and fifty thousand dollars until such time as the aggregate amount of the principal of the bonds herein secured shall be reduced below said sum of $150,000.00; after which time an amount of insurance at least equal to the principal of all said bonds outstanding shall be sufficient; and all policies for such insurance shall be drawn or assigned so that loss, of any accrue thereunder, shall be payable to said Trust Company, or its successors as trustee for the further security and indemnity of the said parties of the third part; and the said Rector and Visitors may, by and with the consent in writing of said Trust Company, or the acting trustee first obtained for that purpose, expend any amount or amounts, or a part thereof, realized from any such loss, in rebuilding and replacing the buildings and structures from the destruction of which the loss accrued.

And the said Rector and Visitors do further covenant to and with the said Trust Company and to and with the said parties of the third part, that they, the said Rector and Visitors, will well and truly establish, set apart, preserve, and maintain a sinking fund of not less than two thousand dollars annually out of the current income and revenues of said University in preference to all other charges on such income and revenues, (except as to those charges to which a superior preference may have been given by law) which sinking fund shall be accumulated, preserved and kept solely and exclusively for the purpose of meeting and discharging the principal of the bonds herein secured; and the same shall be from time to time invested in safe interest bearing securities, or be used in taking up, purchasing or retiring the bonds herein secured, or any of them; but in case the same shall be so used in purchasing, retiring or taking up any such bonds, then an amount equal to all such interest as would thereafter otherwise have become from time to time payable upon such bonds so purchased, retired or taken up, shall be from time to time added to such sinking fund over and above the said two thousand dollars per annum.

And it is further provided that, while the said Rector and Visitors shall remain in possession, and there shall be no subsisting default in the payment of the principal of any of the aforesaid bonds herein secured and no default continuing for ninety days in the payment of any of the interest thereon, the said Rector and Visitors shall have power from time to time to sell and dispose of, free from the lien, operation and effect of this indenture such portion of the movable property conveyed and assigned in the second paragraph of the granting clause of this indenture as may at any time be, or become, undesirable or unsuitable for the uses and purposes for which it is now held, or which may be more valuable for sale than for use; provided that the same shall be adequately replaced and substituted by other similar property to be placed upon the premises of a value equal to or greater than so sold or disposed of; and such property so acquired shall be and remain in all respects subject to the provisions and lien of this indenture as if specifically included and conveyed herein; and such right of sale or exchange shall only be exercised upon condition of substitution being made as aforesaid.

And until such default in the payment of said principal or some portion thereof, or such default of ninety days in the payment of said interest, or some portion thereof, the said Rector and Visitors shall have the full right and power to demand, sue for, receive, give acquittance for and collect the aforesaid legacy bequeathed by the will of the said Arthur W. Austin, and to compromise, compound, adjust and commute the same free from the lien, operation and effect of this indenture; save and except, however, that the principal amount of any and all monies, funds and securities received by said Rector and Visitors from and on account of the said legacy, shall be and remain in the hands of said Rector and Visitors in all respects subject to the lien and operation of this indenture; but until such default be made as aforesaid the said Rector and Visitors shall be permitted to hold the said principal of all such monies, funds and securities, and place and invest the same in some safe, interest-bearing securities, and from time to time to change such investments so made, and to use the interest and income thereof in and about the current business of the University; or the said Rector and Visitors may, with the approval and consent of the said Trust Company, or acting trustee first obtained in writing for that purpose, invest and expend a portion of such monies, funds and securities in, buildings, improvements and betterments of a permanent nature upon the said premises of the said University. But if under the terms and conditions of this indenture, it shall have become necessary and proper for the said Trust Company, or the acting trustee hereunder, to make sale of said legacy, then, and in that event, the said Trust Company, or the acting trustee, shall be authorized, in the discretion of such trustee, to sue for and collect such legacy, and, with the consent of the said Rector and Visitors, to commute and compound the same instead of making sale thereof; and the proceeds of any such collection or commutation shall be disposed of in the same manner that the proceeds of a sale of such legacy would be disposed of hereunder.

Upon the production by the said Rector and Visitors to the said Trust Company, or to its successor or successors in the trust, of all the bonds and coupons which may have been issued in pursuance of and secured by this indenture, or in event of the loss or destruction of any of said bonds and coupons, upon proof satisfactory to said Trust Company, or to said acting trustee or trustees, that all of said bonds and coupons have been fully paid and discharged; then, and in that event, the said Trust Company, or its successor or successors in the trust, shall be fully authorized and empowered, and it shall be their duty to release to release to the said Rector and Visitors all the property and estate of every description herein conveyed, so that the same shall stand free and forever discharged and acquitted from the lien of this indenture as fully and completely as if the same had never been made, but all costs, expenses and charges, incident to this release and discharge, shall be borne and paid by the said Rector and Visitors.

Default in the payment of the principal of the said bonds, or any of them, and default for ninety days in the payment of the interest coupons thereon, as hereinbefore mentioned, referred to and specified, shall be construed to mean such default after demand shall have been made at or after maturity for the payment of any of such bonds or coupons; and no such default shall be understood to have accrued as to any such bond, or coupon for interest, until such demand therefor shall have been made; and no interest shall accrue or any overdue coupon until after demand for the payment thereof shall have been made.

And if the said Virginia Trust Company shall at any time fail or cease to keep an office in the City of Richmond, Virginia, at which the said bonds and coupons can in the usual course of business be presented for payment or redemption, or shall cease to act as trustee under this indenture; then, and in either of these events, all the said bonds then outstanding and interest and coupons, representing such interest thereon, shall be and become payable at the office of the Proctor of the said University; he being by law constituted the fiscal agent of the said Rector and Visitors.

And the said Rector and Visitors covenant to and with the said Trust Company that they will warrant generally the property hereby conveyed; that they have the right to convey the aforesaid lands to the said Trust Company; that the said Trust Company shall, in the execution of the trusts herein created, have quiet possession of the said lands, free from all encumbrances; and that the said Rector and Visitors have done no act to encumber the same. But it is understood that these covenants are made and entered into, subject to the aforesaid lien of July 2nd, 1875, upon said lands, which lien nevertheless the said Rector and Visitors are bound to pay at maturity to the exoneration of said lands.

And this indenture further witnesseth: That said Trust Company hereby accepts the aforesaid trust, and covenants and agrees to and with the said Rector and Visitors to execute the same upon the terms and conditions mentioned.

In Testimony Whereof: the said Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia have caused their name and Corporate seal to be hereunto affixed by . . . . ., their Rector and chief officer, and attested by . . . . . , their Secretary; and the said trust company has caused its name and corporate seal to be hereunto affixed by . . . . . , its President, and attested by . . . . . its Secretary, on the day and year first above written.

The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, a public corporation created and existing under the laws of the State of Virginia, for value received, hereby acknowledges itself indebted and promises to pay to the bearer of this bond, or in case the same be registered, then to the registered owner thereof, forty years after the date hereof, at the Office of the Virginia Trust Company, at Richmond, Virginia, the sum of Five Hundred Dollars in the true and lawful money of the United States of America, with interest thereon at the rate of five per centum per annum from this date until paid, payable semi-annually on the first day of May and the first day of November in each year at the said Office of the said Trust Company on the presentation and surrender of the proper coupons representing the same, hereto attached.

This bond is one of an issue of Two Hundred Thousand Dollars of bonds, the principal and interest whereof is secured by a deed of trust of even date herewith upon all the real estate, and certain personal property of the said Rector and Visitors, to the Virginia Trust Company, of Richmond, Virginia, as trustee, and of record in the Clerk's Office of the County Court of Albemarle County.

In case of default in the payment of the above interest for ninety days after any instalment of the same is due, and has been demanded, the principal of this bond shall at the option of the holder thereof; and in accordance with the terms and conditions of said deed of trust, become forthwith due and payable.

This bond is issued in pursuance of an Act of the General Assembly of Virginia, approved January 23d 1896, entitled \`An Act to enable the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia to repair the loss sustained by that institution by the fire of October 27th, 1895,' which said Act provides that this bond shall be exempt from taxation in any manner by said State, or by any county, city, town, or other corporation exercising the powers of taxation under the authority of the said State.

The said Rector and Visitors as provided in said Act, do hereby reserve the right to pay the principal of this bond at any time after ten years from this date; and after this bond shall have been called in by the said Rector and Visitors in pursuance of this provision, and after notice of such call shall have been published once a week for four successive weeks in some news-paper published in the City of Charlottesville, Va, and for the period of thirty days in some newspaper published in the city of Richmond, Va, all interest on this bond shall cease and determine and no further interest accrue thereon; and all coupons hereto attached and hereafter maturing shall be and become wholly void, and of no effect; but the principal together with any interest, theretofore accrued and represented pro tanto by the coupon next thereafter maturing, is to be paid upon the presentation and surrender of this bond and all the said coupons thereafter maturing.

The holder of this bond may cause the same to be registered on the books of the University in the name of such holder, and the same shall thereafter be transferable only on such books; and until there be a further transfer thereof on said books, the principal thereof shall be payable only to such registered holder, or to the legal representatives of such holder; the coupons or interest warrants remaining always transferable by delivery; but when assigned to bearer by any such registered holder and such assignment registered on the said books, this bond shall again become negotiable and transferable by delivery, and will so continue until again registered in the name of an assignee; and each successive registration shall be endorsed thereon.

This bond shall not be valid until the certificate endorsed thereon shall be signed by the said Trust Company, or some officer thereof.

In Testimony whereof, the said Rector and Visitors have caused this bond to be signed by their said Rector and sealed with their corporate seal, and attested by their secretary, this first day of May, Anno Domini 1896.
