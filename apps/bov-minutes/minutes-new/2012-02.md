**President’s Report**

**The President’s remarks are reported verbatim:**

**Madame Rector, Members of the Board of Visitors:**

**I will begin by speaking about an issue that is familiar to all of us by now — the Living Wage Campaign and its demands. The campaign members say that they have been seeking a living wage policy at UVa for 14 years; that might be true, but I have been here only 18 months. In that time, I presented to you a budget that increased the minimum hiring rate from $10.14 to $10.65 per hour (or $14.55 per hour, if we include the average level of health benefits); accelerated pay increases for our lowest-paid workers; provided compensation for the money that employees lost in last year’s VRS adjustment; and maintained a package of comprehensive benefits. Workers who complete training, usually within six months to a year of hiring, receive a raise to $10.94 per hour.**

**We currently have 26 workers at our minimum entry-level hiring wage[\[1\]](#footnote-1) out of a total of approximately 8,500 salaried staff and faculty in the Academic Division. In September of last year, the Board received a letter from the Living Wage Campaign asking that the minimum hourly wage be raised to $12.01.[\[2\]](#footnote-2) The various demands I have received during the past several weeks have urged us to raise the minimum hourly rate to $11.44[\[3\]](#footnote-3), to $13 including medical benefits[\[4\]](#footnote-4), and to $13 exclusive of medical benefits.[\[5\]](#footnote-5) The City of Charlottesville, which has adopted a living wage policy, lists 20 job categories on its website with a starting wage of $10.73.[\[6\]](#footnote-6) As this variation shows, there is no accepted, objective referent for what constitutes a living wage.**

**I have also been asked to peg future raises to a cost-of-living index calculated by an external group. I will note for the record that for the 12 months ending January 2012, the unadjusted Consumer Price Index rose by 3.1%,[\[7\]](#footnote-7) while the minimum hourly rate demand has risen by nearly 9% in the period since September 2011.**

**The point about these numbers is that the protest is not principally about numbers (nor about dollars). If it were, I would be applauded for the significant progress we made in just one year in raising our minimum hourly wage and in reducing the number of employees earning the minimum entry-level wage from 61 to 26.**

**Rather, this protest is about who makes decisions. The demands have called for a guarantee that we will peg raises in the future to an inflationary figure determined by the Economic Policy Institute,[\[8\]](#footnote-8) and that a Living Wage Oversight Board be appointed to oversee our employment policies.**

**Last spring, when the economic situation continued to look bleak and it appeared that, once again, we would receive no raises from the state, the living wage activists with whom I met urged me just to adopt the policy, even though they conceded that we probably could not fund the policy.**

**I appreciated their conciliatory tone, but I find myself unable to agree to a promise that the University might not be able to keep. We might not be able to keep a pledge to peg wages to inflation. We have not been able to do so for the past four years; as you know, our employees have lost ground because of the state-wide pay freeze. To make the promise represents to me a fundamental lack of integrity; equally important, it represents an abdication of my responsibility to balance all the competing financial priorities before us.**

**I am, without reservation, accountable to you as the Board for the way the administration makes decisions and for how we manage our budget. With regard to the living wage campaign, I believe all of us regret that some protestors have resorted to a hunger strike, choosing the risk of doing harm to themselves. I remain concerned about the wages and working conditions here at UVa for all of our employees, including the lowest-paid. And I am quite willing to be accountable to our community with annual reports on our progress. But I cannot delegate employment policies beyond our administration, except as required by law.**

**Improving salaries and providing for enrollment growth will be our highest priorities in the new budget we propose. I believe that I have demonstrated my concern for these issues, not only in the one budget I have so far submitted to you, but also in the staff satisfaction survey and in the respectful workplace taskforce whose recommendations we are now implementing.**

**Introduction / Overview of Board Meeting**

**I will turn now to other business before us in this Board meeting. This meeting organizes and presents a great deal of information for the committees and for the Board. As you are well aware, this is a large and complex organization with several distinct lines of business. Besides being a major educator of undergraduate, graduate, and professional students, we are also a major health care provider. We are a large research facility, and we have a large athletics operation. Each of these activities will receive attention in the course of the meeting.**

**I would like to highlight three themes of this meeting. First is the focus on student learning. You will learn about the global involvement of our students, both through academic programs such as global humanities and global health, and through study-abroad experiences. You will also learn about what we are doing to foster success in learning among our students. You will hear a report about how UVa students’ curricular choices are distributed, given our curriculum is organized by requirements and not through a core curriculum. I note that you have also elected a Student Visitor for the coming year. We will have lunch tomorrow with several of our student leaders from various organizations across the Grounds.**

**The second theme is the focus on financial accountability and prudence. You will receive a new financial report that summarizes the University’s position at the end of December. This report will provide holistic information on UVa’s fiscal health and its capacity to achieve institutional goals. It will show how we are managing our strategic priorities and ensuring that our flow of revenues and expenditures reflects those priorities. This is important big-picture information for you to have as we enter our FY 2013 budget discussions.**

**You will hear an update on the capital campaign and other fundraising efforts, and an overview of the legislative progress on the higher education budget. You will hear more about the ongoing review of AccessUVa, our financial aid program. You have already heard about the careful planning underway in our Health System. Later today, you will hear an updated ten-year financial plan for Athletics, taking into account some of the changes that have occurred since the plan was last presented to the Board — including the coming addition of two universities to the ACC.**

**We think daily about prudent use of our resources. You recently received this year’s President’s Report, presented for the first time in electronic format only. After assessing the production and printing costs of the report, and by deciding to discontinue the print version, we realized a cost savings of almost $43,000. This is a small savings, but it is one illustration of our efforts to contain costs.**

**The third theme is the necessity for balance as we try to maintain many different activities, using a number of different revenue sources, and seeking always to ensure quality in education, health care, research, and all other endeavors. We face many challenges as we seek to align our people, resources, talents, and space to best serve our diverse constituencies. You will sense in our presentations the tug among many good priorities that compete for the available dollars.**

**CVC Campaign**

**After so much discussion of financial pressures, I want to close with some news about our employees’ commitment to giving —a commitment they have sustained in spite of their own financial pressures in recent years. You are well aware that for four years now, most of our employees have seen no increase in their pay. Nevertheless, we have some of the most generous employees to be found anywhere. UVa employees donated a record $982,000 through the 2011 Commonwealth of Virginia Campaign, or CVC – an annual workplace-giving program that allows all of Virginia’s state employees to support charities of their choice.**

**More than 3,900 UVa employees made donations in the 2011 campaign – an increase of more than 17% over the 2010 campaign and the largest number of donations ever made through the CVC at UVa.**

**Overall, our employee donations accounted for more than 27% of the statewide CVC total of approximately $3.6 million. Since 1999, our employees have contributed more than $9 million through the campaign, and they have led all state agencies in giving for more than 10 years.**

**In spite of the prolonged freeze on salary increases and the poor economy of recent years, our employees have kept up this strong tradition of giving. And that says a lot about the generosity and compassion of the people who work for UVa.**

**This concludes my preliminary remarks. Before I deliver the Gifts and Grants Report, I would be happy to receive your views or to respond to your questions.**

**Gifts and Grants Report**

**Current Fiscal Year through December 31, 2011**

**Philanthropic giving to the University of Virginia and its related foundations is $140,049,592.53 for the fiscal year through December 31, 2011.**

**Access UVA Ad Hoc Committee Report**

**Mark Kington, Chair of the Ad Hoc Committee on AccessUVa, provided a summary of the February 6, 2012 meeting of the Ad Hoc Committee.**

**The February 6th meeting was held to discuss progress on two main elements of the work supported by management and the consultants from Art and Science: aid optimization, and the pricing and positioning study (the survey).**

**On aid optimization, he said the purpose is to assess whether there are opportunities within the current financial aid program and policy to more efficiently or effectively use resources for aid. The outcome measures for optimizing the class were improving yield, diversity, academic quality, and net tuition revenue. Net revenue is the most important financial metric. Institutional aid is best thought of as counter revenue (to be optimized) rather than as a cost (to be reduced). The results of the optimization study indicate very marginal opportunities to optimize under the current financial aid program and policies. In-state opportunities exist, but can only provide marginal gains in net tuition revenue.**

**Mr. Kington called on Mr. Strine to explain tuition revenue. He said gross price is not the important number to focus on. The important number is net revenue to the institution.**

**Mr. Kington said increases in the number of in-state students through the use of increased financial aid awards could help increase diversity, improve in-state academic quality and increase net tuition revenue, but the gains are marginal. Out-of-state opportunities to increase net revenue, diversity, and academic quality exist, but require change to achieve. Overall, each incoming student from outside Virginia increases net tuition revenue significantly. Conversely, if awards were decreased to out-of-state students, each student would “take away” significantly larger amounts of net tuition revenue than could be gained by increasing the number of in-state students unless we applied different financial aid rules to the out-of-state admitted population**

**Mr. Kington said the second main element, the pricing and positioning study, looked at the factors driving prospective students’ decisions about whether or not to apply and matriculate at UVa, and the investments in program and faculty or shifts in pricing and aiding that would advance yield, quality, diversity or net revenue. The key cohorts to be sampled:**

*   **In-state (4 regions) / out of state**
*   **Lower income**
*   **Under-represented groups**
*   **Highest ability**
*   **Planning to major in engineering**

**He said the survey will measure the extent to which those interested in applying choose the University because of the following attributes:**

*   **Strength in intended major**
*   **Academic reputation**
*   **Perceived as attracting outstanding students**
*   **Quality of faculty**
*   **Strength in the sciences and engineering**
*   **Sense of history and tradition**
*   **Presence of strong honor code**
*   **Commitment to need-based financial aid**
*   **Affordability**
*   **Tradition of student leadership**
*   **Beauty of campus**
*   **4-year graduation rate**
*   **Emphasis on public service and citizenship**
*   **Advising and mentoring**

**The survey will also, through a focused decision model process, allow the University to understand how admitted applicants made a decision whether to matriculate by assessing key variables that might influence their decision making:**

*   **Big university v. smaller college feel**
*   **Strong v. limited emphasis on faculty-student relationships**
*   **Extraordinary student leadership opportunities v. more than usual v. typical leadership opportunities**
*   **Strong v. some emphasis on global citizenship**
*   **Tradition/like-minded culture v. individuality/diverse culture**
*   **Need-blind approach and meets full need v. need-blind v. need-aware**
*   **Cost of attendance: current and 3 levels of increase, in-state and out-of-state**
*   **Some v. extensive need-based aid**
*   **Student debt caps: 3 levels**
*   **Some v. no merit aid**

**Lastly, the survey will assess the impact that investments in key programmatic initiatives might have in attracting the interest and driving the decision making of prospective students:**

*   **Support to raise percentage of degree completion in STEM fields**
*   **“Graduate-like” junior-senior concentrations**
*   **“3+1” dual degree programs**
*   **Focus on innovation and entrepreneurship**
*   **Opportunities in Washington, DC, for all**
