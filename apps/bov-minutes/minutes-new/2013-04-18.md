**Present as well were Teresa A. Sullivan, Patrick D. Hogan, John D. Simon, Susan G. Harris, Paul J. Forch, Susan A. Carkeek, Patricia M. Lampkin, Marcus L. Martin, M.D., Nancy A. Rivers, Colette Sheehy, Thomas C. Skalak, Robert D. Sweeney, Anthony de Bruyn, McGregor McCance, Gordon D. Burris, Donna Price Henry, Richard A. Kovatch, and Debra D. Rinker.**

**The Rector called the meeting to order and thanked Susan Harris and Debbie Rinker for their help in adjusting to last minute changes in the agenda. Ms. Dragas called for a moment of silence for the victims of the bombing in Boston. The Rector also thanked her colleagues on the Board, especially Finance Chair Victoria Harker, and President Sullivan and Pat Hogan and their staff for all of their hard work in researching the options and issues before them. She said the goal for the Board and the administration is to provide a public higher education that is both affordable and excellent, which she is sure can be achieved through working together.**

**Ms. Dragas said this analysis leads to certain questions:**

*   **How do we assess excellence? By our rankings, our offerings, learning outcomes, faculty accomplishments, how much we spend?**
*   **What do we know about the true costs of the undergraduate experience? A new budget model will be implemented to help answer this. We must stretch our limits to capture alternative resources, from philanthropy, research, and other sources, and delay expenditures until we understand their final use, to remain affordable to Virginia families.**
*   **When are greater cost increases no longer sustainable? Family income has not kept pace with tuition increases.**
*   **SCHEV reported 27% more in-state students needed financial assistance last year, and average student loan debt has exceeded $20,000, with parent debt is unreported.**

**She said we need to calculate our very best academic experience by actively pursuing other revenue and conserving our resources.**

**Consent Agenda: Assignment of Pavilion X**

**The Rector introduced Mr. Patrick D. Hogan, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, to present the consent agenda. Mr. Hogan said the Executive Committee has concurred with the recommendation that Dr. Nancy E. Dunlap, appointed the dean of the School of Medicine, reside in Pavilion X while fulfilling her duties as dean.**

**On motion, the following resolution was approved:**

**APPROVAL OF ASSIGNMENT OF PAVILION X, EAST LAWN, TO NANCY E. DUNLAP, M.D.**

**RESOLVED, Pavilion X, East Lawn, is assigned to Nancy E. Dunlap, M.D., Dean of the School of Medicine, for the period May 1, 2013 to November 30, 2014.**

**Action Item: Tuition and Required Fees: University of Virginia 2013-2014 Academic Year and 2014 Summer Session**

**Ms. Sheehy stated that for 2013-14, the University developed a proposal that reflects a moderate base tuition increase, addresses differing cost structures in Commerce and Engineering, and provides adequate funds to meet the state-authorized salary increase as well as other required cost increases. She said the University proposed the following approach:**

*   **A base tuition and educational and general (E&G) fee increase of 3.9% for all in-state undergraduate students and a 4.9% increase for all out-of-state undergraduate students.**
*   **Entering engineering students (including students in PRODUCED in Virginia) would pay an additional $2,000 in tuition and no longer would pay program specific fees, while continuing engineering students would pay the engineering course fee approved in 2012-13. Each new entering class would pay $2,000 more than the base tuition in that year until all four years of students are paying the same rate. Program/course fees will be phased out over this period.**
*   **The Commerce School will implement its final phase of increased tuition, and charge students enrolled in the school $5,000 more than the base tuition.**

**Ms. Sheehy showed several graphs illustrating the University’s position as compared to its peers. She stated that Virginia’s 2012-2013 in-state tuition and required fees for first year undergraduates are $12,216, including the orientation fee of $210, which is $1,217 above the $10,999 public average for our peer institutions. Virginia’s 2012-2013 out-of-state tuition and required fees for first year undergraduates are $38,228, including the orientation fee of $210 which is $8,960 above the $29,268 public average for our peer institutions.**

**She stated that while tuition is higher, low fees make the combination of the two lower in comparison to VMI and William & Mary. With the exception of Virginia Tech, UVA devotes a high percentage of collected resources to academic programs.**

**Ms. Sheehy proposed the following increases in tuition and required fees:**

*   **For in-state students, an increase of 3.8%, or $452, in tuition and all required fees to $12,458. For out-of-state students, tuition and required fees are recommended to rise by 4.8%, or $1,826, to $39,844.**
*   **Implementation of the final phase of a three-year differential tuition plan at McIntire. Third- and fourth-year students in the McIntire School of Commerce will pay a $5,000 tuition differential, an increase from the $4,000 differential in place this year.**
*   **Reflecting the resource-intensive nature of engineering education, tuition for Engineering students (including PRODUCED in Virginia) will be $2,000 per year more than the base undergraduate tuition rate, beginning with the class entering in fall 2013. This tuition differential will be phased in over four years with each new entering class until all SEAS undergraduate students pay the same rate. In 2013-2014, first-year Virginians in the SEAS pay $14,458 in tuition and fees, a 20.4% increase over the amount paid in the current year. First-year non-Virginians in the SEAS pay $41,844 in 2013-2014 tuition and fees, a 10.1% increase over the amount paid in the current year. The SEAS will receive the additional revenue generated by the tuition differential, less a discount for AccessUVa and a 15% tax. The existing undergraduate Engineering course fee of $32 per credit hour for Virginian and non-Virginian students will be phased out over four years.**
*   **Increase of 2.7% for Auxiliary Fees.**

**Ms. Sheehy said as part of graduate restructuring and in order to take advantage of new incentives coming from the New Internal Financial Model (NIFM), the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (GSAS) proposes a new tuition structure for its graduate students. The proposed structure is neutral to the student’s mix of research/ coursework, is simpler to understand, better reflects the economics of master’s degree programs, optimizes tuition recovery from grants, and is more in line with tuition rates at peer institutions.**

**GSAS proposes to charge a flat tuition rate for all doctoral students in years one through three regardless of the students’ mix of class credits and/or research hours. The proposal includes 2013-2014 tuition and fees for Virginian students of $16,260, a 3.8% increase over the amount paid by Virginian full-time graduate students in the current year. The proposal includes 2013-2014 tuition and fees for non-Virginian students of $26,266, a 2.3% increase over the amount paid by non-Virginian full-time graduate students in the current year.**

**This proposal reflects a lower flat tuition rate for GSAS PhD students in years four to completion. The proposal includes 2013-2014 tuition and fees for Virginian students of $6,748, a 74.3% increase over the amount paid by Virginian full-time, research-only graduate students in the current year. The proposal includes 2013-2014 tuition and fees for non-Virginian students of $7,430, a 91.9% increase over the amount paid by non-Virginian full-time, research-only graduate students in the current year.**

**The proposed GSAS flat tuition rates also will be charged to PhD in Architecture and PhD in Nursing students. Any additional revenue generated by the new GSAS PhD tuition structure will be used to augment financial aid packages to students.**

**As proposed, GSAS students enrolled in a professional master’s degree or graduate certificate program, as well as master’s degree students in the Public Health Sciences Department, would pay a unique tuition rate. Total tuition and fees for Virginian and non-Virginian students are $16,722 and $26,740, respectively.**

**Ms. Sheehy said to reflect rates that are competitive with similar programs, the tuition and fees assessed to students enrolled in the Batten School’s Master of Public Policy programs will be set at $17,669 for Virginians (4.6% increase) and $31,258 for non-Virginians (10.9% increase). The increased tuition revenues will enable the School to fund the faculty and staff positions required to support the School's projected growth to 330 students by 2017.**

**The proposal includes a two-year tuition plan to reach the cost of delivering the Clinical Nurse Leader (CNL) program in the School of Nursing. New national standards for pre-licensure programs that prepare nurses at the master’s level require higher-level classroom and clinical instruction to meet the complex health demands of patients, families, communities, and systems. The new tuition rates will be phased in, applying to first-year students in 2013-14 and to all students in subsequent years. Proposed 2013-14 tuition and fees are $18,382 for Virginian students (17.4% increase) and $30,254 for non-Virginian students (17.9% increase). A per credit hour rate of $570 for in-state students and $970 for out-of-state students will be charged for approved part-time loads. These per credit hour rates would be charged for all terms (i.e., fall, spring, summer, and January term). As a result, students in the CNL program will pay higher rates in summer session and January term than the normal summer and January term graduate rates. The existing Nursing laboratory fee of $60 per credit hour will not apply to incoming CNL program students. Under the School’s proposal, CNL program tuition rates for 2014-15 will be $19,140 for in-state students ($680 per credit hour) and $32,560 ($1,160 per credit hour) for out-of-state students.**

**Tuition rates for other graduate students will increase by 1.8%-3.0% depending on residency and composition of class credits and research.**

**Ms. Sheehy said the proposed increase recommendation for tuition and required fees for the McIntire Master of Science in Accounting is $600 or 2.1% for Virginians and $720 or 2.1% for non-Virginians. The proposed rates include a new program fee of $1,000 that covers books, materials, software licenses, and other program costs that were previously included in tuition. With the implementation of the new program fee, tuition will decrease for both IS and OOS students.**

**For the McIntire Master of Science in Commerce, the proposal includes an increase in tuition and required fees of $600 or 1.5% for Virginians and $660 or 1.5% for non-Virginians. The M.S. Commerce proposed rates include a $7,985 International Study Fee, which has increased by $235 or 3.0% over the current year. This proposal includes an increase of $1,215 or 3.0% in 2013-2014 tuition and fees for the McIntire Master of Science in Management of Information Technology (MIT). The M.S. MIT proposed rates include a program fee of $9,548 for residents and $9,430 for non-Virginians that covers books, materials, software licenses, group meals, and lodging.**

**For the Darden School full-time M.B.A. students, the proposed tuition and fee increase is $2,000. This represents a 4.1% increase for Virginians and a 3.7% increase for non-Virginians. The proposal maintains a $5,000 differential between Virginian and non-Virginian tuition and required fees and will keep the Darden School rates comparable to peer institutions. Incremental revenue generated will be used to fund investments in faculty and staff compensation, curriculum enhancement, and other essential program costs.**

**Tuition and fees for entering students in the Darden School M.B.A. for Executives (MBAE) program are proposed to increase by $2,500 or 4.0%. Tuition and fees for entering students in the Darden School Global M.B.A. for Executives (GMBAE) program are proposed to increase by $2,500 or 3.7%.**

**Darden’s 2012-2013 tuition and fees ($53,900) are $1,038 below the tuition and fee average of its peer institutions.**

**Ms. Sheehy said the proposed increase in tuition and fees for J.D. and L.L.M. Law School students is $1,500, representing a 3.2% increase for in-state students and a 2.9% increase for out-of-state students. The proposal maintains a $5,000 differential between in-state and out-of-state tuition and fees and still positions the Law School at the low end of comparable rates charged by peer institutions. As the Law School increases in-state tuition, it will increase its commitment to scholarships and loan forgiveness at a percentage rate at least equal to the annual increase in tuition and required fees. Incremental revenue generated will be used to fund increases in financial aid, utilities and facility maintenance, faculty and staff compensation, and electronic library resources.**

**The proposed Virginia Medical School increase reflects a $1,608 increase (3.7%) in tuition and fees for Virginia students and a $1,966 increase (3.7%) in tuition and fees for non-Virginian Medical School students. The Medical School has completed its phased approach to tuition increases, resulting in all students paying the same tuition rate in 2013-2014.**

**Ms. Sheehy stated the proposal also includes a new Clinical Performance Education Center fee of $1,400 for Medical students in year one, $1,000 for students in year two, $750 for students in year three, and $500 for students in year four. This fee will cover the rising operating and capital equipment costs of the School’s Clinical Performance Education Center (comprised of the Medical Simulation Center and the Clinical Skills Center) that result from the increase in simulation and standardized patient activities required by new standards from the medical education accrediting body.**

**On motion, the following resolutions were approved. Mr. Martin, Mr. Atkinson, Mr. Caputo, Mr. Craig, Mr. Diamonstein, Ms. DiNardo, Mr. Gilliam, Ms. Harker, Ms. Kilberg, Dr. Long, Mr. Mastracco, Mr. Nau, Mr. Robertson, and Mr. Rose voted in favor, and Ms. Dragas and Dr. Miller voted against the first resolution entitled Approval of Tuition, Required Fees, and Other Charges for the Academic Division for Fiscal Year 2013-2014.**

**Action Item: Tuition and Required Fees: University of Virginia’s College at Wise 2013-2014**

**Ms. Henry recommended to the Board a $402 (5.0%) increase in tuition and mandatory fees to $8,509 for Virginians. She also recommended a $1,090 (4.8%) increase in tuition and mandatory fees to $23,565 for non-Virginians. She stated the proposed 5% increase in the auxiliary fee comes from increasing operation and maintenance costs of existing and new facilities and funding debt service.**

**On motion, the following resolution was approved:**

**APPROVAL OF TUITION, REQUIRED FEES AND OTHER CHARGES FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA’S COLLEGE AT WISE FOR FISCAL YEAR 2013-2014**

**RESOLVED, the tuition and required fees and other charges applicable to The University of Virginia’s College at Wise are approved as shown below, effective July 1, 2013:**

**RESOLVED FURTHER, the Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer is authorized to approve reduced tuition rates for residents of Kentucky and Tennessee who live in counties that are within a 50-mile radius of The University of Virginia’s College at Wise and who are enrolled at the College in accordance with Section 23-7.4:2.F. of the Code of Virginia.**

**Consent Agenda: Faculty, Staff, and Student Housing Rates, 2013-14, University of Virginia and University of Virginia’s College at Wise**

**Mr. Hogan introduced Mr. Richard A. Kovatch, Associate Vice President for Business Operations, who reported on faculty and staff housing rates, student housing rates, and dining rates for 2013-2014.**

**Mr. Kovatch said State policy requires that rents charged by the University for faculty and staff housing reflect the market rate for similarly sized and equipped properties. The proposed resolution calls for the faculty and staff housing rates to become effective July 1, 2013. The resolution would also allow the Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer or his designee to approve increases to the rates (if they are lower than the market level) when a property is vacated.**

**For the Academic Year rates, an increase would provide funds to cover rising operating costs including increases in salaries & fringe benefits and a 4.2% increase in other operating costs that include utilities, maintenance, and other operating costs. Debt expense will increase along with contributions to the R&R and expansion reserves. The reserves will be used to fund the ongoing program to enhance the residence halls including the renovation of McCormick Road, Lambeth, Gooch-Dillard, and Copeley facilities.**

**For the Summer Session rate, the University’s summer 2014 total cost for Session III (which is the shortest at 25 days in length) at $24 per day is $600. There is no increase from the summer 2013 rate.**

**On motion, the following resolutions were approved:**

**APPROVAL OF PROPOSED INCREASE IN FACULTY AND STAFF HOUSING RATES**

**FOR 2013-2014**

**RESOLVED, the faculty and staff housing rates are approved as indicated, effective July 1, 2013. The Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, or his designee, is authorized to increase the rates to market level when a property is vacated during the year.**

**Consent Agenda: Contract Rates for Dining Services, 2013-2014**

**Mr. Kovatch said the University currently has 8,250 students on meal plans. A new meal plan structure is proposed that will offer increased flexibility and value by providing unlimited access either seven or five days a week. All plans will offer increased Plus Dollar amounts and a meal equivalency feature for use in the retail locations. The meal plans range from 50 meals per semester to an unlimited number of meals.**

**Mr. Kovatch stated the increase in meal plan rates is necessary to cover projected increases in food (3%), personal services (2% increase + fringe benefits, 2% additional staffing for Fresh Food Company and 4.5% projected cost of mandated benefit coverage Jan-14), and additional operating costs including amortization of the capital investment of the Newcomb Hall Dining facility expansion and renovation. The summer session meal plan rates are not proposed to increase for summer 2013.**

**The University of Virginia’s College at Wise proposed a new meal plan structure that offers the increased flexibility of block plans with Dining Dollars. Residential meal plans are proposed to increase for 2013-14 by an average of 4.1% and commuter meal plans by an average of 5.0%. This increase is necessary to support increases in food and operating costs. The College at Wise does not offer a summer session meal plan.**

**Mr. Kovatch also stated that the Mountain Lake Biological Station 2014 daily rates are not proposed to increase.**

**On motion, the following resolutions were approved by the Board of Visitors.**

**Action Item: Multi-Year Capital Plan Update (2014-2024)**

**Ms. Sheehy stated that an update to the Multi-Year Capital Plan is required by the State every two years.**

**Under the current approved capital plan, the Academic Division has: 11 projects under construction ($237 million), four projects in planning ($65 million), and 40 projects not yet initiated ($1,284 million) for a total program cost of $1,586 million. The Medical Center has nine projects under construction ($325 million), four projects in planning ($141 million), and four projects not yet initiated ($19 million) for a total program cost of $485 million. The College at Wise has two projects under construction ($15.6 million), two projects in planning ($40.2 million), and eight projects not yet initiated ($71.0 million) for a total program cost of $126.7 million.**

**Ms. Sheehy reviewed the changes to the Capital Program. There were several near term academic projects added. They were:**

*   *   **Contemplative Sciences - a gift funded project with an estimated project cost of $13.68 million and incremental operating and maintenance costs (O&M) of $393,000.**
    *   **Facilities Management Shop Support/Office Building constructs a 14,000 gsf facility, replacing 11,635 gsf of both trailer and leased space. The incremental O&M cost is $75,800.**
    *   **Acquisition of 560 Ray C. Hunt Drive, a 70,500 gsf building in the Fontaine Research Park to expand translational research space to be gift funded (Ivy Foundation). The incremental O&M cost is estimated at $1.3 million.**
    *   **Jeffersonian Grounds Initiative project is proposed to address the infrastructure needs of the Academical Village over the course of the next ten year. Planned fundraising also includes a $50 million endowment to address the ongoing operational and maintenance needs.**
        *   **The North Grounds Mechanical Plant is reflected with a revised financial plan. This project’s total cost of $13,110,000 remains as approved in April 2011, with a revised financial plan removing state funding of $9,177,000 due to the lack of state support. The state funds will be replaced with: $2 million of increased funding from utility E&G reserves to total $6 million and increased debt financing of $7.11 million to be financed through the utility infrastructure funds (supported by utility rates).**

**Two long-term academic projects were added. The Physics Building Renewal and the New South Lawn Academic Building Phase II. Ms. Sheehy emphasized that any long-term projects would come back to the Finance Committee for a full financial review, before bein accelerated to an earlier biennium.**

**On the Medical Center side, there were four near-term projects were added: Education Resource Center (approved at the February 2013 meeting), the 7th and 8th floor renovations to the University Hospital, the Emergency Department/Operating Room project, and the utility infrastructure required in support of the Emergency Department project. There were no long-term projects added to the plan for the Medical Center.**

**Ms. Sheehy spoke about one long-term Wise project that was added to the plan: the football building, which is being privately funded, will house offices for football coaching staff, conference rooms, and storage areas for equipment.**

**The Rector asked that the Facilities Management Office Space item be removed from the Capital Plan. The Board approved this amendment to the Capital Plan, and approved the following resolution unanimously. The amended Capital Plan is attached as Appendix A.**

**APPROVAL OF UPDATE OF MAJOR CAPITAL PROJECTS PROGRAM AND**

**APPROVAL OF FINANCIAL PLANS FOR NEW CAPITAL PROJECTS TO BEGIN BY**
