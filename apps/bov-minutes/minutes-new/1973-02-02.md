STATEMENT BY PRESIDENT EDGAR F. SHANNON, JR.
--------------------------------------------

The first order of business was to hear a statement from President Edgar F. Shannon, Jr. who read aloud the following letter addressed to the Rector:

Mr. Joseph H. McConnell

Rector of the University

University of Virginia

Charlottesville, Virginia

Dear Mr. Rector:

This letter is intended for all of the members of the Board of Visitors of the University, but I address it to you as their chairman.

At the conclusion of the Summer Session in August, 1974, approximately eighteen months hence, I shall have completed fifteen years as President of the University of Virginia. That seems to me to be an appropriate term of service in this capacity, and indeed in the current experience of American universities it is an extended one. I write accordingly to request you to plan for me to be relieved of my duties as President at the end of August 1974.

As you know from your reading of my recent Report, I believe the state of the University to be thriving and vigorous to an unprecedented degree. The quality of the Faculty and student body is notably enhanced, and it is a daily pleasure to be associated with them as individuals. The University of Virginia has advanced conspicuously as a national center of excellence in graduate and graduate professional studies. Its academic publishing house, established just ten years ago, and numerous scholarly and scientific activities of national significance are flourishing. New buildings and facilities for arts and sciences and the professional schools have recently been completed or are now under construction. Racial integration and full coeducation are firmly established in policy and practice. The Committee on the Future of the University has completed a major study of the size and other aspects of the years immediately ahead, and the Board of Visitors has acted to establish enrollment projections and the role of the University for the remainder of the decade. By the summer of 1974 the self-study under the provisions of the Southern Association will have been completed and the incoming President will have the immediate benefit of its recommendations and those of the visiting committee.

Although some stringency may be anticipated, the University is fiscally sound and in a stronger financial position than many of its leading academic competitors for educational excellence. The General Assembly have demonstrated the pride that they properly take in the University of Virginia, and I have confidence in the provisions that they will make for the future. I shall be responsible for the next biennial budget and see it through the 1974 legislature -- working with a new governor, so that the next President can commence his duties in the first year of the biennium, with a year in which to become familiar with his duties before he has to submit a biennial budget, and a year-and-a-half before he has to appear before the committees of a biennial legislature and secure the regular University appropriation.

During the past fourteen years in an office which makes heavy and continuous demands, I have been fortunate to experience good health. It appears to me wise to relinquish the office to another while I am still in full force of physical vigor, and with unimpaired enthusiasm, and strength of mind and spirit, and to time my relinquishment of office, so that there will be no loss of momentum in the forward progress of the University.

The University has been blessed throughout my years of service with a strong and dedicated Board of Visitors, whose guidance and support have been indispensable to me in everything I have tried to do, and whose personal friendship and association I shall always cherish.

I shall ever be grateful for the opportunity and privilege of having served you and the University of Virginia. I wish to pass on my duties to another while I am still enjoying them as I do. My family are growing up. I wish to become better acquainted with them, and they need more of my daily attention than they have before. And finally at the end of fifteen exciting and gratifying years in one capacity I wish to return to another -- to my first love of teaching and scholarship -- which is a continuing tradition and practice among administrative officers of this university and one which I think is an element of its great strength.

The greatest strength of this University from the time when Jefferson, Madison, and Monroe served together as Visitors has been the stature of its Board members. The continuing high character of the Board and my affection and respect for its individual members give me complete confidence in the future of the University under my successor. You have all been generous in your many kindnesses to me and my family, and I shall greatly miss the regular association with you when my responsibilities as President are terminated at the beginning of the 1974-75 academic year.

STATEMENT BY RECTOR JOSEPH H. MCCONNELL
---------------------------------------

The Rector responded to the President's letter by reading to the Board a statement addressed to President Shannon by the Rector, as follows:

Perhaps we should pause a moment or two to reflect on the seriousness of Dr. Shannon's announcement, but I think it is quite clear to the Board -- as it is to me -- that we are confronted today with a great loss, as well as a great responsibility.

Dr. Shannon, I am sure, has read the surprise -- and the disappointment -- in our faces. On a decision of this magnitude, such a mixture of surprise and sadness was inevitable. It causes one to grope for words.

But I know, Edgar, that I speak for the Board and for the University community at large -- a community you have helped stretch to the limits of the Commonwealth -- when I say how grateful we are for the good and faithful service you have given us.

The University can be proud of you -- as we are proud of you. You have demonstrated to this Board your complete dedication to the University. It always came first -- in the good days and when it rained, as it does today, not only outside but in this room.

On behalf of the Board I want to express our deep gratitude. You have helped carry out the purpose of our founder, Thomas Jefferson, for this institution in a way that all who know us can take pride.

We have indeed become, under your guidance, a national university, not just in law or medicine, but in the full range of the liberal arts. You helped attract a faculty of the highest quality while developing a program and plant to challenge and inspire those who teach and those who learn.

You have put new and important emphasis on the University's role of service to the State, extending the influence of this institution into new areas of great but neglected need.

You have gained recognition in the councils of higher affairs of this nation in a manner that has not only brought honor to you but glory to the University.

And by the timing of your announcement today -- well in advance of the departure we regret so deeply -- you have demonstrated again the qualities of a man Virginia is proud to have as the president of its university.

The standards you have set will not make it easy for this Board in finding a successor. It will be a challenge -- but we will do our utmost to meet it. As prescribed by the Manual of the Board, I will appoint a committee at the appropriate time to work with the faculty in nominating a successor. We ask your counsel, Dr. Shannon, throughout.

Fifteen years ... it sounds so long, yet it seems so short in terms of your presidency. I am sure that this is because of the inspiration and excitement you brought to the task and which you carry to the job each day. When the days are full and life is lively, time passes quickly. So it has been here.

We will miss you. I know that I can say for all of us that we are deeply grateful for the privilege of working with you and seeing the University grow and prosper.

In the days that you will still be with us -- and in those quieter days beyond -- we wish for you and your family great happiness and the knowledge that this University will always remember you with a fond and grateful heart.

At the conclusion of the reading of the Rector's letter, the Board rose and applauded the President, following which each member shook the President's hand.

WELCOME TO SECRETARY EARL J. SHIFLET
------------------------------------

The Rector then extended a warm welcome to Secretary of Education Earl J. Shiflet, who was the guest of the Board at the meeting.

Secretary Shiflet spoke briefly to the Board. He commended President Edgar F. Shannon, Jr. for his statesmanlike actions as President, and expressed regret to learn of Mr. Shannon's approaching retirement.

Secretary Shiflet also commended the Board of Visitors for outstanding service to the Commonwealth and expressed to the Board the thanks of the Governor. He expressed particular pleasure in the high level of cooperation between the University and Piedmont Virginia Community College, and was pleased to witness the presentation of a framed resolution of thanks from the Community College Board to the University of Virginia.

Mr. Shiflet compared his own position to that of the director of a symphony orchestra, noting that he strives to see the educational institutions in the State to be in harmony with each other and with the needs of the citizens of the Commonwealth.

Mr. Shiflet distributed a leaflet describing the financial profile of education in Virginia. He explained that there will be an audit of productivity in education, and that his office will attempt to define the mission of higher education in Virginia.

DENIAL OF FUNDS TO THE GAY STUDENT UNION
----------------------------------------

Mr. W. Wright Harrison, Chairman of the Student Affairs and Athletics Committee, outlined the history of an appeal of an allocation of $45 to the Gay Student Union. The allocation was initially made by the Student Council by a divided vote. The allocation was upheld by the Student Activities Committee by a divided vote. The appeal was then carried to the President and the Board of Visitors.

The Student Affairs and Athletics Committee of the Board of Visitors heard the appeal on behalf of The Rector and Visitors. In compliance with agreements reached at the hearing which was held on January 17, 1973, only those members of the Student Affairs and Athletics Committee who were present at the hearing participated in the preparation of the Committee's report.

Reports from the President and the Committee were distributed to the Visitors. (Copies of these reports form attachments 1 and 2 to these Minutes). Mr. Neill H. Alford, Jr. summarized the reasoning of the Committee report for the Board. During the entire meeting, copies of the transcript of the hearing conducted by the Student Affairs and Athletics Committee were before the Board.

Following the distribution of the reports the meeting was recessed for a sufficient time for all members to read the reports. After the reading of the reports, Board members addressed various questions to the Legal Adviser.

The Rector and Visitors, having received the report of its Student Affairs and Athletics Committee which heard for the Board on 17 January 1973 an appeal from a decision of the Student Activities Committee of the University approving an allocation of $45.00 from the Student Activity Fund to the Gay Student Union, and having received a report of the President who heard the same matter on the same date reconvened and unanimously adopted the following resolution: RESOLVED by The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the request for an allocation of $45.00 by the Gay Student Union is denied for the following reasons:1. The GSU cultivates and advocates a style of sexual life. This is a private and personal matter which has no reasonable relationship to the educational purposes of the University. The Board has no power to authorize a disbursement of funds for a purpose unrelated to the educational purposes of the University. The Board also has no power to authorize the disbursement of public funds for a private and personal purpose. The activity funds are held by the Board subject to an express trust implied from the facts. This trust arises because of the mandatory nature of the fee, the educational context in which the fee is collected, the special purpose for which the fee is collected and the reasonable expectation of students who are required to pay the fee. This trust requires that the funds be used for a purpose beneficial to the University and to support organizations to which all students have de facto access. Heterosexuals have no de facto access to the GSU and its social events. The activities of the Union are not sufficiently beneficial to the University.2. The allocation is not in accordance with the guidelines prescribed by the Board in 1970. The words "social entertainment" as used in the guidelines must be interpreted in context. When interpreted in context, the words are read to exclude an organization such as GSU whose activities are substantially social as well as to exclude payment for social events of an incidental nature by organizations whose activities are not substantially social. This has been the settled policy of the Board and must necessarily be its policy because of restrictions upon its powers to disburse the funds.The Constitution of GSU and its statement of purposes are sufficiently broad to include engaging in propaganda and political activity to change legislation. No funds should be granted to an organization with a constitution and statement of purpose of this scope unless:a. The constitution expressly limits the organization to one of the exempt purposes stated in IRC § 501(c)(3) andb. The constitution specifically excludes as purposes of the organization engagement in propaganda and efforts to influence legislation.An exception should be made for "public interest" organizations so far as efforts to influence legislation are concerned and to its development or dissemination of information based on nonpartisan analysis, study or research.3. An organization with a constitution sufficiently restricted that it would not reasonably embrace propaganda and efforts to influence legislation need not include the special restrictions set forth prior to an allocation of funds.4. The practice of designating special uses of funds allocated to organizations may involve an unconstitutional interference with the freedom of speech or of assembly of members of the organization and should cease.5. The Student Activities Committee is directed at its earliest convenience to reexamine allocations of funds during the 1972-73 session and hereafter in accordance with the decision of the Board in this case and to halt allocations to all organizations not meeting the requirements of the 1970 guidelines as here interpreted.6. The Rector and Visitors adopts the Report of its Student Affairs and Athletics Committee as a detailed statement of the reasoning supporting this Resolution.Mr. Santarelli expressed the gratitude of the Board to Mr. Neill Alford, Jr., the Legal Adviser, for his careful work on the matter.

REPORT BY THE RECTOR
--------------------

The Rector reported that the President and the Rector have agreed to have an informal meeting every four to six weeks so that the President may bring matters of concern to the attention of the Rector.

The Rector announced that he would appoint a committee of the Board for the selection of the President in the near future.

REPORTS BY STANDING COMMITTEES
------------------------------

Mr. Lawrence Lewis, acting for Chairman W. Wright Harrison, advised the Board that the work of the Student Affairs and Athletics Committee was very heavy, and that it has been necessary for the Committee to meet on special occasions with some frequency. He urged that serious consideration be given to forming two committees - one to deal with student affairs, and one for athletics.

Mr. Lewis reported that the Student Council representatives who met with the Committee brought an expert witness on traffic matters to the meeting. He voiced his opposition to inviting witnesses to the Committee meetings, since the President and Vice-President of Student Council have been designated to bring student concerns to the Committee.

Mr. Lewis reported that the Student Affairs and Athletics Committee had a meeting on January 3, 1973 with the Board of the Virginia Student Aid Foundation, and that the President made an excellent statement at the meeting indicating the President's support of athletic programs.

The Acting Chairman recognized Vice-President D. Alan Williams, who reported on recent NCAA actions, particularly legislation restricting the number of athletic grants-in-aid which an institution may award.

Mr. Lawrence Lewis, Chairman of the Buildings and Grounds Committee, reported that the University has learned from the Highway Department that the Board will be approached at a future date about land from the Blandy Experimental Farm for the widening of Route 50.

Mr. William Zimmer, acting for Chairman William S. Potter, advised that the Finance Committee had approved a loan for the purchase of buses for the University's transit system.

Mr. C. Waller Barrett, Chairman of the Educational Policy Committee, reported on the need for library construction. He urged that $100,000 from private sources be raised so that planning may begin at once, then we must seek $4.5 million for construction, possibly in two phases. In addition, he urged raising funds from private sources for a rare book library. The necessity for remodeling of Clark Hall was also discussed. The Rector expressed the gratitude of the Board to Mr. Barrett for his sustained effort to bring the University's libraries to a high level of excellence.

Dr. Hartwell Harrison, Chairman of the Health Sciences Committee, reported that planning for the Medical Library is going forward. He advised that further study of the proposal to purchase the Towers Hospital structure will be required. He advised the Board that medical programs at the University will be adversely affected by the federal budget cuts.
