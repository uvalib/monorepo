The College is a publicly supported baccalaureate-granting institution providing undergraduate education based in the liberal arts tradition. In the heritage of Thomas Jefferson, the primary concern is education in the liberal arts and sciences, the ultimate goal being to prepare students to be full participants in a democratic society and the world at large. The College's mission is to prepare students for lifelong learning, professional careers in fields such as business, teaching and healthcare, and graduate study by fostering development of the ideas, insights, values, competencies, and behavior of liberally educated persons.Set in the natural beauty of the central Appalachian Mountains, Clinch Valley College offers a pleasant learning environment centered on students. Most classes are small which allows faculty to give individual attention to students and to challenge them to reach for academic excellence. The College continues to build a diverse, talented, well-qualified faculty whose primary role is excellent undergraduate teaching. Creative and scholarly activities of faculty and students are also an important part of our mission because they renew teaching and learning at the highest levels.While preserving its original mission to serve the people of Southwest Virginia, the College also enrolls an increasing number of students from across the Commonwealth. Clinch Valley College serves a diverse population that includes traditional residential students, students who commute from around the region, and nontraditional students seeking lifelong learning opportunities or preparation for career changes. To better serve the citizens of Southwest Virginia and the Commonwealth, the College offers an Adult Studies and Continuing Education program and is a partner in the developing Southwest Virginia Higher Education Center in Abingdon.In its recruitment and retention of members of the College community, Clinch Valley College, consistent with its academic and institutional heritage, maintains an openness to all qualified persons.
