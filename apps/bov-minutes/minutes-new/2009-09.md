Resolution for Additions to the Agenda

On motion, the Board adopted the following resolution approving the consideration of addenda to the published Agenda of the meeting:

RESOLVED, the consideration of addenda to the published Agenda of this meeting of the Board of Visitors is approved.

APPROVAL OF REVISIONS TO THE MILLER CENTER GOVERNING COUNCIL BYLAWS

The Governing Council of the Miller Center of Public Affairs voted unanimously at its April 2009 meeting to amend its Bylaws. Amendments must be approved by the Board of Visitors. Most of the proposed revisions clarify or conform the Bylaws to customary practice. Several revisions are new additions, including a conflict of interest provision. The addition of the office of Vice Chair is proposed, as well as prospective term limits for service on the Governing Council, applicable to members elected at its next meeting or subsequent to its next meeting.

A standing nominating committee is also proposed to formalize the nominating process. As set forth in the current Bylaws, pursuant to agreements between the University and the founding donor Burkett Miller, the Board of Visitors, under the revised Governing Council Bylaws, would continue to elect members of the Governing Council on nomination by the Council.

Revising and updating the Bylaws to reflect current practice in corporate governance will be beneficial in attracting new members to the Governing Council, as the Miller Center continues to build its national reputation.

The following resolution was adopted:

WHEREAS, the Miller Center of Public Affairs of the University and its Governing Council has certain rights and responsibilities concerning the Center; and

WHEREAS, since the Center’s founding in 1975, its Governing Council has operated under Bylaws approved by the Board of Visitors, which have been amended from time to time; and

WHEREAS, the Center’s Governing Council at its April 17, 2009 meeting, approved by unanimous vote among those present certain clarifying and procedural amendments to its Bylaws; and

WHEREAS, by the terms of the Bylaws of the Center’s Governing Council (Article XII, Section 2), the Board of Visitors must approve any amendments to the Bylaws;

RESOLVED, the amendments to the Bylaws of the Governing Council of the Miller Center of Public Affairs, shown below, are approved.

NCAA Orientation

Mr. Abramson introduced Mr. Steve Flippen, Director of Compliance, who explained that Board members are considered “boosters”; they must be very careful to avoid any recruiting activity of student athletes or potential athletes, and they must be aware that any extra benefit provided to a potential student athlete, a former student athlete, or a current student athlete, could constitute an NCAA rules violation. If a Board member finds him or herself in a situation that could be considered recruiting or providing an extra benefit, the Board member should contact the Compliance office before taking any action.

President’s Report

The President remarked on several matters prior to presenting the Gifts and Grants report.

President Casteen said that AccessUVA’s numbers have increased dramatically this year. This year, almost one-third of the first year class has at least some AccessUVA support. He referred to slides with statistics about the increase. The total cost of AccessUVA from all sources has increased from $39 million in Fall 2004 to an estimated $75 million for Fall 2009. The amount funded by endowment, unrestricted funds, and state grants is now over $40 million. He said that funding Access UVA should be a priority for everyone at the University.

The President provided statistics from the AAU Data Exchange on the University’s standing among AAU institutions when salaries are adjusted to take into account the cost of living in a region. When adjusted for cost of living, the University moves from 26th among U.S. AAU institutions to 15th among the same group.

The President reviewed the latest report on federal stimulus funds. The University has submitted funding proposals totaling $293 million, and to date the University is in line to receive $30.8 million in stimulus grant funds over a two-year period.

Gifts and Grants Report

The President reported on the current fiscal year through July 31, 2009. Philanthropic giving to the University and its related foundations is $13,473,214.41 for the fiscal year. This is an increase of $3,867,210.81, or 40.26% above the results of the previous fiscal year. This year’s early increase is largely a result of significant gifts to the School of Medicine and the Medical Center.

The significant gifts received since the last meeting of the Board include the following:

*   The Foundation for the National Institutes of Health private grant of $6,467,836 to the Internal Medicine Department in the School of Medicine for its Global Network for Malnutrition and Enteric Disease Research.
*   Mr. Richard L. Sharp and Mrs. Sherry Sharp, through The Community Foundation of Richmond and Central Virginia, gift of $1,000,000 to the School of Medicine for the Emily Couric Clinical Cancer Center - 5th Floor.
*   Lumina Foundation for Education pledge payment of $750,000 to the Miller Center Foundation for its National Discussion and Debate Series.
*   American Cancer Society private grant of $720,000 for the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics for its study of “Centromere Structure and Assembly.”
*   Mr. John L. Nau pledge payment of $320,628 to the College and Graduate School of Arts & Sciences for the South Lawn Project.

Significant pledges since the last meeting include the following:

*   John W. Kluge Foundation pledges of $1,000,000 and $2,000,000 to the Schools of Medicine and Nursing, respectively, for the Tussi and John Kluge Professorship in Palliative Care and the Tussi and John Kluge Professorship in Contemplative End-of-Life Care.
*   Food Lion, Inc., pledge of $1,000,000 to the University of Virginia Children’s Hospital Building Fund.
*   Mr. Paul Tudor Jones and Mrs. Sonia Klein Jones $500,000 pledge for the Klockner Baseball Stadium – Phase Two.

The President recommended that the Board accept the Gifts and Grants report. On motion, the Board approved the Gifts and Grants Report.

The Rector recessed the full Board meeting at 1:50 p.m. to begin the afternoon committee meetings.

The Board opened a new exhibit on the Academical Village, and toured the exhibit with Richard Guy Wilson, Professor of Architectural History. The exhibit is part of the celebration of the 100th anniversary of Carr’s Hill.

WHEREAS, the proposed 2010-2012 biennial budget requests have been reviewed carefully; and

WHEREAS, the proposed biennial budget requests represent the highest priority initiatives and are aligned with the mission of the institution;

RESOLVED, the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia approves the 2010-2012 biennial budget requests as outlined in an attachment to this document; and

RESOLVED FURTHER, the Board of Visitors understands that to the extent these initiatives are not included in the Governor’s 2010-2012 biennial budget, the Academic Division may want to pursue similar requests to the Legislature; and

APPROVAL OF SIGNATORY AUTHORITY FOR MEDICAL CENTER

(approved by the Finance Committee on September 10, 2009)

RESOLVED, the Board of Visitors authorizes the Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of the University to execute a contract for house staff medical benefits, based upon the recommendation of the Vice President and Chief Executive Officer of the Medical Center in accordance with Medical Center procurement policy.

APPROVAL OF THE AUDIT CHARTER

(approved by the Audit and Compliance Committee on September

11, 2009)

RESOLVED, the Audit Charter is approved as recommended by the Audit and Compliance Committee.

APPROVAL OF ENDOWMENT SPENDING DISTRIBUTION FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009-2010

WHEREAS, the University wishes to provide reliable, predictable distributions to support programs; and

WHEREAS, the Board of Visitors wishes to fund institutional priorities, including the recommendations of the Commission on the Future of the University; and

WHEREAS, recent decreases in state support have placed significant strain on University budgets; and

WHEREAS, the endowment spending policy calls for a percentage increase in the annual distribution from the endowment, unless such increase causes the distribution to fall outside a band defined as four percent to six percent of the market value of the Pooled Endowment Fund; and if the distribution falls outside of this range, the Finance Committee may recommend either raising or lowering the rate of increase; and

WHEREAS, applying the spending policy with the usual inflator would result in an annual payout for fiscal year 2009-2010 of 6.6 percent of the market value of the Pooled Endowment Fund, which is outside of the approved band of four percent to six percent;

RESOLVED, the annual endowment distribution for fiscal year 2009-2010 is set at 5.5 percent of the June 30, 2009 market value of the Pooled Endowment Fund.

ATTACHMENT

STATE OPERATING BUDGET REQUEST

FOR THE 2010-2012 BIENNIUM

AGENCY 207 – Academic Division:

_Fund UVa Health Plan Cost Increases ($2.0 million GF in year one and $2.0 million GF in year two)_– The University requests ongoing support to maintain the state’s funding of the University-sponsored health care plan at a comparable level to the state funding provided for other state-sponsored health plans.

_Reimburse Capital Pre-planning Costs at Start of Construction (Language Only)_ - Language was included by the 2009 General Assembly to allow the University to use non-general funds to complete pre-planning for New Cabell Hall and Ruffner Hall, with the advance to be reimbursed from state debt proceeds at the conclusion of the construction project. The amendment will provide for the reimbursement to come as soon as the construction funds are authorized, rather than at the end of the project.

_Reimburse Capital Construction Costs for New Cabell Hall Terrace Connector (Language Only)_ - Language was included by the 2009 General Assembly to authorize the University to use up to $3 million of non-general funds to fund the terrace connector for New Cabell Hall. This $3 million budget item is within the state-funded $80 million project; however, language was not included to allow this advance to be reimbursed from state debt proceeds. The amendment will provide for the reimbursement to come as soon as the construction funds are authorized.

_Graduate Financial Aid Restriction for In-State Students (Language Only)_ – The University requests removal of the existing requirement that 50 percent of general funds allocated to graduate student financial assistance be made to Virginia residents. High-quality graduate students play a vital role in recruiting world class faculty, attracting external grant support, and improving the stature of the University’s research enterprise. One no-cost measure of support for graduate students would be the elimination of this requirement. The University’s highest-quality graduate student applicants are increasingly from out-of-state and require a higher level of financial commitment from the University. Many graduate students remain in the Commonwealth after graduation, even becoming faculty members at our public and private colleges and universities. Out-of-state graduate students frequently bring spouses and families to the region to settle here. Allowing the University to award state support to the highest-quality graduate students, regardless of their residency, will provide the University additional flexibility in building a world-renowned research enterprise.
