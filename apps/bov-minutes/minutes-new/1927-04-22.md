The Board of Visitors desires to place on record its appreciation of the character, the devotion to duty, the unusual attainments in legal scholarship and teaching ability of Professor Graves as exemplified in a continuous service of 54 years in the teaching of law, of which 28 years have been spent at this University. The Board of Visitors desires the privilege of retaining Professor Graves as Emeritus Professor of Law upon the rolls of the University.

RESOLVED, That the Rector and Visitors of the University accept with regret the resignation of Mr. John S. Patton, Librarian.

They appreciate her pioneering services in seeking to define the office and its duties, and wish for her success in any field which she may enter.

Report of the Faculty Committee on educational program for the Blandy Experimental Farm was presented, read and approved, as follows:

After due deliveration and careful study, supplemented by a personal interview with several agricultural experts at V. P. I., the committee on "Blandy Experimental Farm" is of the opinion that the tentative educational program submitted below is practical, and furthermore, that it will (1) comply with the will of the donor, (2) be a service to the people of the State, and (3) will not conflict with the work which is now being done at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute. In light of these facts then, the following recommendations are made:

1\. The appointment of a professor of Agricultural Biology who will also be director of the Blandy Experimental Farm. During the fall and winter terms this man should give courses at the University of Virginia. During the spring and summer months he should reside at the farm and direct the educational work given under the auspices of the school, supervise the investigations conducted by the students and undertake such research work as time and opportunity permit.

II. The establishment of five research fellowships, two carrying an annual stipend of $1,000.00 each, and three with stipends of $500.00 each, all of them including the remission of University fees. These fellowships should be open only to the holders of baccalaureate degrees in agriculture or biology and conferred on the basis of merit. All fellows are to be appointed annually and are eligible for reappointment. The holder of one of these fellowships would be expected to give approximately one hundred hours of his time per year to assisting with imparting information pertaining to agriculture or horticulture to the people of the state, particularly to the people in the immediate vicinity of the farm. Such work would comprise talks, demonstrations, exhibits, compilation of data to be used for the farmer's benefit and other similar things. It should be emphasized, however, that these are primarily research fellowships.

III. Appointment of an advisory council consisting of from five to seven local people, the director and manager of the Blandy Experimental Farm being members ex officio. These people could gather at regular or called meetings and discuss affairs relating to the local usefulness of this unit.

As to the instructional work, it is believed that efforts along this line should be in two directions:

1\. The director and fellows, working in conjunction with state and federal agriculturalists, and in so far as practical, cooperating with the agricultural units at the Boyce and Berryville High School, at Boyce, and the Handley High School at Winchester, shall organize such courses of instruction as are practical and will be beneficial to the people of that vicinity. It appears that the most feasible plan for the present will be to organize several intensive short-courses of about five days duration. From five to six such courses could be given each year. The subjects to be discussed and the time the courses are to be given could be determined by the advisory council. In this way the staff would, for part of their time, actually "teach boys farming in its various branches, ocluding fruit raising".

2\. Fellows, or others desiring to take work in this field, should register in the department of graduate studies, at the University of Virginia, and take courses leading to graduate degrees in agriculture and biology. Courses of particular value in this connection would be: Genetics, Plant Physiology, Forestry, Entomology, Chemistry of Soils, Bacteriology, Economic Geology, Plant Pathology and Morophology, and Biometry. Some of these courses are already provided and most of the others could be arranged for without additional expenditures. The fellows would be expected to confine their class work to the fall and winter terms, moving to the farm in the spring with the director to begin, or to continue, their research, and also to assume their duties in helping to carry out the local education al program. Their work on the frm would continue through the spring and summer months. While there, they could be adequately housed in the ten-room brick building (Exhibit A). The second floor rooms of this building could be used as dormitories, while the rooms on the first floor could be converted into laboratories. No rent is to be charged for the rooms, but but the students will have to pay for their meals. This may be a difficult proposition, but it is believed that satisfactory arrangements can be made.

Aside from the real need of a school in the state where advanced training in agriculture may be obtained, the importance of research and its relation to farming problems cannot be over emphasized. Agriculture is the backbone of stable government and its efficiency has been increased by the application of scientific methods. In this manner insect pests have been combatted, increased yields have been produced and the peoples of the world have been fed with less and less effort. To train men to do efficient research is the best method of dignifying and making profitable agriculture as a basic industry, and would, in this case, supplement and give point to the actual instruction provided for in the previous paragraph.

Estimates for cost of operation according to the plan herein set forth are:

The Professor in charge is to be furnished a house on the farm, rent free (Exhibit B).

Initial outlay in addition to annual expenditures

(NOTE: Exhibit A & B are pictures of the buildings on the property.)

The Bursar asked for instructions from the Board with respect to depositing the funds received for erection of the new medical buildings and stated that the local banks were willing to accept the same with interest thereon at the rate of 4% per annum on certificates of deposit if they are not required to make deposit of either marketable securities or directors' bond as surety for same; or, with interest at 3% per annum and make deposit of either securities or directors' bond as surety. The matter was disposed of in the following motion unanimously adopted:

RESOLVED, That the Bursar is hereby authorized with reference to the funds received for erection of the medical buildings and now on deposit in the Peoples National Bank and the National Bank of Charlottesville to arrange with said banks for the payment of 3% interest on said deposits with the payment of the same secured by deposit with said Bursar of either marketable securities or bonds of the directors to cover the sums so deposited.

The President read a letter from Mr. Fred W. Scott, Chairman of the Finance Committee, in which he stated that he had directed the Administrator of the estate of the late John Alexander Muir, Mr. Gardner L. Boothe, to deliver the cash and securities bequeathed to the University of Virginia, to the State-Planters Bank and Trust Company, of Richmond, to hold same as custodian for the University, but, as the said bank had not been formally designated as a custodian for the University, it was desirable that such action be now taken by the Board, whereupon, the following motion, duly made and seconded, was adopted:

RESOLVED, That at the request of the Chairman of the Finance Committee the Bursar is directed to deposit the funds and securities arising from the estate of John Alexander Muir in the State-Planters Bank and Trust Company, of Richmond, on the usual terms as to security and interest.

The President stated to the Board that he had made arrangements for an Institute of Public Affairs to be held annually at the University sometime during the session of the Summer Quarter and presented the following tentative plan:

After consultation with many leaders in public affairs and friends of the University, it has been decided with their help and the cooperation of others who may become interested in the enterprise, to establish at the University of Virginia, an Institute of Public Affairs to be convened annually for two or more weeks as may hereafter be determined, sometime during the session of the Summer Quarter, probably in August.

The Institute will be organized and conducted in a manner somewhat similar to the one at Williamstown, Massachusetts, but instead of dealing with international relations, will limit its program to a study and discussion of national, state and local governmental problems and to questions of economics and social relations underlying them.

It will be the aim of the institute to secure on its program for study and discussion, the best scholars and research workers available in the fields of Political Science, Economics and Social Relations as well as outstanding men and women in practical politics and public service.

It will, therefore, be conducted on broad and liberal lines and will be national in scope and it is hoped will atract here, in addition to those who are formally on the program, a large number of men and women now interested in public affairs, who will participate in the round table discussions, which will be made a prominent feature of the program.

The first session will be held in August, 1927. In addition to the administration officers of the University, who will have immediate charge, there will be an advisory board of twenty-five or more leaders in public affiars, selected from all sections of the country and from both political parties who will assist in selecting the topics for discussion and the personnel of the program.

Mr. Perkins, Attorney for the University, presented to the Board the situation with reference to the progress being made in the settlement of the estate of Graham F. Blandy, deceased, and explained to the Board that in his opinion it is essential that a chancery suit be instituted in order that certain phases of the will of said Blandy may be judicially construed. In the opinion of Mr. Perkins the most important reason for the institution of such a proceeding is the definite and final determination of the sufficiency of the notice given by the University to said Trustee to conduct the property in Clarke County, devised to the University by said Blandy, as specified under said will.

Unless this question is definitely settled by a Court of competent jurisdiction prior to the final distribution of the residuum of the Estate it will arise before the New York Surrogate of such final distribution.

Furthermore, it is important that the respective rights of Mr. Blandy's widow and of the University be fixed in the roadways which pass over her property and that of the University.

After a discussion of Mr. Perkins' report, it was

RESOLVED, That the Attorney for the University be, and is hereby instructed to file such answer on behalf of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia to the bill which is to filed on behalf of Mrs. Blandy as he may think proper, and that said Attorney is further instructed to protect the interests of the University so far as possible with reference to the determination of rights of way or other easements over or upon the land devised by Graham F. Blandy to the University.

Furthermore, since it is the view of this Board that the work done upon said farm by Mrs. Blandy and by the Estate of Graham F. Blandy, deceased, and materials furnished by them in the operation and maintenance of the farm from March 25th, 1926, the date of Mr. Blandy's death, until August 1st, 1926, the date when the University took possession of the property enures to the benefit of the property devised that it is proper that all amounts expended on this account be Mrs. Blandy and by the Estate should be refunded to them, and a proper allowance made to said Mrs. Blandy for the use of the farm machinery, teams, etc.

The Attorney for the University is therefore instructed to make settlement of this account in an amount not to exceed the sum of $1600.00.

The petition of the Nu Charge House Corporation, and the Chi Holding Corporation for easement on the road leading from Rugby Road to the entrance to the athletic field was referred to the Attorney of the University for opinion as to whether or not the University had power to grant same.

The Rector and Secretary were authorized to unite in a release deed to A. Matacia in the following motion, duly made and seconded.

Whereas the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia hold a deed of trust, of record in the Office of the Clerk of the Corporation Court of the City of Charlottesville, in D. B. 49 p. 474, upon the property of A. Matacia on the South side of Main Street in the City of Charlottesville, Va., fronting 50 ft. and 6 in. thereon, securing 4 bonds bearing date of Jan. 16, 1925 and aggregating $10,000; and whereas the said A. Matacia desires to sell a small triangular strip of said property fronting 10 ft. 3 in. on Main Street and extending back 79 ft. and 3 in. on its west side to a point and 82 ft. 3 in. on its east side to the same point and is desirous of having this deed of trust released as to this small portion; and whereas it has been shown to this Board that the remainder of the property is worth more than double the debt secured

THEREFORE, be it resolved by this Board that its Rector and Secretary be, and they are hereby authorized to unite in a proper deed authorizing the Trustees in said deed of trust to release the same and convey the legal title as to the small portion above described and which the said A. Matacia desires to sell.

The Committee on Buildings and Grounds presented the following report, in the shape of a resolution, with respect to parking of students' automobiles on the grounds of the University which, on motion, duly made and seconded, was adopted:

Be it resolved by the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that motor driven vehicles either owned or operated by students are prohibited from parking in the roadways and alleys of the University Campus between the hourse of 8:30 in the morning and 4:30 in the afternoon.

This resolution shall not be construed in such a manner as to prevent the President of the University from issuing parking permits to students suffering from serious physical disability, or to students who live more than two miles outside the city limits.

Mr. Rinehart, Chairman of the Medical Buildings Committee, reported that bids for the Power House and Dining Room were opened today and the following were found to be the lowest bidders:

Whereupon it was

RESOLVED, That the bids be accepted and the committee be authorized to execute contracts with the above parties.

The Medical Buildings Committee of the Board was increased to a membership of five in the following motion, duly seconded and adopted:

RESOLVED, That the Medical Buildings Committee be increased to five members, and that Messrs, Hulland Williams, appointed to take the places of Messrs. Rinehart and McIntire while absent, be added to the said Committee.

A loan to the Kappa Alpha Fraternity was approved in the following motion, duly made and seconded:

RESOLVED, by the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, That the Finance Committee be and is hereby authorized to make a loan of not exceeding $10,000 from in invested endowment funds to the Kappa Alpha Fraternity as part of the purchase price of the property of the Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity on University Place, said loan to be secured by first lien upon the property, and the fire insurance on the same be made payable to the Rector and Visitors of the University and the Kappa Alpha Fraternity as their interests may appear.

A site on which to erect a chapter house and a loan to assist in erecting same were granted the Alpha Chi Rho fraternity in the following motion, duly seconded and adopted:

RESOLVED, by the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, That Building lot No. 6 located on the Barracks Road, as indicated in report of the Special Committee on sites for Fraternity Houses, made to the Board at its meeting June 14, 1926, be and the same is hereby allocated to the Alpha Chi Rho Fraternity for the purpose of erecting a chapter house, under the usual form of lease in similar cases, and the Rector be and is hereby authorized to execute such lease on behalf of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia.

Resolved, further, That provided the Alpha Chi Rho fraternity erects a chapter house in conformity with plans and specifications, approved by the Superintendent of Buildings and Grounds and the Professor of Art and Architecture, the Finance Committee is requested to arrange for a loan to said fraternity with such terms and conditions of payment as may be satisfactory to the said committee, such loan however, not to exceed one-half of the cost of said chapter house.

The President read to the Board a letter dated April 22nd, 1927, from the Rev. George Floyd Rogers charing Mr. William E. Knight, Associate Professor of Spanish, with having "an ungoverned temper" and having "made false and conflicting statements" in the recent rrial of his son by the Honor Committee of the University, and after discussion, and upon motion duly made and seconded it was

RESOLVED, That a committee of three members of this Board be appointed to investigate said charges and make a report at the next meeting of the Board.

That Mr. Rogers be advised of the appointment of the Committee and be requested to present within ten days to it, a more detailed statement in writing of the specific charges preferred by him against Mr. Knight.

The Rector appointed the following gentlemen to serve on the Committee mentioned above; Messrs. Hall, Buchanan and McIntire.

The Bursar stated to the Board that while the Peoples National Bank of Charlottesville had been duly designated by resolution of the Board as one of the depositories of the University for its endowment funds, no formal contract had ever been executed setting forth the duties and compensation, and that as the said depository was now holding some thirty funds of the University endowments it was desirable that a contract be entered into. He presented the proposed contract which was read and approved, and the following motion, duly seconded, was adopted:

RESOLVED, by the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, That the Rector be and he is hereby authorized to execute on behalf of the Rector and Visitors a contract with the Peoples National Bank of Charlottesville, Va., in the following form for the care of securities belonging to trust funds of the University, collection of the income thereon and reporting same to the Bursar, and the Secretary is authorized to attest the same.

The Bursar reported that he had visited Boston on April 11th for the purpose of receiving the Austin Estate from Messrs. Warren and Garfield, Trustees, and same was received and delivered to the Peoples National Bank, custodian, as directed at the last meeting of the Board. The estate consisted of cash and securities of the value of $439,652.73, as follows:

I beg to advise that, pursuant to instructions given me at the March 1st meeting of the Board, I called on Bentley W. Warren and Irvin McD. Garfield, trustees of the Estate of Arthur W. Austin, on April 11th and received from them the corpus of the estate consisting of the following:

(See journal of Bursar p. 288)

Also a check for $7,157.33 representing the balance of the income in their hands as of April 12th, 1927, the date on which the settlement was completed.

The cash and securities belonging to the corpus of the estate have been deposited with the Peoples National Bank as custodian, in accordance with the directions of the Board, and a complete list of same furnished the Chairman of the Finance Committee. The check representing the accumulated income has been placed to the credit of the income account of the estate on the books of the Bursar.

While in Boston, in compliance with your instruction, I made inquiry of Mr. Warren with respect to the request of Mrs. Mary A. McLaughlin that the University pay off the lien of $18,000 placed upon store and apartment property in order to purchase a residence for herself and husband, which request was reported to you at the March 1st meeting. Mr. Warren stated that while he had no personal or written request from Mrs. McLaughlin regarding the matter, yet, he was satisfied in his own mind that the message as delivered to him by Mr. McLaughlin was the one she has requested be conveyed; that at the time of receipt of the message she was too ill to have written the request - her death coming almost immediately after the request was received by him and transmitted to the University. He further stated that he had a very high regard for the honor and integrity of Mr. McLaughlin and was fully satisfied of its authenticity.

Mr. Warren then had Mr. McLaughlin come to his office where I had a personal interview with him resulting in the following information; he is 59 years of age; Mrs. McLaughlin was in her 67th year; they owned three store rooms with apartments above in West Roxbury, valued at approximately $35,000; they are located in a district of cheap property and are without tenants some portion of the time. The net income from this property is approximately $1,000 per year. A lien was placed on this property for $18,000 to purchase the residence as their home, for which they paid $19,000. The residence is an old one containing 12 rooms in a district where property is difficult to rent, and that it now was now vacant. The property has been for sale since his wife's death but no purchaser has been found. He received about $900 from his wife's estate which would be taken up in paying her bills. Mrs. McLaughlin spent $2,500 per year for 5 years in educating a niece at Wellesley, as well as some $3,000 in educating a nephew.

Mr. McLaughlin is in the lime and cement business with a brother from which business he says he receives from $1,000 to $2,000 per year.

They had been married about 25 years, and Mr. Warren stated that Mr. McLaughlin had been a very devoted husband and a great comfort to his wife. He further stated that he wished it understood that he held no brief for Mr. McLaughlin in this matter, having transmitted the message as requested, but he felt, that if the University could see its way to make some payment to Mr. McLaughlin he thought it would be worthily bestowed.

I discussed with Mr. Warren the question of the propriety of the University's erecting a suitable marker at the grave of the deceased and he was of the opinion that it would be a gracious recognition on the part of the University of the generosity of Mrs. McLaughlin.

The Bursar submitted his report in the matter of the request of Mrs. Mary A. McLaughlin for contribution from the University of $18,000.00 to pay off the mortgage on her property. After some discussion of the matter it was referred to the attorney for the University for his opinion as to the power of the Board to make any such grant.

The President presented the budget of estimated receipts and expenses for 1927-28, which was considered in detail and adopted as follows:

\[Financial Budget follows on Page 222\]

One-half charged to Engineering

\# Other half of salary in Department of Law.

Transferred to Building and Grounds.

After due deliveration and careful study, supplemented by a personal interview with several agricultural experts at V. P. I., the committee on "Blandy Experimental Farm" is of the opinion that the tentative educational program submitted below is practical, and furthermore, that it will (1) comply with the will of the donor, (2) be a service to the people of the State, and (3) will not conflict with the work which is now being done at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute. In light of these facts then, the following recommendations are made:

1\. The appointment of a professor of Agricultural Biology who will also be director of the Blandy Experimental Farm. During the fall and winter terms this man should give courses at the University of Virginia. During the spring and summer months he should reside at the farm and direct the educational work given under the auspices of the school, supervise the investigations conducted by the students and undertake such research work as time and opportunity permit.

II. The establishment of five research fellowships, two carrying an annual stipend of $1,000.00 each, and three with stipends of $500.00 each, all of them including the remission of University fees. These fellowships should be open only to the holders of baccalaureate degrees in agriculture or biology and conferred on the basis of merit. All fellows are to be appointed annually and are eligible for reappointment. The holder of one of these fellowships would be expected to give approximately one hundred hours of his time per year to assisting with imparting information pertaining to agriculture or horticulture to the people of the state, particularly to the people in the immediate vicinity of the farm. Such work would comprise talks, demonstrations, exhibits, compilation of data to be used for the farmer's benefit and other similar things. It should be emphasized, however, that these are primarily research fellowships.

III. Appointment of an advisory council consisting of from five to seven local people, the director and manager of the Blandy Experimental Farm being members ex officio. These people could gather at regular or called meetings and discuss affairs relating to the local usefulness of this unit.

As to the instructional work, it is believed that efforts along this line should be in two directions:

1\. The director and fellows, working in conjunction with state and federal agriculturalists, and in so far as practical, cooperating with the agricultural units at the Boyce and Berryville High School, at Boyce, and the Handley High School at Winchester, shall organize such courses of instruction as are practical and will be beneficial to the people of that vicinity. It appears that the most feasible plan for the present will be to organize several intensive short-courses of about five days duration. From five to six such courses could be given each year. The subjects to be discussed and the time the courses are to be given could be determined by the advisory council. In this way the staff would, for part of their time, actually "teach boys farming in its various branches, ocluding fruit raising".

2\. Fellows, or others desiring to take work in this field, should register in the department of graduate studies, at the University of Virginia, and take courses leading to graduate degrees in agriculture and biology. Courses of particular value in this connection would be: Genetics, Plant Physiology, Forestry, Entomology, Chemistry of Soils, Bacteriology, Economic Geology, Plant Pathology and Morophology, and Biometry. Some of these courses are already provided and most of the others could be arranged for without additional expenditures. The fellows would be expected to confine their class work to the fall and winter terms, moving to the farm in the spring with the director to begin, or to continue, their research, and also to assume their duties in helping to carry out the local education al program. Their work on the frm would continue through the spring and summer months. While there, they could be adequately housed in the ten-room brick building (Exhibit A). The second floor rooms of this building could be used as dormitories, while the rooms on the first floor could be converted into laboratories. No rent is to be charged for the rooms, but but the students will have to pay for their meals. This may be a difficult proposition, but it is believed that satisfactory arrangements can be made.

Aside from the real need of a school in the state where advanced training in agriculture may be obtained, the importance of research and its relation to farming problems cannot be over emphasized.

No rent is to be charged for the rooms, but but the students will have to pay for their meals. This may be a difficult proposition, but it is believed that satisfactory arrangements can be made.

Aside from the real need of a school in the state where advanced training in agriculture may be obtained, the importance of research and its relation to farming problems cannot be over emphasized. Agriculture is the backbone of stable government and its efficiency has been increased by the application of scientific methods. In this manner insect pests have been combatted, increased yields have been produced and the peoples of the world have been fed with less and less effort. To train men to do efficient research is the best method of dignifying and making profitable agriculture as a basic industry, and would, in this case, supplement and give point to the actual instruction provided for in the previous paragraph.

I beg to advise that, pursuant to instructions given me at the March 1st meeting of the Board, I called on Bentley W. Warren and Irvin McD. Garfield, trustees of the Estate of Arthur W. Austin, on April 11th and received from them the corpus of the estate consisting of the following:

(See journal of Bursar p. 288)

Also a check for $7,157.33 representing the balance of the income in their hands as of April 12th, 1927, the date on which the settlement was completed.

The cash and securities belonging to the corpus of the estate have been deposited with the Peoples National Bank as custodian, in accordance with the directions of the Board, and a complete list of same furnished the Chairman of the Finance Committee. The check representing the accumulated income has been placed to the credit of the income account of the estate on the books of the Bursar.

While in Boston, in compliance with your instruction, I made inquiry of Mr. Warren with respect to the request of Mrs. Mary A. McLaughlin that the University pay off the lien of $18,000 placed upon store and apartment property in order to purchase a residence for herself and husband, which request was reported to you at the March 1st meeting. Mr. Warren stated that while he had no personal or written request from Mrs. McLaughlin regarding the matter, yet, he was satisfied in his own mind that the message as delivered to him by Mr. McLaughlin was the one she has requested be conveyed; that at the time of receipt of the message she was too ill to have written the request - her death coming almost immediately after the request was received by him and transmitted to the University. He further stated that he had a very high regard for the honor and integrity of Mr. McLaughlin and was fully satisfied of its authenticity.

Mr. Warren then had Mr. McLaughlin come to his office where I had a personal interview with him resulting in the following information; he is 59 years of age; Mrs. McLaughlin was in her 67th year; they owned three store rooms with apartments above in West Roxbury, valued at approximately $35,000; they are located in a district of cheap property and are without tenants some portion of the time. The net income from this property is approximately $1,000 per year. A lien was placed on this property for $18,000 to purchase the residence as their home, for which they paid $19,000. The residence is an old one containing 12 rooms in a district where property is difficult to rent, and that it now was now vacant. The property has been for sale since his wife's death but no purchaser has been found. He received about $900 from his wife's estate which would be taken up in paying her bills. Mrs. McLaughlin spent $2,500 per year for 5 years in educating a niece at Wellesley, as well as some $3,000 in educating a nephew.

Mr. McLaughlin is in the lime and cement business with a brother from which business he says he receives from $1,000 to $2,000 per year.

They had been married about 25 years, and Mr. Warren stated that Mr. McLaughlin had been a very devoted husband and a great comfort to his wife. He further stated that he wished it understood that he held no brief for Mr. McLaughlin in this matter, having transmitted the message as requested, but he felt, that if the University could see its way to make some payment to Mr. McLaughlin he thought it would be worthily bestowed.

I discussed with Mr. Warren the question of the propriety of the University's erecting a suitable marker at the grave of the deceased and he was of the opinion that it would be a gracious recognition on the part of the University of the generosity of Mrs. McLaughlin.
