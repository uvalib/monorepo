**The Rector called on the Honorable Alan A. Diamonstein to lead the Pledge of Allegiance.**

**Ms. Dragas recommended reviewing materials provided to the Board: a compilation of poetry and prose from the English Department, and a book on University Grounds. She acknowledged the many contributions of the four board members who are retiring from the Board, A. Macdonald Caputo, the Honorable Alan A. Diamonstein, Vincent J. Mastracco Jr., and Hillary A. Hurd. Ms. Dragas also announced that James L. Hilton, Vice President and Chief Information Officer, and Steven T. DeKosky, Vice President and Dean of the School of Medicine, will be leaving their positions; she thanked them for their dedicated service.**

**She said a number of milestones are being marked at this time: Finals, and the progress the Board of Visitors has made in the last 10 to 12 months, and there is quite a bit to be proud of. She mentioned the evening speaker, the Honorable Eric Fingerhut, who she hoped would make it to Charlottesville in time.**

**Report by the Student Board Member**

**Ms. Dragas introduced Hillary A. Hurd, the student member of the board, for her remarks.**

**Ms. Hurd thanked the Board for the opportunity to provide remarks. She said the past year greatly exceeded the others she had experienced as a student because of the increased activism of students, including Honor’s Restore the Ideal Campaign, which have led to a re-evaluation of how the core principles and values are, and sometimes aren’t, realized at the University.**

**Ms. Hurd focused on student involvement in the strategic planning process. She said she hoped that the recommendations from students will be considered in the final plan, and that students will have opportunities for input throughout the process and in the coming years.**

**She said two student leaders had been assigned to each of the seven working groups, and at the beginning of the spring semester, these students met together to discuss how their respective groups were progressing and how more students could become involved. Over the course of the semester, the students met several more times and organized a few separate efforts to engage the student body.**

**Ms. Hurd said students have shared their cumulative list of student concerns and priorities on the IMAGINE UVA Facebook site, and there are some interesting ideas, including how to re-make undergraduate advising, how to involve students in technology development, and how to encourage inter-disciplinary research, both inside and outside of the classroom.**

**Ms. Hurd said a number of students have expressed concern about the short timeline of the strategic planning process, and that it ought to be a continuous process rather than a periodic one, with resources set aside to gather student ideas.**

**Report by the President**

**Ms. Dragas asked President Sullivan to provide a report.**

President Sullivan began by telling a story: Gary Owens, a member of the Cardiovascular Center, was on the verge of leaving for Stanford. He studies the role of vascular smooth-muscle cells (SMC) in the development of diseases like atherosclerosis, asthma, and cancer. President Sullivan met with him at Carr’s Hill, and Mr. Owens indicated that he was leaving in part because of the lack of cutting-edge equipment that is available at Stanford, specifically a CyTOF machine. He said they cost $800,000. President Sullivan offered him half the money from the President’s contingent fund, and asked if he could raise the other half. He said he could, and he has raised the money to buy the machine. It will be installed this summer. He has also received three new grants from NIH, so the investment is a very lucrative one for the University.

**President Sullivan said every organization must invest in itself. We need to decide with whom and in what fields we should compete. There are places where we are not well-positioned to compete, but we need to determine the areas where we are excellent or could build excellence, and differentiate ourselves from others. In the strategic planning session during this meeting, the Board and administration will discuss the distinguishing areas in which we can build, and also a range of initiatives we could undertake. These will require investments. When we make these investments, we are investing in our students.**

**President Sullivan said that in August, we will welcome another first-year class. Each year, the University attracts some of the best and brightest students from Virginia, across the nation, and around the world. This year’s enrolling class is no exception. Preliminary numbers show that more than 92% of admitted students are in the top 10% of their high school’s graduating class.**

**The University strives to recruit the very best students, regardless of their financial situations. We do this in the spirit of Thomas Jefferson, who wanted to replace the false aristocracy of wealth and privilege with what he called a “natural aristocracy” of talent.**

**Preliminary numbers show that the administrative changes made in November to hold the AccessUVa institutional budget at the 2012-13 level have not adversely affected the number of low-income students enrolling. In fact, the number of low-income students in this fall’s entering class is the second highest since AccessUVa’s inception.  Although minority representation declined last year, it has rebounded this year in almost every category of minority students. Recent changes in measurement metrics can add confusion to how we measure the diversity of our students. The University wants to do more, but we need to wait for two Supreme Court decisions to come down—not because we expect them to change what we do, but because they could substantially change our competitive position vis-à-vis other schools that are competing for the same students.**

**She said the Educational Policy Committee meeting this afternoon is devoted to MOOCs, an experiment that the University is undertaking with Coursera. In addition to the U.Va.-Coursera courses that were offered this spring, the University is offering two courses now in preparation: one on the Life of Thomas Jefferson, with Peter Onuf, and one on the Kennedy Assassination, with Larry Sabato. Also during the Educational Policy meeting, committee members will be asked to approve the new bachelor’s in health professions, an online course developed in conjunction with Virginia community colleges and our own hospital, designed to meet a known need in the labor market. This is another STEM offering.**

**We are creating innovative new courses because we have excellent faculty. In recent months, we have successfully recruited several new, world-class teachers and scholars who will strengthen the faculty considerably in the years ahead. She provided a few examples:**

**The University recruited historian Alan Taylor from the University of California-Davis as Professor in the Corcoran Department of History. Mr. Taylor has written numerous books about the early American Republic, and he has won both the Pulitzer Prize and the Bancroft Prize for his work. The History Department is already recognized as one of the top five in the country for the history of America to 1865, and Mr. Taylor will help strengthen that position.**

**Willis Jenkins from Yale will join the faculty as the Margaret Farley Associate Professor of Social Ethics. Mr. Jenkins is the first hire in Environmental Humanities, which is one of the cluster hires the College is now doing with support of the Mellon Foundation.**

**Dr. Richard Westphal from the Nurse Corps of the US Navy will join the School of Nursing faculty. Dr. Westphal managed the Navy and Marine Corps’ psychological health and traumatic brain-injury programs. During his career, he has been recognized with the Legion of Merit and the Navy Commendation Medal.**

**Jonathan Goodall will come from the University of South Carolina as an Associate Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering. Mr. Goodall’s research focuses on the emerging field of hydro-informatics, where researchers integrate massive data sets with complex models for water resource systems. Mr. Goodall will add to the existing strengths and disciplinary diversity that make the University a leader in the field of Big Data.**

**Amy LaViers will join the faculty as an Assistant Professor of Computer Science upon completion of her Ph.D. at Georgia Tech. Ms. LaViers conducts research to develop choreographic abstractions for robotic motion. She holds a Certificate in Dance from Princeton University, and she uses her expertise in dance to design the smooth motion of robots.**

**Dan Murphy will join the Darden School as an Assistant Professor of Business Administration upon completion of his Ph.D. at the University of Michigan. Mr. Murphy’s primary research interest is in international trade and how “catalyst goods” increase demand for other products — for example, how the reliable provision of electricity increases demand for appliances.**

**Benjamin Castleman will join the Curry School as an Assistant Professor in Education Policy upon completion of his Ph.D. at Harvard. Mr. Castelman’s work addresses the need for interventions aimed at low-income students and their families to increase access to higher education.**    

**These new additions to the faculty are just a few examples of the broad excellence we are building at the University, one person at a time, as we recruit the University’s next generation of teachers and scholars.**

**She said that one member of the leadership team was not at the meeting because he was doing important business in Washington, DC. Vice President for Research Tom Skalak was at the White House with a small, invited group of experts for a national workshop aimed at enhancing the transition of research discoveries to the marketplace.  The title of the event was “The Lab-to-Market Cross-Agency Summit,” and it involved government agency leaders, corporate executives, and university leaders who have proven track records in proof-of-concept research and other means of bringing university research to public benefit.  Of the small group of 20 invited experts, only two were from universities in the U.S.: Cal. Tech. and the University of Virginia. Establishing the University as a national leader in this kind of discussion is an important goal.**

**President Sullivan said the University is celebrating a remarkable achievement: campaign chair Gordon Rainey and Senior Vice President for University Advancement Bob Sweeney will announce the successful completion of the Campaign for the University of Virginia. Surpassing the $3-billion goal is a remarkable achievement, especially considering the economic head-winds that the University has sailed against in the latter part of the campaign. Mr. Rainey and his team of strong volunteer-leaders, and Mr. Sweeney and his team of dedicated staff, deserve an enthusiastic thank-you from everyone who cares about the University and its future.**

**She said that when she made the campaign announcement during Final Exercises, she described some of the buildings and programs that have resulted from this campaign. The campaign has also affected students and faculty through the creation of more than 500 new scholarships and 63 new professorships. For example, the Marvin Rosenblum Professorship in Mathematics allowed the University to recruit an internationally known expert in operator theory and analysis, Craig Huneke, to serve as chair of the Department of Mathematics. And scholarships like the Thomas Quinn Jones Scholarship Fund and the John Blackburn Endowed Scholarship for AccessUVa provide financial resources for students in need.**

**The gifts that helped the University reach the goal in the final stretch of the campaign are described in the Gifts and Grants report.**

**The Rector asked for approval of the following resolution, which was discussed in Executive Session on May 20, 2013:**

**RESOLUTION ON FACULTY ROLE IN UNIVERSITY GOVERNANCE**

**WHEREAS, the Board of Visitors values the input of University faculty members in its formulation of policy, and accordingly invites faculty members to serve as representatives to Board committees; and**

**WHEREAS, the Board wishes to formally recognize the important responsibilities faculty members have in shaping and implementing the University’s curriculum; and**

**WHEREAS, the Board also values the role of faculty in reviewing administrative policies that guide students, faculty, and staff of the University;**

**RESOLVED, the Board adopts the following statement regarding Faculty Role in University Governance:**

**Authority for the governance of the University is vested by statute in the Board of Visitors by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Virginia. The Board’s responsibilities, specified by state statute, include but are not restricted to the appointment of the University president; appointment, promotion, and granting of tenure; removal of members of the faculty; the prescription of faculty responsibilities; the setting of faculty salaries; the determination of student tuition, fees, other charges; and the government and discipline of students. The Board prescribes the duties of the President, and the President has supreme administrative direction of the University, subject to the authority of the Board. The Board has delegated certain authority and responsibilities to the President and the Chief Academic Officer, who have delegated certain of these responsibilities to the faculty.**

**University faculty has played an important role in assisting the Board in fulfilling its responsibility from the University’s founding to the present day. Through the work of the Faculty Senate, a representative body consisting of members elected from each of the schools, faculty recommend approval of the establishment of new degree programs and major modifications to existing degree programs. Faculties also approve the conferral of all degrees and oversee the development of curricula in their respective schools and departments. Faculties serve as non-voting consulting members on committees of the Board of Visitors, as well as on standing administrative committees of the University, including the University Policy Review Committee, which reviews administrative policies. The Senate also provides the Executive Vice- President and Provost with advice and counsel on other academic matters. Through all of these mechanisms, faculty members share their expertise and insights on academic matters with the Provost, the President, and members of the Board of Visitors.**

**RESOLVED FURTHER, the president is directed to publish or distribute to the Faculty and the University community the above statement regarding Faculty Role in University Governance.**
