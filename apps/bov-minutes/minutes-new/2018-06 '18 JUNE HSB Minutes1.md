WHEREAS, Mr. Craig’s term on the Health System Board ends on June 30, 2018; and

WHEREAS, prior to being a public member of the Health System Board, Mr. Craig served on the Board of Visitors and on the Health System Board as a representative of the Board of Visitors; and

Dr. Britt welcomed Dr. John Niederhuber whose appointment to the committee as a public member will be considered at Friday’s meeting of the full Board. He reported that Dr. Jessica Lukacs, a 2017 graduate of the UVA School of Medicine and a current student at the Darden School, will begin serving a term as a student member of the committee in September; she will participate in a non-voting capacity in all sessions. Dr. Britt concluded by thanking Mr. Larry Fitzgerald, Mr. Patrick Hogan, and President Teresa Sullivan for their service. He recognized President Sullivan for her leadership and said her focus on clinical quality and expansion of the Health System has left the Commonwealth with a top tier academic health system.

Dr. Britt gave the floor to Dr. Shannon. Dr. Shannon recognized Dr. Niederhuber for his contributions to the partnership between the University, the Inova Translational Medicine Institute, and the Global Genomics and Bioinformatics Research Institute. He also noted the contributions made by Mr. Fitzgerald, Mr. Hogan, and Ms. Sullivan.

Remarks from the President

President Sullivan said when she came to the University, she realized there were going to be dramatic leadership changes due to retirements and one of her tasks was to find leadership that was equally as good. She said the University is unusual in American higher education because its medical school is adjacent to the academic campus, which creates greater opportunities for collaboration. Charlottesville’s distant location from the state’s population centers, on the other hand, is a disadvantage to the Health System. The Heath System has been proactive and has developed strategies to respond to this situation.

Ms. Sullivan said higher education and health care are in trouble today. The University can respond by leveraging collaboration to make its resources go further and find novel ways to address these issues. Clinical care is an important part of the University’s mission and collaboration across the University is important. She highlighted a number of accomplishments: growth in research; development of the licensing and ventures group and the venture fund; patient care improvements; the BeSafe program; expansion with Novant;, the relationship with Inova; and the Genomics Institute. To illustrate the progress that has been made, she said the conversation on the street has changed from ‘can’t you do something about the hospital’ to ‘what great care I received.’ She thanked the committee for its dedication and congratulated it for the positive results it has achieved.

Reports from the Executive Vice President for Health Affairs

Dr. Shannon said Dr. Britt was recognized by his hometown of Suffolk for his contributions. He gave a status review of the Health System’s goals for the fiscal year. Steady progress has been made. The goals have 13 strategies. Of these, nine have been achieved. The BeSafe strategy, improve tertiary/quaternary referral pattern strategy, and advance diversity strategy will not be met. The FY 2018 Operating Margin strategy is “too close to call” at this point. The Health System is exceeding performance on five of the nine metrics that make up the BeSafe strategy. Two, readmissions and mortality, will not be met. For the mortality metric, the Health System is on track to have nearly 200 fewer deaths than two years ago. The diversity strategy will not be met because the search for a chief wellness and diversity officer will not be completed until next the fiscal year.

Action Item: Signatory Authority Related to Medical Center Contracts Exceeding $5 Million Per Year

On motion duly seconded, the committee approved the following resolution and recommended it for approval by the Finance Committee and by the Board of Visitors:

Health System Consolidated Financials Fiscal Year 2018 Year-to-Date Report

Mr. Doug Lischke reviewed the performance as of the end of March. The system’s assets totaled $4.7 billion. There was an operating income deficit of $16.4 million, which was $600,000 more than projected. He reminded the committee that the budget projected a $24 million deficit during the first six months, due to the implementation of Epic, and a $26 million recovery during the last six months resulting in a $2 million operating margin. Volume for April and May was strong. If it continues for June, the Health System should achieve this margin by June 30.

Action Item: Fiscal Year 2019 Operating and Capital Budgets for the University of Virginia Health System

Mr. Lischke said the proposed operating budget is not conservative and that there will be a continued focus on access, quality, and cost control. He anticipates assets will total $5 billion by the end of the fiscal year. Total operating income is projected to be $23.1 million. This will be $13.7 million less than the income for FY 2017 and is due to three main drivers: a full year of the 340B outpatient drug discount drop; tax reform which will increase bad debt; and depreciation expense growth. The FY 2019 income projection was compared to FY 2017 because FY 2018 was impacted by the implementation of Epic. The operating cash flow projection is $152 million. Capital expenditures are budgeted at $160.2 million.

On motion, the committee approved the following resolution and recommended it for approval by the Finance Committee and the Board of Visitors:

FISCAL YEAR 2019 OPERATING AND CAPITAL BUDGETS FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA HEALTH SYSTEM  

RESOLVED, the Fiscal Year 2019 Operating and Capital Budgets for the University of Virginia Medical Center and Transitional Care Hospital are approved, as recommended by the President, the Executive Vice President for Health Affairs, the Chief Operating Officer of the University, and the Health System Board.

Action Item: Renaming of UVA HealthSouth Rehabilitation Hospital

On motion, the committee approved the following resolution and recommended it for approval by the Buildings and Grounds Committee and the Board of Visitors:

RENAMING UVA HEALTHSOUTH REHABILITATION HOSPITAL TO UVA ENCOMPASS HEALTH REHABILITATION HOSPITAL

WHEREAS, the UVA HealthSouth Rehabilitation Hospital is located on the Fontaine Campus of the University and is a 50/50 joint venture between the UVA Medical Center and HealthSouth Corporation; and

WHEREAS, in January 2018, HealthSouth Corporation changed its name to Encompass Health Corporation; and

WHEREAS, the Medical Center desires to change the name of the Rehabilitation Hospital to reflect the change in corporate name of its partner;

RESOLVED, the Board of Visitors renames the UVA HealthSouth Rehabilitation Hospital to the UVA Encompass Health Rehabilitation Hospital.
