Alice J. Raucher was the presenter.

Mr. Clement opened the meeting. After reviewing the agenda, he asked Ms. Sheehy to present the action items.

**Action Item: Naming: Baseball Stadium Access Road as Coogan Way**

On motion, the committee approved the following resolution and recommended it for Board approval:

**NAMING OF THE BASEBALL STADIUM ACCESS ROAD AS COOGAN WAY**

WHEREAS, Henry William Coogan Jr., who earned an M.B.A. from the Darden School of Business in 1982, has been a loyal and generous supporter of the University of Virginia, particularly UVA Athletics and the Darden School; and

WHEREAS, Mr. Coogan made significant contributions to the renovation of Davenport Field, the home of Virginia Baseball;

RESOLVED, the Board of Visitors names the baseball stadium access road as _Coogan Way_.

**Action Item: Naming: Baseball Stadium as Disharoon Park**

Ms. Sheehy said the name of the stadium will be Davenport Field at Disharoon Park.

On motion, the committee approved the following resolution and recommended it for Board approval:

**NAMING OF THE BASEBALL STADIUM AS DISHAROON PARK**

WHEREAS, University of Virginia Athletics has undertaken extensive and important renovations of the baseball field and stadium; and

WHEREAS, this renovation project was made possible in part through philanthropic gifts, including substantial support from two anonymous donors; and

WHEREAS, the aforementioned anonymous donors wish to recognize the support and contributions of Leslie B. Disharoon and Ann Merriwether Disharoon, who are longtime, enthusiastic, and generous supporters of Virginia Baseball;

RESOLVED, the Board of Visitors names the baseball stadium as _Disharoon Park_.

**Action Item: Concept, Site, and Design Guidelines: Softball Stadium**

Ms. Raucher presented this item. At the committee’s January meeting, the University committed to studying the three most promising sites: the soccer practice field at the southwest corner of the Massie and Copeley intersection; the parking lot at the southeast corner of the same intersection; and a site at the south end of The Park. The Athletics Department, Facilities Management, and the steering committee selected the soccer practice field as the best option. It locates the stadium with other competition venues allowing the shared used of elements, such as the main entry, ticket booths, and parking. The site also accommodates future expansion needs.

On motion, the committee approved the following resolution:

**CONCEPT, SITE, AND DESIGN GUIDELINES FOR THE SOFTBALL STADIUM**

RESOLVED, the concept, site, and design guidelines for the Softball Stadium, prepared by the Architect for the University, are approved.

**Schematic Design Review: Ivy Mountain Musculoskeletal Center**

Ms. Raucher presented the proposed design. She said a number of changes have been made to the Ivy Mountain master plan. To make patient wayfinding easier, the center’s proposed parking garage has been replaced with on-grade parking. The central utility plant has been relocated from the center’s main entry road to an isolated, central location where it will be closer to the development proposed for the west end of the Ivy Mountain site. The center’s service area and loading dock have also been moved away from the main entry road.

The building massing consists of two bars joined by two story public space. The scale of this 188,000 square foot structure will be diminished by building it into the 60 foot grade change between Ivy Road and the adjacent Poplar Glen neighborhood. What appears as a three story building facing Ivy Road will be a two-story building facing the neighborhood. The building’s base will have a stone veneer; the upper floors will have a brick and glass facade. The architecture will take clues from the Emily Couric Cancer Center, the Battle Building, and the University’s new office building on Old Ivy Road. The project will preserve as much of the site’s landscaping as possible.

**Committee Discussion of Revisions to the Capital Program**

Ms. Sheehy reviewed the proposed revisions. Fourteen projects are being added; four are being removed. Projects in the program are divided into near-term (2018-2020), mid-term (2020-2022), and long-term projects (after June 30, 2022). The majority of the new projects are in the near-term category. The dollar value of the current plan is nearly $2.4 billion. The proposed revisions increase the value to nearly $2.8 billion.

The Academic Division has eight new near-term projects: two new residence halls; the Darden Inn; the University Hotel; a new University Museum for the Fralin and the Kluge-Ruhe museums; demolition of U-Hall, the Cage, and Onesty Hall; North Grounds Mechanical Plant and Infrastructure; and West Grounds Chilled Water Capacity project. There is one mid-term project: North Plant Chillers 6 & 7 Replacements.

The proposed demolition of University Hall sparked a discussion about master planning opportunities and challenges for the development of the North Grounds, Athletics, the Emmet/Ivy Corridor, and the West Complex. The Rector suggested the University take a high level look to make sure they are coordinated. As an example, he said the decanting of the West Complex could possibly impact plans for the Emmet/Ivy Corridor or residential needs on Grounds.

Ms. Sheehy said the Health System has four new near-term projects: Comprehensive Breast Care Center; Eye Center; Pinn Hall Nobel Laureate Atrium; and Pinn Hall Renovation – Envelope & Infrastructure. The University was asking for an immediate approval of the Comprehensive Breast Care Center, which consolidates breast services in leased space on Pantops, because the Health System was in lease negotiations and needed approval prior to the June committee meeting.

On motion, the committee approved the following resolution and recommended it for Board approval:

**REVISION TO THE CAPITAL PROGRAM: ADDITION OF THE COMPREHENSIVE BREAST CENTER**

WHEREAS, the University recommends the establishment of a Comprehensive Breast Center in 20,000 gross square feet leased space proximate to the UVA Community Oncology practice at Pantops;

RESOLVED, the Board of Visitors approves the addition of the Comprehensive Breast Center to the University’s Capital Program.

After the vote, Ms. Sheehy presented the last revision, which was a mid-term project at the College at Wise for a Technology Classroom Building.

Ms. Sheehy’s report concluded with a review of Land-Use and Space Needs Studies. The chair asked how studies were initiated and approved. He didn’t see them referenced in the Annual Strategic and Capital Process chart. Ms. Sheehy said they were typically identified during the annual capital program review in response to new project requests.

After directing the committee’s attention to the reports in the meeting materials, the chair asked Ms. Carla Williams for her initial assessment of the Athletic Department’s capital needs. Ms. Williams outlined two critical needs – decanting of the programs in U-Hall, Onesty Hall, and the Cage to new space and a new football facility. The tennis, golf, and softball programs also had needs, which were being addressed. She said the department will be in good shape once the needs of the football program and the teams housed in U-Hall, Onesty Hall, and the Cage were addressed.

As a follow-up to the discussion on space needs studies, Mr. Katsouleas said the studies focus on needs, efficiencies, and synergies. Historically buildings have been constructed for departments, such as the physics and chemistry, but given the emphasis on integrated research, the University must think about shared facilities and what they can produce in terms of research and scholarship to advance the University. Referencing the concept of shared space, the Rector said the University has a number of democracy oriented institutes and centers. There has been discussion about aligning these centers in a way which does not require mergers or loss of individual identity, but could create a larger footprint for the University’s reputation. He has asked the president to work with these groups to determine their space needs and how they could fit in the Emmet/Ivy Corridor in a more efficient manner. Mr. Macfarlane suggested residential colleges could be a way to reinforcing a sense of community for students and providing upper-class housing.
