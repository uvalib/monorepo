RESOLVED, the consideration of addenda to the published Agenda of this meeting of the Board of Visitors is approved.

Pavilion Assignment Policy

The Rector called on Mr. Casteen to review the changes to the Pavilion assignment policy. The changes include adding the Dean of the Frank Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy to the priority list and cleaning up some ambiguous language. On motion, the Board approved the following revised policy:

ASSIGNMENT OF PAVILIONS ON THE LAWN AND MONTEBELLO

Residence in a Lawn Pavilion is a privilege that entails certain obligations. Residents of the Pavilions must have an interest in being true members of Thomas Jefferson’s “Academical Village” in the sense the Founder envisioned, which is to say a community of faculty and students living together and working together. To this end, Pavilion residents must use their assigned Pavilion as their principal residence and they must be willing to have frequent contact with their student neighbors and to participate fully in the life of the Lawn community.

Applicants for Pavilions must agree to these conditions before being considered for residence.

The Board of Visitors for some years has followed an order of precedence, which it devised, in considering tenants for the Pavilions and Montebello. The spirit of this order of precedence must not be violated if there is to be a fair and equitable assignment procedure. Pavilions, or the promise of being assigned one, under no circumstances will be used as an inducement in recruiting faculty or administrators to the University nor will any assignment process be used other than the one approved by the Board and outlined in these procedures.

1.  **Priority shall be accorded the Provost, the Vice President and Chief Student Affairs Officer, and any vice president nominated by the President and agreed to by the Board, and to the academic deans in order of the founding of several schools, followed by the faculty, subject to conditions listed in (e).**

Specifically, the order shall be as follows:

1.  **The Vice President and Provost**
2.  **The Vice President and Chief Student Affairs**

**Officer**

1.  **Any vice president nominated by the President and**

**agreed to by the Board**

1.  **The Dean of the College and Graduate School of Arts**

**and Sciences**

1.  **The Dean of the School of Medicine**
2.  **The Dean of the School of Law**
3.  **The Dean of the School of Engineering and Applied**

**Science**

1.  **The Dean of the Curry School of Education**
2.  **The Dean of the McIntire School of Commerce**
3.  **The Dean of the School of Architecture**
4.  **The Dean of the Darden Graduate School of Business**

**Administration**

1.  **The Dean of the School of Nursing**
2.  **The Dean of the Frank Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy**
3.  **Following the assignment of Pavilions to those**

**identified in (a), remaining Pavilion**

**assignments, the apartments in Pavilion VIII, and the**

**assignment of Montebello, shall be recommended to the**

**Board by a committee consisting of the Secretary to the**

**Board of Visitors, a representative of the faculty, and**

**a representative of the student body. The faculty**

**representative shall be the Chair of the Faculty Senate**

**and the student representative(s) shall be the holder(s)**

**of the Gray-Carrington Award. The Secretary to the**

**Board shall serve as the chair of the committee. The**

**committee shall submit its recommendations to the Board**

**for approval.**

1.  **The committee will advertise vacancies in the Pavilions**

**and Montebello among the faculty through the academic**

**deans’ offices and the Faculty Senate.**

1.  **All applicants will complete an application form issued**

**by the committee.**

1.  **Qualifications for the assignment of residences, other**

**than the apartments in Pavilion VIII, shall include:**

*   1.  **Assignees, other than eligible vice presidents and**

**deans, shall hold the rank of full professor, and**

**shall have demonstrated excellence in teaching and**

**in interaction with students.**

*   1.  **The following are not eligible for assignment to**

**residences:**

*   *   1.  **Part-time professors**
        2.  **Professors who have entered into retirement contracts with the University.**

1.  **Junior faculty shall be encouraged to apply for the two**

**Pavilion VIII apartments. The process for selecting**

**tenants for these apartments was devised by the**

**Provost’s Office and shall be administered by the**

**committee described in (b). As with other Pavilion**

**residents, applicants for the apartments must be willing**

**to have frequent interaction with their student**

**neighbors and to participate fully in the life of the**

**Lawn.**

1.  **Leases of the Pavilions including the Pavilion VIII**

**apartments, and Montebello, shall be for five years. The five year leases for the Pavilion VIII apartments will not be renewable, but leases for Montebello and the other Pavilions may be renewed for a second five year term upon approval by the Executive Committee of the Board. No tenant shall live in a Pavilion or Montebello for more than ten years, with the exception noted in (j) below.**

1.  **Pavilion and Montebello tenants who resign from the**

**faculty shall vacate the premises within 30 days of the**

**date of resignation. Retiring faculty must vacate the premises by June 30th of the year of retirement. Vice presidents and deans who leave their administrative positions shall vacate the premises no later than 120 days after leaving the administrative position. The family of a tenant who dies during an academic year may occupy the residence until early in the following summer term, or at some other date approved in consideration of the relict family's circumstances, but in no instance later than August 1.**

1.  **A prospective occupant’s willingness to assign space in**

**a Pavilion for classes or seminars will be considered an**

**additional qualification. In Pavilion V, however, space for classes was designed when the building was restored and classes will be conducted there. The scheduling of these classes will be done by the Registrar in consultation with the Pavilion occupant, but the classroom will be used according to a regular schedule.**

1.  **Leases for the Pavilions, the Pavilion VIII apartments,**

**and Montebello, will conform to a standard devised by the Housing Division and the Office of the General Counsel, in consultation with the committee described in (b). Terms of residence for current Pavilion tenants in effect at the time of the approval of these procedures will be honored, as long as those tenants continue to fulfill the Board’s requirements of active participation in the life of the “Academical Village” and primary residence on the Lawn.**

**Comments by the Rector**

**In addition to some instructions to Members about the dinner Monday evening, the Rector mentioned the Association of Governing Boards annual conference for Trustees which will be held March 19 through 21, 2010, in Orlando, Florida. He asked Members to contact the Secretary if they are interested in participating in the conference.**

**President’s Report**

**The President spoke about his recent trip to China prior to giving the Gifts and Grants Report. He said he opened the UVa.-Beijing Office at Peking University, an effort based in the College and Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. He said this gives the University a foot-hold to build relationships in China.**

His topic was “Effective University Management in Difficult Times”. He mentioned that the University is ranked #91 in the world according to a Shanghai Jiao Tong University survey.**

Proceeds from tax-exempt bond issues, endowment assets, and money held in bank demand deposit accounts are not covered under this policy.

Except for cash in certain legally-restricted and special accounts, the University will consolidate cash and reserve balances to optimize University-wide liquidity management and investment earnings and to increase efficiencies with regard to investment pricing, custody/trust and administration.

III. General Objectives

1.  Safety - Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the investment program. Investments shall be undertaken in a manner that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital in the overall portfolio by mitigating credit risk and interest rate risk.
2.  Liquidity - The investment portfolio shall remain sufficiently liquid to meet all operating requirements that may be reasonably anticipated.
3.  Yield - The investment portfolio shall be designed with the objective of attaining a market rate of return throughout budgetary and economic cycles.
