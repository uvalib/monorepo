At the annual meeting of the Board of Visitors, called for the consideration of the Financial Budget for 1913-1914.

Present: The Rector, Visitors Craddock, Flood, Norton, White, Irvine, Drewry, Michie, Oliver, State Superintendent Stearnes, and Acting President, Dean James M. Page.

The Rector having called the Board to order at 10:30 o'clock, the newly appointed member, (to fill vacancy caused by resignation of Dr. W. M. Randolph), Mr. George R. B. Michie, appeared, and being duly qualified, was accordingly recognized as a member of this Board.

Report of Committee on Entrance Building

At a meeting of the Committee on Entrance Building at 8:00 P.M., May 9th, 1913, there were present Messrs. Lambeth, Michie, Newcomb, Smith, Forrest. The following was moved by Mr. Newcomb, seconded and carried:-

Resolved that it be the sense of this Committee that the contract for the construction of the Entrance Building for the University be and is herewith awarded to Vandegrift and Fitch, the lowest competitive bidders, subject to the approval by the Rector and Visitors of the University of our resolution asking for $5,000.00 increased loan.

The following was presented by Mr. Forrest and moved and seconded by Mr. Smith and Mr. Michie, and adopted for presentation at next meeting of the Board, together with the preceeding resolution for their information:-

To the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia.

Your Committee on Improvements at the University entrance beg to report that in harmony with your instructions they secured bids on completed plans and specifications for the building approved by you at your meeting February 10, 1913.

The lowest bid, even after making all such changes in the plans as can reduce the cost without injuring the building in appearance, structure or rent-yielding power, shows that the building alone, with the architect's fees, will cost nearly $20,000.00. Your provision for the building being only $15,000.00, it has impossible to sign the contract and proceed with the work.

We therefore ask that you provide a further sum of $5,000.00 making a total of $25,000. for the building and outside improvements, interest upon which at the rate of six per cent per year shall be deducted by the Bursar from the gross revenues of the building paid into his hands. In our judgement the rents will easily care for this annual charge of $1,500.00 and leave a handsome surplus. We also believe it would be a mistake to reduce the size of the building, and that if reduced it would not carry an interest charge of $1,200.00 as safely as the proposed building will carry, $1,500.00.

The Committee on Entrance Building having made the foregoing report, it was

Resolved: That an additional sum of $5,000.00 be appropriated to the building and improvements at the University entrance, making the total appropriation for the purpose $25,000.00 instead of $20,000.00 as provided in the resolution of February 10, 1913.

Relative to the "1908 Alumni Reunion," it was

Resolved: first, That the sum of $200.00 be and is hereby appropriated to pay for the music in connection with the reunion of the 1908 class to be held at the approaching Finals.

Resolved, secondly, That the sum of $150.00 be and is hereby appropriated to be used for the purpose of providing suitable lodging in the University dormitories for the members of the 1908 class and their friends at the reunion during the approaching Finals.

Resolved, that the sum of $1,500. be and is hereby appropriated for the University Summer School for the summer of 1913. Of this sum of $1,500.00, $500.00 is to pay the salary of the Director of the Summer School, $300.00 to pay the salary of the Professor of Advanced Algebra and Trigonometry: the remaining $700.00 to be used for general Summer School purposes.

The Financial Budget for the year 1913-1914 having been submitted to the Rector, and to each member of the Board, some weeks prior to this meeting, and having been thus fully considered and also discussed in this meeting, on motion duly seconded, the same is hereby adopted in the following words and figures:—;

\[See Budget for year 1913-1914 page 284\]

At the annual meeting of the Board of Visitors, called for the consideration of the Financial Budget for 1913-1914.

Present: The Rector, Visitors Craddock, Flood, Norton, White, Irvine, Drewry, Michie, Oliver, State Superintendent Stearnes, and Acting President, Dean James M. Page.

The adoption of the foregoing Budget, carried with it the following promotions,—;

Instructor James C. Bardin to Adjunct Professor of Spanish and Poruguese.

Adjunct Professor W. S. Rodman, to Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering.

Adjunct Professor J. S. Grasty, to William Barton Rogers Associate Professor of Economic Geology.

Adjunct Professor Wm. A. Kepner to Associate Professor of Biology.

In view of the following letter from the Dean of the Engineering Department, Mr. J. S. Lapham was appointed Instructor in Applied Mechanics.

After the annual report of the Department of Engineering had been made and forwarded to the President, it was learned that Mr. J. S. Lapham, a graduate of this University in Mechanical Engineering, desired an appointment on our teaching staff. Mr. Lapham is a young man of unusual ability; and, if his application had been received earlier, he would undoubtedly have been engaged. It is not often that any school has the opportunity of securing the services of a man so eminently fitted by capacity, training, and character to make a useful and accomplished University teacher. The department is already committed to the young men nominated in our report as instructors for 1913-1914, and cannot in good faith, cancel any one of the nominations. On the other hand, the opportunity is one which cannot be postponed; unless Mr. Lapham comes to us, he will go into business with his father, and such permanent changes will have to be made in the details of that business as will prevent him from accepting a position with us in the future.

I am so greatly impressed by the desirability of engaging Mr. Lapham that I beg to ask through you a small special appropriation for his salary. This appropriation will be for the one year only, after 1913-1914, we shall be able to arrange our teaching force so that Mr. Lapham will receive one of the regular appointments.

I desire therefore to recommend that for the session 1913-1914, Mr. J. S. Lapham be appointed, assistant instructor in Applied Mechanics at a salary of $500.

I have been a professor in this University for thirty-seven years. Men have been appointed in the past to extend the work of the Department of Engineering, but I have never before asked for a man to share my individual work. I should not do this at present, but for the cogent reasons given above. I trust the Rector and Visitors may find it possible, and deem it wise to approve this recommendation.

Resolved, (1) That the action of Professor H. T. Marshall in releasing his assistant, Dr. J. O. Mundy on April 10, 1913, to accept an advantageous position in New York City, be approved.

Resolved, further, that Professor Marshall's employing Miss Lila Thornton as Technical Assistant for the unexpired term of Dr. Mundy, to continue to July 1 at $30.00 a month, be approved.

Resolved: (3) That the Bursar be and is hereby authorized to pay Miss Thornton for her work during the unexpired term of Dr. Mundy out of the amount appropriated for Dr. Mundy's salary for that period; and that the unexpended balance of $96.76, of Dr. Mundy's salary for that period be transferred to the credit of the Pathological Laboratory.

Resolved: That for next session the salary of Mr. A. G. Nochren as Student Assistant in Physcial Education be and is hereby fixed at the sum of $350.00, he to pay the University fee and tuition in the Medical Department.

Resolved: That for the next session, the position of Sanitary Inspector of the University be instituted, and that the same be filled by some medical student recommended by the University Sanitary Committee. The remuneration attached to the position shall be $100.00; and the incumbent shall act under the direction of and report to the Chairman of the University Sanitary Committee.

Resolved, That the sum of $100. be and is hereby appropriated to pay for an Assistant in the office of the Dean of the University from July 1 to September 15th.

Resolved: That a sum not to exceed $200. be and is hereby appropriated for the maintenance of Madison Hall during the fiscal year ending July 1, 1913.

Resolved: That $127.00 be poropriated to send a sample copy of the Alumni News to each of five thousand (5,000) Alumni.

The following letter to the President from Prof. Albert H. Tuttle, was presented by Dean Page,

As you are already aware, I have recently sent to the Trustees of the Carnegie Foundation a formal application for retirement, feeling that after forty years of full professional work and twenty-five years of active service at this University, the time has come when it is wise for me to take advantage of the provisions of the Foundation,

This application still awaits the action of the Board of Trustees at their forthcoming meeting, at which time I hope and expect that it will meet with their approval. Pending their action, however, I feel it my duty to advise the Rector and Visitors of the step that I have taken, and of my wish, subject to this contingency, to retire from active service on September 15th next. I therefore request that these facts be laid before them.

I should like also to ask of the Rector and Visitors of the University that, in case of my retirement at the time indicated, I be permitted for the present to occupy the house I am now living in on the same terms as heretofore, viz., a rental at $25.00 a month. Hoping for favorable action on their part, I remain,

Pursuant to the foregoing letter, the following was adopted:-

Resolved, first, That contingent upon his being admitted to the benefits of the "Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching," at the next meeting of the Executive Committee of said Foundation, the resignation of Professor Albert Henry Tuttle as Miller Professor of Biology and Agriculture in the University of Virginia, be accepted to take effect September 15, 1913.

Resolved, secondly, that in case of Professor Tuttles' retirement at the time indicated, he shall be permitted for the present to occupy the house he is now living in, on the same terms as heretofore, namely, a rental of $25.00 per month.

Resolved: That Mr. R. E. Beard, who withdrew from the University, November 21, 1913, in order to accept a position as teacher in Norfolk Academy, be and he is hereby relieved from the payment of all fees for the second and third terms of this session, as a student in the University.

Resolved: That the appreciative thanks of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia be extended to Mrs. Martha Jefferson T. Burke for the gift of the Bible formerly in the possession of George Wythe, and by him given to Thomas Jefferson; and also for the gift of the two copies of the New Testament from which Thomas Jefferson clipped the portions used by him in preparing his compilation known as "The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth."

Resolved: That the Rector and Visitors of the University accept with thanks a membership for the University of Virginia in the "Monticello Graveyard Association," and hereby elect the President of the University as such member;

Resolved: That the Rector and Visitors agree to contribute annually to said graveyard association, such sum as shall be agreed upon by the officers of said association, and the said President of the University.

The Peoples National Bank, through its cashier, Mr. W. W. Waddell, made application to this Board for a part of the University bank account, whereupon the following was adopted;-

Resolved: That the deposits of this University be divided approximately equally between the Jefferson National Bank and the Peoples National Bank, upon the same terms and conditions as those now in force with the present University depository.

Resolved: That a residence be erected for the use of the Dean of the University at a cost not to exceed $10,000.00, upon some suitable location upon the University Grounds, that amount of the funds of the University now invested in a low rate of interest bearing securities, or funds now uninvested to be invested in said residence. The details of said erection to be left to the Grounds and Building Committee, and the Finance Committee of this Board is directed to provide the necessary funds.

Whereas, it was necessary to reduce the size of certain rooms in the Dawon's Row dormitories, in order to provide a closet for each house, one room in each of the following houses being reduced thereby; viz:, A,B,C,E, & F; and

Whereas, these changes were made without the knowledge of certain of the boys now occupying said rooms, said boys having signed up for these rooms without knowledge of the proposed changes, therefore be it

Resolved, That the Bursar is authorized to refund to each such boy the sum of $5.00 for the session of 1912-1913; but the rental of said rooms for subsequent sessions shall be the same as for other rooms in said buildings.

Resolved: That Miss Julia Tutwiler's request to be allowed to have a plaster cast made of the bust of her father in the University Library, be granted, subject to the condition that the cast is made by a person approved by the artist Valentine, and that all due precautions be taken not to injure the bust.

Whereas, it has been stated to this Board that there stands on the books of the University a debit balance against the late Jas. B. Green, in the amount of $415.77, and

Whereas, it has come to the knowledge of this Board that said Jas. B. Green died, leaving no estate, therefore be it

Resolved: That the said sum be charged off the books to Surplus Account, and the Bursar is hereby authorized to make the necessary entries.

Resolved: That Mrs. Clara T. Green be granted the privilege of renting the cottage now occupied by her, for another year, from July 1, 1913 to July 1, 1914 at the same rental.

Resolved: That the request of Mr. I. K. Moran for reimbursement to amount of $71.50, on account of installation of certain permanent fixtures in house occupied by him, be and is hereby granted.

Resolved: That a sum not to exceed $50.00 be and is hereby appropriated to reimburse Dr. J. M. Page for expenses incurred by him in attendance upon a convention of the Phi Beta Kappa in New York City.

Mr. Craddock, Chairman of the Finance Committee, brought to the attention of the Board the several requests from fraternities for loans in order to erect Chapter Houses on the property of the University, and stated that at a meeting of the Committee recently held in Richmond, it was decided that no more loans for this purpose could be made at this time, and offered the following, being adopted,

Resolved: That the condition of the funds will not justify further loans for fraternity houses for the present, and that the applicants be informed of this resolution.

Dr. Page brought to the attention of the Board the fact that certain of the students, occupying University dormitories, who had received their rooms at a reduced price by reason of boarding at the "Commons," had failed to attend the "Commons" for the whole time. Messrs. Aiken and Jett representing those students who had left the "Commons" appeared before the Board asking that the said students be released from any further obligation to the University for that portion of the room rentdue on account of not so boarding, their contention being based on poor quality of food. Prof. Lile, who had been requested by the Dean to give his opinion in the matter, sent to the Board an opinion in the matter, setting forth that the said students were liable f the balance of the room rent. After a general discussion of the matter the following resolution was unanimously adopted,—;

Resolved: That no deduction be made from the rent of rooms occupied by members of the "Commons" who left during the session.

The following report of the Building Committee was presented:—;

I. We recommend that the sites on Carr's Hill for fraternity houses, be at present restricted to four, and that the northernmost site be located on a line passing through the centre of the president's residence and the centre of the president's stable, and at least as far distant from the president's house as is the location of the "Delta Tau Delta" house.

II. We further recommend that no trees be cut without permission of a Committee appointed to accurately locate these sites.

III. That the earth from the excavations for these fraternity buildings be deposited in the new road under the direction of the Superintendent of Grounds.

In view of the above report it was

Resolved: That the following committee be appointed to carry out the recommendations of the report,

Committee: President Alderman,

Committee: Mr. Michie,

Committee: Dr. Lambeth,

The following report was presented,—;

Prof. Newcomb who is planning the plants for the sewage purification, as directed by the State Board of Health, indicates that we will have to acquire land to furnish a sufficient fall to carry off the effluent from the filter beds.

It is therefore recommended that the Board appoint a Committee to secure options on property that seems to be required, or take condemnation proceedings, if necessary.

In view of the above report, it was

Resolved: That the following committee be appointed to carry out the recommendations of the report, the President, Mr. Michie, and Dr. Lambeth.

Resolved: That the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, in annual meeting assembled, send heartiest greetings and sincerest congratulations to President Edwin A. Alderman, upon the good news of his restored health and strength, and their best wishes for his early and entire recovery.

They desire also to express to him their realization,—; so keenly brought home to them by his recent absence from their gatherings, as nothing else perhaps might have brought it,—;of the significance and value of his wise counsel and vigorous guidance in all their deliberations; and to rejoice with him both for his returning health and for the pleasing prospect of again having his active cooperation and leadership.

It is the wish of the Board that he be assured of the warm personal regard of each individual member, and of the hearty concurrence of each in this message of friendship, felicitation and good cheer.

Resolved: That this resolution be communicated to President Alderman by the Rector of the University.

The report of the Superintendent, Dr. Wm. A. Lambeth, concerning recommendations of the Faculty with reference to the day current, (electric) was tabled till the June meeting.

It appearing to the Board that the annual meeting of the Trustees of the University of Virginia Endowment Fund was not held on yesterday, the day preceeding the annual meeting of this Board, and it further appearing that by the provision of the third section of the deed of trust constituting said trustees of the said endowment fund, that in the event the "Alumni Board of Trustees of the University of Virginia Endowment Fund should fail to hold its meeting on the day preceding that fixed by the Board of Visitors to determine the expenditures for the succeeding year, it shall pay over all of the said annual income for said year to the Bursar to be expended as this Board may direct," and it further appearing to this Board from the report of Eppa Hunton, Jr., prepared for submission to the annual meeting of the said Trustees that there will be available from the several funds constituting said Endowment Fund for the present fiscal year as follows:

Resolved: That the said Eppa Hunton, Jr., Treasurer of the said Alumni Board of Trustees of the University of Virginia Endowment Fund, be requested to pay over the said income quarterly as the same shall be collected by him to the Bursar of the University of Virginia, and the said Bursar is hereby directed, upon the receipt of the said sums from the said Eppa Hunton, Jr., Treasurer, to execute to him a due and proper voucher for such payments, to be expended as follows:

On motion the Board adjourned to meet in annual session, Monday, June 16th, 1913.

After the annual report of the Department of Engineering had been made and forwarded to the President, it was learned that Mr. J. S. Lapham, a graduate of this University in Mechanical Engineering, desired an appointment on our teaching staff.

At the annual meeting of the Board of Visitors, called for the consideration of the Financial Budget for 1913-1914.

Present: The Rector, Visitors Craddock, Flood, Norton, White, Irvine, Drewry, Michie, Oliver, State Superintendent Stearnes, and Acting President, Dean James M. Page.

The Rector having called the Board to order at 10:30 o'clock, the newly appointed member, (to fill vacancy caused by resignation of Dr. W. M. Randolph), Mr. George R. B. Michie, appeared, and being duly qualified, was accordingly recognized as a member of this Board.

Report of Committee on Entrance Building

At a meeting of the Committee on Entrance Building at 8:00 P.M., May 9th, 1913, there were present Messrs. Lambeth, Michie, Newcomb, Smith, Forrest. The following was moved by Mr. Newcomb, seconded and carried:-

Resolved that it be the sense of this Committee that the contract for the construction of the Entrance Building for the University be and is herewith awarded to Vandegrift and Fitch, the lowest competitive bidders, subject to the approval by the Rector and Visitors of the University of our resolution asking for $5,000.00 increased loan.

The following was presented by Mr. Forrest and moved and seconded by Mr. Smith and Mr. Michie, and adopted for presentation at next meeting of the Board, together with the preceeding resolution for their information:-

To the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia.

Your Committee on Improvements at the University entrance beg to report that in harmony with your instructions they secured bids on completed plans and specifications for the building approved by you at your meeting February 10, 1913.

The lowest bid, even after making all such changes in the plans as can reduce the cost without injuring the building in appearance, structure or rent-yielding power, shows that the building alone, with the architect's fees, will cost nearly $20,000.00. Your provision for the building being only $15,000.00, it has impossible to sign the contract and proceed with the work.

We therefore ask that you provide a further sum of $5,000.00 making a total of $25,000. for the building and outside improvements, interest upon which at the rate of six per cent per year shall be deducted by the Bursar from the gross revenues of the building paid into his hands. In our judgement the rents will easily care for this annual charge of $1,500.00 and leave a handsome surplus. We also believe it would be a mistake to reduce the size of the building, and that if reduced it would not carry an interest charge of $1,200.00 as safely as the proposed building will carry, $1,500.00.

After the annual report of the Department of Engineering had been made and forwarded to the President, it was learned that Mr. J. S. Lapham, a graduate of this University in Mechanical Engineering, desired an appointment on our teaching staff. Mr. Lapham is a young man of unusual ability; and, if his application had been received earlier, he would undoubtedly have been engaged. It is not often that any school has the opportunity of securing the services of a man so eminently fitted by capacity, training, and character to make a useful and accomplished University teacher.

This appropriation will be for the one year only, after 1913-1914, we shall be able to arrange our teaching force so that Mr. Lapham will receive one of the regular appointments.

I desire therefore to recommend that for the session 1913-1914, Mr. J. S. Lapham be appointed, assistant instructor in Applied Mechanics at a salary of $500.
