SUBJECT TO THE

APPROVAL OF THE

BOARD OF VISITORS

June 10-11, 2010

The Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia met in Open Session, at 1:05 p.m., on Thursday, June 10, 2010, in the Board Room of the Rotunda, John O. Wynne, Rector, presided.

Present were Daniel R. Abramson, Stewart H. Ackerly, A. Macdonald Caputo, The Honorable Alan A. Diamonstein, Ms. Susan Y. Dorsey, Ms. Helen E. Dragas, W. Heywood Fralin, Robert D. Hardie, Ms. Glynn D. Key, Austin Ligon, Vincent J. Mastracco Jr., The Honorable Lewis F. Payne, Don R. Pippin, Warren M. Thompson, and E. Darracott Vaughan Jr., M.D. Absent was Randal J. Kirk.

In addition to the Board, also present were John T. Casteen III,

Ms. Teresa A. Sullivan, Leonard W. Sandridge, Ms. Susan G. Harris, Paul J. Forch, Arthur Garson Jr., M.D., Ms. Susan A. Carkeek, James L. Hilton, R. Edward Howell, Ms. Patricia M. Lampkin, Marcus L. Martin, M.D., Ms. Yoke San L. Reynolds, Thomas C. Skalak, Robert D. Sweeney, David J. Prior, and Ms. Jeanne Flippo Bailes.

The Rector opened the meeting by welcoming Ms. Teresa Sullivan, president-elect, and Mr. Stewart Ackerly, Student Member of the Board of Visitors.

The Rector called on Mr. Pippin to lead the Pledge of Allegiance.

Approval of the Minutes of the Board Meetings on February 25-26, 2010 and April 15, 2010

On motion, the Minutes of the Board meetings on February 25 and 26, 2010, and April 15, 2010, were approved.

The Rector said he was sorry to see Dr. Vaughan leaving the Board, but he was pleased that he has agreed to serve for two years as a public member of the Medical Center Operating Board, which he was instrumental in developing as its first chair. He asked for a motion to approve a resolution appointing Dr. Vaughan, which was made, seconded, and approved.

Appointment of E. Darracott Vaughan Jr., M.D., to the Medical Center Operating Board

RESOLVED, E. Darracott Vaughan Jr., M.D., is appointed to the Medical Center Operating Board as a public member for the period July 1, 2010, through June 30, 2012.

The Rector called on Mr. Sandridge to explain the proposed revisions to the Pavilion assignment policy. Mr. Sandridge said the administration recommends that the board take over assigning two residences in addition to the Lawn Pavilions and Montebello: Weedon House, and Sunnyside.

Weedon House was recently acquired from the UVA Foundation after they completed extensive renovations. The house sits at the end of Sprigg Lane adjacent to the international residential college, the University Press, and near the Alumni Association. Originally it was intended as a suitable place for the president while Carr’s Hill underwent renovations, but that has not been necessary. Weedon House is empty and should be occupied. The logical assignment process is to add it to the Board’s assignments, because it is similarly situated to Montebello—close to central grounds and a very nice residence.

Sunnyside is located off Barracks Road very close to the North Grounds. It has been owned by the university since 1963, but recently underwent extensive renovations. The policy revisions give the board authority to assign Sunnyside, but with different criteria because it is not close to central grounds. Preference is to faculty in the schools of Law and Business as well as all deans and vice presidents.

These changes do not change in any way the process for assigning Lawn Pavilions.

On motion, the Board approved the following resolution. The revised policy follows the resolution.

ASSIGNMENT OF PAVILIONS ON THE LAWN; WEEDON HOUSE; MONTEBELLO; AND SUNNYSIDE

RESOLVED, the Board approves the revisions dated June 10, 2010 to the Policy on the Assignment of Pavilions on the Lawn and Montebello, to add Weedon House and Sunnyside as residences assigned by the Board.

ASSIGNMENT OF PAVILIONS ON THE LAWN; WEEDON HOUSE; MONTEBELLO; AND SUNNYSIDE

Lawn Pavilions, Weedon House, and Montebello

Residence in a Lawn Pavilion, Weedon House, or Montebello is a privilege that entails certain obligations. Residents must have an interest in being true members of Thomas Jefferson’s “Academical Village” in the sense the Founder envisioned, which is to say a community of faculty and students living together and working together. To this end, residents must use their assigned residence as their principal residence and they must be willing to have frequent contact with their student neighbors and to participate fully in the life of the University community. Pavilion residents must participate fully in the life of the Lawn community. Applicants for Pavilions, Weedon House, and Montebello must agree to these conditions before being considered for residence.

Sunnyside

Residence in Sunnyside is available to vice presidents, deans, and full professors with a preference for those teaching at the School of Law or the Darden School of Business. Faculty visiting for a year or more are eligible to apply; however, assignment to Sunnyside may not be used as an inducement in recruiting faculty or administrators to the University. The selection of residents for Sunnyside shall be administered by the committee described in I.b., below.

I. Order of Precedence for Lawn Pavilions (other than

Pavilion VIII apartments), Montebello, and Weedon House

The Board of Visitors for some years has followed an order of precedence, which it devised, in considering tenants for the Pavilions (other than Pavilion VIII apartments) and Montebello. Weedon House was added to the policy in 2010. The spirit of this order of precedence must not be violated if there is to be a fair and equitable assignment procedure. Pavilions, Weedon House, and Montebello or the promise of being assigned one of these residences, under no circumstances shall be used as an inducement in recruiting faculty or administrators to the University nor shall any assignment process be used other than the one approved by the Board and outlined in these procedures.

1.  **Priority shall be accorded the Provost, the Vice President and Chief Student Affairs Officer, and any vice president nominated by the President and agreed to by the Board, and to the academic deans in order of the founding of several schools, followed by the faculty.**

**Specifically, the order shall be as follows:**

1.  **The Vice President and Provost**
2.  **The Vice President and Chief Student Affairs**

**Officer**

1.  **Any vice president nominated by the President and**

**agreed to by the Board**

1.  **The Dean of the College and Graduate School of**

**Arts and Sciences**

1.  **The Dean of the School of Medicine**
2.  **The Dean of the School of Law**
3.  **The Dean of the School of Engineering and Applied**

**Science**

1.  **The Dean of the Curry School of Education**
2.  **The Dean of the McIntire School of Commerce**

4.  **The Dean of the Darden Graduate School of**

**Business Administration**

1.  **The Dean of the School of Nursing**
2.  **The Dean of the Frank Batten School of Leadership**

**and Public Policy.**

1.  **Following the assignment of Pavilions to those**

**identified in I.a., above, remaining assignments shall be recommended to the Board by a committee consisting of the Secretary to the Board of Visitors, the chair of the Faculty Senate, and the holder(s)of the Gray-Carrington Award. The Secretary to the Board shall serve as the chair of the committee. The committee shall submit its recommendations to the Board for approval.**

**The committee will advertise vacancies among the faculty through the academic deans’ offices and the Faculty Senate.**

1.  **All applicants will complete an application form issued**

**by the committee.**

1.  **Qualifications for the assignment of residences**

**shall include:**

*   1.  **Assignees, other than eligible vice presidents and**

**deans, shall hold the rank of full professor, and**

**shall have demonstrated excellence in teaching and**

**in interaction with students.**

*   1.  **The following full professors are not eligible for assignment to residences:**
        1.  **Part-time professors**
        2.  **Professors who have entered into retirement contracts with the University.**

II. Assignment of Pavilion VIII Apartments

**Junior faculty shall be encouraged to apply for the two**

**Pavilion VIII apartments. The process for selecting**

**tenants for these apartments was devised by the Provost’s Office and shall be administered by the committee described in I.b. As with other Pavilion residents, applicants for the apartments must be willing to have frequent interaction with their student**

**neighbors and to participate fully in the life of the Lawn.**

III. Lease Terms

**Leases of the Pavilions, including the Pavilion VIII**

**apartments, Weedon House, Sunnyside, and Montebello, shall be for five years. The five year leases for the Pavilion VIII apartments will not be renewable, but leases for the other residences may be renewed for a second five year term upon approval by the Executive Committee of the Board. No tenant shall live in a Pavilion, Weedon House, Sunnyside, or Montebello for more than ten years.**

**Pavilion, Weedon House, Sunnyside, and Montebello tenants who resign from the University shall vacate the premises within 30 days of the date of resignation. Retiring faculty must vacate the premises by June 30th of the year of retirement. Vice presidents and deans who leave their administrative positions but remain at the University shall vacate the premises no later than 120 days after leaving the administrative position. The family of a tenant who dies during an academic year may occupy the residence until the following summer term, or at some other date approved in consideration of the relict family's circumstances.**

A prospective occupant’s willingness to assign space in

**a Pavilion for classes or seminars will be considered an**

**additional qualification. In Pavilion V, however, space for classes was designed when the building was restored and classes will be conducted there. The scheduling of these classes will be done by the Registrar in consultation with the Pavilion occupant, but the classroom will be used according to a regular schedule.**

**Leases for all residences under this Policy shall conform to a standard devised by the Housing Division and the Office of the General Counsel, in consultation with the committee described in I.b.**

Resolution for Additions to the Agenda

On motion, the Board adopted the following resolution approving the consideration of addenda to the published Agenda of the meeting:

RESOLVED, the consideration of addenda to the published Agenda of this meeting of the Board of Visitors is approved.

Comments by the Rector

The Rector said this year’s Board retreat will be in Virginia Beach on July 9th, and 10th. He explained the plan for the retreat days and said the agenda will be sent to Board Members soon. He said he is pleased that Ms. Sullivan will participate in the retreat.

The Rector congratulated John Casteen on an extraordinarily thoughtful and pertinent speech at final exercises. He said it was magnificent.

President’s Report

President Casteen said he was grateful to the Board and to members of prior Boards who have given him advice and friendship over the past twenty years.

The President welcomed Ms. Sullivan and her family to Carr’s Hill. He said he thought they would be moved out and the house would be available by mid-July.

Mr. Casteen spoke about the work of the Windsor Group and Reunions giving. He said total Reunions gifts were close to $17 million this year. Gifts may be made through June 30, and so there may be additional funds. This same group of classes gave $14.8 million at their last reunion in 2005, and so the classes’ giving has increased. He then turned to the gifts and grants report.

On motion, the Finance Committee adopted the following resolutions and recommended them to the Executive Committee:

APPROVAL OF PROPOSED INCREASE IN FACULTY AND STAFF HOUSING RATES

FOR 2010-2011

RESOLVED, the faculty and staff housing rates are approved as indicated, effective July 1, 2010. The Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, or his/her designee, is authorized to increase the rates to market level when a property is vacated during the year.

**APPROVAL OF PROPERTY RESTRICTIONS FOR THE LIFE SCIENCES ANNEX OF THE SHERIDAN G. SNYDER TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH BUILDING**

**RESOLVED, the 2,100 square feet of laboratory space in Molecular Electron Microscopy Core Facility suite in the Life Sciences Annex of the Sheridan G. Snyder Translational Research Building located at the Fontaine Research Park and renovated with funds from the National Center for Research Resources (NCRR) of the National Institutes of Health is subject to the following restrictions: for a period of ten (10) years from the date of its beneficial occupancy, the property shall not be (1) used for any purpose inconsistent with that authorized by the grant program statute and applicable regulations,(2) mortgaged or otherwise used as collateral without the written permission of the NCRR, or (3) sold or transferred to another party without the written permission of the NCRR; and**

**RESOLVED FURTHER, the Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of the University is authorized to execute and record documentation which evidences these property restrictions.**

*   **\- - - - - - - - -**

**Action Items**

Mr. Sandridge presented the project budget review of the South Chiller Plant Addition for approval. On motion, the following resolution was adopted by the Finance Committee and recommended to the Executive Committee:

APPROVAL OF PROJECT BUDGET REVIEW, SOUTH CHILLER PLANT ADDITION

RESOLVED, an increase to the South Chiller Plant Addition project of $12,700,000, bringing the total project budget to $35,200,000, is approved, contingent on the review and approval of the Buildings and Grounds Committee.

*   **\- - - - - - - - -**

Tuition and Fees

Mr. Sandridge introduced Ms. Melody Bianchetto, Assistant Vice President for Budget and Financial Planning, to review state reductions and the impact on tuition and fees.

Ms. Bianchetto said the state supplement per in-state student has dropped from $12,000 ten years ago to $8,500 last year. Access UVA’s cost is now $80 million from all sources and the University expects the needs of students to increase. For these reasons and others, the University proposes a 9.9% increase in in-state undergraduate tuition and fees and a 6.0% increase in out-of-state undergraduate tuition and fees. Graduate student tuition and fees would increase by 9.8% for in-state and 5.5% for out-of-state students.

Ms. Bianchetto reviewed increases for the College at Wise and Graduate Business, Law, and Medicine. Mr. Fralin commented that if the introduced budget is sustained by the General Assembly, the cuts next year will be much larger.

On motion, the following resolution was approved by the Finance Committee and recommended to the Executive Committee of the Board of Visitors:

APPROVAL OF INCREASE IN TUITION, REQUIRED FEES, AND OTHER CHARGES FOR THE ACADEMIC DIVISION
