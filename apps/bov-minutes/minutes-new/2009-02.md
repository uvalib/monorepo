The Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia met, in Open Session, at 1:10 p.m., Thursday, February 5, 2009, in the Board Room of the Rotunda; W. Heywood Fralin, Rector, presided.

Daniel R. Abramson, A. Macdonald Caputo, The Hon. Alan A. Diamonstein, Ms. Susan Y. Dorsey, Ms. Helen E. Dragas, Thomas F. Farrell, II, Robert D. Hardie, Austin Ligon, Vincent J. Mastracco, Jr., The Hon. Lewis F. Payne, Warren M. Thompson, E. Darracott Vaughan, Jr., M.D., John O. Wynne, and Ms. Adom Getachew were present.

Also present were Edmund W. Kitch, Chair of the Faculty Senate, and Ms. Elaine Gall, University Building Official.

The Rector asked Mr. Caputo to lead the Board in the Pledge of Allegiance. After the Pledge was recited, the Rector asked the Board to observe a moment of silence in memory of Mrs. Elsie Goodwyn Holland (a former Member of the Board of Visitors), Mr. Gilbert J. Sullivan (for many years the Director of the Alumni Association), and Mr. John A. Blackburn (Dean of Undergraduate Admission) – all recently deceased.

Approval of the Minutes of the Board Meetings of October 2-4, 2008

The Minutes of the Board meeting of October 2-4, were approved.

Resolution for Additions to the Agenda

RESOLVED, the consideration of addenda to the published Agenda of this meeting of the Board of Visitors is approved.

University Building Official

At the Rector’s request, Mr. Sandridge, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, introduced Ms. Elaine Gall, the University Building Official. He reminded the Board that the position and Ms. Gall’s responsibilities are defined in the Management Agreement between the Commonwealth and the University, and he emphasized that Ms. Gall reports directly and exclusively to the Board and not to the administration of the University.

Approval of the University of Virginia Hazard Mitigation Plan

Mr. Sandridge told the Board that the University is required, both by the federal authorities and by the Commonwealth, to have a Hazard Mitigation Plan. Such a Plan has been devised, but it now must be approved by the Board. He proposed the following resolution which the Board, on motion, adopted:

APPROVAL OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN

WHEREAS, the University of Virginia strives to recognize and mitigate any potential natural and human-caused hazards to the health, safety, and well-being of members of the University community; and

WHEREAS, the Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 as amended, and 44 C.F.R. 201.6, require that local governments develop and adopt hazard mitigation plans in order to receive certain federal assistance; and

WHEREAS, as a sub-grantee of the Virginia Department of Emergency Management, the University of Virginia Disaster Resistant University Advisory Committee together with an experienced consulting firm, and in consultation with members of the public, private, and non-profit sectors has completed such a Hazard Mitigation Plan for the University;

RESOLVED, the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia approves the University of Virginia Hazard Mitigation Plan dated November 2008.

Comments by the Rector

The Rector reported that Mr. Sweeney, the Senior Vice President for Development and Public Affairs, has undergone several very serious operations in the last week but is recovering well and should be released from the hospital shortly.

President’s Report

The Rector asked the President to make his customary report.

The President briefed the Board on matters of interest before the General Assembly in the current Session. He said debates about in-state enrollment have been particularly intense this year and

that many of the “facts” asserted about enrollments at this Session have been patently wrong.

Several bills to regulate out-of-state enrollment were introduced, but the University has just learned that they will not be heard by the relevant subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee. The Budget bill now becomes the vehicle for this issue, the President said, but the University is working with members of the General Assembly who are engaged with this question.

New Appointments

The President spoke about Harry Harding, who was announced last week as the founding dean of the new Batten School for Leadership and Public; Mr. Harding will begin his term as dean on July 1st. One of the nation’s foremost experts on Southeast Asia, particularly China, he has served for ten years as the dean of the Elliott School of International Affairs at George Washington University. Before that he was a Senior Fellow in the Foreign Policy Studies Program at the Brookings Institution, a member of the political science faculties of Stanford University and Swarthmore College, and director of the Asia Program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.

Greg Roberts, who has been Senior Associate Dean of Undergraduate Admission since 2008, has just been named Dean, _vice_ the late John A. Blackburn. Mr. Roberts joined the Admission Office in 2003 as an associate dean. Prior to that, he was Associate Director of Undergraduate Admission at Georgetown University.

The President also reported that Bruce Ambler Boucher has been named as the new Director of the University Art Museum. Mr. Boucher has been curator of European sculpture at the Art Institute of Chicago while teaching at the University of Chicago. Previously, he was an art history professor at University College, London, for 24 years.

AAU-AGB Meeting

The President announced that presidents, chancellors, and trustees from several AAU (Association of American Universities)Institutions will be at the University February 26-27 for an AAU-AGB (Association of Governing Boards) meeting. Participants will include representatives of the Universities of Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Minnesota and Rochester, as well as the University of California at Los Angeles and Pennsylvania State University.

The meeting, organized under the theme “Crossroads: Leading and Governing America’s Research Universities,” is envisioned as a candid discussion of university leadership and governance issues. The President said the Vice Rector and Mr. Ligon – in the absence of the Rector, who cannot come, will participate in the meeting. He invited other Members to participate.

Gifts and Grants Report

The President reported that philanthropic giving to the University and its related foundations in the current Fiscal Year, through December 31, 2008, amounted to $156,359,398.40, an increase of 11.18% over the previous Fiscal Year. Much of this, he said, was received toward the end of the year.

Among significant gifts since the October Board meeting were a Batten Foundation pledge payment of $40,000,000 to the Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy; a Gates Foundation private grant of $6,820,437 to the School of Medicine for its “Study of Risk Factors for Malnutrition using Molecular and Genomic Tools;” a pledge payment and gifts of $6,738,955 from Paul Tudor Jones II and Mrs. Sonia Klein Jones toward several areas of the University including the John Paul Jones Arena, Jefferson Scholars, and Environmental Sciences; $4,740,000 from the Estate of Gertrude S. Greenslade to the College and Graduate School of Arts and Sciences; and a private grant of $2,113,551 from the Lilly Endowment to the Religious Studies Department for “The Project on Lived Theology.”

Among significant new pledges were $3,100,000 from the Focused Ultrasound Surgery Foundation for the Focused Ultrasound Facility Fund; $1,000,000 from Frederick P. Hitz and Mrs. Mary Buford Bocock Hitz for the Batten School of Leadership; a pledge of $500,000 from the Hobby Family Foundation for the John A. Blackburn AccessUVa Endowed Scholarship and other areas of the University; and a $500,000 pledge from Paul Tudor Jones II for Jefferson Scholars.

The Rector asked for a motion approving the President’s Gifts and Grants Report. The motion was made and approved and the Report accepted.

The Preliminary Meeting ended at 1:45 p.m., and the Board recessed as the full Board to go into Committee meetings.

Friday, February 6th

The Board resumed meeting as the full Board after lunch on Friday, February 6th.

Executive Session

After adopting the following motions permitting it to do so – under the terms of the Virginia Freedom of Information Act – the Board went into Executive Session at 1:15 p.m.

All Members of the Board, save Mr. Pippin, were present.

That the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia convene in Closed Session for the purpose of discussing and/or approving personnel actions involving the appointment, reappointment, transition, nomination, evaluation, performance, compensation, and resignation of specific University officers and employees as provided for in Section 2.2-3711 (A) (1) of the Code of Virginia.

That the Board of Visitors convene in Closed Session to consult

with General Counsel regarding his privileged legal report to the Board

on pending and anticipated litigation affecting the University, as

provided for in Section 2.2-3711 (A) (7) of the Code of Virginia.

#### That the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia convene in Executive Session to consider the appointment of a specific student member to the Board of Visitors, in accordance with Section 2.2-3711 (A)(1) of the Code of Virginia.

That the Board of Visitors go into Closed Session to consider and discuss investing in new educational modules where competition is involved and in connection therewith assessing the performance and leadership capability of specific University personnel, where discussion in public session at this time would be detrimental to the University’s financial interests, as permitted by Section 2.2-3711 (A) (1) and (6) of the Code of Virginia.

The Board resumed its meeting in Open Session at 2:35 p.m., and adopted the following resolution certifying that its deliberations in Executive Session had been conducted in accordance with the exemptions permitted by the Virginia Freedom of Information Act:

That we vote on and record our certification that, to the best of each Board member’s knowledge, only public business matters lawfully exempted from open meeting requirements and which were identified in the motion(s) authorizing the closed session, were heard, discussed or considered in closed session.

Report of the Diamonstein Committee: On the Election of the Rector

The Rector reminded the Board that at the April Board meeting, he had appointed an ad-hoc committee, chaired by Mr. Diamonstein, to consider possible changes in the procedure for electing the Vice Rector, and thus the Rector. He asked Mr. Diamonstein to report on the Committee’s recommendations.

Mr. Diamonstein said his Committee had polled the Board and based on that, have decided to recommend no changes, either in the electoral process or in the terms of office of the Rector and the Vice Rector. The Committee, however, does feel strongly that there should be no electioneering on the part of candidates more than thirty days before the election meeting.

Report of the Diamonstein Committee: On the Recognition of Former Members of the Board

The second charge to the Diamonstein Committee, the Rector said, was to find a suitable occasion on which former Board Members might be invited to return to the University to be honored by the Board (the provision of the Manual calling for an annual social occasion involving current and former Members has been struck from the Manual). Mr. Diamonstein told the Board that his Committee recommends that an occasion such as an athletic event be used for this purpose. He and the Rector suggested that the Secretary and the Secretary-elect consider possibilities and make a recommendation to the Board.

The Rector accepted the Committee’s recommendations.

All Members, save Mr. Pippin and Dr. Vaughan, were present for the Final Session.

The Board approved the following resolutions:

**This procedure is intended to provide the College with a fair and efficient means of resolving certain complaints brought by Administrative and Professional General Faculty with respect to their employment.(\*see below).**

**A. Complaints Covered by Phases I, II, and III:**

**This procedure has three phases. Phase I consists of two levels of review. Complaints qualifying for Phase I may qualify for further review, utilizing either Further Investigation Phase II or the Hearing Phase III, but not both unless authorized by the Chancellor.**

1\. Phase I

  
a. Complaint of Illegal Discrimination — a complaint made by the faculty member alleging discrimination because of his or her race, color, sexual orientation, gender, religion, political affiliation, age, handicap, national origin or veteran's status, or harassment on the basis of any of the foregoing.

b. Complaint of Disciplinary Action — a complaint of unwarranted disciplinary action in his or her employment.

c. Complaint of Breach of Employment Contract.

d. Complaint of Reprisal — a complaint of acts of reprisal as a result of using this procedure or being a witness for another complainant using this procedure or for reporting improper conduct to appropriate College officers or public officials.

1

2\. Phase II

**  
Complaints qualifying for Phase II review are those which the Chancellor or his or her designee decides, as described below, should be investigated further.  
  
3\. Phase III**

**  
Complaints qualifying for the Phase III reviews are those which the Chancellor or his or her designee decides, as described below, should be reviewed through a hearing procedure.**

**B. Extensions of Time Periods**

**1\. Phase I and Qualification Proceedings**

**  
The time periods applicable in Phase I and the qualification proceedings under Section III may be extended by written agreement of the complainant and the relevant College official involved in a particular step, or by the Chancellor or his or her designee upon a written determination that good cause exists for the extension.  
  
2\. Phase II**

**The time periods applicable in Phase II review may be extended by written agreement of the complainant, the appropriate management representative and the investigator, or by the Chancellor or his or her designee upon a written determination that good cause exists for the extension.  
  
3\. Phase III**

**  
The time periods applicable in the Phase III may be extended by written agreement of the parties and the panel, or by the Chancellor or his designee upon a written determination that good cause exists for the extension.**

**2**

**C. Noncompliance Issues  
**

**Any issues relating to noncompliance with these procedures shall be promptly presented to the Chancellor for resolution.**

**D. Delegation by the Chancellor  
**

**If the Chancellor deems it appropriate, he or she may delegate some or all of the Chancellor’s duties under this procedure.**

**E. Alternates  
**

**In the following cases the Chancellor may designate, at the complainant's timely request, in writing, to the Chancellor or on the Chancellor’s own motion independent of any such request, an alternate to perform the role of one or more persons under this procedure:**

1.  **A complaint directed at a person discharging any official duty on behalf of the College under this procedure who also immediately supervises the complainant;**

**2\. A complaint directed at a person who would be a reviewer under this procedure;**

**3\. A complaint against the Chancellor.**

**F. Attorneys**

**1\. Other than for the Panel:**

**  
Attorneys or other advisors representing the parties may be present during any hearing or meeting called for by this procedure, so long as such presence is not disruptive. However, the attorney or advisor may not participate in the proceedings or speak for or on behalf of the party represented.**

**3**

**2\. For the Panel:**

**  
A hearing panel may have counsel present at any time. The panel's counsel shall not question witnesses and shall be available to the panel to provide such legal advice as may be requested or advisable, however any factual findings are and shall be the prerogative of the panel. Counsel for the panel as may be needed shall be provided by the University’s Office of General Counsel or Office of the Attorney General; provided any lawyer who may have provided legal advice to management concerning the grievance or the matter on which it is based shall not serve as counsel to the hearing panel.**

#### II. Phase I Review Procedures

**A. Standard First Level of Phase I Review**

**1\. Bring complaint to Director of Human Resources. Complainants are encouraged to discuss their grievances in person with those able to resolve them before the procedure described in this document is initiated. If the complainants are not comfortable discussing their grievances directly with each other, they can request the assistance of a third party mediator to informally discuss their grievances in an effort to resolve them before the procedure described in this document is initiated. The mediator can be assigned by the Director of Human Resources or the Chancellor. This procedure is not intended as a substitute for such discussions, but rather as an additional means of resolving disputes.**

**2\. If the dispute cannot be resolved through informal discussion, the complainant must initiate a review by providing their immediate supervisor, within ten calendar days of the event which is the basis for the complaint, a written statement describing both the nature of the complaint and the relief requested. Failure to timely provide the written statement shall preclude proceeding under this grievance procedure unless the Chancellor may rule otherwise finding good cause to proceed and that the failure to timely**

**4**

**provide the written statement is not attributable to the fault of the complainant. The complainant and the supervisor should attempt to resolve the complaint informally during the supervisor’s following five workdays.  
**

**3\. Within ten workdays after receipt of the complainant’s written statement, the complainant's immediate supervisor shall provide to the complainant a written response to the statement. The response shall state the supervisor's decision and the supporting reasons.**

**B. Anonymous First Level Review Option**

1.  **For complaints of harassment or discrimination, instead of proceeding as stated in above, the complainant may initiate this Anonymous Review within ten calendar days after the event which is the basis for the complaint. The complainant must request in writing, that the Chancellor review the complaint directly. The Chancellor may designate an appropriate individual to conduct the review who shall not be the immediate supervisor of the complainant or otherwise the subject of the complaint. The anonymity of the complainant shall be respected to the extent practicable except as may be required by law or necessary in connection with the investigation.**
2.  **The designate shall take such steps as the designate and the complainant deem appropriate to attempt to resolve the complaint without the need for disciplinary action or further use of this procedure.**

**3\. The complainant may terminate the Anonymous Review at any time upon informing the designate in writing or by initiating a complaint as described in Section II.A in a timely manner.**

**C. Second Level of Phase I Review**

**1\. If the immediate supervisor's response from the First Level Review does not resolve the complaint to the complainant's satisfaction, the complainant may advance the complaint to the Second Level Review.**

**5**

**Within five days of receipt of the immediate supervisor's response, a written statement describing the complaint and the relief requested must be submitted to the Director of Human Resources, with copy to the immediate supervisor and the head of the department (or appropriate vice chancellor as provided in the next paragraph.)  
  
2\. A Second Level reviewer shall be the head of the complainant's department or, if the head was the First Level reviewer, the appropriate vice chancellor or other person reporting to the Chancellor or, if such person was the First Level reviewer, the Chancellor or his or her designee.  
  
3\. The Second Level reviewer shall schedule a meeting with the complainant to be held within five workdays (of the Second Level reviewer) after receipt of the complainant's statement. The Second Level reviewer shall also gather such additional information concerning the complaint as he or she deems appropriate.  
  
4\. Within ten workdays after meeting with the complainant, the Second Level reviewer shall provide the complainant a written response to the complaint, with a copy to the Chancellor. The response shall state the reviewer's decision and the supporting reasons.**

#### III. Request for Further Investigation Phase II or Hearing Phase III Reviews

1.  **Further Investigation Phase II**

**1\. If the Second Level reviewer's response does not resolve the complaint to the complainant's satisfaction, the complainant may request the Chancellor to qualify the complaint either for Further Investigation Phase II or Hearing Phase III. Such a request must be submitted to the Chancellor in writing, with a copy to the First and Second Level reviewers, within ten calendar days after the complainant's receipt of the Second Level reviewer's**

**6**

**response. The request to the Chancellor must be timely as above provided and include the complainant's statement of the complaint, the relief requested, the facts the complainant claims support the complaint, and an explanation of why the complainant believes the complaint should be reviewed by a Further Investigation Phase II or Hearing Phase III review. Failure to comply with the foregoing shall preclude further proceedings hereunder, unless the Chancellor directs otherwise for good cause.**

**Within ten workdays after receipt of the complainant's statement, the Chancellor shall normally provide to the complainant a written decision (with copies to the first and second step reviewers) on whether the complaint qualifies for Further Investigation Phase II or Hearing Phase III. If the complaint does not qualify for either Further Investigation or Hearing Phases, processing of the complaint under this procedure is terminated. The decision shall include a brief statement of the Chancellor's reasoning.**

1.  **If Further Investigation Phase II is ordered, the Chancellor shall designate an investigator, who shall not be under the authority of the previous reviewers or report to the immediate supervisor.  
    **

**B. Hearing Phase III Review**

**1\. A Hearing Phase III Review shall be ordered if the Chancellor determines after consultation with counsel that a procedural due process hearing is legally required or would be in the College's best interest.  
  
2\. If a Hearing Phase III is ordered, the Chancellor shall provide a copy of the decision to the chair of the Administrative and Professional General Faculty Hearing Committee and shall include in the decision a determination of which party shall have the burden of proof on which issues. Such decision is not grievable. In the case of disciplinary action against the**

**7**

**complainant, management shall have the burden of proving that its action was a reasonable exercise of discretion.**

#### IV. Further Investigation Phase II Procedures

1.  **Investigation**

**The investigator shall investigate and gather relevant facts by whatever means he or she determines to be most effective and efficient, provided the investigator shall conduct at least one meeting at which the complainant and the appropriate management representative shall be present and afforded an opportunity to respond to each other's presentations concerning the complaint.**

**B. Report**

**As soon as practicable and normally within thirty workdays after the investigator's receipt of the Chancellor's decision qualifying the complaint for Further Investigation Phase II, the investigator shall provide his or her report and recommendations to the Chancellor.**

**If the investigator determines that the evidence qualified the complaint further review, the complainant or management may within five days after receipt of the report provide the Chancellor a written request for review and modification of the report. The Chancellor may at his or her discretion, review the matter and take such action as deemed appropriate. Within ten workdays after receipt of the request for review, the Chancellor shall provide a written response to the complainant and the First and Second Level reviewers.**

**C. Decision  
**

**Within ten workdays after receipt of a copy of the investigator's initial report or within ten workdays after completion of any revised report, the Chancellor shall provide to the complainant a written statement of whether the College will provide the complainant with any relief.**

**8**

**D. Request for Reconsideration  
**

**Within ten workdays after receipt of the Chancellor's statement, the complainant may submit to the Chancellor a written statement requesting the Chancellor to reconsider the decision and describing why the complainant believes the Chancellor's statement is incorrect. The Chancellor shall provide to the complainant a response within ten workdays after receipt of the complainant's request. That response shall be the final step under this procedure.**

**V. Hearing Phase III Procedures**

**A. Selection of Hearing Panel**

**Within ten workdays from the Chancellor’s decision ordering Hearing Phase III, the hearing panel shall be selected. Each vice chancellor shall appoint one General Faculty member from his or her division to serve a two-year term as a member of the Administrative Hearing Panel. In addition, the Chancellor shall appoint a member-at-large and will insure that members terms are staggered the parties of the composition of the panel in writing. The Panel Chair may disclose the names of the parties and the general nature of the complaint to aid prospective members in their decisions as to whether they should serve or decline due to potential bias or conflict.**

**B. Challenges of Panel Members  
**

**Within five calendar days after receipt of the Administrative and Professional General Hearing Relations Committee Chair's written notification of the panel members, either party may petition the Chair to replace one or more of the members for good cause.

The Credentials Committee shall then follow the credentialing procedures set forth in the Credentials Manual including the process related to the information required in an application for initial appointment and the processing of the application. Upon receipt and review of all necessary credentialing documentation, the Credentials Committee shall recommend to the Clinical Staff Executive Committee that such Applicant should either be granted or denied initial privileges in the Medical Center. The Clinical Staff Executive Committee shall then review the Credentials Committee’s recommendation and all applicable documentation. If the Credentials Committee and the Clinical Staff Executive Committee are both in favor of granting privileges to the Applicant, the favorable recommendation shall be forwarded to the MCOB for final action.

6.2 Provisional Appointment Status

Initial appointments and all initially granted Clinical Privileges for Active and Ph.D. Clinical Pathologist Staff shall be provisional for a period of one year. During this provisional period, the individual’s performance and clinical competence shall be observed and evaluated through FPPE and OPPE by the Chair, Division Chief, or Peer designee of the applicable Department. If at the end of the year the Active or Ph.D. Clinical Pathologist Staff satisfies the requirements to become an active Member as more specifically provided in these Bylaws and the Credentials Manual, the provisional status ceases. If at the end of the year the Active or Ph.D. Clinical Pathologist Staff does not satisfy the requirements to become an active Member as required by these Bylaws and the Credentials Manual, then membership in the Clinical Staff and Clinical Privileges for that individual shall cease. Failure to achieve active status from provisional status shall not give rise to the procedural rights, afforded by Article VIII of these Bylaws.

6.3 Procedure for Reappointment

Periodic redetermination of Clinical Privileges for Active and Ph.D. Clinical Staff Members, and the increase or curtailment of same, shall be based upon the reappointment procedures set forth in the Credentials Manual, including deadlines for submission of information and documentation and the forms required thereby. Criteria to be considered at the time of reappointment may include specific information derived from the Department’s direct observation of care provided, information gathered through FPPE and OPPE, review of records of patients treated in this or other medical centers, review of the records of the Departmental Clinical Staff as compared to the records of the particular Member and an appropriate comparison of the performance of the Member with his or her professional colleagues in the Department.

6.4 Active Status

An Active or Ph.D. Clinical Pathologist Staff Member may become an active Member with Clinical Privileges upon the satisfactory conclusion of provisional status as provided in these Bylaws and the Credentials Manual, which appointment shall be for no more than two (2) years at a time and as more specifically provided in the Credentials Manual.

6.5 Change in Qualification

If during the course of any period of appointment, the qualifications of the Member change, or the Department learns of Adverse Action taken by an official licensing or certification body or Medicare or Medicaid, then those changes in qualification or Adverse Action must be reported immediately to the Member's Department Chair and the Credentials Committee who will review the information and determine whether the Member's privileges should be revoked, revised, or suspended. The provisions of Section 7.6 or Article VIII may apply.

6.6 New or Additional Clinical Privileges

Requests for new or additional Clinical Privileges, including those related to the use of new technology or a new procedure, technique or treatment modality, shall be processed only when the Applicant meets the Medical Center approved criteria. In the event there are no approved criteria, the Medical Center shall first determine whether it will allow the new or additional Clinical Privilege, and if so the procedure described in the Credentials Manual or Medical Center policy for new or additional Clinical Privileges shall be followed. Applications for new or additional Clinical Privileges must be in writing and submitted by the Applicant as well as by the appropriate Department Chair. All applications for new or additional Clinical Privileges shall be submitted on a form prescribed by the Credentials Committee upon which the type of Clinical Privileges desired and, among other things, the Member’s relevant recent training and/or experience are set out, together with any other information required by the Credentials Manual or the Credentials Committee. Such applications shall be processed as provided in the Credentials Manual, including the timeline for processing. The Credentials Committee shall determine the conditions and requirements upon which any new or additional Clinical Privileges shall be granted, including but not limited to, how current competence will be demonstrated and any proctoring or other monitoring requirements, and will recommend the requirements to the Clinical Staff Executive Committee for consideration. In turn CSEC shall make appropriate recommendations regarding new or additional Clinical Privileges to the Medical Center Operating Board for final determination. A decision not to approve a new or additional Clinical Privilege to be performed within the Medical Center and/or to be added to the Medical Center privilege list shall not be deemed an Adverse Action or a denial of privileges nor entitle any individual to the hearing rights set forth in Article VIIII of these Bylaws.

6.7 Burden of Producing Information

In connection with all applications for appointment of membership and for Clinical Privileges, the Applicant shall have the burden of producing information for an adequate evaluation of the Applicant’s qualifications and suitability for the Clinical Privileges requested, of resolving any reasonable doubts about these matters, and of satisfying requests for information. This burden may include submission to a medical or psychological examination, at the Applicant’s expense, if deemed appropriate by the Department Chair, the President of the Clinical Staff, the Chair of the Credentials Committee, the Chief Executive Officer of the Medical Center, the Dean of the School of Medicine, or the Director of the Physician Wellness Program. The President of the Clinical Staff, the Chair of the Credentials Committee, the Chief Executive Officer of the Medical Center, or the Director of the Physician Wellness Program shall select the examining physician, program, and/or site of the examination.

The Applicant or Member has a duty to advise the Credentials Committee, within fifteen (15) days, of any change in information previously submitted by him or her related to his or her credentials. The Applicant’s failure to sustain these duties shall be grounds for denial of the application or termination of a Member’s Clinical Staff membership and a Member or Non-Member’s Clinical Privileges.

6.8 Acknowledgment of Applicant

Each Applicant shall sign and specifically acknowledge his or her agreement:

1.  to provide for appropriate continuous care and supervision of his or her patients;

The Member or Non-Member shall authorize the qualified practitioner(s), to submit reports of the evaluation(s), as appropriate, to the Chair of the Credentials Committee, the Department Chair, the President, the Chief Executive Officer, the Dean, the Director of the Physician’s Wellness Program and the person or entity requesting the examination(s). Any time limit for action by the Credentials Committee, as specified in Section 7.4 below, shall be extended for the number of days from the request for the examination(s) to the receipt of the examination report(s).

The MCOB and the Clinical Staff Executive Committee recognize the need to assist Members or Non-Members who have been granted Clinical Privileges regarding their physical and mental health issues as well as to protect patients from harm. Accordingly, upon the recommendation of the Department Chair, the President, the Dean or the Chief Executive Officer, or on its own initiative, the Credentials Committee shall investigate any Member or Non-Member who appears to suffer from a potentially impairing condition. Any such Member or Non-Member is encouraged to seek assistance from the Physicians’ Wellness Program and/or the Employee Assistance Program or any successor program thereto.

The Credentials Committee may also require periodic monitoring after completion of the initial treatment/rehabilitation. If the Member or Non-Member does not complete the initial treatment/rehabilitation program or does not comply with the required monitoring, the provisions of Article 7.4 or 7.5 shall be applicable. In addition, the Credentials Committee shall strictly adhere to any state or federal statutes or regulations containing mandatory reporting requirements.

The purpose of the evaluation and investigation process concerning potential impairing conditions is to protect patients and to aid the Member or Non-Member in retaining or regaining optimal professional functioning. If the Member or Non-Member in question seeks such assistance, the Credentials Committee shall report to the Clinical Staff Executive Committee that he/she is voluntarily seeking treatment and has agreed to appropriate monitoring.

If at any time during the diagnosis, treatment, or rehabilitation phase of the process it is determined that a Member or Non-Member is unable to safely perform the Clinical Privileges he or she has been granted, the Credentials Committee shall proceed in accordance with Sections 7.4 or 7.5, as appropriate, below. Additionally, the Credentials Committee shall strictly adhere to any state or federal statutes or regulations containing mandatory reporting requirements.

7.4 Initiating Evaluation and Recommendation for Corrective Action

*   *   1.  Investigation

Upon receipt of the request for initiation of corrective action, the Credentials Committee shall conduct a thorough investigation of the Member or Non-Member who has been granted Clinical Privileges in question. The Member or Non-Member shall be notified in writing that an investigation is being conducted. In addition the applicable Department Chair, the Dean, and the Chief Executive Officer shall be notified of the investigation. The Member or Non-Member shall provide to the Credentials Committee all available information that it requests. Failure to provide such requested information will itself be considered grounds for corrective action. The Credentials Committee may, but is not obligated to, review medical files or other documents and conduct interviews with witnesses; however, such investigation shall not constitute a “hearing” as that term is used in Article VIII, nor shall the procedural rules with respect to hearings or appeals apply. The Credentials Committee may, in its sole discretion, request an interview with the Member or Non-Member under investigation and, during such interview, question the Member or Non-Member about matters under investigation. A record of such interview shall be made by the Credentials Committee. Within thirty (30) days of the receipt of the request for initiation of investigation, the Credentials Committee shall submit the recorded interview along with the report of the Committee’s recommendations to the Clinical Staff Executive Committee and the Chair of the Department in which the Member being investigated practices.

*   *   1.  Recommendation

The Credentials Committee’s written recommendation to the Clinical Staff Executive Committee of action to be taken on the matter may include, without limitation:

1.  determining that no further action is necessary on the matter;
2.  issuing a warning, a letter of admonition, or a letter of reprimand;
3.  recommending terms of probation or requirements of consultation;
4.  recommending reduction, suspension or revocation of Clinical Privileges in accordance with Sections 7.5 and 7.6 herein;
5.  recommending reduction of Clinical Staff category or limitation of any Staff prerogatives directly related to patient care;
6.  recommending suspension or revocation of Clinical Staff membership;
7.  recommending concurrent monitoring or retrospective auditing;
8.  requiring additional training;
9.  requiring evaluation by a physician assessment organization or individual; or
10.  requiring a proctor for all procedures.

Any corrective action in accordance with subsections (c) through (f) of this Section shall entitle the Member to the procedural rights provided in Article VIII of these Bylaws.

*   1.  Precautionary Summary Suspension

(i) Whenever the conduct of a Member or a non-Member who has been granted Clinical Privileges reasonably appears to pose an imminent threat that requires that immediate action be taken to protect the health, life or well-being of patients or prospective patients, or any other person in or associated with the Medical Center, or (ii) whenever the conduct of a Member or a Non-Member who has been granted Clinical Privileges reasonably appears to pose a substantial likelihood of harm to the life, health and safety of any patient or prospective patient, or (iii) whenever the Member or Non-Member who has been granted Clinical Privileges refuses to follow these Bylaws, the Credentials Manual, the policies, procedures, rules and regulations of the Clinical Staff and/or the Medical Center, or (iv) whenever a Member or Non-Member has made a material misrepresentation on the application for Clinical Staff membership or Clinical Privileges, then in any such event the President, the Chair of the Credentials Committee, or the Chief Executive Officer may summarily restrict or suspend the Clinical Staff membership or Clinical Privileges of such Member of non-Member. Unless otherwise stated, such summary suspension shall become effective immediately upon imposition, and the person responsible shall promptly give written notice of the suspension or restriction to the Member or non-Member in question, the MCOB and the Clinical Staff Executive Committee. The summary restriction or suspension may be limited in duration and shall remain in effect for the period stated or, if not so limited, shall remain in effect until resolved by the procedures specified in Article VIII with respect to Members only. Unless otherwise indicated by the terms of the summary restriction or suspension, the President or his/her designee shall assign the patients of the Member or Non-Member in question to another Member.

7.5.1 Procedure for Members

Within ten (10) working days of such suspension of a Member, a meeting of the Clinical Staff Executive Committee shall be convened to review and consider the action; provided, however, that the Clinical Staff Executive Committee may extend the period of review for good cause. Upon request, the Member may attend and make a statement concerning the issues under investigation, on such terms and conditions as the Clinical Staff Executive Committee may impose, although in no event shall any meeting of the Clinical Staff Executive Committee, with or without the Member, constitute a “hearing” within the meaning of Article VIII, nor shall any procedural rules apply except those adopted by the Clinical Staff Executive Committee. The Member’s failure without good cause to attend any Clinical Staff Executive Committee meeting upon request shall constitute a waiver of his or her rights under Article VIII. The Clinical Staff Executive Committee may modify, continue, or terminate the summary restriction or suspension, but in any event it shall furnish the Member with notice of its decision.

Unless the Clinical Staff Executive Committee terminates the summary restriction or suspension within ten (10) working days of such restriction or suspension, the Member shall be entitled to the procedural rights afforded by Article VIII of these Bylaws.

7.5.2 Procedure for Non-Members

A Non-Member whose Clinical Privileges are summarily suspended pursuant to Section 7.5 shall be notified in writing of the suspension and the grounds for the suspension. Within ten (10) working days of such suspension, the Non-Member may request a meeting with the Chair of the Credentials Committee in order to discuss the suspension. In any event, the Chair of the Credentials Committee shall refer the matter to the Credentials Committee at its next scheduled meeting. The Non-Member shall not be entitled to the procedural rights afforded by Article VIII of the Bylaws.

*   1.  Automatic Suspension

In the following instances, the Member’s or Non-Member’s Clinical Privileges may be automatically suspended or limited, as specifically described by the President, the Chair of the Credentials Committee or the Chief Executive Officer. In addition, in each of the instances listed below, the Member’s Clinical Staff Membership shall be suspended or limited, as specifically described by the President, the Chair of the Credentials Committee or the Chief Executive Officer:

*   *   1.  Change in Licensure
            1.  Revocation or Suspension

Whenever a Member’s or Non-Member’s license authorizing practice in the Commonwealth of Virginia is revoked or suspended by the applicable health regulatory board, Clinical Privileges shall be automatically revoked or suspended as of the date such action becomes effective.

*   *   *   1.  Probation and Other Restriction

If a Member’s or Non-Member’s license authorizing practice in the Commonwealth of Virginia is placed on probation by the applicable health regulatory board, his or her Clinical Privileges shall automatically become subject to the same terms and conditions of the probation as of the date such action becomes effective and throughout its duration.

Whenever a Member’s or Non-Member’s license authorizing practice in the Commonwealth of Virginia is limited or restricted by the applicable health regulatory board, any Clinical Privileges that the Member or Non-Member has been granted by the Medical Center that are within the scope of such limitation or restriction shall be automatically limited or restricted in a similar manner, as of the date such licensing or certifying authority’s action becomes effective and throughout its duration.

*   *   1.  Change in DEA Certificate Status
            1.  Revocation or Suspension

If a Member’s or Non-Member’s DEA certificate is revoked, limited, or suspended, the Member or Non-Member shall automatically be divested of the right to prescribe medications covered by the certificate as of the date such action becomes effective and throughout its term.

*   *   *   1.  Probation

If a Member’s or a Non-Member’s DEA certificate is subject to probation, the Member’s or Non-Member’s right to prescribe such medications automatically shall become subject to the same terms of the probation, as of the date such action becomes effective and throughout its term.

*   *   1.  Lack of Required Professional Liability Insurance

Failure to maintain professional liability insurance in amounts and of a type required by the MCOB, as such amounts shall be defined from time to time, shall be a basis for automatic suspension of a Member’s or a Non-Member’s Clinical Privileges. If within 30 days after written warnings of such delinquency, the Member or Non-Member does not provide evidence of the required professional liability insurance, such individual’s Clinical Privileges shall be automatically terminated.

*   *   1.  Federal Program Exclusion

If a Member of a Non-Member is convicted of a crime pursuant to the Medicare and Medicaid Protection Act of 1987, Pub. L. 100-93, or a crime related to the provision of health care items or services for which one may be excluded under 42 U.S.C. Section 1320a7(a), or is suspended, excluded, debarred or otherwise declared ineligible to participate in Medicare or Medicaid or other federal or state health care or other programs, such Member’s or Non-Member’s Clinical Privileges shall be automatically suspended as of the date such conviction or action with respect to the Medicare or Medicaid federal program becomes effective.

*   *   1.  Loss of Faculty Appointment

If a Member’s faculty appointment in the School of Medicine is terminated for any reason or for any length of time, his/her membership and Clinical Privileges within the Medical Center shall be automatically revoked or suspended as of the date such loss of faculty appointment becomes effective. Loss of faculty appointment shall not give rise to a hearing under Article VIII as such appointment is a prerequisite to membership. Due process procedures applicable to contesting the loss of a faculty appointment are set forth in the University of Virginia Faculty Handbook.

7.6.6 Failure to Undergo Physical and/or Mental Examination

If a Member or Non-Member fails or refuses to undergo a physical and/or mental examination as required by Section 7.3 of these Bylaws, such failure or refusal shall result in automatic suspension of the Clinical Privileges of the Member or Non-Member.

If the Member believes that any such automatic restriction of privileges is the result of an error, the Member may request a meeting with the Clinical Staff Executive Committee. A Non-Member shall have no right to a meeting with the Clinical Staff Executive Committee.

ARTICLE VIII
------------

HEARING AND APPELLATE REVIEW FOR MEMBERS
----------------------------------------

*   1.  General Provisions
        1.  Right to Hearing and Appellate Review

1.  When any Member receives notice of a recommendation of the Credentials Committee that, if approved by the Clinical Staff Executive Committee and the MCOB, will adversely affect his or her appointment to or status as a Member or his or her exercise of Clinical Privileges, he or she shall be entitled to a hearing before a hearing committee appointed by the Clinical Staff Executive Committee. If the recommendation of the Clinical Staff Executive Committee following such hearing is still adverse to the affected Member, he or she shall then be entitled to an appellate review by the MCOB or a committee appointed by the Chair of the MCOB, before the MCOB makes a final decision on the matter. Such review shall be made based on the evidentiary record, unless the MCOB or the committee appointed by the MCOB to hear the appeal requests additional information.
2.  All hearings and appellate reviews shall be in accordance with the procedural safeguards set forth in Article VIII to assure that the affected Member is accorded all rights to which he or she is entitled.
    *   1.  Exhaustion of Remedies

If Adverse Action described in Section 8.2 is taken or recommended, the Applicant or Member must exhaust the remedies afforded by these Bylaws before resorting to legal action. For purposes of Article VIII, the term “Member” may include “Applicant”, as appropriate under the circumstances.

*   1.  Grounds For Hearing

Except as otherwise specified in these Bylaws, the following recommended actions or actions shall be deemed Adverse Actions and constitute grounds for a hearing, if such action is based on professional conduct, professional competence, or character:

*   1.  denial of Clinical Staff Membership;
    2.  denial of Clinical Staff reappointment (excluding failure to obtain active status following provisional status);
    3.  suspension of Clinical Staff Membership;
    4.  revocation of Clinical Staff Membership;
    5.  denial of requested Clinical Privileges (excluding Temporary Privileges) for a Member;
    6.  involuntary reduction of current Clinical Privileges (excluding Temporary Privileges) for a Member;
    7.  suspension of Clinical Privileges (excluding Temporary Privileges) for a Member; or
    8.  termination of all Clinical Privileges (excluding Temporary Privileges and excluding loss of faculty appointment) for a Member.

However, actions described above in this Section that are the result of automatic suspension imposed pursuant to Section 7.6 of these Bylaws, shall not be considered an Adverse Action for purposes of Article VIII.

*   1.  Requests For Hearing; Waiver
        1.  Notice of Proposed Action

In all cases in which a recommendation has been made as set forth in Section 8.2, the Chair or Vice Chair of the Credentials Committee shall send a Member affected by an Adverse Action written notice of (a) his or her right to a hearing if requested by him or her within thirty (30) days of the notice, (b) clear and concise reasons for the Adverse Action recommended, including the acts or omissions with which the Member is charged and a list of the medical charts in question, if applicable, and (c) his or her rights at such a hearing, including the hearing procedures described in Section 8.4. Such notice shall be sent by personal delivery or certified mail, return receipt requested.

*   *   1.  Request for Hearing

The Member shall have thirty (30) days following receipt of notice of such action to request a hearing. The request shall be in writing addressed to the Chair of the Credentials Committee who shall transmit a copy to the Clinical Staff Executive Committee and to the MCOB. The request shall contain a statement signed by the Member that the Member shall maintain confidentiality of all documents provided to the Member during the hearing process and shall not disclose or use the documents for any purpose outside the hearing process. Unless the Member is under summary suspension, he or she shall retain existing rights and privileges until all steps provided for in Sections 8.4 through 8.4.8 of Article VIII of these Bylaws below have concluded. If, however, the Member’s reappointment term is scheduled to expire during the hearing process, the Member’s membership and privileges shall expire unless (i) the Clinical Staff Executive Committee extends the reappointment until the hearing is concluded, or (ii) the Member is reappointed according to final action by the MCOB.

8.3.3 Waiver of Hearing

In the event the Member does not request a hearing within the time and manner described, the Member shall be deemed to have waived any right to a hearing and accepted the recommendation involved. The recommendation of the Credentials Committee shall then become final and effective as to the Member when it is approved by the Clinical Staff Executive Committee and the MCOB.

8.3.4 Notice of Time, Place and Procedures for Hearing

Upon receipt of a request for hearing, the Chair of the Clinical Staff Executive Committee shall schedule a hearing and give notice to the Member of the time, place and date of the hearing, which shall not be less than thirty (30) days after the date of the notice. Each party shall provide the other with a list of witnesses within fifteen (15) days of the hearing date, unless both parties agree otherwise. Witness lists shall be finalized no later than five (5) working days before the hearing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Hearing Entity shall have the right to call such witnesses as it deems appropriate and necessary. Unless extended by the Chair of the Hearing Entity, described in Section 8.3.5 below, the date of the commencement of the hearing shall be not less than thirty (30) days, nor more than ninety (90) days from the date of receipt of the request for a hearing; provided, however, that when the request is received from a Member who is under summary suspension, the hearing shall be held as soon as the arrangements may reasonably be made and provided further that the parties may agree to a mutually convenient date beyond the ninety (90) day period.

8.3.5 Hearing Entity

The Chair of the Clinical Staff Executive Committee may, in his or her discretion and in consultation with the Chair of the Credentials Committee, the Chief Executive Officer and other members of CSEC as he or she deems appropriate, direct that the hearing be held: (1) before a panel of no fewer than three (3) Members who are appointed by the Chair of the Clinical Staff Executive Committee and if possible are Peers of the Member in clinical practice or academic rank and are not in direct economic competition with the Member involved, or (2) by an independent Peer Review panel from outside the Medical Center whose members are not in direct economic competition with the Member involved, or (3) a panel consisting of a combination of (1) and (2). Each type of panel described in the preceding sentence shall be referred to hereinafter as the “Hearing Entity.” Knowledge of the matter involved shall not preclude a Clinical Staff Member from serving as a member of the Hearing Entity; however each member must certify at the time of appointment and also on the record at the hearing that any prior knowledge he or she may have does not preclude rendering a fair and impartial decision. The Chair of the Clinical Staff Executive Committee shall designate the chair of the Hearing Entity. At least three-quarters of the members of the Hearing Entity shall be present when the hearing takes place and no member may vote by proxy. In the event of any conflict involving the Chair of the Clinical Staff Executive Committee, the Vice Chair of CSEC shall be responsible for performing the duties described in this paragraph.

8.3.6 Failure to Attend and Proceed

Failure without good cause of the affected Member to personally attend and proceed at such a hearing shall be deemed to constitute voluntary acceptance of the recommendations involved and his or her request for a hearing shall be deemed to have been withdrawn.

8.3.7 Postponements and Extensions

Once a request for hearing is initiated, postponements and extensions of time beyond the times permitted in these Bylaws may be permitted by the Hearing Entity, or its chairperson, acting upon its behalf. Such decisions are solely within the discretion of the Hearing Entity or its presiding officer and may only be granted for good cause.

8.4 Hearing Procedure

8.4.1 Representation

The hearings provided for in these Bylaws are for the purpose of intra-professional resolution of matters bearing on professional conduct, professional competency or character. If requested by either the affected Member or the Credentials Committee in accordance with Section 8.4.2, however, both sides may be represented by legal counsel. In lieu of legal counsel, the Member may be represented by another person of the Member’s choice.

8.4.2 The Hearing Officer

The President may appoint a hearing officer to preside at the hearing. In the sole discretion of the President, the hearing officer may be an attorney qualified to preside over a quasi-judicial hearing. If requested by the Hearing Entity, the hearing officer may participate in the deliberations of the Hearing Entity and be an advisor to it, but the hearing officer shall not be entitled to vote.

*   *   1.  The Presiding Officer

The Hearing Entity shall have a presiding officer. If the President appoints a hearing officer pursuant to Section 8.4.2, then the hearing officer shall serve as the presiding officer. If no hearing officer is appointed, then the Chair of the Hearing Entity shall serve as the presiding officer. The presiding officer shall strive to assure that all participants in the hearing have a reasonable opportunity to be heard and to present relevant oral and documentary evidence in an efficient and expeditious manner, and that proper decorum is maintained. The presiding officer shall be entitled to determine the order of or procedure for presenting evidence and argument during the hearing and shall have the authority and discretion to make all rulings on questions that pertain to matters of law, procedure, or the admissibility of evidence. If the presiding officer determines that either side in a hearing is not proceeding in an efficient and expeditious manner, the presiding officer may take such discretionary action as seems warranted by the circumstances.

*   *   1.  Record of the Hearing

An official reporter shall be present to make a record of the hearing proceedings. The cost of attendance of the reporter shall be borne by the Medical Center, but the cost of the transcript, if any, shall be borne by the party requesting it.

*   *   1.  Rights of the Parties

Within reasonable limitations imposed by the presiding officer, the Credentials Committee, the Hearing Entity and the affected Member may call and examine witnesses for relevant testimony, introduce relevant exhibits or other documents, cross-examine or impeach witnesses who have testified orally on any matter relevant to the issues and otherwise rebut evidence. The Member may be called by the Credentials Committee or the Hearing Entity, as appropriate, and be examined as if under cross-examination.

1.  Burden of Proof. The Credentials Committee shall appoint one of its members to represent it at the hearing, to present facts in support of its adverse recommendation and to examine witnesses. Where the issue concerns the denial of initial Clinical Staff membership, it shall be the obligation of the affected practitioner to present appropriate evidence in support of his or her application, but the Credentials Committee representative shall then be responsible for showing that evidence exists to support the decision and that the Credentials Committee appropriately exercised its authority under these Bylaws and other applicable rules or regulations of the Medical Center. In all other situations outlined in Section 8.2 above, it shall be the obligation of the Credentials Committee representative to present appropriate evidence in support of the adverse recommendation, but the affected Member shall then be responsible for supporting his or her challenge to the adverse recommendation by providing appropriate evidence showing that the grounds for the decision lacked support in fact or that such grounds or action based upon such grounds is either arbitrary or capricious.
2.  Written Statement. Each party shall have the right to submit a written statement at the close of the hearing.
3.  Written Decision. Upon completion of the hearing, the affected Member shall be informed in writing by the Clinical Staff Executive Committee of the recommendation of the Hearing Entity, including a statement of the basis for the recommendation, and shall be informed in writing of the decisions of the Clinical Staff Executive Committee and the MCOB, including a statement of the basis for the decision.
    *   1.  Evidence

Judicial rules of evidence and procedure relating to the conduct of the hearing, examination of witnesses, and presentation of evidence shall not apply to a hearing conducted under Article VIII of these Bylaws. Any relevant evidence, including hearsay, shall be admitted if it is the sort of evidence on which responsible persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious affairs, regardless of the admissibility of such evidence in a court of law. The Hearing Entity may question the witnesses or call additional witnesses if it deems such action appropriate. At its discretion, the Hearing Entity may request both parties to file written arguments.

*   *   1.  Recess and Conclusion

After consultation with the Hearing Entity, the presiding officer may recess the hearing and reconvene the same at such times and intervals as may be reasonable, with due consideration for reaching an expeditious conclusion to the hearing. Upon conclusion of the presentation of oral and documentary evidence and the receipt of any closing written arguments, the hearing shall be closed. The Hearing Entity shall, at a time convenient to itself, conduct its deliberations outside the presence of the parties. The Hearing Entity may seek legal counsel during its deliberations and the preparation of its report. Upon conclusion of its deliberations, the hearing shall be declared finally adjourned.

*   *   1.  Decision of the Hearing Entity

Within fifteen (15) days after final adjournment of the hearing, the Hearing Entity shall render a decision, which shall be accompanied by a report in writing and shall be delivered to the Clinical Staff Executive Committee. If the affected Member is currently under summary suspension, the Hearing Entity shall render a decision and report to the Clinical Staff Executive Committee within five (5) working days after final adjournment. A copy of the decision shall also be forwarded to the MCOB and the affected Member. The report shall contain a concise statement of the reasons supporting the decision.

*   *   1.  Decision of Clinical Staff Executive Committee and MCOB

At its next regularly scheduled meeting, the Clinical Staff Executive Committee shall review the report and decision of the Hearing Entity and shall, within thirty (30) days of such meeting, give notice of its recommendation to the MCOB and the Member. The Clinical Staff Executive Committee may affirm, modify or reverse the decision of the Hearing Entity.

*   *   1.  Appeal

The Member may submit to the Chief Executive Officer a written appeal statement detailing the findings of fact, conclusions, and procedural matters with which he/she disagrees, and his/her reasons for such disagreement. This written appeal statement may cover any matters raised at any step in the hearing process, and legal counsel may assist in its preparation. The statement shall be delivered by hand or by certified or registered mail to the Chief Executive Officer and received no later than fourteen (14) days after the Member’s receipt of the recommendation of the Clinical Staff Executive Committee. The Chief Executive Officer shall promptly provide a copy of the Member’s statement to the MCOB. In response to the statement submitted by the affected Member, the Clinical Staff Executive Committee may also submit a written statement to the MCOB and shall provide a copy of any such written statement to the Member.

*   *   1.  Decision by the Operating Board

1.  At a regularly scheduled meeting following receipt of the Member’s written appeal statement (or the expiration of the time in which the Member had the opportunity to submit a written statement) and the Clinical Staff Executive Committee’s written statement, the MCOB shall render a decision in writing and shall forward copies thereof to each party involved in the hearing. The decision of the MCOB shall include a statement of the basis for its decision.
2.  The MCOB may affirm, modify, or reverse the decision of the Clinical Staff Executive Committee, or remand the matter to the Hearing Entity or the Clinical Staff Executive Committee for reconsideration. If the matter is remanded to the Hearing Entity for further review and recommendation, such Hearing Entity shall conduct its review within fifteen (15) working days and make its recommendations to the MCOB. This further review and the time required to report back shall not exceed sixty (60) days except as the parties may otherwise agree, for good cause, as jointly determined by the Chair of the MCOB and the Hearing Entity or Clinical Staff Executive Committee. The MCOB shall thereafter make its final decision.
3.  The decision of the MCOB as reflected in paragraphs (a) or (b) above shall constitute final action. This decision shall be immediately effective and shall not be subject to further hearing, appellate or judicial review.
    *   1.  Right to One Hearing and One Appeal

No Member shall be entitled to more than one evidentiary hearing and one appeal on any matter that shall have been the subject of Adverse Action or recommendation.
