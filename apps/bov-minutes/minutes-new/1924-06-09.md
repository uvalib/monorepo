"And said Lessee agrees and covenants to and with the said the said Lessor as follows:

THIRD: That the said building so erected shall be used exclusively and for the purposes of a students' chapter or fraternity house and for lodging rooms by the individual members of said Lessee and the members of Zeta Psi Fraternity of North America, that unless the consent of said Lessor over the signature of its Rector if first obtained, said Lessee will not subject or assign said premises, or any part thereof, during the term, or permit the use thereof otherwise than by said Zeta Psi Fraternity of North America and its members, and the members of said Lessee.

"That during the use and occupations of said building as aforesaid, and so long as said lease shall remain in force and effect, said building shall be cared for and kept in order and in such reasonable repair as the Superintendent of Grounds and Buildings, or other duly designated officer of said Lessor shall require, at the expense of the said Lessee, and without charge to said Lessor; and such repairs shall include restoration in case of damage or desturction by fire.

"FOURTH: That the said building shall be at all times as fully subject to the ispection and visitation of the authorities of said Lessor for police purposes and the ends of dissipline, and for sanitary and other purposes of a similar nature, as are any of the buildings owned by said University.

FIFTH: In the event the said Lessor shall, at any time in the future, change its views as to fraternities, and desire to recall any and all rights that may have been granted herein, then and in that event the said Lessor shall have the right at any time to revoke any and all the rights and privileges granted, conveyed or given hereunder, and take possession of said building, and upon payment to the said Lessee for such building of such price as may be agreed upon by said Lessor and said Lessee; and upon failure to agree upon a price the same shall be fixed by arbitration—;one arbitrator to be selected by each party, and the two selected to choose an umpire—;the award of said arbitrators and their umpire, or of any two of them, shall be final and binding upon both parties.

SIXTH: That in case of the breach by said Lessee or its failure to observe any of the covenants, agreements or conditions hereof, or if said building shall be used in a manner not satisfactory to the said Lessor, or if said Beta Chapter of Zeta Psi shall be dissolved or discontinued, then and in any of said events, after sixty (60) days notice given in writing by said Lessor through its Secretary, or through any other authorized agent of said Lessor, at any time after such breach, to any member or officer of the Lessee found at the University, or if no such member or officer be there found, then without notice, the Lessor shall have the right to enter upon its records the fact of such default or breach of such covenant, agreement or condition, or of the unsatisfactory use of said house by the Lessee as aforesaid, or of said declaration of discontinuance, and this lease shall thereupon be determined and terminated and the said leased property and the buildings and improvements thereon shall thereupon revert to said Lessor, who shall have the right to require its Superintendent of Grounds and Buildings, or such officer or agent as may be designated by the Lessor, to take possession of the said building, land and improvements thereon, and the same shall become and continue the absolute property of the said Lessor, free and forever discharged from any and all rights and claimes of said Lessee hereunder.

"Provided, however, if the said building shall revert to said Lessor as aforesaid in consequence of the dissolution or discontinuance of the said Beta Chapter of Zeta Psi within five years after said building shall have so reverted the Chapter shall be revived and restored, to its former standing and position, and if said Lessee as so revived and restored shall within five such years make application to said Lessor for restoration to its rights and privileges under this lease, the said Lessor shall thereupon be bound to restore the same on the same terms and conditions as are hereinbefore set out; provided that evidence satisfactory to the Lessor is presented to it of the good standing of the Lessee as revived and restored and of its ability to perform thereafter the obligations of this lease; otherwise the Lessee shall not be entitled to a restoration of its rights and privileges as aforesaid.

SEVENTH: That in the event of failure on the part of said Lessor to exercise its rights hereunder to terminate this lease under the provisions of the SIXTH section above, such failure shall not be taken or considered as in any manner constituting a waiver of any of the rights of the Lessor as hereinbefore set forth to terminate this lease above stated, and take possession of the building as aforesaid, in case of any subsequent or other failure, default, or breach on the part of the Lessee. And the Lessor agrees and covenants to and with said Lessee that on the payment by the said Lessee of said annual installment of rent as aforesaid, on the full and faithful performance and discharge by said Lessee of all covenants, stipulations and agreements herein contained, the said Lessor will, on payment to it by said Lessee of $25.00 renewal fee, execute and deliver at the request of said Lessee a new lease of the above demised premises for nother term of nine-nine (99) years to commence on the expiration of this lease, subject to the same rents and to the same covenants, agreements and conditions as hereinbefore set out, so that the demise hereby created may be renewable and renewed from time to time.

Application of the Omicron Chapter of Beta Theta Pi Fraternity for a site on the University grounds for a Fraternity House was referred to the Committee on Buildings and Grounds for a report at the next meeting.

Dr. W. A. Lambeth, Superintendent of Buildings and Grounds, reported that after a thorough examination of Medical Hall, in which he had the assistant and advice of Professor Hudnut, he was of the opinion that the building should be abandoned during August, in order that necessary repairs be made to make it safe for occupancy; and that it was his opinion that the repairs could be made at a cost not to exceed $2000.00.

The recommendation of the Superintendent was approved, and expenditure of not to exceed $2000.00 was authorized.

The Superintendent of Buildings and Grounds presented his recommendation as to rates to be charged for heating the residences on the grounds of the University, which was approved Spread.

"RESOLVED: That beginning with the session of 1924-25 the heating rate be fixed as in the past at $20.00 per hundred square feet of radiation, with the following conditions for those who increased their number of square feet in the change from steam to hot water—;the amount of such increase shall be adjusted as follows: During the session of 1924-25 there will be no charge for 2/3 of such increase, during 1925-26 no charge for 1.3 of such increase, and in 1926-27 they will be required to pay $20.00 per one hundred square feet of hot water radiation, which is at that time connected with the central heating plant. To illustrate: if a tenant had one thousand feet of steam radiation, and now increased to thirteen hundred square feet of hot water radiation, he will be charged for eleven hundred feet in 1924-25, twelve hundred feet in 1925-26, and thirteen hundred feet in 1926-27."

Mr. C. H. H. Thomas, Manager of the McIntire Concerts, submitted his report for the session, showing receipts of $3,937.00, and expenditures of $4,731.80, leaving a deficit of $694.80. After a full discussion of the question of continuing these concerts for the session 1924-25, it was the opinion of the Board that they should be continued with every effort made to prevent a deficit.

Expenditures Incidental to Changes Proposed.

Note 1. At the end of the two year period we will have saved $5,940.00 out of our appropriation, and we will have paid for the new building, the new laundry equipment, ice machinery and dish washer; we will have stopped the waste of laundry, and because we will be able to buy in quantities, we will get better prices on perishable commodities.

There being no further business, the meeting adjourned, on motion duly made and seconded.
