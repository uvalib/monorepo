He said he hoped everyone had enjoyed the new Board meeting format and the change to the concurrent meeting structure. This format will allow more dialogue between members of a committee.**

**The Rector said the Board was assembled for a short meeting to appoint the Executive Committee for a term of one year. The Rector serves as the chair of the committee, and he asked the Vice Rector, Bill Goodwin, to serve as the vice chair. The Rector proposed a slate of four additional members: Victoria Harker, Stephen P. Long, M.D., Timothy B. Robertson, and Linwood H. Rose. The Rector also proposed the addition of one non-voting member, Edward D. Miller, M.D. He reminded the Board that last year they considered amending the statute to allow a seventh member. Due to concerns at that time, it was decided to pull back that amendment, but now the Rector would like to propose amending the statute in the 2014 General Assembly session. With that in mind, the Rector opened the floor for nominations and questions. Ms. Dragas suggested the seventh member be designated as the Chair of the Medical Center Operating Board because of its financial and operating risks for the University and the Rector stated he would not be opposed to this.**

**On motion, the following resolution was approved:**

**APPOINTMENT OF EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE FOR 2013-2014**

**RESOLVED, the Board approves the following members which constitute the Executive Committee until the Annual Meeting 2014: George Keith Martin, William H. Goodwin Jr., Victoria D. Harker, Stephen P. Long, M.D., Timothy B. Robertson, and Linwood H. Rose. In addition, Edward D. Miller, M.D. is elected as a nonvoting member of the committee; and**

**RESOLVED FURTHER, the Board approves a legislative proposal to add a seventh member to the Executive Committee.**

**The full Board recessed at 3:25 p.m. and committee meetings continued throughout the afternoon.**

He said he has a better appreciation for the commitment since taking over as rector six to eight weeks ago. He also thanked Ms. Dragas’ family for the time that she put in to being such a devoted rector. Ms. Dragas thanked the Board members and said it has been the greatest honor of her life.**

**NCAA Orientation**

**Annually, the Board members must be oriented on NCAA compliance issues. Mr. Eric Baumgartner, the Associate Athletics Director of Compliance, provided the orientation. Mr. Baumgartner began by explaining institutional controls as the ability of each institution to control its intercollegiate athletics programs to ensure compliance with the NCAA rules and regulations. Ultimately, President Sullivan is responsible for the athletics program and she has assigned Craig Littlepage and Eric Baumgartner to oversee the compliance program from a rules and compliance stand point.**

**Mr. Baumgartner said boosters are representatives of athletic interests, and this includes Board members. Once you are a booster, you remain a booster for your life. Board members may not engage in recruiting. This means Board members should not meet with or speak with prospective student athletes or their parents or guardians either on Grounds or off Grounds. Recruiting is prohibited for high school students in grades 9 through 12. There are different levels of violations; sanctions include banning from post-season play, fines, and many other potential sanctions.**

**ACC Certification**

**The Atlantic Coast Conference requires the Rector to read a certification to the Board stating the President is responsible for the athletics program and has full authority from the Board to run the program. The Rector read the certification, and said he and President Sullivan would sign it later.**

**Report by the Student Board Member**

**Mr. Blaze highlighted four student groups on-Grounds that he felt exemplified student self-governance. He reported that the Honor Committee has created a newsletter to make the system more accessible and less intimidating; U.Va. Student Council has instituted sweeping organizational changes to increase efficiency and is currently overseeing 55 initiatives that range from promoting the arts to critically analyzing advising here at the University; Dialogue Across U.Va. is a relatively new group on-Grounds that is bringing faculty, staff, and students together to talk about issues at the University; and friends of Shelley Goldsmith in Alpha Phi sorority have formed a Contracted Independent Organization (CIO) that promotes awareness about the dangers of drug use, in memory of Ms. Goldsmith.**

**Mr. Blaze said that he stood by the Board of Visitors' decision made in August on AccessUVa, however, students are concerned that diversity will decrease. He suggested that there be close monitoring. He read a segment from the IAmNotaLoan campaign's letter to the Board as an example of how passionate the students are about this matter, and he quoted the Black Student Alliance (BSA) president Joy Omenyi, to further highlight what this means to the students.**

**Report by the President**

**The President said the visiting committee from the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS) concluded its visit to the University on Wednesday. She thanked the Board members and others who took the time to meet with the committee. She believes it was a very productive and positive visit.**

**The President said the SACS visiting committee will deliver its report to SACS, and in December, a decision will be made. She said she feels very hopeful and confident that the University will be taken off warning at that time.**

**President Sullivan introduced the newest members of the University’s executive leadership team, Dr. Richard Shannon and David Martel. Dr. Shannon will be the Executive Vice President for Health Affairs and he will report directly to the President, while working closely with Provost John Simon and Chief Operating Officer Patrick Hogan to advance broad institutional goals.**

**President Sullivan introduced the new Chief Communications Officer, David Martel. She said he was a seasoned communications executive with more than 20 years of success in marketing, brand awareness, graphic identity, multimedia, and media relations. Mr. Martel will also report directly to the President. She said she has already been impressed by his creativity and strategic vision, and is excited about the energy and leadership he will bring to our Communications team.**

**Gifts and Grants Report**

**Before delivering the Gifts and Grants Report, President Sullivan shared a brief story with the Board members. This past spring, we celebrated the successful conclusion of the $3-billion capital campaign. She said many large gifts helped us surpass our campaign goal, but many small gifts made a difference also.**

**She spoke about one especially small gift and the donor who gave it. Last spring, the University received a donation form returned in an envelope containing a gift of six cents. When it appeared, the engagement staff suspected that this six-cent gift might be some kind of angry gesture from a disgruntled alumnus, so they decided to look into it by calling the donor. It turned out that the donor was a 1999 alumna who had fallen on hard times. She told the engagement officer that she had recently lost a job that she’d held for several years, but she loved the University, she said, and when she received the campaign mailing, she could not bear to throw it away without giving something. In her purse, all she could find was six cents, so she sent it. In other words, this woman gave 100% of her disposable income to the University.**

**The President said like the Bible story of the “widow’s mite,” the story of the gift from the six-cent donor should remind us to appreciate the small gifts — and the personal sacrifices they represent — even as we celebrate the big gifts that we mention in the Gifts and Grants Report.**

**Summary of Fiscal Year-To-Date through July 31, 2013**

**Philanthropic cash flow to the University of Virginia and its related foundations is $4,467,775.65 for the fiscal year through July 31, 2013, with an additional $2,111,847.85 pledged.**

**Significant Gifts Received Since The Last Meeting**

**The following are significant gifts received since the last Board meeting:**

**Altria Client Services Inc., private grant of $2,000,000 to the Curry School of Education in support of the Center for Positive Youth Development;**

**Estate of Robert S. Pace, Jr., in-kind bequest of $354,860 to the College and Graduate School of Arts and Sciences for the benefit of the department of Environmental Sciences.**

**Significant Pledges Received Since The Last Meeting**

**The following are significant pledges received since the last Board meeting:**

**Mr. Bernard Lynn and Mrs. Maxine Platzer Lynn pledge of $3,000,000 in support of the Women’s Center;**

**The William Stamps Farish Fund pledge of $1,000,000 to the Jeffersonian Grounds Initiative to support the renovation of the Rotunda;**

**Mr. Radford W. Klotz and Ms. Shahnaz Batmanghelidj pledge of $1,000,000 to the College and Graduate School of Arts and Sciences for the Radford W. Klotz and Shahnaz Batmanghelidj Fund for Faculty Excellence in Economics.**

**The President recommended that the Board accept the gifts and grants report. The Rector asked for a motion to approve the report. The motion was made, seconded, and the report was approved.**

**Faculty Senate Report**

**Dr. Chris Holstege, current Faculty Senate Chair, thanked the Board for the opportunity to address them, and extended an invitation for them to sit in on any of his teaching sessions. He said, during his term as chair, it will be a priority to focus on how faculty leaders communicate and engage with others throughout the greater university community, including the Board. He thanked Rector Martin and the Board for the opportunity to attend the August retreat. He said it was a valuable opportunity to meet the new board members and talk with each of them. He said to have effective communication, it needs to come from both directions.**

**Dr. Holstege cited two examples of effective communication. He said we are in the midst of the development of the strategic plan led by the diligent work of Milton Adams. He said it will be a challenging process that will require effective communication from all parties. Up to this time, there were multiple Town Hall meetings with each of the working groups to encourage engagement with all University faculty. Those discussions and many others led to the development of the five strategic pillars. Dr. Holstege said the Faculty Senate has dedicated its meetings this year to Town Hall sessions to discuss the Strategic Plan and provide feedback to the administration as the process is further honed. He said this was a tremendous challenge representing all 4,000 faculty. He gave several examples of the challenge they face. In order to make wise decisions on the Strategic Plan that may appear intuitive, the ramifications of each of the strategies must be clearly vetted with all constituents (faculty, students, staff, alumni, administration, and the Board) to assure the success of a final plan - one that we may not all fully agree on, but a process that we can clearly show was openly communicated and engaged all.**

**Dr. Holstege spoke briefly about internal communications and how important they are. He gave an example of the changes in health care benefits. Spouses who are eligible for health care benefits at their place of employment will no longer be eligible for benefits at the University,. He said this may affect 1,500 - 2,000 employees and is the talk of the town. He expressed thanks to Susan Carkeek and the work that she has done for the University but said that as the Faculty Senate chair, this was a wake-up call for him on internal communications. He said there is an advisory council to the benefits office which includes five faculty members who could have assisted with communication before and after such decisions were enacted – had they been engaged.**

**Dr. Holstege said they are working with the General Faculty Council and other various councils representing university staff in a group now called “OneUVA” that is identifying those councils and committees on Grounds that have faculty and staff members to assure that those representatives are indeed representing their constituents. He said the Faculty Senate should provide an easy conduit for such representation, including those faculty consulting members on the Board committees to truly represent the faculty accurately. He said faculty leaders need to ensure that their communications are representing the greater faculty and not simply an individual’s personal thoughts on a topic.**

**Dr. Holstege explained how they are moving forward on improving communications. He said communication and engagement must first begin with the institution’s leadership. He reported that they were communicating effectively with the administration leadership. The Faculty Senate has a specific committee dedicated to collaboration, communication, and engagement. They are working to further improve communications with others throughout the institution. Dr. Hostege said the Faculty Senate leadership has been meeting with the rector, George Martin and others on the Board. He said at this time we need to ensure that we all communicate effectively, striving for the betterment of this university as a whole to provide the best education possible for the gifted students we all serve. He concluded by saying that he looked forward to this year’s activities and working with each of the Board members as the chair of the Faculty Senate representing the University’s outstanding faculty.**

Crockett Award

**Ms. Donna Henry made the presentation of this year’s Crockett Award to Pace Lochte. Ms. Henry said Ms. Lochte is a person who believes in the power of authentic partnership to improve lives and create innovative change, and she lives this belief through her abiding partnerships in Southwest Virginia.
