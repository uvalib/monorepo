The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia

Bond Resolution Appendix

July 9-10, 2010

The Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia met, in Retreat and in Open and Executive Session, at the Hilton Virginia Beach Oceanfront Hotel Friday, July 9, 2010, and Saturday, July 10, 2010; John O. Wynne, Rector, presided.

A. Macdonald Caputo, Hunter E. Craig, The Honorable Alan A. Diamonstein, Ms. Susan Y. Dorsey, Ms. Helen E. Dragas, W. Heywood Fralin, Marvin W. Gilliam, Robert D. Hardie, Ms. Sheila C. Johnson, Ms. Glynn D. Key, Mark J. Kington, Vincent J. Mastracco Jr., The Honorable Lewis F. Payne, and Stewart H. Ackerly, were present.

Also present were Ms. Teresa A. Sullivan, Leonard W. Sandridge, Paul J. Forch, Arthur Garson Jr., M.D., Ms. Colette Sheehy, Ms. Carol Wood, Ms. Nancy Rivers, Ms. Susan G. Harris, and Ms. Jeanne Flippo Bailes.

Present as well for the sessions on July 9th were Ms. Yvonne B. Hubbard, Gregory W. Roberts, and George A. Stovall.

Friday, July 9

The session on Friday, July 9th, began at 1:05 p.m., and was led by the Rector.

The Rector reviewed the agenda for the Retreat and introduced Ms. Sullivan, president-elect, who gave a synopsis of the discussions she has had already with administrators, faculty, and friends of the University, and she reviewed her schedule for the coming months. She said she will be the speaker at Fall Convocation.

Ms. Sullivan said she does not plan to start a new strategic planning exercise immediately. She will work with the University leadership to integrate previous planning.

She said she has done substantial work on productivity as the chair of a National Research Council panel. The University is a trendsetter with regard to the traditional measures of productivity, but there is more that can be done. She plans to analyze “gateway” courses with an eye toward improving achievement in those courses. A redesign of these courses is occurring throughout the country. She

8193

said she is not proposing “dumbing down” the courses, but rather finding creative ways to make students successful.

Ms. Sullivan said she will also look at cost controls, internal budgeting, and succession planning this year.

Board Members made a number of suggestions about productivity, including looking at faculty teaching loads. Mr. Fralin said Ms. Sullivan should think about suggestions on improving productivity to provide to the Virginia Commission on Higher Education Reform, Innovation and Investment.

Performance Measures

The Rector gave some background information on the Performance Measures materials, which were provided to the Board in advance of the meeting. He stated that this is the fifth year the Board has reviewed the Performance Measures. He sees secular change in higher education that requires institutions to develop goals in certain areas that will lead to long-term success. Higher education has not been traditionally goal oriented and that must change. He said the state does not have long-term goals either.

The Rector introduced Ms. Colette Sheehy, who said there are 43 measures. Where possible, data has been trended and compared to a select number of peers. The Medical Center has a separate set of measures.

Ms. Sheehy said it was not possible to talk about all of the measures, and so she and the other speakers will review with the Board those that look at rankings, new measures, and those containing data of particular interest. Ms. Sheehy introduced George Stovall to review the measures on rankings.

Mr. Stovall said the University tied with UCLA for 24th overall on the U.S. News and World Report undergraduate rankings for 2010. In the graduate rankings, most notable was the Education School moved up 10 positions since 2009. Both peer and superintendent rankings increased, which comprise 40% of the total ranking.

Dr. Garson pointed out that the rankings for different schools are composed of different factors. For instance, School of Medicine rankings include a researcher ranking, and Graduate Business includes rankings by recruiters. Arts and Sciences is entirely reputational.

8194

Mr. Stovall said there are some international rankings including Jiao Tong which is very research oriented. The University improved in all three geographical areas in this ranking. The National Research Council is planning to release rankings, but they have not been released yet.

Mr. Stovall discussed the measure on innovation as a percentage of the University’s overall sponsored research as compared to peers. He said UCLA and Berkeley are not included because the University of California System lumps all of the schools together. Duke is not included either because their numbers are outliers to the extent that they may not be measuring the same thing. Virginia ranks above Vanderbilt and UNC, but below the University of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Cornell.

Mr. Stovall showed a graph of University sponsored program awards by school. Awards overall have grown by 58% over the last ten years. Medicine has by far the most awards.

A chart showing federal research expenditures indicates that Virginia is lower than peers. Size and the number of faculty in research areas are factors.

Graduate student rate of graduation shows that this rate has stayed fairly steady at between 60 and 63% over the last ten years, which is above the peer mean.

Mr. Stovall reviewed several statistics about female and minority faculty turnover. He admitted that the overall numbers are so small that the statistics may not be very meaningful. The high turnover quotient may be attributed to a low number of hires rather than a high number of people leaving.

Mr. Stovall reviewed faculty hiring statistics for five years. The yield on offers was higher in 2009 than past years.

Following a ten minute break, the Rector asked Ms. Sheehy to continue the presentation.

Ms. Sheehy reviewed the capital campaign progress per month, which declined in 2008 and 2009. She said a bequest campaign, which has a goal of pledges of $400 million, is at 59% of goal. Fiscal year 2010 new campaign commitments stand at about $160 million.

Ms. Sheehy said that Yoke San Reynolds had created two measures on overall institutional financial health: Equity Ratio, which is total net assets divided by total assets, and free cash flow margin, which is cash generated through operations that remains after the bills are paid. The University’s free cash flow margin is slightly under 2% for 2009. The more free cash flow in the institution, the

8195better it is able to invest in new ventures. If the margin is negative, this shows that the institution is using debt for operations.

Ms. Sheehy concluded her remarks with a third measure of long-term financial strength: efficiency, i.e. educational expenditures versus reputation (peer assessment). US News and World Report ranks the University 64th in financial resources and 24th in reputation. Of the top 50 schools in the rankings, only five rank below the University in financial resources.

The Rector said the takeaways from the presentation include the need for levers to deans to encourage advancing the University’s goals; a greater focus on innovation; and more effort to find opportunities for attracting research dollars.

Early Action

The Rector began by explaining that three years ago the University had “early decision” which was a binding program. This was abolished without input from the Board. Now there is concern about losing really good students who want to apply early and get the process over with. Many of the top institutions have either early decision or early action. He introduced Greg Roberts, Dean of Admission, who gave the presentation.

The University’s current system includes a January application deadline and April 1 notification with a deposit deadline of May 1. The University currently receives applications from November 1 through January 1. In most years, the staff evaluates between 3500 and 4000 applications during this period. Every file is read twice; deans read about 30 files per day. The first reader makes an initial admission decision; the second reader is one of three senior deans. They do not track their decisions as they go. At the end of February, they look at the decisions overall and by school and residency. This past year they received more applications than in the past, and the offer rate decreased to 32%.

There are three primary early action programs in place across the country: 1. Single choice where an applicant may apply to only one school early; 2. The middle of the road, in which an applicant can apply early action to multiple schools but not early decision; and 3. Unrestricted, in which an applicant may apply anywhere early. The first program is in place at Yale and Stanford. The second program is fairly rare. The third program is the most widely used.

8196

Mr. Roberts said his proposal falls within the third category. It would set November 1 as the application deadline, and January 31 as the decision/notification date. The University’s decision may be to offer, deny, or defer admission to the regular cycle. Applicants would have until May 1 to respond, which is the same as regular admission. Mr. Roberts said the first year the early action program could be in place is for the 2012 admission year.

Yvonne Hubbard, Director of Student Financial Services, gave a brief overview of the process for applying for financial aid. She said financial aid letters are now issued by April 1. Early action would allow them to push the process back a bit. It is possible to do estimated financial aid calculations if necessary. The key is to identify students early in the process and educate them and their parents about the availability of aid and how to apply for it.

The Rector commented that he would prefer a mid-December decision date rather than January 31. Mr. Roberts said this would require a substantial increase in staff to process applications in such a short period of time.

Approval of the Series 2010 Bond Resolution

The Rector asked Mr. Sandridge to present the bond resolution item. Mr. Sandridge said the Board authorized the bond issuance at its June meeting. The issuance is for taxable Build America bonds in the amount of $250 million. There is a lower effective rate with the Build America Bonds than tax-exempt bonds. The plan is to close the bond issuance on July 28, 2010. The long-term bonds will be issued for projects previously approved by the Board for construction and financing.

On motion, the Board approved two resolutions:

RESOLUTION TO APPROVE ADDITIONAL ACTION ITEMS

RESOLVED, the Board approves the addition of items to the Agenda, for consideration by the Board.

THE RECTOR AND VISITORS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA BOND RESOLUTION AUTHORIZING AND SECURING $250,000,000 TAXABLE GENERAL REVENUE PLEDGE BUILD AMERICA BONDS SERIES 2010

The full text of the resolution is included as an Appendix to these Minutes.

The Rector recessed the meeting at 5:05 p.m.

8197

Saturday, July 10

The Rector opened the meeting at 8:30 a.m., and asked for motions to continue in Executive Session.

Executive Session

Upon adopting the following motions, the Board went into Executive Session at 8:35 a.m.:

That the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia convene in Closed Session for the purpose of discussing and/or approving personnel actions involving the appointment, reappointment, transition, nomination, evaluation, performance, compensation, and resignation of specific University officers and employees as provided for in Section 2.2-3711 (A) (1) of the Code of Virginia.

That the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia convene in Closed Session for the purpose of discussing specific legal matters and litigation where such discussion in an open meeting would adversely affect the negotiating or litigating posture of the public body, as provided for in Section 2.2-3711 (A)) (7) of the Code of Virginia.

\- - - - - - - - - - -

The Board resumed its meeting in Open Session at 9:40 a.m., and adopted the following resolution certifying that its discussions in Executive Session had been conducted in accordance with the exemptions permitted by the Virginia Freedom of Information Act:

That we vote on and record our certification that, to the best of each Board member’s knowledge, only public business matters lawfully exempted from open meeting requirements and which were identified in the motions authorizing the closed session, were heard, discussed or considered in closed session.

New Financial Model

The Rector began by explaining that the Governor has formed a Commission on Higher Education Reform, Innovation and Investment, which will force the University to consider how it will fund itself in the future. A major issue is productivity, and this is a tough subject for academics—teaching, learning and research are not an assembly line. He said secular change is occurring in higher education in this nation. Institutions have been overspending for far too long and there is not enough money now to go around. The Governor is looking to find continuous improvement and shared practices.

8198

The Rector asked Mr. Sandridge to begin the presentation. Mr. Sandridge said his objective was to provide information that would create discussion about the issues. He said an examination of the University’s revenue sources reveals that the two major sources are tuition and private funds. He pointed out that these are not new issues, but there are going to be proposals in state government and among constituents, and it would be best for the University to be in the lead and not merely reacting.

Situation Analysis - Environment

Student demand for the University’s product is very high, and there is pressure to increase in-state enrollment to 75% from the 69-70% of undergraduate enrollment that it is now. It has been demonstrated, however, that a student will have a 96% chance of admission to at least one of four state schools if they apply to all four including JMU, William and Mary, Virginia Tech, and UVA. The University has put a “stake in the ground” on the 70/30 in-state, out-of-state ratio.

Mr. Sandridge said the University received 23,000 applications in 2010, a record number. In 2009, the University awarded 14% of the degrees awarded by state public institutions.

Undergraduate tuition is a major source of revenue. Some will be concerned about tuition increases they perceive to be too high, while others understand a couple of institutions in the state, including the University, have the ability to help themselves and at the same time help the state by not asking for additional funding. Financial aid is critically important to any discussion of tuition, and if the University increases tuition in any substantial way we will need to look more carefully at support for middle income families.

Mr. Sandridge said that out-of-state students pay 249% of the cost of education while in-state students pay just 67% of the cost of education. The University is dependent on out-of-state tuition to support programs including medical education and graduate education.

Efficiency is an issue for higher education generally. The University, relatively speaking, is operating on a very efficient framework. Even so, we need to demonstrate that we continue to implement strategies to gain efficiencies and reduce costs.

Mr. Sandridge said we are a point where we ought to consider some bold moves, however, we need to be able to demonstrate to the public and state government that we know what we’re doing.

8199

Situation Analysis — Resource Facts and Figures

Mr. Sandridge turned to Ms. Sheehy to provide some facts and figures. Ms. Sheehy pointed out that the gap between the 1990 general fund appropriation per in-state student inflated and the actual appropriation is now close to $8,000. There is less funding per student in total than 20 years ago. For the first time, in-state students are paying more in tuition than the state is paying on their behalf.

The “base budget adequacy” model, which is what the state (not the University) has determined as the minimum cost of an in-state student’s education, includes a policy that the state should pay 67% of the cost of education. In fiscal year 2010, the state funded 44.5% of the cost. Ms. Sheehy emphasized that this model is a state calculation, for instance, the Law School pricing is well above base budget adequacy which reflects their determination of the costs to function as one of the top ten law schools in the nation.

Not only has the state reduced funding for the University over time, it now takes some money generated by the University for the state general fund. Net general fund support in 2010-2011 will be $145.3 million, a drop from $147.3 million in 2009-2010. Adding in non-general fund reversions to the state, the total state operating support to the University will be $133.6 million in 2010-2011, a drop from $139 million in 2009-2010. In other terms, state funding has dropped from approximately 37% of the University’s 2001-2002 educational and general budget to about 17% of the budget for 2010-2011. The state non-general fund support for capital projects has dropped significantly for the 2010-2012 biennium.

Situation Analysis — Productivity Gains and Cost Containment

Ms. Sheehy said higher education is very focused on cost containment. Some institutions have used outside consultants but others have established internal task forces. She said the consultants generally come up with very similar lists for different institutions and we are well aware of the areas that they identify.

The University has worked to contain costs in many of the areas identified at other institutions. The areas we have focused on are educational enhancements, centralizing services, improving space utilization, streamlining and/or automating processes, reorganizing and forming partnerships, finding ways of creating revenue, managing assets better, and outsourcing. Ms. Sheehy provided examples of the University’s efforts in all of these areas. For instance, the University has outsourced student e-mail, the information technology “help desk”, dining and mail services, surplus property handling,

8200

vehicle rental, child care, arena management, and at least 26 other services partially or wholly outsourced to multiple vendors.

Ms. Sheehy listed some standard measures of outcomes, including a 2008-2009 six-year graduation rate of 93%; a top 25 ranking among national universities by US News and World Report; growth in undergraduate student enrollment which has been 1,273 since 2000; we have avoided layoffs; we have reduced the staff turnover rate from 10.9% in fiscal year 2008 to 2.4% through the third quarter of fiscal year 2010 (Ms. Sheehy stated this may be as much the economy as anything else); faculty salaries average 29th among AAU institutions and in the 30th percentile in the SCHEV faculty salary group (the goal has been the 60th percentile); and the student/faculty ratio has increased from 15 to 1 to 16 to 1.

Situation Analysis — Cost of Degrees

Ms. Sheehy said there is no nationally accepted methodology of what it should cost to award a degree. The University is developing a methodology to determine that number for each school. She presented some statistics that were issued by NCHEMS showing that the funding per bachelor’s award at the University is $128,908, with total funding for all degree awards at $73,590. The methodology for determining these numbers is not apparent,

Institutional Priorities

The second part of the presentation focused on institutional priorities. Ms. Sheehy said two major priorities are sustaining current operations and enhancing academic programs. She said Dr. Garson would address academic programs. One of the most pressing issues in sustaining current operations is faculty and staff salaries. The University’s faculty and staff have not received a raise in three years. Other funding priorities are supporting operations and maintenance for new facilities, offsetting future state budget reductions, funding deferred maintenance, keeping the commitment to the College of Arts and Sciences on future funding, and hiring new faculty as necessary, particularly in Architecture and the School of Engineering.

Dr. Garson focused on the Commission on the Future of the University priorities for his presentation on academic goals. He said the first goal is enhancing the student experience. One of the ideas that has gained some momentum is adding a fourth-year “capstone” requirement in the undergraduate curriculum which consist of a major research project and paper.

Dr. Garson said studying, improving, and expanding the University’s international engagements was a priority, both by bringing programs to the University and providing opportunities for

8201

our students to study abroad. Ms. Dorsey added that one of the

advantages of having international students at the University is the prospect of bringing global commerce to Virginia.

A third academic goal is to advance the University’s standing in science, research, and technology. Among other strategies that he outlined briefly, Dr. Garson said this could be accomplished through targeting incremental dollars to faculty in three to five pan-University areas.

Tools for Addressing Institutional Priorities

The final part of the presentation examined the tools available to address the University’s priorities.

Ms. Sheehy said increasing tuition is a primary method of addressing the funding needs. Options include increasing tuition for all undergraduate students, resetting the price of undergraduate education for entering students with full implementation over four years, or creating differential tuition for the different schools. The concern about differential tuition is if it is based on the actual costs to educate students, Nursing, Engineering, and Education have the highest costs and these are areas in which we want to encourage students to study.

Ms. Sheehy showed graphs of undergraduate in-state and out-of-state tuition and fees compared to peers. At $9,872, the University is only slightly above the public average of $8,617 and far below the private average of $38,924 for in-state tuition. In-state tuition is well below the overall average of $18,315. At $31,872, the University exceeds the overall average for out-of-state tuition, which is $29,469. The public average is $25,020. Only Michigan has a higher out-of-state tuition among the public peers.

Enrollment growth is another way to generate revenue and to attain critical mass in certain disciplines. By growing in total number of students, the University can increase the number of in-state seats without changing the 70/30 ratio.

Annual Giving is an area that has been identified as having potential for additional revenue. Only 18% of current alumni contribute, with an average contribution per donor of $709.

Ms. Sheehy said there are opportunities for improving efficiency and containing costs which are being pursued at the University. She mentioned making Procurement Services a self-sufficient operation, more effectively utilizing the space available at the University rather than building or renting new space, and focusing on energy conservation. She said a program to retrofit energy hog buildings is underway and the goal is to save enough money to cover inflation of energy costs, i.e. to keep the costs constant.

8202

Ms. Sheehy said the University is looking at consolidating services where feasible by examining duplication of services.

Dr. Garson presented some measures to improve academic efficiency including the creation of the Center for Effective Teaching in Higher Education, examining faculty teaching and workloads to be sure they are in line with school expectations, and right-sizing departments and majors including looking closely at courses with fewer than 10 students.

Although the University leads public peers in graduation rates, any improvement would affect efficiency. An additional way of improving efficiency and effectiveness is through partnerships such as the PRODUCED in Virginia program that results in a bachelor of science in Engineering degree without ever stepping foot on the University Grounds. This is a combination of community college work with online courses. Distance education does not require additional on-Grounds resources.

Dr. Garson said another initiative is to add a teaching requirement for all Ph.D. programs because teaching can be delivered at a lower pay rate than with tenure track faculty. In addition, doctoral students will benefit by designing a course, leading a class, and demonstrating to potential academic employers that they have more experience than other candidates who have not served as teachers of record.

Dr. Garson said increasing the courses designed to illustrate connections across a discipline using learning centers will produce a more effective, integrated, active learning environment and non-track faculty or graduate students could cover the learning centers. Virginia Tech’s Math Emporium uses this model.

Dr. Garson’s final point was that moving some students through the undergraduate program in three rather than four years would conserve resources and increase the number of graduates. It was pointed out that motivated students can do this now. Although some leave in three years, many take more credits than needed for graduation and stay for the full four years.

In closing the session, the Rector thanked the presenters and asked if there were any additional questions. Hearing none, he moved on to the final session of the Retreat.

Board Activities—Committee Structure

The Rector said in order to hold a vice rector election, eleven Board Members must be physically assembled in one location. After some discussion, the consensus of the Board was to hold the election the afternoon before the September 14 meeting.

8203

The Rector asked the Board Members to send him their preferences for committee membership by the following week. He said he would announce committee chairs by the end of the month. He plans to hold open the Finance committee chair until the vice rector is elected.

The Rector said the performance measures can be related to Board committees, and he thought it would be appropriate to have each committee cover the applicable metrics in their meetings. He said there were too many issues at the moment to address this, and so he would put this off for a year in the hope that it would be pursued in the future.

By Chapter 9, Title 23 of the Code of Virginia of 1950, as amended, there is created a corporation under the name and style of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia (the "University"); which is governed by a Board of Visitors (the "Board" or the "Board of Visitors"), which is vested with the supervision, management and control of the University.

Pursuant to Title 23 of the Code of Virginia of 1950, as amended, the University is classified as an educational institution of the Commonwealth.

By Chapter 4.10, Title 23 of the Code of Virginia of 1950, as amended (the "Act"), the University entered into a management agreement with the Commonwealth of Virginia which was enacted as Chapter 3 of Chapter 933 of the 2006 Virginia Acts of Assembly, as amended, pursuant to which the University is classified as a public institution of higher education and the University is empowered with the authority to undertake and implement the acquisition of any interest in land, including improvements on the acquired land at the time of acquisition, new construction, improvements or renovations and to borrow money and make, issue and sell bonds of the University for such purposes, including the refinancing of any such facilities.

Pursuant to a resolution adopted on June 11, 2010 (the "Authorizing Resolution"), the Board determined to finance and/or refinance capital improvements to the University's educational facilities located in the City of Charlottesville and/or Albemarle County, Virginia, including certain capital improvements identified therein (collectively, the "Project") and delegated to certain officers of the University pursuant to the University's Board-approved debt and interest rate risk management policies the power to approve the final terms of such financing, within certain stated parameters.

For the purpose of providing funds to finance and refinance the acquisition, construction and equipping of the Project, the Board, pursuant to the powers granted it under Section 23-75 of the Code of Virginia of 1950, as amended, has determined to adopt this Resolution (the "Board Resolution") authorizing the issuance of general revenue pledge bonds of the University as Series 2010 Bonds (the "Series 2010 Bonds").

All the Series 2010 Bonds shall bear interest (a) from their dated date, if authenticated prior to March 1, 2011, or (b) otherwise from the September 1 or March 1 that is, or that immediately precedes, the date on which such Bond is authenticated (unless payment of interest is in default, in which case such Bond shall bear interest from the date of which interest has been paid).

Both principal of and interest on the Series 2010 Bonds shall be payable in lawful money of the United States of America, but only from the revenues lawfully available therefor pursuant to the Act and pledged to the payment thereof as hereinafter provided. Principal of the Series 2010 Bonds shall be payable upon presentation and surrender of the Series 2010 Bonds as they become due at the designated office of the Paying Agent.

The Registrar shall not be required to transfer or exchange any Series 2010 Bond selected or called for redemption pursuant to the provisions therein or from a Record Date through the next succeeding Interest Payment Date.

Whenever any Series 2010 Bonds shall be surrendered for registration of transfer, the University shall execute and the Registrar shall authenticate and deliver a new Series 2010 Bonds, of authorized denominations of the same maturity and interest rate and for a like aggregate principal amount. Such transfer shall be without charge to the Bondholder, except that the Registrar shall require the Bondholder requesting such transfer to pay any tax or other governmental charge required to be paid with respect to such transfer.

Notices sent to Bondholders pursuant to this Bond Resolution shall be sent to the addresses shown on the registration books maintained by the Registrar or such other address as may be filed with the Registrar for such purpose.

*   *   *   1.  to any Bondholder, if an Event of Default (as hereinafter defined) shall have occurred and be continuing; and
            2.  to the Holders of 25% or more in aggregate principal amount of the Series 2010 Bonds then outstanding, at any time.

*   1.  **Temporary Series 2010 Bonds**. The Series 2010 Bonds may be issued in temporary form exchangeable for definitive Series 2010 Bonds when ready for delivery. Any temporary Bond may be printed, lithographed or typewritten, shall be of such denomination as may be determined by the University and may contain such reference to any of the provisions of this Resolution as may be appropriate. A temporary Bond may be in the form of a single Bond payable in installments, each on the date, in the amount and at the rate of interest established for the Series 2010 Bonds maturing on such date.

Until so exchanged, the temporary Series 2010 Bonds shall be entitled to the same benefits under this Resolution as definitive Series 2010 Bonds authenticated and delivered hereunder.
    2.  **Series 2010 Bonds Mutilated, Lost, Destroyed or Stolen**. If any Series 2010 Bond shall become mutilated, the University, at the expense of the Bondholder of such Series 2010 Bond, shall execute, and the Registrar shall thereupon authenticate and deliver, a new Series 2010 Bond of like tenor bearing a different number in exchange and substitution for the Series 2010 Bond so mutilated, but only upon surrender to the Registrar of the Series 2010 Bond so mutilated. Every mutilated Series 2010 Bond so surrendered to the Registrar shall be canceled by it and shall be delivered to, or upon the order of, the University. If any Series 2010 Bond shall be lost, destroyed or stolen, evidence of the ownership thereof and of such loss, destruction or theft may be submitted to the University, and the Registrar and, if such evidence be satisfactory to both of them and indemnity satisfactory to them shall be given, the University, at the expense of the Bondholder, shall execute, and the Registrar shall thereupon authenticate and deliver, a new Series 2010 Bond of like tenor bearing a different number in lieu of and in substitution for the Series 2010 Bond so lost, destroyed or stolen (or if any such Series 2010 Bond shall have matured or shall be about to mature, instead of issuing a substitute Series 2010 Bond, the Paying Agent may pay the same without surrender thereof). The University may require payment of a sum not exceeding the actual cost of preparing each new Series 2010 Bond issued under this Section and of the related expenses which may be incurred by the University, the Registrar, and the Paying Agent. Any Series 2010 Bond issued under the provisions of this Section in lieu of any Series 2010 Bond alleged to be lost, destroyed or stolen shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation on the part of the University whether or not the Bond so alleged to be lost, destroyed or stolen be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to the benefits of this Resolution with all other Series 2010 Bonds secured by this Bond Resolution.
    3.  **Terms and Conditions for Issuance and Delivery of the Series 2010 Bonds**.

When the documents mentioned above in this Section shall have been filed with the Registrar and when the Series 2010 Bonds shall have been executed as required by this Bond Resolution, the Registrar shall deliver such Bonds to or upon the order of the Underwriters, but only upon payment to the Custodian of the purchase price of such Bonds.

The proceeds of such Bonds shall be deposited as described in Section 4.1.

*   1.  **Book Entry Provisions**. The provisions of this Section 2.11 shall apply to the Series 2010 Bonds so long as all of the Series 2010 Bonds shall be maintained in book-entry form with a Securities Depository, any other provisions of this Bond Resolution to the contrary notwithstanding.
        1.  The principal or redemption price of and interest on the Series 2010 Bonds shall be payable to the Securities Depository, or registered assigns, as the registered owner of the Series 2010 Bonds, in same day funds on each date on which the principal of, and premium, if any, or interest on the Series 2010 Bonds is due as set forth in this Bond Resolution and in the Series 2010 Bonds. Such payments shall be made to the offices of the Securities Depository specified by the Securities Depository to the University and Paying Agent in writing. Without notice to or the consent of the beneficial owners of the Series 2010 Bonds, the University and the Securities Depository may agree in writing to make payments of principal and interest in a manner different from that set out herein. If such different manner of payment is agreed upon, the University shall give the Paying Agent written notice thereof, and the Paying Agent shall make payments as if set forth herein. Neither the University nor the Paying Agent shall have any obligation with respect to the transfer or crediting of the appropriate principal, premium, if any, and interest payments to participants of the Securities Depository or the beneficial owners of the Series 2010 Bonds or their nominees.
        2.  The Paying Agent at the written direction of the University may replace any Securities Depository as the depository for the Series 2010 Bonds with another qualified securities depository or discontinue the maintenance of the Series 2010 Bonds in book-entry form at any time if the University determines to do so. Notice of any determination above shall be given to such Securities Depository at least 30 days prior to any such discontinuation (or such fewer number of days as shall be acceptable to such Securities Depository). The University may undertake to locate a qualified replacement Securities Depository and/or may discontinue the book-entry system of evidencing ownership of the Series 2010 Bonds.
        3.  If the University discontinues the maintenance of the Series 2010 Bonds in book-entry form, the University will issue replacement Series 2010 Bonds directly to the participants in the former Securities Depository or, to the extent requested by any such participant, to the beneficial owners of the Series 2010 Bonds as further described in this Section. At the written direction of the University, the Paying Agent shall notify participants and the beneficial owners of the Series 2010 Bonds, by mailing an appropriate notice to the Securities Depository, or by other means deemed appropriate by either the Securities Depository or the Paying Agent, that the University will issue replacement Series 2010 Bonds directly to the participants shown on the records of the Securities Depository or, to the extent requested by any participant, to beneficial owners of the Series 2010 Bonds shown on the records of such participant, as of a date set forth in such notice, which shall be a date at least 10 days after receipt of such notice by the Securities Depository (or such fewer number of days as shall be acceptable to the Securities Depository).

In the event that replacement Series 2010 Bonds are to be issued to participants in the Securities Depository or to beneficial owners of the Series 2010 Bonds, the University shall promptly have prepared replacement Series 2010 Bonds registered in the names of the participants as shown on the records of the former Securities Depository or, to the extent requested by any participant, in the names of the beneficial owners of Series 2010 Bonds shown on the records of such participant, as of the date set forth in the notice delivered in accordance with the immediately preceding paragraph.

The form set forth in Exhibit A may be modified to include any variations, omissions or insertions that are necessary or desirable in the delivery of replacement certificates in printed form. In delivering replacement certificates, the Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely, without independent investigation, on the records of the former Securities Depository as to its participants and the records of the participants acting on behalf of the beneficial owners. The Series 2010 Bonds will thereafter be registrable and exchangeable as set forth in Sections 2.6 and 2.7.

*   *   1.  So long as there is a Securities Depository for the Series 2010 Bonds, (1) such Securities Depository shall be the registered owner of the Series 2010 Bonds, (2) transfers of ownership and exchanges shall be effected on the records of the Securities Depository and its participants pursuant to rules and procedures established by such Securities Depository and its participants, and (3) references in this Resolution to Bondholders, Holders or registered owners of the Series 2010 Bonds shall mean the Securities Depository and shall not mean the beneficial owners of the Series 2010 Bonds.
        2.  If the University replaces any Securities Depository as the depository for the Series 2010 Bonds with another qualified Securities Depository, replacement Series 2010 Bonds issued to such replacement Securities Depository shall have the same terms, form and content as the Series 2010 Bonds initially registered in the name of the predecessor Securities Depository or its nominee except for the name of the registered owner.
        3.  Each Securities Depository and the participants thereof and the beneficial owners of the Series 2010 Bonds, by their acceptance of the Series 2010 Bonds, agree that the University and the Paying Agent shall have no liability or responsibility with respect to (1) the accuracy of any records maintained by such Securities Depository or any Securities Depository participant; (2) the payment by such Securities Depository to any Securities Depository participant or by any Securities Depository participant to any beneficial owner of any amount due in respect of the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on the Series 2010 Bonds; (3) the delivery or timeliness of delivery by such Securities Depository to any Securities Depository participant or by any Securities Depository participant to any beneficial owner of any notice which is given to Bondholders; (4) the selection of the beneficial owners to receive payment in the event of any partial redemption of the Series 2010 Bonds; or (5) any consent given or other action taken by such Securities Depository or any nominee of such Securities Depository, as Bondholder.

1.    
      
    REDEMPTION OF THE SERIES 2010 BONDS
    1.  **Redemption of the Series 2010 Bonds**. The Series 2010 Bonds shall not be subject to prior redemption except as provided in this Article III.
        1.  Optional Redemption. The Series 2010 Bonds are subject to redemption prior to their maturity at the option of the University, in whole or in part on any date, at a redemption price equal to the greater of:

100% of the principal amount of the Series 2010 Bonds to be redeemed; or

the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to the maturity date of the Series 2010 Bonds to be redeemed, not including any portion of those payments of interest accrued and unpaid as of the date on which the Series 2010 Bonds are to be redeemed, discounted to the date on which the Series 2010 Bonds are to be redeemed on a semi-annual basis, assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months, at the Treasury Rate, plus 20 basis points;

plus, in each case, accrued interest on the Series 2010 Bonds to be redeemed to the redemption date.

*   *   1.  Extraordinary Optional Redemption. The Series 2010 Bonds are further subject to redemption prior to their maturity at the option of the University, in whole or in part upon the occurrence of an Extraordinary Event, as defined below, at a redemption price equal to the greater of:

100% of the principal amount of the Series 2010 Bonds to be redeemed; or

the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to the maturity date of the Series 2010 Bonds to be redeemed, not including any portion of those payments of interest accrued and unpaid as of the date on which the Series 2010 Bonds are to be redeemed, discounted to the date on which the Series 2010 Bonds are to be redeemed on a semi-annual basis, assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months, at the Treasury Rate, plus 100 basis points;

plus, in each case, accrued interest on the Series 2010 Bonds to be redeemed to the redemption date.

An "Extraordinary Event" will have occurred if the University determines that (1) a material adverse change has occurred to Section 54AA or 6431 of the Code (as such Sections were added by Section 1531 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, pertaining to "Build America Bonds"), or (2) there is any guidance published by the Internal Revenue Service or the Treasury Department with respect to such sections or any other determination by the Internal Revenue Service or the Treasury Department, which determination is not the result of any act or omission by the University, pursuant to which the University's Interest Subsidy Payment from the United States Treasury is reduced or eliminated.

*   *   1.  At the request of the Paying Agent, the redemption price of the Series 2010 Bonds to be redeemed at the option of the University shall be determined by an independent accounting firm, investment banking firm or financial advisor retained by the University at the University’s expense to calculate such redemption price. The Paying Agent and the University may conclusively rely on the determination of such redemption price by such independent accounting firm, investment banking firm or financial advisor and shall not be liable for such reliance.
        2.  If the Series 2010 Bonds are not registered in book-entry only form, any redemption of less than all the Series 2010 Bonds shall be allocated among the registered owners of such Series 2010 Bonds as nearly as practicable in proportion to the principal amounts of the Series 2010 Bonds owned by each registered owner, subject to the authorized denominations applicable to the Series 2010 Bonds. This will be calculated based on the following formula:

(principal amount to be redeemed) x (principal amount owned by owner)

(principal amount outstanding).

The particular Series 2010 Bonds to be redeemed shall be determined by the University, using such method as it shall deem fair and appropriate. If the Series 2010 Bonds are registered in book-entry only form and so long as DTC or a successor Securities Depository is the sole registered owner of the Series 2010 Bonds, partial redemptions shall be done in accordance with DTC procedures. It is the University's intent that redemption allocations made by DTC, its participants or such other intermediaries that may exist between the University and the beneficial owners be made in accordance with these same proportional provisions. However, the University can provide no assurance that DTC, its participants or any other intermediaries will allocate redemptions among beneficial owners on such proportional basis.

*   1.  **Notice of Redemption**. Whenever the Series 2010 Bonds are to be redeemed under the provisions of this Resolution, the Paying Agent shall, not less than thirty (30) nor more than sixty (60) days prior to the redemption date, mail notice of redemption to all registered owners of all Series 2010 Bonds to be redeemed at their registered addresses. The Paying Agent shall also mail a copy of any such notice of redemption to any Rating Agency. Any such notice of redemption shall identify the Series 2010 Bonds to be redeemed, shall specify the redemption date and the redemption price, and shall state that on the redemption date the Series 2010 Bonds called for redemption will be payable at the designated office of the Paying Agent and that from that date interest will cease to accrue. The Paying Agent may use "CUSIP" numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Bondholders, provided that any such notice shall state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Series 2010 Bonds or as contained in any such notice.
        1.  If at the time of mailing of notice of any optional redemption the University shall not have caused to be deposited with the Paying Agent money sufficient to redeem all the Series 2010 Bonds called for redemption, such notice may state that it is conditional in that it is subject to the deposit of such moneys with the Paying Agent not later than the redemption date, and such notice shall be of no effect unless such moneys are so deposited. Failure by the Paying Agent to give any notice of redemption or any defect in such notice as to any particular Bonds shall not affect the validity of the call for redemption of any Bonds in respect of which no such failure or defect has occurred. Any notice mailed as provided in this Bond Resolution shall be conclusively presumed to have been given whether or not actually received by any Holder.
    2.  **Effect of Calling for Redemption**. On the date designated for redemption, notice having been mailed in the manner and under the conditions hereinabove provided and moneys for payment of the redemption price being held in separate accounts by the Paying Agent in trust for the Holders of the Series 2010 Bonds to be redeemed, all as provided in this Resolution, the Series 2010 Bonds so called for redemption shall become and be due and payable at the redemption price provided for redemption of such Bonds on such date, interest on the Series 2010 Bonds so called for redemption shall cease to accrue, such Bonds shall cease to be entitled to any benefit or security under this Resolution and the Holders or registered owners of such Bonds shall have no rights with respect thereto except to receive payment of the redemption price.
    3.  **The Series 2010 Bonds Redeemed Not Deemed Outstanding**. The Series 2010 Bonds which have been duly called for redemption under the provisions of this Article, or with respect to which irrevocable instructions to call for redemption have been given by the Board to the Paying Agent in form satisfactory to him or her, and for the payment of the redemption price of which moneys shall be held in separate accounts by the Paying Agent in trust for the Holders of the Series 2010 Bonds to be redeemed, all as provided in this Resolution, shall not thereafter be deemed to be outstanding under the provisions of this Resolution.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, the University may only incur the following types of Credit Obligations in the event the conditions set forth below are met in each instance:
        1.  Limitation on Parity Credit Obligations. The University may incur, assume, guarantee or otherwise become liable on any Parity Credit Obligation, but only if, prior to the incurrence of each such Parity Credit Obligation, an Authorized Officer of the University certifies in writing that (1) taking into account the incurrence of such proposed Parity Credit Obligation (i) the University will have sufficient funds to meet all of its financial obligations, including its obligations to pay principal of and interest on all Credit Obligations, for all Fiscal Years to and including the second full Fiscal Year after the later of (A) the issuance of such Parity Credit Obligation and (B) the completion of any facility financed with the proceeds of such Parity Credit Obligation, and (ii) such Authorized Officer has no reason to believe that the University will not have sufficient funds to pay all amounts due under all indebtedness of the University during the term of such proposed Parity Credit Obligation, and (2) to the best of his or her knowledge, the University is not in default in the performance and observance of any of the provisions of this Resolution. Any such Parity Credit Obligation shall be secured by a pledge of Pledged Revenues on a parity with the pledge of Pledged Revenues herein, unless expressly subordinated to the pledge hereof.
        2.  Limitation on Section 9(c) Credit Obligations. The University may incur, assume, guarantee or otherwise become liable on any Credit Obligation pursuant to the provisions of Article X, Section 9(c) of the Constitution of Virginia, as such section may be amended from time to time, and may pledge and apply such portion of the Pledged Revenues as may be necessary to provide for the payment of any such Credit Obligation, the funding of reasonable reserves therefor, or the payment of operating and other reasonable expenses of the facilities financed in whole or in part with the proceeds of such Credit Obligation or facilities reasonably related to such facilities, and such pledge shall be senior and superior in all respects to the pledge of Pledged Revenues securing the Series 2010 Bonds and any other Parity Credit Obligations, but only if, prior to the incurrence of each such Credit Obligation, an Authorized Officer of the University certifies in writing that (1) taking into account the incurrence of such proposed Credit Obligation (i) the University will have sufficient funds to meet all of its financial obligations, including its obligations to pay principal of and interest on all Credit Obligations, for all Fiscal Years to and including the second full Fiscal Year after the later of (A) the issuance of such proposed Credit Obligation and (B) the completion of any facility financed with the proceeds of such proposed Credit Obligation, and (ii) such Authorized Officer has no reason to believe that the University will not have sufficient funds to pay all amounts due under all indebtedness of the University during the term of such proposed Credit Obligation, (2) to the best of his or her knowledge, the University is not in default in the performance and observance of any of the provisions of this Resolution, and (3) in connection with the issuance of such proposed Credit Obligation, the University has received an opinion of Bond Counsel to the effect that such proposed Credit Obligation has been validly issued under Article X, Section 9(c) of the Constitution of Virginia.
        3.  Limitation on Other Credit Obligations, Including Section 9(d) Credit Obligations. The University may incur, assume, guarantee or otherwise become liable on any Credit Obligation not described elsewhere in this Section 6.3, including any Credit Obligation incurred pursuant to the provisions of Article X, Section 9(d) of the Constitution of Virginia, as such section may be amended from time to time, and may pledge and apply such portion of the Pledged Revenues as may be necessary for the payment of any such Credit Obligation, the funding of reasonable reserves therefor, or the payment of operating and other reasonable expenses of the facilities financed in whole or in part with the proceeds of such Credit Obligation or facilities reasonably related to such facilities and such pledge shall be senior and superior in all respects to the pledge of Pledged Revenues securing the Series 2010 Bonds and any other Parity Credit Obligations, but only if, prior to the incurrence of each such Credit Obligation, an Authorized Officer of the University certifies in writing that (1) taking into account the incurrence of such proposed Credit Obligation (i) the University will have sufficient funds to meet all of its financial obligations, including its obligations to pay principal of and interest on all Credit Obligations, for all Fiscal Years to and including the second full Fiscal Year after the later of (A) the issuance of such proposed Credit Obligation and (B) the completion of any facility financed with the proceeds of such proposed Credit Obligation, and (ii) such Authorized Officer has no reason to believe that the University will not have sufficient funds to pay all amounts due under all indebtedness of the University during the term of such proposed Credit Obligation, (2) to the best of his or her knowledge, the University is not in default in the performance and observance of any of the provisions of this Resolution, and (3) the University has received an opinion of Bond Counsel to the effect that such proposed Credit Obligation has been validly issued under the relevant provisions of the Constitution of Virginia.
        4.  Limitation on Issuance of Indebtedness on a Parity with Qualifying Senior Obligations. Except for Credit Obligations issued pursuant to subsections (b) or (c) above or to refund any Qualifying Senior Obligation as described in subsection (e) below, no additional bonds or other obligations may be issued or incurred by the University on a parity with any Qualifying Senior Obligation.
        5.  Limitation on Additional Encumbrances. The University shall not encumber the Pledged Revenues in any manner (except as permitted in connection with Credit Obligations issued pursuant to subsections (a), (b) or (c) above or to refund any Qualifying Senior Obligation as described below), unless any such encumbrance is made junior and subordinate in all respects to the liens, pledges, covenants and agreements of this Resolution. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, however, the University may issue bonds to refund any Qualifying Senior Obligation and to secure such refunding bonds with the same source of revenues securing the Qualifying Senior Obligation being refunded. Upon the defeasance of the refunded Qualifying Senior Obligation pursuant to any such refunding, the refunding bonds will be considered Qualifying Senior Obligations for all purposes.
    3.  **Disposition of Assets**. The University may convey, sell or otherwise dispose of any property of the University as long as (1) such conveyance, sale or encumbrance is in the ordinary course of business, or (2) an Authorized Officer certifies in writing that, taking into account the conveyance, sale or other disposition of such property (i) the University will have sufficient funds to meet all of its financial obligations, including its obligations to pay principal of and interest on all Credit Obligations for all Fiscal Years to and including the second full Fiscal Year after such conveyance, sale or other disposition and (ii) such Authorized Officer has no reason to believe that the University will not have sufficient funds to pay all amounts due under all indebtedness of the University then outstanding.
    4.  **Insurance**. The University covenants that it will at all times carry or cause to be carried insurance policies with a responsible insurance company or companies, qualified to assume the risks thereof, or that it will maintain an adequate program of self-insurance, in either case sufficient to provide the University with insurance in such amount and covering such risks as the University shall deem to be reasonable and desirable.
    5.  **Rights of Bondholders Not to Be Impaired**. Except as otherwise set forth herein, the University covenants that no contract or contracts will be entered into or any action taken which might impair or diminish the rights of the Bondholders.
    6.  **Further Instruments and Actions**. The University covenants that it will, from time to time, execute and deliver such further instruments and take such further action as may be required to carry out the purposes of this Resolution.

    9.  **Tax Covenants**. The University shall not use or permit the use of any proceeds of Series 2010 Bonds or any other funds of the University, directly or indirectly, to acquire any securities or obligation, and shall not use or permit the use of any amounts received by the University or the Custodian with respect to the Series 2010 Bonds in any manner, and shall not take or permit to be taken any other action or actions, which would cause any Bond to be an "arbitrage bond" within the meaning of Section 148 of the Code or to impair its status as a "Build America Bond" under Section 1531 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. If at any time the University is of the opinion that for purposes of this subsection it is necessary to restrict or limit the yield on the investment of any moneys held under this Bond Resolution the University shall so instruct the Custodian, any trustee or the Paying Agent in writing, and such Custodian, trustee or Paying Agent shall take such action as may be reasonably necessary in accordance with such issuance.
        1.  The University shall not use or permit the use of any proceeds of Series 2010 Bonds or any other funds of the University, directly or indirectly, in any manner, and shall not take or permit to be taken any other action or actions, which would result in any of the Series 2010 Bonds being treated as an obligation not described in Section 103(a) of the Code by reason of classification of such Bond as a "private activity bond" (except for those Series 2010 Bonds which the University has designated or allocated as "private activity bonds" benefiting a 501(c)(3) organization) or an "arbitrage bond" or "bond not in registered form" within the meaning of Section 103(b) of the Code.
        2.  The University shall at all times do and perform all acts and things permitted by law and this Bond Resolution which are necessary or desirable in order to maintain the status of the Series 2010 Bonds as "Build America Bonds" under Section 1531 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and shall take no action that would result in impairing such status for federal income tax purposes.
        3.  The University covenants that it shall file the information report with respect to the Series 2010 Bonds required by Section 149(e) of the Code (currently Form 8038-G) within the time period provided in such Section.
        4.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the University may amend this section or alter or eliminate any actions or restrictions allowed or required by this section, if it receives an opinion of Bond Counsel that such amendments, alterations or eliminations would not alter the Bondholders' U.S. federal income tax treatment of principal and interest payments on the Series 2010 Bonds.

1.    
      
    EVENTS OF DEFAULT AND REMEDIES
    1.  **Events of Default**. Each of the following events is hereby declared to be an "Event of Default" under this Resolution:
        1.  due and punctual payment of the principal, purchase price or redemption premium, if any, of any of the Series 2010 Bonds is not made when the same become due and payable, either at maturity or by proceedings for redemption or otherwise;
        2.  due and punctual payment of any interest on any of the Series 2010 Bonds is not made when the same becomes due and payable;

        4.  an order or decree is entered, with the consent or acquiescence of the University, appointing a receiver or receivers of the University or any part thereof or of the revenues thereof, or if such order or decree, having been entered without the consent or acquiescence of the University, is not vacated or discharged or stayed on appeal within sixty (60) days after the entry thereof;
        5.  any proceeding is instituted, with the consent or acquiescence of the University, for the purpose of effecting a composition between the University and its creditors or for the purpose of adjusting the claims of such creditors pursuant to any federal or state statute now or hereafter enacted; or
        6.  the University defaults in the due and punctual performance of any other of the covenants, conditions, agreements and provisions contained in the Series 2010 Bonds or in this Resolution on the part of the University to be performed, and such default continues for thirty (30) days after written notice specifying such default and requiring same to be remedied is given to the Board by any Bondholder, provided that if such default is such that it can be corrected but cannot be corrected within such thirty (30) day period, it shall not constitute an Event of Default if corrective action is instituted by the University within such period and is diligently pursued until the default is corrected.
    2.  **Remedies**. Upon the happening and continuance of an Event of Default, hereunder, the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Series 2010 Bonds, by instrument or instruments filed with the University and proved or acknowledged in the same manner as a deed to be recorded, may appoint a trustee to represent the Holders of the Series 2010 Bonds for the purposes herein, which trustee may be the State Treasurer and shall be the same trustee so appointed with respect to all other outstanding Parity Credit Obligations. Such trustee may, and upon written request of the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Series 2010 Bonds then outstanding shall, in its own name:

by mandamus or other suit, action or proceeding at law or in equity enforce all rights of the Holders of the Series 2010 Bonds, including the right to require the University and its Board to collect fees, rents, charges or other revenues adequate to carry out an agreement as to, or pledge of, such revenues, and to require the University and Board to carry out any other agreements with the Holders of the Series 2010 Bonds and to perform it and their duties under the Act;

bring suit upon the Series 2010 Bonds;

by action or suit in equity, require the University to account as if it were the trustee of an express trust for the Holders of the Series 2010 Bonds; or

by action or suit in equity, enjoin any acts or things which may be unlawful or in violation of the rights of the Holders of the Series 2010 Bonds.

*   *   1.  Any such trustee, whether or not all such Series 2010 Bonds have been declared due and payable, shall be entitled as of right to the appointment of a receiver who may enter and take possession of any property of the University any of the revenues from which are pledged for the security of the Series 2010 Bonds and operate and maintain the same and collect and receive all fees, rents, charges and other revenues thereafter arising therefrom in the same manner as the University itself might do and shall deposit all such moneys in a separate account and apply the same in such manner as the court appointing such receiver shall direct. In any suit, action or proceeding by the trustee the fees, counsel fees and expenses of the trustee and of the receiver, if any, shall constitute taxable costs and disbursements and all costs and disbursements allowed by the court shall be a first charge on any fees, rents, charges and other revenues of the University pledged for the security of the Series 2010 Bonds.

Such trustee shall, in addition to the foregoing, have and possess all of the powers necessary or appropriate for the exercise of any functions specifically set forth herein or incident to the general representation of the Holders of the Series 2010 Bonds in the enforcement and protection of their rights.

*   *   1.  To the extent permitted by law, upon the happening and continuance of any Event of Default, then and in every such case any Bondholder may proceed, subject to the provisions of Section 7.5, to protect and enforce the rights of the Bondholders by a suit, action or special proceeding in equity or at law, either for the specific performance of any covenant or agreement contained herein or in aid or execution of any power herein granted or for the enforcement of any proper legal or equitable remedy as such Bondholder shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce such rights.
    
    1.  **Pro Rata Application of Funds**. Anything in this Bond Resolution to the contrary notwithstanding, if at any time the moneys available in the Debt Service Fund shall not be sufficient to pay the interest on or the principal of the Series 2010 Bonds as the same shall become due and payable, such moneys, together with any moneys then available or thereafter becoming available for such purpose, whether through the exercise of the remedies provided for in this Article or otherwise, shall be applied as follows:
        1.  If the principal of all the Series 2010 Bonds shall not have become due and payable, all such moneys shall be applied:

first: to the payment to the persons entitled thereto of all installments of interest then due and payable in the order in which such installments became due and payable and, if the amount available shall not be sufficient to pay in full any particular installment, then to the payment, ratably, according to the amounts due on such installment, to the persons entitled thereto, without any discrimination or preference except as to any difference in the respective rates of interest specified in the Series 2010 Bonds; and

second: to the payment to the persons entitled thereto of the unpaid principal of any of the Series 2010 Bonds which shall have become due and payable (other than Series 2010 Bonds called for redemption for the payment of which moneys are held pursuant to the provisions of this Resolution), in the order of their due dates, with interest on the principal amount of such Series 2010 Bonds at the respective rates specified therein from the respective dates upon which such Series 2010 Bonds became due and payable, and, if the amount available shall not be sufficient to pay in full the principal of the Series 2010 Bonds due and payable on any particular date, together with such interest, then to the payment first of such interest, ratably, according to the amount of such interest due on such date, and then to the payment of such principal, ratably, according to the amount of such principal due on such date, to the persons entitled thereto without any discrimination or preference.

*   *   1.  If the principal of all the Series 2010 Bonds shall have become due and payable, all such moneys shall be applied to the payment of the principal and interest then due and unpaid on the Series 2010 Bonds, without preference or priority of principal over interest or interest over principal, or of any installment of interest over any other installment of interest, or of any Bond over any other Bond, ratably, according to the amounts due, respectively, for principal and interest, to the persons entitled thereto, without any discrimination or preference.

Whenever moneys are to be applied by the trustee pursuant to the provisions of this Section, such moneys shall be applied by the trustee at such times, and from time to time, as the trustee in his or her sole discretion shall determine, having due regard to the amount of such moneys available for application and the likelihood of additional moneys becoming available for such application in the future; the deposit of such moneys with any Paying Agent, or otherwise setting aside such moneys, in trust for the proper purpose shall constitute proper application by the trustee; and the trustee shall incur no liability whatsoever to the Board, to any Bondholder or to any other person for any delay in applying any such moneys, so long as the trustee acts with reasonable diligence, having due regard to the circumstances, and ultimately applies the same in accordance with such provisions of this Resolution as may be applicable at the time of application by the trustee. Whenever the trustee shall exercise such discretion in applying such moneys, he or she shall fix the date (which shall be an Interest Payment Date unless the trustee shall deem another date more suitable) upon which such application is to be made and upon such date interest on the amounts of principal to be paid on such date shall cease to accrue. The trustee shall give such notice (or shall cause the Paying Agent to give such notice) as he or she may deem appropriate of the fixing of any such date and shall not be required to make payment to the Holder of any Bond until such Bond shall be surrendered to the trustee or any Paying Agent for appropriate endorsement, or for cancellation if fully paid.

Notwithstanding anything in this Bond Resolution to the contrary, this Section 7.3 shall be interpreted so that term "Series 2010 Bonds" or "Bonds" shall include the Series 2010 Bonds and any Parity Credit Obligations. In each resolution authorizing the issuance of any Parity Credit Obligation, the University agrees to provide for the trustee or paying agent thereunder to be the same entity as under this Bond Resolution, and further agrees to include provisions substantially identical to those contained in this Section 7.3.

*   1.  **Effect of Discontinuance of Proceedings**. In case any proceeding taken by any Bondholder on account of any Event of Default shall have been discontinued or abandoned for any reason, then and in every such case the University and the Bondholders shall be restored to their former positions and rights hereunder, respectively, and all rights and remedies of the Bondholders shall continue as though no such proceeding had been taken.
    2.  **Proceedings for Equal Benefit of All Bondholders**.

Reference is hereby made to the Series 2010 Resolutions for the provisions, among others, with respect to the custody and application of the proceeds of Bonds issued under the Series 2010 Resolutions, the funds charged with and pledged to the payment of the interest on and the principal of the Series 2010 Bonds, the nature and extent of the security, the terms and conditions on which the Series 2010 Bonds are or may be issued, the rights, duties and obligations of the University and the rights of the holders of the Series 2010 Bonds. Capitalized terms not defined herein shall be as defined in the Series 2010 Resolutions. By the acceptance of this Series 2010 Bond, the Holder hereof assents to all of the provisions of the Series 2010 Resolutions.

The Series 2010 Bonds are subject to redemption prior to their maturity at the option of the University, in whole or in part on any date, at a redemption price equal to the greater of:

100% of the principal amount of the Series 2010 Bonds to be redeemed; or

the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to the maturity date of the Series 2010 Bonds to be redeemed, not including any portion of those payments of interest accrued and unpaid as of the date on which the Series 2010 Bonds are to be redeemed, discounted to the date on which the Series 2010 Bonds are to be redeemed on a semi-annual basis, assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months, at the Treasury Rate, plus 20 basis points;

plus, in each case, accrued interest on the Bonds to be redeemed to the redemption date.

The Series 2010 Bonds are further subject to redemption prior to their maturity at the option of the University, in whole or in part upon the occurrence of an Extraordinary Event, as defined below, at a redemption price equal to the greater of:

100% of the principal amount of the Series 2010 Bonds to be redeemed; or

the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to the maturity date of the Series 2010 Bonds to be redeemed, not including any portion of those payments of interest accrued and unpaid as of the date on which the Series 2010 Bonds are to be redeemed, discounted to the date on which the Series 2010 Bonds are to be redeemed on a semi-annual basis, assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months, at the Treasury Rate, plus 100 basis points;

plus, in each case, accrued interest on the Series 2010 Bonds to be redeemed to the redemption date.

An "Extraordinary Event" will have occurred if the University determines that (1) a material adverse change has occurred to Section 54AA or 6431 of the Code (as such Sections were added by Section 1531 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, pertaining to "Build America Bonds"), or (2) there is any guidance published by the Internal Revenue Service or the Treasury Department with respect to such sections or any other determination by the Internal Revenue Service or the Treasury Department, which determination is not the result of any act or omission by the University, pursuant to which the University's Interest Subsidy Payment from the United States Treasury is reduced or eliminated.

At the request of the Paying Agent, the redemption price of the Series 2010 Bonds to be redeemed at the option of the University shall be determined by an independent accounting firm, investment banking firm or financial advisor retained by the University at the University’s expense to calculate such redemption price. The Paying Agent and the University may conclusively rely on the determination of such redemption price by such independent accounting firm, investment banking firm or financial advisor and shall not be liable for such reliance.

If the Series 2010 Bonds are not registered in book-entry only form, any redemption of less than all the Series 2010 Bonds shall be allocated among the registered owners of such Series 2010 Bonds as nearly as practicable in proportion to the principal amounts of the Series 2010 Bonds owned by each registered owner, subject to the authorized denominations applicable to the Series 2010 Bonds. This will be calculated based on the following formula:

(principal amount to be redeemed) x (principal amount owned by owner)

(principal amount outstanding).

The particular Series 2010 Bonds to be redeemed shall be determined by the University, using such method as it shall deem fair and appropriate. If the Series 2010 Bonds are registered in book-entry only form and so long as DTC or a successor Securities Depository is the sole registered owner of the Series 2010 Bonds, partial redemptions shall be done in accordance with DTC procedures. It is the University’s intent that redemption allocations made by DTC, its participants or such other intermediaries that may exist between the University and the beneficial owners be made in accordance with these same proportional provisions. However, the University can provide no assurance that DTC, its participants or any other intermediaries will allocate redemptions among beneficial owners on such proportional basis.

If any of the Series 2010 Bonds or portions thereof are called for redemption, the Paying Agent shall mail a notice of the call for redemption, identifying the Series 2010 Bonds or portions thereof to be redeemed, not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date, to the registered owner of each Series 2010 Bond to be redeemed, at its address as it appears on the registration books kept by the Registrar. Provided funds for their redemption are on deposit at the place of payment on the redemption date, all Series 2010 Bonds so called for redemption shall cease to bear interest on such date, shall no longer be secured by the Pledged Revenues and shall not be deemed to be outstanding under the terms of the Series 2010 Resolutions. If a portion of this Series 2010 Bond is called for redemption, a new Series 2010 Bond in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion hereof will be issued to the registered owner upon the surrender hereof.

This Series 2010 Bond is transferable by the registered owner, in person or by its attorney duly authorized in writing, at the designated office of the Registrar, upon presentation of a written instrument of transfer and surrender of this Series 2010 Bond to the Registrar for cancellation. Upon the transfer, a new Series 2010 Bond or Bonds of the same aggregate principal amount, maturity date and interest rate will be issued to the transferee. No transfer will be effective unless represented by such surrender and reissue. This Series 2010 Bond may also be exchanged at the designated office of the Registrar for a new Series 2010 Bond or Bonds of the same aggregate principal amount, maturity date and interest rate without transfer to a new registered owner. Exchanges and transfers will be without expense to the holder except for applicable taxes or other governmental charges, if any. The Registrar shall not be required to transfer or exchange any Series 2010 Bond selected or called for redemption pursuant to the provisions hereof or from a Record Date through the next succeeding Interest Payment Date. All Bonds delivered in exchange or transfer shall be dated so that neither gain nor loss results from the transfer or exchange.

The University, the Paying Agent and the Registrar may treat the registered owner as the absolute owner of this Series 2010 Bond for all purposes, notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.

Neither the members of the Board nor any person executing this Series 2010 Bond are liable personally hereon or subject to any personal liability or accountability by reason of the issuance hereof.

This Series 2010 Bond will not be valid until the Certificate of Authentication has been signed by the Registrar.

The holder of this Series 2010 Bond shall have no right to enforce the provisions of the Series 2010 Resolutions or to institute action to enforce the covenants therein, or to take any action with respect to any Event of Default under the Series 2010 Resolutions, or to institute, appear in or defend any suit or other proceeding with respect thereto, except as provided in the Series 2010 Resolutions.

All acts, conditions and things required by the Constitution and laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia and by the rules and regulations of the Board to happen, exist and be performed precedent to and in the issuance of this Series 2010 Bond have happened, exist and have been performed as so required.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia has caused this Series 2010 Bond to be issued and caused this Series 2010 Bond to bear the manual or facsimile signatures of its Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer and its official seal to be impressed, imprinted, reproduced or lithographed hereon, all as of the dated date hereof.
