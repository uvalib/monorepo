One of these chairs was held over from the early eighties campaign. The price was raised from $200,000 to $250,000.

The single asterisk (\*) designates properties that were vacated, renovated, and modernized during the year. As a result, rates were increased to reflect the current market level when the units were re-occupied.

Rate increases are proposed for those properties which have not been recently vacated. The purpose of these rate increases is to gradually adjust those rents to market level.

Utility abbreviations are as follows: WS (water, sewer), E (electric), G (gas), O (oil), HP (heating plant), HVAC heating, venting, and air conditioning), A/C (air conditioning), and C (cable TV).

REPORT BY THE PRESIDENT
-----------------------

The President distributed to the Board copies of a report prepared the day before for the student group, Concerned Black Students. The report addresses the recommendations made in the 1987 Task Force Report, "Audacious Faith" (the Task Force was appointed by President O'Neil to study ways to improve the racial climate at the University). Reports of this sort, the President noted, typically have a lifespan of three to five years; the 1987 Task Force, as a planning group, was replaced in 1992, by the University's Council on Community, whose joint Chairs are Dean Guiton and Dr. Detmer. The report the President distributed summarizes what has been done to implement the recommendations of the 1987 "Audacious Faith."

The President discussed some of the highlights of the report, particularly the increases in financial aid for black students and the successes of the programs in the School of Engineering to retain and graduate black students.

As to the concerns expressed in recent weeks by Concerned Black Students, the President said the University administration is trying to begin a dialogue with them. The students, he said, are frustrated about financial aid and about the recruitment of black faculty, in spite of the University's demonstrable successes in both areas.

A copy of the report distributed to the Board is attached to these Minutes. (See Appendix B)

On motion, the meeting was adjourned at 11:10 a.m.

APPENDIX A
----------

1\. Establish three new levels for chairs: $2,000,000 for privately funded new position - includes base salary and supplement; $1,000,000 for a chair to anchor a department or teaching area - includes salary supplement plus discretionary funds; $500,000 for a typical Eminent Scholars Chair as well as a Research Professorship - includes salary supplement.

2\. In terms of visiting professorships, either the $1,000,000 or $500,000 level could be designated as a visiting professorship as agreed to by donor and recipient area.

3\. For Curry, Nursing and Architecture a designated number of chairs could be established at the $250,000 level (essentially half of the new $500,000 level) for the duration of our comprehensive campaign or until the designated number are committed - whichever comes first. Going forward from either of these two events, current chair levels will prevail universally.

4\. For Law and Darden, a designated number of currently marketed research professorships may be maintained at $250,000 until 12 months following the official kickoff of the campaign. Once the designated number of research professorships are committed or the time period elapses, whichever comes first, the new level for research professorships will prevail.

5\. A new minimum level of $100,000 to name either a graduate fellowship or undergraduate scholarship is recommended. A minimum of $25,000 permits a donor to become a "partner" with other donors in providing financial assistance to undergraduate and graduate students.

6\. Minimum levels for lectureships, prize/awards, and memorial/commemoratives were raised to $50,000.

7\. A new category of unrestricted endowment would require a minimum of $100,000 to name.

8\. A policy for naming centers, institutes, departments or programs is articulated, and is parallel to the policy for naming facilities.

Addressing the need to maintain a limited number of lower priced chairs and research professorships:

To accommodate the needs of the Curry School of Education, the School of Architecture, and the Nursing School, a specified number of Eminent Scholars Chairs will be set aside for each school at the $250,000 level (or half the new level of $500,000) for the duration of the University's comprehensive campaign. Once the specified number of chairs have been committed at the $250,000 level or the campaign comes to a close (whichever comes first), Eminent Scholar chair levels will be raised to whatever the current level is in effect at the time.

The number of chairs for each of the specific Schools follows:

Architecture 4\* \*One $200,000 chair held over from the first campaign is currently partially funded and is not included in this count.

One $200,000 chair held over from the first campaign is currently partially funded and is not included in this count.

CENTERS, INSTITUTES, DEPARTMENTS, PROGRAMS

Recommended policy: The Committee recommends that each naming opportunity be decided on a case by case basis through negotiations among the dean or director, administration, and the Board of Visitors with the following guideline as a starting point:

To name a center, department, program, or institute a donor should provide endowment to support one half of the projected operating costs.

CHAIR AND FINANCIAL AID ENDOWMENTS THAT DO NOT QUALIFY FOR A MATCH

Chairs and fellowships/scholarships established from School/Program discretionary funds can be endowed at the new minimum levels outlined above. Such endowed funds do not qualify for matching state funds.

APPENDIX B
----------

University of Virginia April 8, 1994

On April 7, 1994, members of the Concerned Black Students asked for immediate implementation of the items of "Audacious Faith," a 1987 Task Force Report that sought to improve the racial climate at the University. Such reports have typical lifespans of 3-5 years.

The University's Council on Community replaced the Task Force as a planning entity in 1992.

The following report (drawn from routine progress reports since 1987) summarizes what was done with the 1987 recommendations.

Recommendation 1: Provision of incentives to academic units to promote the hiring of black faculty.

• initiated performance evaluation criteria for department chairs, deans, and vice presidents that include success in attracting minority and women faculty;

• designated $500,000 placed in the provost's budget to fund loan lines (some 10 positions) to allow hiring of minority and women tenured or tenure-track faculty;

• in 1986-1993, 24 such lines were used, 14 for African-American faculty, the others for other minority faculty and for women faculty;

• as of August 1993, 12 of the 14 are still here; five are tenured;

• total number of African-American full-time, instructional and research faculty nearly doubled since 1983 (from 25-47);

• in academic year 1994, the Law School has made commitments to 12 new faculty members (11 instructional and one administrative), 8 of whom are women and/or minority group members; this includes two African-American women and two African-American men; success rates vary among schools; deans have standing orders to recruit actively in order to attract new and visiting minority faculty members; results are a primary factor in deans' performance reviews and salary settings.

Recommendation 2: Enhancement of efforts to recruit black faculty members.

This recommendation overlaps with #1, above. In addition to above incentives,

• faculty vacancies are advertised in publications that target minority audiences and are sent to historically black colleges and universities; schools make use of minority vita banks for faculty searches; search committees are obligated to make significant personal efforts to identify and recruit qualified minority candidates;

• schools and departments are regularly allotted incremental funds to cover the additional cost of providing competitive salaries for new and continuing minority faculty;

• in 1990, the University approved and put into effect the Faculty Recruitment and Appointment Procedures manual, which was updated in 1993. This manual details procedures to be used in recruiting and hiring, with specific attention to matters involving minority and women candidates;

• in 1983, 3 black faculty members held the rank of full professor; in 1993, 15 did.

Recommendation 3: Improved monitoring of and accountability for affirmative action faculty recruitment efforts.

• every vice president, dean, or unit director reports annually on activities and progress in meeting affirmative action goals;

• by Board of Visitors' resolution (1990), this information is presented annually in the form of a detailed report on progress; this report is delivered to the Board annually;

• by president's order, affirmative action hiring criteria were included commencing in 1993 in the evaluations of all deans, unit directors, and department chairs;

• by president's order, vice-presidents are required to submit quarterly reports to the president on all major searches;

• the affirmative action officer monitors all searches;

• as necessary, the president intervenes to require additional search or recruitment efforts.

Recommendation 4: Enhancement of efforts to retain black faculty.

• the percentage of tenured and tenure-track black faculty has increased since 1983 (1983 tenured -- 2.0%; 1993 tenured -- 3.1%; 1983 tenure-track -- 2.4%; 1993 tenure-track -- 4.2%);

• the provost reviews every case in which a dean recommends that a minority or woman faculty member be denied tenure to ensure that proper decisions were made and procedures were followed; when sufficient cause exists, the provost overrides denials recommended at the school level;

• some schools provide mentoring for minority and women junior faculty; others reduce teaching loads for junior members to allow for the research activities that enhance their opportunities for tenure;

• the Office of Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action conducts exit interviews with faculty who resign, and reports relevant findings to the deans and the provost.

Recommendation 5: Expansion of the number of black graduate students at the University.

• graduate students -- 1983, 2.7% African-American; 1993, 4.1%;

• first professional students -- 1983, 5.2% African-American; 1993, 10.1%;

• schools use candidate referral services, including affirmative action registers, for recruitment;

• although state support for graduate students and for graduate education deteriorated dramatically in 1990-93, faculty members supplemented available aid by designating research income for graduate student support, by shifting funds from other objects, and by personal contributions from staff and faculty members; this year, staff and faculty from the Health Sciences Center pledged more than $760,000 (of personal resources) to scholarships for minority and disadvantaged students; last year, they contributed $600,000 for this purpose and raised additional private gifts from other persons;

• Medicine has more than doubled minority enrollment; this spring, 11 minority students will graduate; 28 enrolled last fall;

• Engineering has increased its minority student enrollment from 6 in 1986 to 50 in 1993; the related fellowship support was derived almost entirely from faculty research grants;

• in 1991, Engineering secured an $864,000, five-year NSF grant to recruit, support, and graduate minority Ph.D. students;

• in 1992, the University ranked 8th out of 33 in the percent of African-American graduate students among AAUDE universities, which are our peer group.

Recommendation 6: Enhancement of activities to increase the interest of black students in attending the University of Virginia.

• Admissions and recruitment activities:

Functions include coordination and oversight of the summer and fall transition programs. A functional review, which is a regular and recurring element of quality control, of the Learning Needs and Evaluation Center was completed this year. As appropriate, the vice president for student affairs will order changes in this center.

Recommendation 15: Establishment of a committee to assure full use of the Luther P. Jackson Cultural Center.

An advisory committee to the Center -- consisting of faculty, administrators, and students -- existed prior to this recommendation in 1987. The Center's budget has grown from $28,500 in 1986-87 to $65,000 in 1993-94.

Recommendation 16: Encouragement of the University's growing emphasis of the intercultural programming by supporting incorporation of an Afro-American or African perspective into public presentations.

Recommendation 19: Enhancement of the Afro-American and African Studies program.

• in 1989, the University matched a $150,000 Ford Foundation grant that has permitted hiring teaching assistants and faculty in the Afro-American and African Studies Program; funding is now in jeopardy because of reductions ordered by the state in 1990-93 and recommended by the former governor in his 1994-96 budget;

• in 1994, there are some 55-60 Afro-American and African Studies majors; this major is the largest undergraduate interdisciplinary major in the University;

• 10 former Woodson Fellows are now full-time faculty members in the University.

Recommendation 20: Provision of a more welcoming and social environment for black students.

• residence staff have ongoing training regarding racial and ethnic issues; 26% of the residence staff is African-American; this proportion is approximately double the proportion of total enrollment of African-American students;

Recommendation 22: Study of the application of the honor system to determine if it provides equal treatment to all racial groups.

• the University, acting in behalf of the Honor Committee, commissioned a 1990 consultant's study of the honor system to evaluate the system's treatment of minority students. This study found no pattern of discriminatory treatment and strong support for the system among all identified student populations.

Recommendation 23: Appointment of blacks to high-level administrative positions.

Such appointments have been numerous in recent years, and they continue. Appointments include Bonnie Guiton-Hill as dean of the McIntire School of Commerce (1992), John W.

Recommendation 24: Establishment of the position of advisor to the president on minority affairs.

The director of the Office of Equal Opportunity Programs advises the president on minority affairs, equal opportunity, and affirmative action. Various senior level committees supplement this advisory system. Recently, the entire Equal Opportunity Office began to report to the president through his executive assistant, who works with the president on such issues on a daily basis.

Recommendation 25: Creation of the Office of Associate Provost for Student Academic Services.

This recommendation has already been addressed under # 11 - 13, above. The office was created and fully staffed in 1987. In 1993, a steering committee on student academic support made a full inventory of academic support services, distributed the information widely, initiated a tutor training program, provided departmental seed money to develop academic support services, and established a new leadership structure for the Summer Transition Program. As a result of a review conducted in 1993, this approach is being substantially altered. The Dean of the College is absorbing the functions of the office -- an arrangement that the review suggests will be more effective.

• the University Temporary Employment Service employs approximately 30% minority persons in its various enterprises; this service began in 1988 to meet the temporary employment needs of the University and to increase hiring of minorities. Through this service, minorities have the opportunity to increase their general office skills and become more competitive for classified salaried employment inside and outside the University;

• a skill-oriented training program is now being developed to help UVaTEMPS increase word-processing and spreadsheet skills; the program's goals are to improve the office skills of temporaries and to increase the hiring of minorities into full-time classified salaried positions;

• a joint U.Va. and Monticello Area Community Action Agency partnership supports the Summer Youth Works! Program; the program will employ at least 20 economically disadvantaged youths this summer; most participants will be minorities between the ages of 16 and 21;

• a partnership among U.Va., Monticello Area Community Action Agency, and Charlottesville Redevelopment & Housing Authority assists residents of public housing in finding jobs, obtaining preventative health care, and increasing educational opportunities; this program began in summer 1993 and has facilitated hiring of 7 African-American Westhaven residents into full-time salaried positions in Medical Records Department;
