Board of Visitors' minutes, Accession # RG-1/1/, Special Collections Dept., University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Va.

Minutes of meetings of the university's governing body which is the legal owner and operator of the institution. Recorded in the minutes are appointments and other personnel decisions concerning faculty, decisions about construction of facilities, gifts to the university, and all other board actions, decisions and resolutions.

A called meeting of the Board of Visitors was held on this date at 8 o'clock to consider the needs of the University which should be presented to the Legislature at its approaching session, the question of establishing at the University a college for women co-ordinate therewith, and such other matters as may be presented.

There were present the Rector, Armistead C. Gordon, Wm. H. White, Goodrich Hatton, John W. Craddock, Geo. R. B. Michie, Dr. W. F. Drewry, Dr. Frank W. Lewis and Walter T. Oliver.

Dr. Alderman presented to the Board the schedule of University needs which ought to be presented to the Legislature for its consideration. The several items were discussed at length, adopted and referred to the President to be presented to the Legislature at the proper time.

The CoOrdinate College matter was disposed of in the following resolution, offered by Mr. Michie and adopted by a vote of six to two, as follows: AYES, Messrs. Gordon, Craddock, Drewry, Lewis, Oliver and Michie, (6) NOES, Messrs. White and Hatton.

WHEREAS, The conditions of our modern life render it essential to the welfare of the State that young women as well as young men, have access to collegiate training in the arts and sciences, and,

WHEREAS, The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia believe that the most practical and efficient mode of meeting this need would be found in the erection of a woman's college near the University of Virginia, and,

WHEREAS, The Rector and Visitors are convinced that such a woman's college can be established and conducted in affiliation with the University without injuriously affecting the life, spirit, and traditions of the Institution;

THEREFORE, be it

RESOLVED: That the Rector and Visitors recommend that the General Assembly authorize them to establish and maintain, as soon as sufficient funds are available by appropriation or endowment, a college for white women, co-ordinate with the College of the University of Virginia, wherein shall be offered for women courses of instruction equal, though not necessarily the same as those given in the College of the State University for men, of equal breadth and thoroughness, and of ndentical standards of teaching and examination.

RESOLVED, further, that it is the sense of the Rector and Visitors that such college for women be located on the side of Charlottesville opposite the present site of the University, and shall not be co-educational in character.

RESOLVED, further, that it is the sense of the Rector and Visitors that a sum of money, not less than $100,000 is necessary as an appropriation to provide for the initial expenses of building, equipping, and planning the college, which sum shall be available when an equal amount shall have been guaranteed to the Rector and Visitors from other sources.

On motion, a committee of three, of which the Rector should be a member, was authorized to co-operate with President Alderman in presenting the aforesaid resolution to the Legislature. The Rector appointed Mr. Craddock and Mr. Michie to serve with himself on said committee.

The Phi Delta Theta Fraternity presented a petition to the Board praying for the privilege of erecting a club house on the vacant lot along west side of Rugby Road and between the Kappa Sigma House and the C. & O. Railway.

Said petition was granted, subject to the terms and conditions governing grants to fraternities, as adopted by the Board December 2, 1907, the site to be approved by a committee consisting of Dr. Alderman, Mr. Michie and Dr. Lambeth.

The matter of the Visiting Committee for the Observatory, which was discussed at the last meeting of the Board without action, was again brought to the attention of the Board by the President, and, after a full discussion, the following offered by Mr. White was adopted:

RESOLVED: That a committee is hereby appointed to be known as the "Visitors Committee of the Leander McCormick Observatory", whose duties shall be to make periodical visits to the Observatory at the University, and make such suggestions and recommendations to the Rector and Visitors as may seem to them appropriate, and for such action as the said Rector and Visitors may, in their discretion, see fit to take, the relation of said Committee to the University shall be terminable at the instance of either party. The said Committee, until otherwise determined by the Rector and Visitors, shall consist of the following gentlemen,-the Rector, President, Dr. Mitchell, Mr. McCormick, and Prof. Pickering of Harvard University.
