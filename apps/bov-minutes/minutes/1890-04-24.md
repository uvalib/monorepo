On the application of Profr Garnett asking for certain repairs and improvements to the buildings assigned him, the Proctor was directed to make such repairs only as in his judgment were needed for the preservation of such building, in accordance with the existing regulations of the Board as to what repairs are to be at the cost of the University, etc.

The contingent appropriations recommended in the Faculty's report to the Board at the last annual meeting, June 1889—;were ordered to be made—;the funds of the University being sufficient to justify them—;They were as follows.

On motion, resolved that five hundred dollars be added to the usual appropriation of four hundred and fifty dollars for the use of the Library, and that the additional appropriation be expended in books, it being the sense of the Board that the Librarian should complete the Catalogue without additional compensation.

On motion Section 12 of the same report in relation to letter boxes for students referred to Committee on Grounds, Buildings etc. for consideration & report to the annual meeting in June.

On motion, resolved, that the recommendations contained in "Annex A" accompanying the report of the Faculty be concurred in—; This paper reads as follows:

The Faculty respectfully suggest the following optional first year-course for Medical students. To induce a greater number of young men to return here after the first year they believe it will be necessary to make a change, even though it be an optional one, in the usual method of dividing the course into a first and second year—; Wishing likewise to utilize as far as possible the instruction and equipment of those schools which can contribute as collateral branches to medical education, we suggest that the proposed course consist of the following.

* Anat. & Mat. Med. (The regular course as it now stands);
* Chemistry, (The regular course unchanged);
* Biology, (Slightly modified to suit medical students);
* Physics, (Special course for medical students)

We suggest that the charges for Medical students in the above schools shall be as follows:

It is likewise suggested that the school of Anatomy be placed upon the same footing as the School of Chemistry in that those who obtain a proficiency will not be required to attend lectures during the coming session.

The Board received the communication of Adjunct Professor Dabney in relation to the establishment of a class in English and American History, and being favorably inclined to the suggestions therein contained, it is resolved that the matter be remitted to Profr Dabney with the request that he have the same considered by the Faculty and reported to the Board through the regular channel.

Resolved that,

1st. After maturely considering the question of whether to enlarge the Chemical Hall or to divide the class and grant the Professor an Assistant, the Board of Visitors decide it best for the present to let the hall remain as it is and grant the required assistant at a salary of $800.

Resolved 2nd

That the question of building a small extension for the use of Profr Dunnington and of lighting the building be referred to the Committee on Grounds & Buildings.

Resolved that, the communication of D. H. Howard be referred to the Faculty and that authority be conferred on the Faculty if they consider the case of Mr Howard one of peculiar merit, to grant him the credit asked upon his executing to the Proctor a bond for Thirty three 90/100 dollars with good security. This action is taken because Mr Howard is near the close of his second session at the University and is not to be regarded as a precedent.

Resolved, that Profr Thornton be authorized to advertise to the public the enlargement of the plant of the present Engineering School, and the addition of courses in Sanitary & Electrical Engineering, provided that, after conference with Profr Tuttle, Profr of Biology, & Profr Smith, Profr of Natural Philosophy, it be found practicable for them to assume charge respectively of these additional courses.

Messrs Randolph and Kean were elected members of the Executive Committee to fill the two vacancies in the Committee.

On motion the Board adjourned sine die.
