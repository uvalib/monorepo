## GIFTS, GRANTS AND CONTRACTS

The President distributed a list of gifts received by the University and a report on sponsored programs covering the period May 1, 1978, through June 30, 1978. Gifts for the period totaled $598,800. Also reported was $7,315,800 for the support of sponsored programs at the University of Virginia. The report was received by the Board of Visitors.

## DISCUSSION OF CAVALIER DAILY REQUEST

In response to a request for information about an appeal from the Cavalier Daily with respect to the payment of salaries to its staff, the President advised that he received an appeal from the decision of the Student Activities Committee which excluded salary payments to Cavalier Daily staff members. Before the President acted on this appeal, the Cavalier Daily rejected Student Activity Funds and began payment of salaries to staff members, thus making the appeal moot. The President advised that he has not received any further requests on appeals in the matter. Under Section 5.3 of the Manual, communications to the Board are channeled through the Office of the President. This will again be explained to the Cavalier Daily.

## DISCUSSION OF AN ATHLETIC REPORT

The President discussed with the Board a report, which he considers to be a presidential paper, from Mr. Eugene Corrigan, Director of Athletic Programs. Mr. Hereford advised the Board that he intends to make a statement about athletic matters on October 9, 1978.

## REVISED PATENT POLICY FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA

### Policy

Definition of University Research and Researcher

Administrative Responsibilities

1. Associate Provost for Research
2. The Office of Sponsored Programs
3. The University Research Policy Council

### Distribution of Royalties to the Inventor(s)

Inventions and Discoveries which are not the Result of University Research

The policy of the University of Virginia is to consider and, where appropriate, assist in the patenting and commercial development of discoveries or inventions which are the product of University research. Any person who may be engaged in University research shall be required to execute a patent agreement with the University in which the rights and obligations of both parties are defined.

For the purpose of this Patent Policy and any documents developed for its implementation, University research is defined as research and related activities by any person a) which are related in any way to duties or responsibilities for which he has been compensated either by or through the University or b) for which facilities owned, operated, or controlled by the University are used.

Products of research eligible for copyright protection are excluded from this definition.

Modification of this definition of University research may be effected by the terms of a contract between the University and another public or private agency or, in exceptional circumstances, in the patent agreement with an individual University researcher.

A researcher is any person who may be engaged in University research.

Responsibility for the administration of the University of Virginia Patent Policy is assigned to the Associate Provost for Research.

Decisions regarding the University's rights to an invention shall be made within a reasonable time so that an inventor's options are not compromised unnecessarily.

In general, the inventor(s) will receive from any product of University research fifteen percent of the gross royalties which accrue from inventions for which the University obtains a patent.

An institutional agreement between the University and an outside patent management firm, such as the University of Virginia Alumni Patents Foundation or Research Corporation, or between the University and a Federal agency, such as the National Institutes Of Health, will specify a distribution of royalties.

Individual grants or contracts for sponsored University research with public or private agencies may specify an assignment of patent(s) ownership and distribution of royalties of which the researcher shall be informed before research is conducted under such an award or contract.

The University normally will relinquish any claim to an invention or discovery which is judged by the Associate Provost for Research not to be the product of University research. However, in such cases the researcher may request that the invention or discovery be appraised by and, if appropriate, assigned to the University. In such cases, the terms of the agreement will be determined by the inventor and the University.
