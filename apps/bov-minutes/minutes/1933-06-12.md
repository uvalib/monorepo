Report from the Special Committee of the Board appointed by the Rector to consider settlement of the Seward Estate, was presented and approved.

I have checked all deeds of trust;

I have checked all insurance policies,

I have checked all tax payments.

I have transferred all Bank accounts to National Bank & Trust Company here, and since February 15th have had all except a small checking balance on Savings Account at 3% interest.

Each of the foregoing items requiring discussion was taken up separately and discussed in detail, and it was agreed that the following recommendations should be made to the Board of Visitors at its next regular or special meeting:

1. That the action of the Executor in selecting the National Bank & Trust Company of Charlottesville as the depository of the Estate's funds be approved.

2. That the action of the Executor in not undertaking to immediately force collection of past due obligations to the Estate be approved.

3. That the Executor be instructed not to make payment of delinquent taxes upon any of the real estate encumbered by deeds of trust securing notes or bonds to Dr. Seward.

4. That the action of the Executor in paying insurance premiums upon policies of insurance upon properties encumbered by such deeds of trust be approved, and that he be instructed to continue this practice whenever absolutely necessary so that the security of the Estate shall be properly maintained.

5. That the Executor be requested to proceed with the final settlement of the Estate as soon as may be possible after the expiration of the six months period provided by law.

6. That the Executor be requested to communicate with Mr. William J. Branch and Mrs. Helen F. Guthrie, and say to them that in the opinion of this Committee any action with reference to their respective proposals for the settlement of their indebtedness to the Estate would, at this time, be premature, but at the proper time the matter will be taken up with the Board of Visitors and given careful and sympathetic consideration.

Mr. Newcomb then called the attention of the Committee to the following situation.—; Mr. Randolph B. Turnbull, of Lawrenceville, Va., is now a fourth year medical student at the University. During the years 1931 and 1932 Dr. Seward lent young Mr. Turnbull the sum of $483.00 to enable him to stay in the University and Dr. Seward had promised Mr. Turnbull to lend him such additional money as he might need to complete his medical course. Mr. Turnbull, an exceptionally good student, will graduate this year and has already received an appointment as interne in the University Hospital. There is undoubtedly a moral obligation upon the estate to carry out Dr. Seward's promise. The matter was fully discussed and the Executor was requested to make a loan of $450.00 to Mr. Turnbull, taking his note therefore, payable three years after date, with interest at 6%, said note to be endorsed by Mr. Turnbull's father, Dr. F. R. Turnbull, of Lawrenceville, Va., by his sister, Miss Elizabeth Turnbull and by his cousin, Irby Turnbull. The Committee will request the Board at its June meeting to ratify and approve this loan.

I think to be absolutely on the safe side we may certainly count on the Estate showing a value of $250,000.00

I will collect about $6000.00 in interest during the six months period of administration, so the total of sound values which will pass through my hands will be about $256,000.00

Pay monthly @ $66.66 per month, for eighteen months, and we will accept this in full of any service rendered by us during said eighteen months, EXCEPT in case of suit to set will aside.

Your Committee, which was appointed by the Rector with reference to the recommendations made by Mr. W. Allan Perkins, as Executor of the Will of Walter M. Seward, having carefully considered said recommendations, report and recommend as follows:

1st. That the action of the Executor in selecting the National Bank and Trust Company of Charlottesville as the depository of the Estate's funds be approved.

2nd. That the action of the Executor in not undertaking to immediately force collection of past due obligations to the Estate be approved.

3rd. That the Executor be instructed not to make payment of delinquent taxes upon any of the real estate encumbered by deeds of trust securing notes or bonds to Dr. Seward.

4th. That the action of the Executor in paying insurance premiums upon policies of insurance upon properties encumbered by such deeds of trust be approved, and that he be instructed to continue this practice whenever absolutely necessary so that the security of the Estate shall be properly maintained.

5th. That the Executor be requested to proceed with the final settlement of the Estate as soon as may be possible after the expiration of the six months period provided by law.

6th. That the Executor be requested to communicate with Mr. William J. Branch and Mrs. Helen F. Guthrie, and say to them that in the opinion of this Committee any action with reference to their respective proposals for the settlement of their indebtedness to the Estate would, at this time, be premature, but at the proper time the matter will be taken up with the Board of Visitors and given careful and sympathetic consideration.

7th. Your committee further recommends that the compensation to the Executor shall be as follows:

$6,500 to be paid upon settlement and the balance, to-wit, $1200, in monthly installments of $66.66 per month for eighteen (18) months, which shall be in full payment of all services heretofore rendered and of any service rendered by the Executor during the eighteen months, except in case of suit to set aside the will.

Your committee also asks the Board to ratify and approve authority given by the committee to the Executor to make a loan of $450 to Mr. Randolph B. Turnbull, of Lawrenceville, Virginia, carrying out an oral promise of Dr. Walter M. Seward, the Executor to take Mr. Turnbull's note payable three years after date with interest at six per cent, said note to be endorsed by Mr. Turnbull's father, Dr. E. R. Turnbull, of Lawrenceville, his sister, Miss Elizabeth Turnbull, and by his cousin, Irby Turnbull.
