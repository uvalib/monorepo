At a called meeting of the Board of Visitors held at the City of Richmond, this 24th day of January 1912.

Present: Messrs. Harmon, Irvine, Drewry, Shackelford and White.

In the absence of the Rector, Mr. White was made Chairman and Mr. Harmon, Secretary.

The Board having been called to order, the Bill now pending before the General Assembly, entitled, "A Bill to Establish a Co-ordinate State College for Women," was submitted for discussion, whereupon after discussion, Mr. White offered the following; viz.-

Resolved: That the bill entitled, "A Bill to Establish a Co-ordinate State College for Women," now pending before the General Assembly of Virginia, and which has been brought before this Board somewhat suddenly, is a matter of such gravity as to call for the most serious consideration of the Board, and, in order that such consideration may be given to the matter, it is the sense of the Board that the General Assembly be requested to postpone a consideration of the Bill, until this Board can have an opportunity to form a correct judgment of the measure, as it affects the best interests of the University and of the people of the State.

—And Mr. Harmon offered the following:—

Resolved: That it is the sense of the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia that a co-ordinate college for women should be established at or near the University of Virginia, under the control of the Rector and Visitors of the University, but without co-education of the sexes in any of the courses, except the courses leading to the "Degree of Doctor of Philosophy." Further, it is the opinion of the Board that the bill now before the General Assembly does not conform to these principles.

Whereupon, Mr. Irvine offered as amendment to Mr. Harmon's resolution, the following: viz.—

—And, in view of the inability of the State financially to appropriate funds for this purpose at the present time; and, in further view of the fact that there is apparent division and misunderstanding on the subject among the alumni of the University, whose loyal and united support is so essential to its continued prosperity and advancement, it is further

Resolved: That we request that the said bill be passed by and no action be taken thereon by the General Assembly at its present session.

Thereupon, a vote was taken upon the resolution of Mr. White; and it was defeated by a vote of three to two; Messrs. White and Irvine voting in the affirmative, and Messrs. Drewry, Harmon, and Shackelford voting in the negative.

Thereupon, a vote was taken on the amendment to Mr. Harmon's resolution offered by Mr. Irvine, and the same was adopted by a vote of four to one; Mr. Harmon voting in the negative.

Whereupon, a vote was taken on the resolution offered by Mr. Harmon, as amended; and the same was adopted by a vote of three to two. Messrs. Harmon and White voting in the negative.

On motion, the meeting adjourned. Secretary, protem.
