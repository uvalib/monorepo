A special meeting of the Board was held on this date with the Rector, Fred W. Scott, Visitors Carson, Hall, McIntire, Rinehart, Williams and Walker, and Acting President J. L. Newcomb, present.

Minutes of the previous meeting, copies of which had been mailed to the members, were approved.

The meeting was called for the special purpose of giving consideration to the requests to be made of the Governor and Budget Commission covering the needs of the University for the biennium of 1932-34. Mr. Newcomb presented for consideration the following statement of needs in the fields of expense of operation and capital outlay

I beg to present the following needs of the University to be considered in connection with the budget requests for the biennium of 1932-34.

Private foundations, such as the General Education Board, International Education Board and the Rockefeller Foundation, are supplying money to several departments of the University, distributed over varying periods of years, in order to place the work of the University of Virginia on high university levels. These grants have been made in decreasing amounts each year, in the expectation that the State would gradually make appropriations to care for this work. Unless these grants can be gradually replaced by state appropriations, the graduate and professional departments of the University of Virginia will be seriously impaired.

MEDICINE

After contributing $800,000 towards the construction of our new Medical School Building, the General Education Board made a grant of $156,000, distributed over a six-year period, to provide an adequate teaching staff to place this department on the basis of a first class modern medical school From $38,000 a year this appropriation will drop to $15,000 in 1932-33 and will cease entirely at the end of that session. In order, therefore, to carry forward the work now being done, without any additions whatever, the following increase must be made by the State for the Biennium 1932-34: $23,000 in 1932-33 and $38,000 in 1933-34.

EDUCATION

The state has found it impossible to supply our need requested four years ago and repeated two years ago, for the construction of a University Practice School for the Department of Education. Since practice school training is necessary in all teacher-training institutions and since we did not have a Practice School, we entered into a co-operative agreement with the public school systems of the City of Charlottesville and the County of Albemarle, by which our students in Education use the schools of the City and County for supervised training. This program has been financed by a contribution of $20,000 a year by the General Education Board. This grant terminates at the close of the Session 1931-32. We have applied for a renewal of this grant and have been told that it cannot be continued by the General Education Board. They thoroughly approve of the co-operative scheme, and praise the results which we achieved, however, they decline to make a further grant and feel that it is the obvious duty of the State to care for us. There will be needed from the State, to carry forward our present necessary operations in this field, the sum of $20,000 a year for each year of the Biennium 1932-34.

NATURAL SCIENCES

The International Education Board has made a grant to the University of Virginia of $175,000, extending over a period of seven years, in gradually decreasing amounts, which enables us to do real graduate and research work in the fields of Biology, Chemistry, and Physics. Our agreed upon program calls for an expenditure in these fields of $45,000 each year of the Biennium 1932-34. Of this sum the International Education Board will supply $30,000 in 1932-33, and $20,000 in 1933-34. The State, therefore, should provide $15,000 in 1932-33 and $25,000 in 1933-34.

HUMANITIES

In the ancient languages, Germanic languages, Romanic languages, English and History, the General Education Board has made a grant to the University of Virginia of $120,000, distributed in decreasing amounts over a period of five years. In order to provide first grade graduate work in the humanities, it is provided that $40,000 a year will be expended in these fields during the Biennium 1932-34. The General Education Board will supply $30,000 in 1932-33 and $20,000 in 1933.34. Unless our graduate work is to be seriously crippled, the State must provide in this field $10,000 in 1932-33 and $20,000 in 1933-34.

SOCIAL SCIENCE

The Rockefeller Foundation has made a grant to the University of Virginia of $75,000, extending in diminishing amounts over a period of five years, in order to place the Social Science work of this Institution on real university levels. We are now spending through our Institute for Research in the Social Sciences $30,000 per year. For 1932-33 the Rockefeller Foundation will supply for this work $20,000, and for 1933-34 they have granted $15,000. We feel that the work now going forward must be continued. In order to do this, without any expansion whatever, it will be necessary for the State to provide in the fields of the Social Sciences an additional appropriation of $10,000 for 1932-33 and $15,000 for 1933-34.

RECAPITULATION

To replace monies now being supplied by private benefactions, all of which is necessary unless our work here is to suffer serious impairment, the following additional appropriations must be made for the Biennium 1932-34.

HOSPITAL

The two items of medical and laboratory supplies and medical and laboratory equipment exceeded the appropriation for the session 1930-31 by $15,000. The number of patients cared for in our Hospital is annually increasing, and an additional appropriation to the Hospital in the sum of $15,000 is urgently needed. Unless this can be granted we must refuse to admit to the Hospital many deserving citizens of Virginia in dire need of medical and surgical attention. Our hospital receipts from public ward patients decreased $15,700 last year, as a result of the general financial depression and its consequent unemployment. This sum represents an added contribution of our Hospital to care for the sick members of poor and unemployed families in this Commonwealth.

EXTENSION

In the important field of Adult Education we have entered into a co-operative undertaking with the other educational institutions of the State, by which this necessary work is carried forward. This co-operative effort has the enthusiastic endorsement of many prominent citizens of the Commonwealth and should go forward as planned. It will require an additional appropriation to the Extension Department of $15,000 per year.

SALARY SCHEDULE

We feel that it is of the highest importance to carry out our agreed upon professorial salary schedule. This schedule was carefully worked out and is based on length of teaching service. It was given months of study by a committee of our Governing Board, and when presented to the Rector and Visitors it received their unanimous and enthusiastic endorsement. It was then taken to the Governor and Director of the Division of the Budget, and agreed to and approved by Governor Byrd and Director Bradford. After approval of all legal authorities the schedule was promulgated by the President to the teaching staff of the University as an official statement of what the teaching staff could expect as a matter of right from the University authorities. As a direct result of this action, the annual turnover of professors has been greatly reduced. Nothing undertaken by the University in recent years has done as much to enable our entire teaching staff to put forward their best efforts. Failure of the State to continue this adopted policy would be more injurious to the welfare of the Institution than any change of policy that could be considered. In order to carry out this agreed upon schedule, $6,000 additional must be provided for the first year of the next biennium, and $15,000 for the second year.

LIBRARY

The Library, which has been called by the late President Alderman the beating heart of the University, is in dire need of strengthening. In this important field of the University's life an increase of $12,400 per year for each year of the coming biennium is urgently needed. A budget showing the detail of this expenditure is appended to this report.

STRENGTHENING EXISTING SCHOOLS

In order to provide better instruction in certain of our overcrowded schools, there is desperate need of four additional associate professors, two in English, one in History, and one in Sociology. This will require $15,000 a year of additional appropriation for the maintenance of the college and graduate departments.

FOLK MUSIC

Authorities on music seem to be agreed that the only substantial contribution of the Anglo-Saxon civilization to Music is in the field of Folk Songs. These songs are almost the sole possession of the older members of the pure-bred Anglo-Saxon in our mountain districts. These people are rapidly dying out, and if this music is to be preserved and handed down to posterity it must be collected now. In order to collect, classify, and make available to the public this Folk Music, an appropriation of $5,000 a year is requested, $3,750 for an associate professor of Music and $1,250 for traveling and supplies. This particular need of the University has already been brought forcibly to the attention of the Governor by Mr. John Powell, of Richmond, who is enthusiastically interested in this proposal and who is my authority for the statement that if not collected immediately it will be forever lost to posterity.

BUILDINGS AND GROUNDS

Between this date and the beginning of the next biennium, we will open for use in the University $625,000 worth of new buildings, - a $300,000 Law Building, a $220,000 Nurses' Home, and a $105,000 addition to the Chemical Laboratory. These buildings must be heated, lighted, and janitorial service provided. On the basis of a two-per cent maintenance charge, there should be added $12,500 to our appropriation in the field of Buildings and Grounds.

MINOR CAPITAL OUTLAYS

The appropriation passed by the last General Assembly carried an appropriation from the surplus budget of $60,000 for additional equipment, which was distributed over all departments of the University. We are in desperate need of the continuation of this appropriation. We therefore earnestly request a continuation of $30,000 a year in the field of new equipment, to be distributed over all departments of the University.

STATEMENT OF NEEDS OF UNIVERSITY FOR BIFNNIUM 1932-34.

After a general discussion of the matter, the following, offered by Mr. Hall, was adopted

Whereas, the expense of operation is of first importance to the continuation of the services of the University of Virginia to the Commonwealth, and,

Whereas, the Rector and Board of Visitors recognize the importance of maintaining the University in an efficient manner, and without further assistance from the State along this line the efficiency of the University will be handicapped, be it therefore,

RESOLVED, by the Rector and Board of Visitors that the President of the University in presenting the University Budget to the Governor and the Budget Committee present as the first needs of the University that part of the budget entitled "Expense of Operation", including $30,000 a year for minor capital outlay, and as of next importance the needs for capital outlay;

RESOLVED, further, That the Acting President be and is hereby authorized to present the foregoing needs to the Governor and Budget Commission.

Mr. Williams offered the following, which was adopted.

RESOLVED, That the Rector, Acting President and Senator Buchanan be requested to take up with the Governor the question of having the roads of the University taken over and maintained by the State Highway Department.

The meeting then adjourned.

The Rockefeller Foundation has made a grant to the University of Virginia of $75,000, extending in diminishing amounts over a period of five years, in order to place the Social Science work of this Institution on real university levels. We are now spending through our Institute for Research in the Social Sciences $30,000 per year. For 1932-33 the Rockefeller Foundation will supply for this work $20,000, and for 1933-34 they have granted $15,000. We feel that the work now going forward must be continued. In order to do this, without any expansion whatever, it will be necessary for the State to provide in the fields of the Social Sciences an additional appropriation of $10,000 for 1932-33 and $15,000 for 1933-34.

RECAPITULATION

To replace monies now being supplied by private benefactions, all of which is necessary unless our work here is to suffer serious impairment, the following additional appropriations must be made for the Biennium 1932-34.

HOSPITAL

The two items of medical and laboratory supplies and medical and laboratory equipment exceeded the appropriation for the session 1930-31 by $15,000. The number of patients cared for in our Hospital is annually increasing, and an additional appropriation to the Hospital in the sum of $15,000 is urgently needed. Unless this can be granted we must refuse to admit to the Hospital many deserving citizens of Virginia in dire need of medical and surgical attention. Our hospital receipts from public ward patients decreased $15,700 last year, as a result of the general financial depression and its consequent unemployment. This sum represents an added contribution of our Hospital to care for the sick members of poor and unemployed families in this Commonwealth.

EXTENSION

In the important field of Adult Education we have entered into a co-operative undertaking with the other educational institutions of the State, by which this necessary work is carried forward. This co-operative effort has the enthusiastic endorsement of many prominent citizens of the Commonwealth and should go forward as planned. It will require an additional appropriation to the Extension Department of $15,000 per year.

SALARY SCHEDULE

We feel that it is of the highest importance to carry out our agreed upon professorial salary schedule. This schedule was carefully worked out and is based on length of teaching service. It was given months of study by a committee of our Governing Board, and when presented to the Rector and Visitors it received their unanimous and enthusiastic endorsement. It was then taken to the Governor and Director of the Division of the Budget, and agreed to and approved by Governor Byrd and Director Bradford. After approval of all legal authorities the schedule was promulgated by the President to the teaching staff of the University as an official statement of what the teaching staff could expect as a matter of right from the University authorities. As a direct result of this action, the annual turnover of professors has been greatly reduced. Nothing undertaken by the University in recent years has done as much to enable our entire teaching staff to put forward their best efforts. Failure of the State to continue this adopted policy would be more injurious to the welfare of the Institution than any change of policy that could be considered. In order to carry out this agreed upon schedule, $6,000 additional must be provided for the first year of the next biennium, and $15,000 for the second year.

LIBRARY

The Library, which has been called by the late President Alderman the beating heart of the University, is in dire need of strengthening. In this important field of the University's life an increase of $12,400 per year for each year of the coming biennium is urgently needed. A budget showing the detail of this expenditure is appended to this report.

STRENGTHENING EXISTING SCHOOLS

In order to provide better instruction in certain of our overcrowded schools, there is desperate need of four additional associate professors, two in English, one in History, and one in Sociology. This will require $15,000 a year of additional appropriation for the maintenance of the college and graduate departments.

FOLK MUSIC

Authorities on music seem to be agreed that the only substantial contribution of the Anglo-Saxon civilization to Music is in the field of Folk Songs. These songs are almost the sole possession of the older members of the pure-bred Anglo-Saxon in our mountain districts. These people are rapidly dying out, and if this music is to be preserved and handed down to posterity it must be collected now. In order to collect, classify, and make available to the public this Folk Music, an appropriation of $5,000 a year is requested, $3,750 for an associate professor of Music and $1,250 for traveling and supplies. This particular need of the University has already been brought forcibly to the attention of the Governor by Mr. John Powell, of Richmond, who is enthusiastically interested in this proposal and who is my authority for the statement that if not collected immediately it will be forever lost to posterity.

BUILDINGS AND GROUNDS

Between this date and the beginning of the next biennium, we will open for use in the University $625,000 worth of new buildings, - a $300,000 Law Building, a $220,000 Nurses' Home, and a $105,000 addition to the Chemical Laboratory. These buildings must be heated, lighted, and janitorial service provided. On the basis of a two-per cent maintenance charge, there should be added $12,500 to our appropriation in the field of Buildings and Grounds.

MINOR CAPITAL OUTLAYS

The appropriation passed by the last General Assembly carried an appropriation from the surplus budget of $60,000 for additional equipment, which was distributed over all departments of the University. We are in desperate need of the continuation of this appropriation. We therefore earnestly request a continuation of $30,000 a year in the field of new equipment, to be distributed over all departments of the University.
