Upon the unanimous recommendation of the Executive Committee which was concurred in by a majority of the other members of the Board, viz. Messrs Goode, Gilmore & Hart, and communicated to the Secretary in writing some days prior to this date, the meeting to be held on this day in pursuance of the adjournment on the 12th of September last was by consent, postponed to the 27th day of June next, and notice thereof forwarded by the Secretary to each member of the Board prior to this date.

The Board of Visitors this day met in pursuance of the postponement from the 4th of February last.

Present Messrs Conrad, Gilmore, Marye, Randolph and Whitehead.

On motion Mr. Marye was chosen Rector pro temp., in the absence of the Rector, who thereupon called the Board to order.

A communication was received from the Rector, Mr. Stuart, stating that he was prevented by sickness from being present at this meeting.

On motion the Secretary was requested to inform Prof. Harrison, Chairman of the Faculty, that the Board were in session and ready to receive the Faculty report and any other matters to be submitted for consideration, which being communicated by the Secretary to Prof. Harrison, he appeared before the Board and submitted the Annual report of the Faculty with the usual accompanying reports of the Proctor \&c, and other papers- which were received by the Rector pro tem. and laid before the Board.

The Rector pro tem. on motion proceeded with the reading of the Faculty report, which being concluded, On motion the Board adjourned to meet tomorrow at 9 A.M.

University of Va., June 28th 1879

The Board met and was called to order at 2.45 P.M. by the Rector pro tem. Mr. Marye.

Present, the same members as on yesterday with the addition of Mr. Goode and Mr. Hart.

On motion of Mr. Whitehead the Board decided to enter on the examination of the papers submitted by the various candidates for the Chair of Natural History & Geology, but before proceeding with this business Dr. Randolph submitted the report of the executive Committee which bears upon the question of filling said chair, and is as follows:

Your Committee have the honor to make the following report of their transactions for the past year: Your Committee authorized Dr. J. F. Harrison to expend sixty dollars in the purchase of instruments necessary for the instruction of his class. A petition largely signed by students requesting that the ordinance in reference to board should be so amended as to permit them to change their boarding houses without requiring them to give up their rooms. We referred their application to the Faculty who advised that no change should be made in the ordinance; we therefore declined to accede to their request.

The President of the U.S. appointed Professor J. L. Cabell a member of the National Board of Health. Your Committee having satisfied themselves that his class would not suffer, authorized his acceptance. He was subsequently appointed by the Board of Health their President. This compliment to our distinguished Professor was well deserved and highly honorable to the University. In April your Committee requested Dr. Cabell to attend the meeting of the National Medical Association at Atlanta and thus authorized his absence. In May last Professor Ward wrote to the Chairman of the Faculty offering to furnish the cases for the Botanical Museum at a cost of seven hundred and fifty dollars. Your Committee authorized the Chairman to request Professor Ward to proceed to have the cases made and to inform him that the amount would be paid on their delivery.

At your called meeting in September last you requested your Executive Committee "by correspondence or otherwise to collect such information as they could in regard to the qualifications of the candidates for the Professorship of Natural History and Geology". In your resolution prescribing the subjects to be taught in the School you specified the following; "Geology, Mineralogy and such branches of Natural History as the Board of Visitors may hereafter determine". Profoundly impressed with the importance to the University and the material interest of the State, of a judicious selection of this Professor; and being conscious that the subjects to be taught were those that were less known by gentlemen of the average culture than almost any others taught in the institution; your Committee were naturally diffident of their ability to correctly appreciate the requirements necessary for such an appointee. This being the case they availed themselves of the informal permission granted by the Board at their called meeting of applying to the Faculty for their advice, such application was made by the Rector and Chairman of the Ex. Committee. A Committee was appointed by the Faculty and their report was considered and unanimously adopted at their December meeting. It is forwarded as a part of this report and your attention respectfully called to it. Your Committee have only considered the testimonials of practical Geologists and have alone investigated their qualifications. They have excluded from their investigations the qualifications of theoretical Geologists. First because the University has for thirty years taught by its Professors of Natural Philosophy a class in didactic Geology and Mineralogy. The well known capacity and conscientious devotion to duty of its two professors Rogers and Smith is ample guarantee that the science so far as it can be taught didactically has been successfully taught by them. Second, the present condition of the State, her poverty, the failure of her old industries and the necessity for new, when taken in connection with her rapidly increasing reputation for mineral wealth admonish us of the need of a more than didactical course on these subjects. Third, in common with all new studies the success of a Professor in securing a class is problematical. Had we a theorist alone he would be useful for nothing else but didactic teaching. While with a practical man who has won reputation in the field and and laboratory by geological surveys the University would be thrown in renewed and more intimate relations with the material interests of the State. Fourth, the University had the honor of inaugurating and partially completing the only Geological survey of the State worthy of the name, The Geological Survey of Virginia by Professor Rogers. It is most desirable that he should have the credit of its completion. This can only be done by a Field Geologist. For these reasons your Committee have thought that your intentions as shown when the chair was organized could only be carried out by a practical Geologist.

It seems to us obvious that only a Geologist who has won reputation among scientific men by work in the field and in the laboratory could be classed as such. We then have turned our attention to such alone and have given most weight to information that shows the success or failure of candidates in original research or in field work. Information that proves excellence in writings or lectures on Biology, Evolution and all similar speculative studies cognate to Geological Knowledge for practical uses have been regarded as of little worth either to carry out the original design of the donor or the intentions of the Board in the establishment of the Chair. In estimating the value of the testimonials and of such information as we may have obtained by by correspondence or otherwise have carefully weighed the sources. Have given most weight to the opinions of specialists and scientists of acknowledged reputation who are leaders in this branch of science and least weight to popular estimate and newspaper articles other than those of the Scientific periodicals. Placing the first as far ahead of ourselves in Knowledge of the subject and not recognizing the latter as more than equals. Of the candidates whose testimonials are before you there are five who rank high among scientific men, Messrs. Fontaine, Comstock, Kerr, Hitcock and Little. The three latter hold official rank as Geologists of States and have been or are now engaged in surveys of their respective States. Of these five from all the information that we have been able to get, Mr. Fontaine ranks highest. He commends himself most to us both as a Virginian, an alumnus and Master of Arts of the University, as a trained and successful teacher, as a Geologist who has won his reputation by his surveys of Virginia and as a man whose knowledge is progressive, whose last works scientists consider his best. It is useless for us to allude to his testimonials, they are before you for your consideration. Sufficient is it for us to say that our information derived from correspondence or otherwise more than justifies any commendation of him they may make. We cannot cease this subject without testifying our obligation to our Faculty individually and collectively for the valuable aid furnished us in our investigation. At your meeting in September, Professor Joseph Leconte's name was brought before you as possibly an available candidate. He was written to and invited to become a candidate, he held the matter under advisement, but finally in January declined to present his name.

At the annual meeting of the Board of Visitors of the University-

Present- Messrs Conrad, Bocock, Gilmore, Hart, Marye, Randolph & Whitehead.

The Board was called to order by Mr. Marye, Rector pro tem.

A letter was read from the Rector, Mr. Stuart, stating that he continued to be too unwell to attend the meeting and that his physician had prohibited his doing so. Mr. Goode, it was announced upon information by letter from him, is prevented from being present by his official duties in Congress.

On motion the Board proceeded to consider the matters of business brought to its attention by the Annual reports of the Faculty and its Chairman, with the accompanying papers, submitted at the irregular meeting concluded on the 28th inst. and references made to the appropriate Committees for their consideration & report to the Board.

A letter, in which our Honored Rector, the Hon. A. H. H. Stuart, under date of the 28th inst. gives an account of the connection of W. W. Corcoran, Esq. with the question of selecting a suitable person to fill the chair of Natural History & Geology, recently endowed by him, having been produced and read before the Board.

On motion- The Board doth resolve, that having in their possession full and accurate information of the entire action taken by M. Corcoran as to the selection of the person to fill the said chair, deem it their duty to put on record their declaration, that all criticisms on unfavorable sentiments which have been expressed or felt in regard to the participation of Mr. Corcoran in this matter have been caused by misapprehension of the facts of the case, and that Mr. Corcoran is entitled to occupy the same high position of enlightened and disinterested liberality to the University which public opinion has heretofore with so much unanimity assigned him.

2. Resolved that the circumstances seem to justify a renewed declaration on our part of our unshaken respect for Mr. Corcoran, and our undiminished gratitude for his noble and enlarged benefactions to this cherished Institution of Learning.

3. Resolved, that the Secretary forward a copy of these resolutions to Mr. Corcoran.

Mr. G. F. Nicolassen submitted his application, forwarded through the Chairman of the Faculty, to be allowed a special examination at the beginning of the next session, which on being read and considered was on motion referred to the Faculty with the request that they report to the present meeting of the Board their recommendation in the premises.

At 4 P.M. the Board proceeded to consider the election of a Professor to fill the Chair of Natural History & Geology, in pursuance of its resolution of the 28th inst. and after such consideration Mr. Conrad moved that William M. Fontaine be elected Professor of the Corcoran School of Natural History and Geology in the University of Virginia, which motion was seconded by Mr. Gilmore.

Whereupon William M. Fontaine was elected by the unanimous vote of the Visitors present, viz- Messrs Bocock, Gilmore, Hart, Marye, Randolph & Whitehead.

Resolved, that the Secretary inform Mr. Fontaine of his election, by letter.

On motion the Board adjourned to meet at 9 A.M. on the 3d proximo.

The Committee on the Library respectfully report that upon a personal inspection of the Library, they find the Books well preserved, and the cases and other furniture in good condition. The judicious plan pursued both as to the classification and cataloguing of the books, maps, engravings \&c renders the access to and use of the Library convenient and agreeable.

In regard to the matters specially mentioned in the report of the Faculty, the Committee recommend as follows.

I. That the concession proposed by the Faculty as to the use of the Library by certain persons during the vacation be ordered on the terms suggested. And the Committee further recommend that the use of the Library be granted to such persons as are now on who have heretofore been members of the Board of Visitors who are residents in the vicinity of the University.

II. That the disposition by sale of imperfect books, odd volumes, duplicate sets, and useless books, be ordered, under the restrictions and terms proposed by the Faculty.

III. That hereafter the income annually received from the fund contributed by President Madison for the benefit of the Library be specifically designated in the appropriations made each year for the Library, as "The Madison donation."

IV. In regard to the enlargement of the appropriation for the Library, the Committee, while duly sensible of the great desirableness thereof, can furnish us information to aid the Board in its conclusions which is not already possessed by other members.

V. The Committee recommends that the Board place on its Records an appropriate testimonial as to the long and faithful services rendered as Librarian by William Wertenbaker, Esqr. The deep sympathy of its members in his bodily afflictions, and that the existing salary allowed him be continued to him during the residue of his life. And in view of the increased labors imposed upon the Assistant Librarian, F. W. Page, Esq. by the disabilities of Mr. Wertenbaker, it is recommended that the sum of \_\_\_\_ be allowed to Mr. Page as compensation for the present fiscal year. The forms of orders to be entered in the above matters, in case the Board concurs in the foregoing recommendations, are herewith presented.
