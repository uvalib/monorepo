RESOLVED, That the Rector and Visitors approve the budget presented by the President and authorize its presentation to the Governor and to the General Assembly.

The President stated that in order to meet the rapidly increasing expenses in all departments of the University, it had been deemed expedient to increase the tuition fees in the several departments and offered the following motion which, after discussion, was unanimously adopted:

RESOLVED, That the scale of fees and tuition in the several departments of the University be established as follows, beginning with the session of 1920-21:

Upon the recommendation of the President, increases in certain salaries, appointments of an Adjunct Professor, Instructors and Assistants, appointment of Registrar and Assistant to succeed Mr. Howard Winston, retired, appropriations for the Engineering Department and for certain physical needs of the University, etc., were made as set forth in the following resolutions, and adopted:

The President read a letter from Mr. Greenough, of the General Alumni Association, concerning the question of raising an endowment fund for the University. It was

RESOLVED, That the President consider the matter and communicate with the General Alumni Association.

The President announced that owing to the small number of students who desired to enter the R. O. T. C., it was found necessary to withdraw said course from the University, as is shown in the following communication:

From: President of the University of Virginia,

To: Adjutant General of the Army.

Subject: Withdrawal of the R.O.T.C. Unit from the University of Virginia.

I deeply regret to inform you that The University of Virginia is unable to meet the minimum requirements of 100 students enrolled in the R. O. T. C., notwithstanding the fact that our total enrollment, in all departments, will reach at least 1500 students. I am, therefore, forced to request that the Unit authorized for the University of Virginia be withdrawn.

I am also forced, profoundly against my personal will and my personal desire, to state that the services of Lieutenant Colonel Abney Payne, CAC, are no longer needed at the University. It is difficult for me to tell you how much I regret the outcome of this undertaking here. I regret it because I believe great good could have accrued to the Institution. The causes for the failure of the undertaking are due to reasons inherent in the minds and purposes of the young men presenting themselves for matriculation. There is no war spirit in them. They are brave manly fellows who have proven their willingness to serve their country, but they do not care to prepare in advance for future military service, and no amount of persuasion can change their minds. None would be quicker to respond to the call of any urgent need, but their spirits and wills are all bent upon the call for peace service, and their psychology is distinctly anti-military.

Colonel Payne was the ideal man for the task. Every possible thing that could have been done to make the undertaking a success was done by him. If energy, tact, good sense, and devotion to duty could have carried this undertaking forward successfully, he would have achieved the end. We part with him with the deepest regret and sentiments of affection and esteem.

The reports of the Committee on Buildings and Grounds in the matter of the demolition of the old Dispensary Building and the leasing of the central store room in the Entrance Building, which matter had been referred to said committee with power to act, were presented, approved and ordered to be spread as follows:

The Committee on Buildings and Grounds reports that after conference with the Superintendent of Buildings and Grounds and the Bursar, the Superintendent is authorized to lease to the University Shop, Inc., the center store and the store adjoining it on the east for the term of three years next following August 1, 1919 at $125 per month, payable at the end of each month during the term.

Lessee to have right to renew the lease for additional period of three years at $150 per month, payable at end of each month; right of renewal to be exercised only upon the lessee giving written notice of intention to renew for period of sixty days prior to August 1, 1922. And upon giving of such notice, lease to be ipso facto renewed at new rental but without renewal privilege.

Lease herein provided for to be drawn by the attorney for Rector and Visitors with such provisions as may be necessary, in the opinion of the attorney, to protect the rights of the Rector and Visitors. Lease to be executed in duplicate in name and on behalf of Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia by the Rector and seal to be affixed and attested by Secretary.

The President announced that Emeritus Professor Francis H. Smith had reached his ninetieth birthday on this date and that he was receiving from all sections of the State telegrams and messages of respect and good wishes. The President was authorized to prepare and send to Professor Smith on behalf of the Board a resolution of respect in honor of this his ninetieth birthday.

Mr. Michie submitted the following motion which was read, discussed and referred to a special committee consisting of the Rector, the President, Mr. Hart, and the Finance Committee to study the same and report their finding to a special meeting of the Board at an early date:

RESOLVED, That the salaries of all members of the faculty of the rank of professor, associate professor and adjunct professor, who have been with the University for three years or more; and the salaries of administrative officers who have been with the University three years or more, shall be increased 25%, as of September 15th, 1919.

RESOLVED, That a similar increase of 25% shall be made in the salaries of each member of the faculty and administrative officer, who had been with the University for less than three years, when he has been with the University for three years.

On motion the meeting then adjourned.
