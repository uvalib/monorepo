A special meeting of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia was held on this date at 5:00 p.m. in the Office of the President of the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia, with the following present: The Rector, Edward R. Stettinius, Jr.; Dr. M. L. Combs, President of Mary Washington College; Visitors Anderson, Miller, Willis, and Wailes. Absent: President Colgate W. Darden, Jr. of the University of Virginia; Visitors Barksdale, Black, Bustard, Calcott, Carrington, Garnett, Gay, Mears, and Trout.

Mrs. Wailes, Chairman of a special committee appointed at the meeting of the Board on November 14, 1947 to consider the continuance of home economics and commercial courses and physical education at Mary Washington College of the University, presented the report of that committee, which was approved as submitted.

The Committee on Mary Washington met at Mary Washington on Tuesday, November 18, 1947. Committee members present were Mrs. Willis, Judge Garnett and Mrs. Wailes. Present also were Mr. Gay, Chancellor Darden, Dean Lewis, President Combs, Dean Alvey; Mr. A. A. Charles, Director of Admissions of Mary Washington, Mr. E. E. Woodward, Treasurer, Dr. R. H. Tanner, a member of its faculty and of its Committee on Academic Standards.

Careful consideration was given to the matter of granting credit toward the A.B. degree for courses in typewriting and shorthand, and to the setting up of majors in physical education and home economics.

The Committee makes the following recommendations:

1\. That courses in typewriting and shorthand continue to be offered on a non-credit basis only.

2\. That no major in physical education be set up for the present.

3\. That the degree of B.S. in Home Economics be granted, and that if the faculty of Mary Washington approves this degree, details concerning major requirements be worked out by the Dean and departments concerned.

The Act on the Consolidation of Mary Washington College with the University stipulates that Mary Washington provide for women educational opportunity of equal excellence as that offered to men students in the College of Arts and Sciences of the University. The Committee wishes to re-affirm its belief that the purpose of the Act and the interests of the women of Virginia are best served by maintaining and strengthening as a core the liberal arts curriculum of Mary Washington College.

There being no further business to come before the meeting, the same was adjourned after a motion to that effect had been made, seconded, and carried.
