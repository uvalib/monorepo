**Minutes of the November 12-13, 2015, Meetings of the Board**

**On motion, the Minutes of the Board meetings held on November 12-13, 2015, were approved.**

**Resolution for Additions to the Agenda**

**On motion, the Board adopted the following resolution approving the consideration of addenda to the published agenda of the meeting:**

**RESOLUTION TO APPROVE ADDITIONAL AGENDA ITEMS**

**RESOLVED, the Board of Visitors approves the consideration of addenda to the published Agenda.**

**Comments by the Rector**

**The Rector asked Dr. Britt to give a brief report on the actions at the Medical Center Operating Board (MCOB) meeting the day before. This committee report can be found at:**

[**http://www.virginia.edu/bov/meetings/'16Feb/'16%20FEB%20REPORT%20FROM%20MCOB%20MEETINGS%20FOR%20BOV.pdf**](http://www.virginia.edu/bov/meetings/'16Feb/'16%20FEB%20REPORT%20FROM%20MCOB%20MEETINGS%20FOR%20BOV.pdf)

**During the MCOB, Dr. Shannon spoke about the intention to change the name of the Medical Center Operating Board to the Health System Board to reflect the inclusion of strategic and operational endeavors for all the components of the Health System. As examples, he noted reporting of the School of Medicine research strategy and plans, and the Health System consolidated financials. The MCOB as well as the Board of Visitors unanimously approved the name change. A resolution changing the name and the charge of the committee in the _Manual of the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia_ will be brought to the June Board meeting.**

**The Rector reminded the Board of several spring and summer meetings: Buildings & Grounds Committee will meet the afternoon of April 26, and the Committee on The University of Virginia’s College at Wise on May 6. He also mentioned that the Wise graduation is scheduled for May 7, so members should plan to stay overnight and participate in graduation. On April 26, the annual retiring faculty dinner will be held and Rector Goodwin encouraged Visitors to attend.**

**The Rector proposed changing the February and November meeting dates for the next several years. He explained that February was not the right time for the spring meeting because it fell in the middle of the legislative session and was too early for a full picture of the budgetary issues. He said a mid-March meeting date would better align with the spring calendar. The September and November meeting dates were too close together and he would like to have a meeting at the close of the fall semester to allow the Board to review the entire semester and discuss any open issues for the spring. There was discussion on the proposed meeting dates and it was decided that the Board Office would poll the members with earlier dates in March and December than those proposed.**

**Rector Goodwin reminded Visitors of the Retreat dates which have been set as August 14 and 15. He said the Retreat should be different from a regular meeting and should allow Board members an opportunity to delve more deeply into an issue or a couple of issues. He asked for their thoughts on the program and suggested the following: 1) future enrollment; 2) Bicentennial and Third Century Capital campaign planning; and 3) a discussion of strategic investments.**

**The Rector addressed one more topic during his report: the term of the faculty representative to the Board. The current term ends on May 31, 2016 to match the term of the Faculty Senate chair. He proposed, and the Board approved, a resolution extending the term of the current representative to June 30 and appointing his successor beginning on July 1. Upon motion, the following resolution was approved by unanimous voice vote:**

**FACULTY REPRESENTATIVES TO THE BOARD FOR 2015-2016 AND 2016-2017**

**RESOLVED, Joe Garofalo is affirmed as the non-voting faculty representative to the Board of Visitors for a term commencing August 17, 2015 and ending June 30, 2016; and**

**RESOLVED FURTHER, Nina J. Solenski, M.D., is appointed as the non-voting faculty representative to the Board of Visitors for a one-year term commencing July 1, 2016 and ending June 30, 2017; and**

**RESOLVED FURTHER, this resolution supersedes the resolution entitled Faculty Representative to the Board, approved August 17, 2015.**

**Reporting Relationship**

**President Sullivan explained that approval was needed for Provost Tom Katsouleas’ partner to join the faculty because of the appearance of a conflict of interest. Upon motion, the following resolution was approved:**

**APPROVAL OF REPORTING RELATIONSHIP AND SUPERVISORY STRUCTURE FOR ANNA MARIA SIEGA-RIZ**

**WHEREAS, the Virginia Conflict of Interest Act permits the dual employment of immediate family members by public institutions of higher education on certain terms and conditions; and**

**WHEREAS, the School of Medicine has recommended that Ms. Anna Maria Siega-Riz, the partner of Executive Vice President and Provost Thomas C. Katsouleas, be employed as a member of the faculty; and**

**WHEREAS, Executive Vice President and Provost Thomas C. Katsouleas is an officer of the University and would accrue a personal interest in Anna Maria Siega-Riz’ employment contract as her partner;**

**RESOLVED, the Board of Visitors finds it in the best interests of the University of Virginia and the Commonwealth to employ Anna Maria Siega-Riz as a member of the faculty in the School of Medicine; and**

**RESOLVED FURTHER, the reporting relationship and supervisory structure for Ms. Siega-Riz shall be as follows:**

**(a) All personnel matters concerning Ms. Siega-Riz while**

**employed as a member of the faculty of the School of Medicine will be handled in accordance with customary practices and policies of the School of Medicine with the faculty member reporting to the chair of the Department of Public Health Sciences. Where further University approval may be required the dean of the School of Medicine shall make appropriate recommendations regarding Ms. Siega-Riz’ salary, faculty rank, performance evaluations, and other personnel matters to the President;**

**(b) The President shall act in the stead of the Executive Vice President and Provost for all matters that may require the Executive Vice President and Provost’s action concerning Ms. Siega-Riz and will present to the Board of Visitors those matters that require its action.**

**Report by the President**

**President Sullivan said the unifying theme for the meeting is our commitment to building excellence in every corner of the University.**

**The Cornerstone Plan is our expression of our commitment to academic excellence. She reported on implementation of the plan.**

**Cornerstone Plan**

**President Sullivan said the University is adapting one floor of Clemons Library to create a new Total Advising Center. This new Center will allow students to find all the information they need related to advising, internships, career counseling, study abroad, et cetera, in one location.**

**The Provost has been talking with two non-alumni parent donors who want to support the Total Advising Center. President Sullivan announced that the donors have committed $1.1 million toward the creation of the Center in Clemons Library.**

**In the Cornerstone Plan, there is an emphasis on High-Impact Educational Experiences. As an example of one high-impact experience, UNLEASH is a new program that helps students connect with research opportunities. UNLEASH stands for “Undergrad Novel Learning Experience and Scientific Hands-On.” The program features a database that matches UVA undergrads with research work being done by UVA faculty.**

**For students, the matching service eliminates the unknowns of how to find faculty, how to ask if a professor is looking for an undergrad research assistant, etc. For faculty, the database bundles all student inquiries and presents consistent applicant materials in a uniform format. UNLEASH currently includes faculty in the sciences and medicine, but it will soon expand to include all disciplines.**

**To further enhance UVA’s high-impact educational experience, the College will pilot a curricular-reform effort called “Forums” for first-year students this fall. Forums will offer a two-year structure of courses organized on a theme that stretches across multiple disciplines in the College. The Forum faculty organizer will serve as the students’ advisor until they declare their majors. The five Forums to be implemented in fall 2016 are:**

*   **Creative Processes and Practices**
*   **Epidemics**
*   **Human Impact on the Environment**
*   **Mobility and Community**
*   **Visions of the Good**

**The College is also making progress on the curricular reform effort that Dean Baucom spoke about in an Educational Policy Committee meeting last year.**

**Strengthening the research enterprise is a major focus of the Cornerstone Plan. The Provost had reported in an earlier meeting about the selection process for the next pan-university research institute, and at the MCOB meeting, Dean Wilkes and Professor Kovatchev, who leads UVA’s Center for Diabetes Technology, discussed the $12.7 million in NIH funding to support clinical trials to test the artificial pancreas device developed for patients with Type-1 diabetes. Clinical trials will be conducted at nine sites in the U.S. and Europe. The artificial pancreas is a joint research endeavor with faculty from Harvard’s School of Engineering & Applied Science. This $12.7 million is the largest commitment made by NIH under a $20 million program to fund advanced clinical trials.**

**Also, the U.S. Department of Education, through its Institute of Education Sciences, recently announced funding for two projects in the Curry School, one focused on pre-kindergarten, and the other on higher education. The University is the only institution that received grants in both areas, demonstrating the strength of University faculty across the education continuum.**

**President Sullivan reported that Curry School Dean Pianta received $5 million to study policies and practices that support learning in pre-kindergarten through 3rd grade in Fairfax County Public Schools, and Assistant Professor Ben Castleman received $4 million to study how mobile technology can be used to improve college completion rates at open-enrollment institutions.**

**Research funding as of December 31, 2015 has increased 4.5% compared with 2014.**

**She said many of our aspirations in the strategic plan are funded through philanthropy. President Sullivan has hosted several events across the country with deans and other leaders to discuss with alumni and friends the three current fundraising priorities: faculty hiring, student scholarships, and the Jeffersonian Grounds Initiative.**

**Diversity**

**President Sullivan said as we pursue academic excellence across the University, we know we cannot achieve our goals without a full commitment to diversity. Over the years, various University committees have looked at the issue of diversity. Members of the President’s staff have assembled an index of all of the diversity recommendations, and responses to those recommendations. Substantial progress in some areas has been made, but three areas still need work, and these will be the three prongs of the diversity effort going forward.**

**The first prong is faculty hiring. Hiring and diversity go hand-in-hand because the generational turnover of faculty gives the University a rare opportunity to rapidly improve the diversity of the faculty. The Provost and his team have created a new summary of initiatives for faculty cluster hires, target-of-opportunity hires, retentions, and other strategic hires. A more diverse faculty will help the University attract a more diverse student population.**

**The second prong is student diversity. According to the Journal of Blacks in Higher Education, among highly-ranked national research universities, the University admitted more African-American students than any other school, and enrolled the second-highest number of African-American students based on fall 2014 data. However, the yield remains low for this population. The current difference in yield between African-American and white admitted students from Virginia is nine percentage points; the new goal is to reduce that gap by three percentage points each year for three years, and to close the gap by 2019. Race-based aid is not an option because of a federal Fourth Circuit opinion.**

**President Sullivan said the University has identified 80 Virginia high schools in which at least half of the students qualify for free or reduced-price lunches. These schools don’t send many students. Over the past two years, she has written a series of letters to principals of these high schools to encourage their students to apply by letting them know about scholarship opportunities for summer programs, and, most recently, by alerting them to a University workshop for counselors. She said we need to do more. By targeting an increase in socioeconomic diversity through the schools, we can improve diversity along other dimensions with a program similar to the Blue Ridge Scholars program.**

**Data gathered in a 2015 survey of accepted students gives some important baseline information about the decision-making of African-American students from Virginia. Several conclusions can be drawn based on the survey data:**

*   **Cost of attendance is very important in the enrollment decision-making of accepted African-American students;**
*   **Students who choose not to enroll often think the cost of attendance is too high for them;**
*   **Students who receive some type of aid are much more likely to enroll.** 

**She explained that if we can get more students from these 80 underrepresented Virginia schools to apply, and if we can support the strongest students with aid, we will begin to see a “chain migration” effect.**

**The third prong is improving the University’s environment and culture. The effort to improve diversity needs to be complemented by a commitment to inclusiveness and a welcoming environment for students from all backgrounds. Medical Center CEO Pamela Sutton Wallace said recently, “Diversity is being asked to the dance; inclusion is being asked to dance.” Once we invite underrepresented students to the dance, we need to take the next step and make sure they feel included and welcomed.**

**President Sullivan mentioned plans for a charrette focused on environment and culture. Enhancing inclusiveness will be part of that discussion.**

**President Sullivan spoke about a survey of undergraduates by SERU, which stands for Student Experience in the Research University. The climate survey will gather information about students’ academic and social experiences. This information will be useful as the University community works to improve environment and culture.**

**The Ad Hoc Group on Climate and Culture met in December 2015 to review recommendations from its three working groups (Culture, Prevention, and Response). President Sullivan said we know that many of our challenges in climate and culture are related to alcohol use by students, and so the University is implementing some of the groups’ recommendations such as offering an alternative-programming initiative called “After Hours”; extending IM-Rec Sports facility hours and late-night programming on Friday and Saturday nights; converting the Lloyd Building on the Corner to serve as alcohol-free student-activity space in the evening, and during the day it will house a UVA Career Center team; and hosting a major concert on the weekend of the Wertland Street Block Party.**

**In addition to these programmatic efforts, President Sullivan is working with the Council of Black Presidents so they are prepared to educate prospective students about the University’s strategic priorities that benefit all students.**

**Training is also underway. The Provost has asked each school to develop a diversity program and plan, and the McIntire School recently completed diversity training through Korn/Ferry for their faculty and administrators.**

**President Sullivan said all of these steps are helping to improve the environment and culture, and the work will continue in the weeks and months ahead.**

**Good-News Rankings**

**President Sullivan said the University moved up two spots, to No. 14, in the Princeton Review’s 2016 list of the top-50 schools that give the highest return on the cost of an education. The Princeton Review highlighted efforts to keep down the cost of tuition and to make a University education affordable for all students regardless of their economic circumstances.**

**This month, the National Venture Capital Association ranked Charlottesville as the fastest-growing venture capital ecosystem in the United States. The University is a driving force behind this rapid growth. Nine leading companies in Charlottesville were the primary recipients of $27.7 million in investments last year; of those, six worked directly with the University of Virginia Licensing & Ventures Group to bring University research to the commercial market.**

**Comments by the Student Member**

**The Rector recognized this meeting as the last meeting for Daniel Judge as the student representative. He thanked Mr. Judge on behalf of the Board for his good advice and counsel on student matters.**

**Daniel Judge’s comments are reported verbatim as follows:**

I'm going to keep my comments brief today, because I'd like to focus on Shannon's comments about UVA- Wise and her student experience. However, before I introduce her I'd like to take a moment to reflect on one student issue, which is the Departmentalization of the African-American and African Studies program at the University. And then I'd like to make a few brief comments about the University as a whole.

UVA's Carter G. Woodson Institute for African-American and African Studies was founded in 1981. Since then it has created an undergraduate major, a distinguished majors program, and a minor. It has also become an internationally acclaimed residential fellowship program that hosts pre- and post-doctoral scholars. The popularity of these classes has grown substantially over the last several years and most of the undergraduate courses have long wait lists for enrollment. Some courses like the "Introduction to African-American and African Studies II" had to open up additional sections to accommodate demand this semester. That particular class has about 140 students currently enrolled and this has been a trend for several years.

There are two main reasons that departmentalization is particularly important for African-American and African Studies. First, it will allow the program to offer tenured positions for faculty. Currently, faculty are hired by other departments and then are able to teach AAS courses by cross-listing. If AAS became a department they would be able to directly hire faculty and offer them tenure. This would enable them to hire some of the most competitive scholars in the field. The second reason departmentalization is particularly important is because of the interdisciplinary nature of AAS. African-American and African Studies pulls professors from Sociology, English, History, Media Studies, and Languages like Swahili among others. It is by far one of the most interdisciplinary subjects at the University. Now, it can be argued that because it's so interdisciplinary, AAS should remain a program and be less centralized. However, this isn't the case when you look at our peer institutions. Almost all of our peer institutions already have departments. These include, but are not limited to, UCLA, UC Berkley, Syracuse, Duke, UNC, Harvard, and Yale. These depat1ments have been successful and we would likely experience a similar success.

Now, before I continue, I should be clear about two things. First, the actual process of departmentalization is not a Board issue. And second, Dean Baucom has already been working on this issue and has requested a proposal for departmentalization. So there has been some progress. However, the reason I'm bringing this issue to the Board is because it's the perfect intersection of several of our stated goals. At every meeting I've attended I've heard discussions about how to diversify the University faculty and student body. I don't know how much departmentalization would positively affect job applicants or student enrollment, but it would be a start and is worth while to investigate. It will help give AAS more resources to establish itself even more in our academic community. I recommend that the Board consider looking into the effects of Departmentalization and think about how this important transition could fit into upcoming University events like the Bicentennial.

Finally, I'd like to emphasize the student desire for departmentalization. After speaking with AAS majors, the heads of student organizations, and black student leaders, and after hearing discussions at student council meetings, reading the request for departmentalization in the Black Student Alliance's Towards a Better University report, and even after asking random students, I am confident in saying that this is something the University student body desires. I sincerely hope the Board will consider ways to involve the departmentalization process in its future plans.

The last thing I'd like to do before I introduce Shannon is thank the Board and UVA Administration. This is my last time addressing the full Board and I'd like to thank each of you for how accessible you've been over the last year. I'd like to thank Rector Goodwin, Mr. Conner, and President Sullivan for your support and guidance. I'd also like to especially thank Ms. Harris and Ms. Rinker. I can't begin to tell you how much they've helped me during my time on the Board. I know they will be just as helpful to my successor. I am excited to hand the position over to Phoebe Willis at the end of the semester. I've had the chance to speak with Phoebe several times and I have full confidence that she will serve the student body and the Board well.

I also want to thank the Board for its commitment to the on-Grounds experience of UVA students. It's fitting that I end my final report with a quote I used in my first student report. John Henry Cardinal Newman wrote "The Idea of a University" while Rector of the Catholic University of Ireland. In this he states, "It is more correct, as well as more usual, to speak of a university as a place of education than of instruction ..." Newman is explaining that the college experience is just as much outside the classroom as it is inside. I want to thank the Board for its commitment to improving the experience of all students on Grounds. I know the University is in good hands.

At this time I'm happy to answer any questions. I haven't discussed several student issues like the Honor Referenda, but I have sent the proposals to all of you via email. I'm happy to answer any questions either now or later.

Unless there are any more questions I'll go ahead and introduce Shannon.

Shannon Walker is here to give us a report on the College at Wise. She is a fourth year student at UVA- Wise. She is from Lovettsville, Virginia and is a double major in History and Communications. Shannon has served on the Student Government Association (SGA) for four years as a Senator, Vice-President, and a two-term President. Her time on the SGA has been spent focusing on building a relationship with the Town of Wise as well as trying to connect alumni with the current students. After graduation, she plans to take a year or two off from school but return to Graduate School for Organizational Communication or Law School to practice family law.

She is also currently the President of the National Society of Leadership and Success and a Student Ambassador. Without further ado, Shannon Walker.

**Comments by UVA-Wise Student Shannon Walker**

**Shannon Walker provided a student perspective on The University of Virginia’s College at Wise. She mentioned ways the students give back to the community at Wise. She said she values the relationships between the faculty and students and the positive impact these have had on her time at Wise. She considers Wise to be her home now. She said the College and community have provided her with a sense of belonging and encouragement, and she takes great pride in her college. From philanthropic work to building great student leaders, including the emphasis on academic excellence, Wise has changed her life in the most positive way and she could not be more thankful for the opportunities she has had as a student.**

**Ms. Fried asked for permission to share Shannon’s thoughts with local legislators. Ms. Walker agreed.**

**Comments by the Faculty Senate Chair**

**Dr. Nina Solenski gave a report on digital technology and how it affects the faculty. She highlighted many areas of research. She said students need to be exposed to innovative technology and take it into their working lives. She mentioned campus IT priorities based on the Campus Computing Survey of 2015, which included input from 417 colleges. Of the five priorities identified, many of them are University priorities as well. They are:**

1.  **Assisting faculty to integrate IT into instructions;**
2.  **Hiring and retaining qualified IT staff;**
3.  **Providing adequate user support;**
4.  **Upgrading and enhancing network and data security; and**
5.  **Leveraging IT resources to support student success.**

**Dr. Solenski provided several examples of high tech initiatives at the University. Among other examples, she mentioned the Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities, which is extraordinarily popular; she encouraged Visitors to check out their website at** [**http://www.iath.virginia.edu/**](http://www.iath.virginia.edu/)**.**

**In the area of healthcare efficiency and excellence, Dr. Solenski gave several examples, such as electronic bed boards; resource digital tracking of pumps/wheelchairs/equipment; telemetry both video and biometric monitoring; smart phone/mobile devices secure paging; care coordination platforms; and global desktop videoconferencing.**

**Dr. Solenski said the bottom line is the IT core has to be strong enough to support infrastructure, software, IT personnel, security, and storage. The Vice President for Information Technology Ron Hutchins has been very active and has a strategic plan; he will be meeting with the Faculty Senate soon.**

**ESTABLISHMENT OF BOARD OF VISITORS STRATEGIC INVESTMENT FUND**

**(approved by the Finance Committee on February 19, 2016)**

**WHEREAS, the University seeks to create a fund for strategic investments that support the vision and aspirations of**

**the highest levels of excellence in the University’s academic, research, and healthcare missions; and**

**WHEREAS, in March 2015, the Board of Visitors authorized the restructuring of the University’s debt to reduce liquidity requirements and better align short-term assets and liabilities; and**

**WHEREAS, in November 2015, the Board of Visitors approved a liquidity policy which outlines the University’s philosophy on liquidity management, establishes a control framework for managing liquidity, and establishes liquidity management guidelines; and**

**WHEREAS, in November 2015, the Board of Visitors authorized its Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer to enter into operating lines of credit with one or more financial firms to diversify the University’s liquidity sources and to be used only as an additional source of back-up liquidity to ease requirements on operating funds; and**

**WHEREAS, the University is committed to the establishment and careful management of a fund which is designed to grow and provide the means by which future strategic investments could be funded;**

**RESOLVED, the Board of Visitors authorizes the establishment of the Board of Visitors Strategic Investment Fund, to operate under the following principles:**

1.  **Consistent with the objectives of University of Virginia Investment Management Company (UVIMCO), the Board of Visitors Strategic Investment Fund will be managed within UVIMCO’s long-term pool. UVIMCO will maintain segregated accounting records with respect to investment earnings and distributions.**

**A detailed investment proposal will be provided for each strategic investment that will include the following elements: the specific investment opportunity; the strategic alignment with the University’s mission; the business objectives, milestones and financial plans; key risks; and the terms of an investment and exit strategy.**

**Projects will be strongly encouraged to demonstrate self-sufficiency or pay back within a three-year time period.**

1.  **The investment proposals will be due on or before February 28 of each year. The President, the Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, the Rector, and the Chair of the Finance Committee will review all investment proposals and will seek assistance if needed in the evaluation of any proposal. The evaluation process will take no more than ninety days. The committee will make recommendations to the Board of Visitors at its June meeting for the funding for the next fiscal year.**

**All investment proposals must clearly align with the University's strategic plan objectives, with the expectation that proposals will be prioritized by greatest anticipated reach and return on investment over time. The expectation is that these competitive proposals made and funded by the Board of Visitors will, over time, make a major difference in all facets of the University. These funds will not be used in lieu of normal ongoing operating costs but are expected to have a positive impact on the strategic direction and enhance the quality of the University.**

1.  **There will be a quarterly process of financial reporting and monitoring of each investment, with an annual progress report provided each June to the Board of Visitors. This annual report will include project status and funding to date, at which time funding may be continued, adjusted or curtailed.**

**TUITION, REQUIRED FEES, AND OTHER CHARGES FOR THE ACADEMIC DIVISION FOR FISCAL YEAR 2016-2017**

**(approved by the Finance Committee on February 19, 2016)**

**WHEREAS, in 2014, the Finance Subcommittee was charged by the Rector of the Board of Visitors to develop a financial/pricing model (including a long-term financial plan) that promotes: affordability for low-income and middle-income students and their families; predictability of tuition and fee costs and associated financial aid; a sustainable student financial aid program; sustainable funding for instruction that preserves and enhances academic excellence; diversity and inclusiveness; and, process efficiencies and savings achieved through the Organizational Excellence initiative; and**

**WHEREAS, over the course of several months in 2014-2015, the Full Board discussed and considered the development of the multi-year financial plan, which incorporated several funding sources for these strategic priorities, including increasing the endowment spending distribution; optimizing the performance of the balance sheet; generating savings by restructuring the debt portfolio; executing a robust philanthropic campaign to support the Cornerstone Plan, faculty excellence, and student financial aid; continuing to achieve operational efficiencies and developing new academic revenues; and, after other sources of revenue have been utilized, crafting a tuition/aid model to improve affordability and predictability; and**

**WHEREAS, all Virginia students, regardless of personal and family income, continue to pay less in tuition than the cost of the education they receive at the University; and**

**WHEREAS, reducing the financial burden of low-income and middle-income Virginia students and their families, as the Commonwealth of Virginia has defined those terms, was made a policy priority by the Virginia General Assembly through the Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2011, also known as the “Top Jobs Act”, and was embraced by the University of Virginia as a strategic imperative; and**

**WHEREAS, in 2015 the Board of Visitors approved a reduction in the maximum loan amount from $14,000 to $4,000 for low-income Virginia students, and from $28,000 to $18,000 for all other Virginia students demonstrating financial need; and**

**WHEREAS, in 2015 the Board of Visitors approved step increases in Virginia undergraduate base tuition of $1,000 in Fall 2015 and an additional $1,000 in Fall 2016, with currently enrolled Virginia students exempt from the step increases, in line with the multi-year financial plan approved in 2015.**

**RESOLVED FURTHER, the 2016-2017 in-state undergraduate tuition rates listed above represent a half percent lower rate of increase for the year than had been projected in the multi-year financial plan, resulting from efficiencies implemented during the year. If the University’s 2016-2017 unrestricted state appropriation increases beyond what is assumed in the multi-year financial plan, the proposed 2016-2017 in-state undergraduate tuition rates would be revised downward accordingly.**

**ATTACHMENTS**

**UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA**

**ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT CHARTER**

Introduction
------------

**The University of Virginia's Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program is designed to provide reasonable assurance that the University is managing risks that impact its ability to achieve its objectives. Risk encompasses both negative events and missed opportunities and includes inherent as well as emerging risks. An effective ERM program helps the University effectively deploy its resources in pursuit of its objectives.**

**It is the approach of the University to establish and support the ERM Program to assist the University in accomplishing its objectives by facilitating management’s processes for identifying potential events and risks that could affect its strategic plans and to coordinate its responses to mitigate such risks.**

Scope
-----

**The scope of the ERM program will include risk management activities at the Academic Division, Medical Center, and College at Wise. The ERM function will work closely with the Audit and Compliance functions. Efficiencies are gained through collaboration among the three functions, including:**

*   **Linking work across the enterprise risk assessment, audit plan, and compliance plan.**
*   **Sharing available resources**
*   **Cross-leveraging each function’s competencies**

**This collaboration is accomplished while recognizing the distinct roles played by each party. The ERM program is responsible for leading ERM within the organization. Compliance is responsible monitoring and promoting adherence to laws and regulations. Internal Audit is responsible, in part, for examining and evaluating the adequacy and effectiveness of the University’s governance, risk management, and internal controls.**

**Objectives**

**The objective of the ERM program is to provide reasonable assurance that the University is managing risks that impact its ability to achieve its objectives. This includes:**

*   **Creating a framework to effectively identify, assess, and manage risk.**
*   **Promoting collaboration to manage cross-functional risks**
*   **Assist in defining risk appetite and aligning that with strategy**
*   **Enhancing risk response decisions**
*   **Incorporating risk in the decision to allocate resources**

**Roles and Organization**

**The University’s Treasurer is responsible for administering the University’s ERM program. The Treasurer reports to the Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. ERM is a collaborative effort that includes involvement at various levels of the organization, including:**

**_Operating Units_**

**ERM should be integrated into a unit’s planning process. ERM should be part of assessing and implementing strategies related to strategic and operating objectives. Those responsible for managing unit budgets and programs are in the best position to manage risk. Leaders of individual schools and units will provide a key role in the day-to-day management of such risks and the execution of related mitigation strategies.**

**_Risk Management Council_**

**The Risk Management Council (“RMC”) is comprised of representatives from the major functional areas of the University, including the Health System. The RMC’s objectives are to provide a comprehensive assessment of risk at the University and provide reasonable assurance that the University is managing risks that impact its ability to achieve its objectives.  This group would focus on both inherent risks and emerging risks, both of which are critically important.  The RMC assesses risks and discusses risk mitigations approaches. The RMC will share these insights with the University’s executive leadership for discussion.**

**_University Executive Leadership_**

**The RMC will review key risks and mitigation strategies with the University’s executive leadership. Executive leadership will help set the University’s risk appetite, contribute to the assessment of risks, and provide guidance on how to report key risks to the ACR.**

**_The Board of Visitor’s Audit Compliance and Risk (“ACR”) Committee_**

**The ACR Committee will:**

*   **Approve the Enterprise Risk Management Charter.**
*   **Receive communications from the Treasurer on the University's Enterprise Risk Management assessment and mitigation efforts.**
*   **Review, at least annually, the institutions risk governance framework including the risk assessment and mitigation strategies.**
*   **Make appropriate inquiries of management and the Treasurer to determine whether all ERM efforts have the necessary resources and direction to be as effective as possible.**

**The Treasurer will communicate and interact directly with the Chair of the ACR committee, including in executive sessions and between ACR committee meetings as appropriate.**

**UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA COMPLIANCE CHARTER**

Mission and Purpose
-------------------

**The University of Virginia's compliance function supports the University’s fundamental commitment to the highest standards of ethics, integrity, and lawful conduct by promoting adherence to all applicable federal, state, and local laws, regulations, as well as standards and internal policies and protocols.**

**Institutional compliance promotes greater coordination of and consistency among individual University compliance programs, covering a wide variety of requirements related to academics, athletics, human resources, research, health care, information technology, and numerous administrative functions. The University established a compliance program to prevent, detect, and respond appropriately to potential violations of law and to foster a corporate culture that promotes integrity and ethical behaviors in all matters relating to compliance.**

Organization
------------

**The Assistant Vice President for Compliance oversees institutional compliance activities and programs to confirm they are reasonably designed, implemented, communicated, and enforced.**

**The Assistant Vice President for Compliance reports to the Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. The Assistant Vice President for Compliance coordinates the University-wide network of functional compliance officers.**

**The Audit, Compliance, and Risk (ACR) Committee will:**

*   **Approve the Compliance Charter and periodically reassess it for continued relevance.**
*   **Receive communications from the Assistant Vice President for Compliance regarding compliance strategies, plans, and other relevant matters.**
*   **Make appropriate inquiries of management and the Assistant Vice President for Compliance to determine whether all compliance efforts have the necessary resources and scope.**
*   **Support leadership for the compliance program by promoting and supporting a University-wide culture of ethical and lawful conduct.**

**The Assistant Vice President for Compliance will communicate and interact directly with the Chair of the ACR Committee, including in executive sessions and between committee meetings as appropriate to ensure direct access to the board.**

**Professional Standards**

**The compliance function’s objective is to establish and promote standards that meet the U.S. Federal Sentencing Guidelines' criteria for an effective compliance program.**

1.  **Compliance standards and procedures to prevent and detect criminal activity;**
2.  **Oversight by high-level personnel, with periodic reporting to the board from individuals with operational responsibility;**
3.  **Due care in delegating substantial discretionary authority;**
4.  **Effective communication and training to all levels of employees;**
5.  **Systems for monitoring, auditing and reporting suspected wrong-doing without fear of reprisal and for periodically evaluating the effectiveness of the compliance and ethics programs;**
6.  **Consistent enforcement of compliance standards including disciplinary mechanisms and appropriate incentives to perform in accordance with the compliance and ethics program; and**
7.  **Reasonable steps to respond to and prevent further similar offenses upon detection of a violation.**

**In addition, the Medical Center’s compliance program also follows the program elements defined in the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of the Inspector General’s “Compliance Program Guidance Document for Hospitals”.**

Responsibilities
----------------

**Members of the University community having responsibility for a specific area of compliance must ensure the following:**

*   **Oversight of compliance in their specific functional areas;**
*   **Adherence to the University’s compliance policies;**
*   **Implementation of corrective action as necessary, arising from compliance reviews and/or investigations.**

**The role of the Assistant Vice President for Compliance is to remain well-informed on the content and operation of the University’s compliance and ethics program in order to exercise reasonable oversight of the effectiveness of the program, including:**

1.  **_Standards of Conduct/Policies and Procedures_. Confirming that the University implements policies, procedures, training programs, and internal control systems that are reasonably capable of reducing misconduct and that comply with relevant regulatory requirements.**
2.  **_Compliance Roles and Responsibilities_. Establishing clear roles and responsibilities across the University.**
3.  **_Compliance Oversight_. Exercising reasonable oversight over compliance activities by requesting and receiving updates from compliance officers.**
4.  **_Reporting and Investigative Mechanisms_. Confirming that the University maintains an effective mechanism for stakeholders to report or seek guidance regarding potential or actual wrongdoing.**
5.  **_Correction and Prevention_. Working with the University’s senior leadership to promote and enforce compliance through appropriate incentives and disciplinary measures.**
6.  **_Culture of Integrity and Compliance_. Promoting the University’s culture of integrity and compliance, through communication of compliance standards and policies.**

Interaction with Audit and Enterprise Risk Management
-----------------------------------------------------

**The Assistant Vice President for Compliance will work closely with Internal Audit to assess and prioritize which compliance areas present the greatest risk and need for attention, based on regulatory environment and complexity, overlap with University strategic plans, and consequences of non-compliance. Managers with responsibility for specific areas of compliance will complete self-assessments to evaluate their individual compliance efforts against a list of criteria necessary to have an effective compliance program.**

**The Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program is designed to identify and mitigate key institutional risks. For example, one category of risk to be considered is legal and regulatory compliance risk. The regular review of compliance requirements may highlight an emerging institutional risk. Conversely, the identification of key institutional risks may guide the work of the compliance function and initiate a mitigation strategy that the University may use to address a given risk.**

Authority
---------

**The Assistant Vice President for Compliance, with strict accountability for confidentiality and safeguarding of records and information, is authorized to have full, free, and unrestricted access to any and all of the University’s records, physical properties, and personnel pertinent to carrying out compliance investigations and to review and monitor compliance issues. All employees are requested to assist the compliance function in fulfilling its roles and responsibilities.**
