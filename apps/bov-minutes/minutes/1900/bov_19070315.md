University of Virginia, Board of Visitors

March 15, 1907

At a called meeting of the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia, held in the President's office, Friday, March 15, 1907,

**Present:** Visitors White, Harmon, Craddock, Flood, Moore, and President Alderman,

**Absent:** The Rector, and Visitors Buchanan, Norton, Hunton, and Eggleston,

The meeting was called to order at 2:30 p. m., by Hon. Daniel Harmon, acting Rector, and the following resolutions were adopted,-

It appearing that notice having been given, as required by statute, of the purpose of the Board to elect a Professor of General Surgery and Director of the University Hospital:

Now therefore, Dr. Stephen H. Watts having received the votes of the members of the Board present, is declared elected to the chair of General Surgery and Director of the University Hospital, at a salary of $3,000 per annum, to enter upon his duties, September 12th, 1907.

It appearing that notice having been given, as required by statute, of the purpose of the Board to elect a Professor of Economic Geology: Now therefore, Dr. Thomas Leonard Watson having received the votes of the members of the Board present, is declared elected to the chair of Economic Geology, at a salary of $2,800, per annum, to enter upon his duties, September 12th, 1907.

It appearing that notice having been given as required by statute, of the purpose of the Board to elect a Collegiate Professor of Chemistry: Now therefore, Dr. Robert Montgomery Bird having received the votes of the members of the Board present, is declared elected Collegiate Professor of Chemistry, and made Director of the Laboratory for Undergraduate Instruction in Chemistry, at a salary of $2,500 per annum, to enter upon his duties September 12th, 1907.

Resolved: That Dr. Arthur E. Austin be appointed an Adjunct Professor of Physiological Chemistry, for the remainder of the present session, at a salary of $1,000.

The resignation of Dr. Francis Henry Smith as Professor of Natural Philosophy in the University of Virginia, (to take effect, June 12th, 1907) has been received by the Board of Visitors with sincere regret.

The Board of Visitors desires to place on record its appreciation of the character, the devotion, the genius, and the attainments of Professor Smith, as they have been exemplified in his continuous service to the University of Virginia for fifty-seven years. Succeeding William B. Rogers as Professor of Natural Philosophy, he has so conducted that school for a half century, that its fame and its reputation throughout the country, has been placed upon an enduring basis.

The Board desires too, to bear testimony to the strength given to this University through the character and life of Professor Smith. Thousands of young men, throughout this nation, have had their ideals advanced, and their conception of life elevated and dignified, by contact with his personality.

The Board of Visitors wish for him the pleasure and freedom that comes of duty nobly done, and they desire the privilege of retaining him as Emeritus Professor of Natural Philosophy upon the rolls of the University.

Resolved: That, the correspondence between Professor Smith and President Alderman in reference to Professor Smith's resignation is directed to be recorded in the minutes along with this resolution.

I respectfully resign my office as Professor of Natural Philosophy in the University of Virginia; the resignation to take effect at the close of the present session.

Will you kindly transmit the accompanying open letter to the Rector at the next meeting of the Board of Visitors?

This action on my part has been long contemplated. The hour seems to me plainly to have come when I ought to resign to younger and abler hands, the duties of my office.

I lay down my work with a heart full of gratitude for the kindness and forbearance of a long line of distinguished men, visitors, professors, and students, with whom it has been my honor and my good fortune to be associated. Among these happy years, I count those not least which I have spent under your presidency. I cannot say all that I feel, but I retire from the University in the hearty faith that her best days are to come.

I beg to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 3rd inst., conveying to the Rector of the University, the Honorable Armistead C. Gordon, and to myself, your resignation of the professorship of Natural Philosophy in the University of Virginia.

It is difficult for me to tell you how sincerely I regret that you have reached this conclusion. I am aware, as a mere matter of fact, that you have reached an age when earnest men have earned rest and freedom from constant toil. But you will permit me to say that I cannot see that age has touched you at all, in spirit, in method, in point of view, and in capacity of real work, and it would give me profound satisfaction if you could feel that it was best for you to go on with the work which you have carried forward so splendidly for fifty-seven years, and which you are doing to-day with the vigor and enthusiasm of youth.

I count it one of the privileges of my life, as a college president, to have been associated with you; to have known something of your fairmindedness and just spirit, of your scholarly ideals, and of your gentleness mingled with strength, which marks everywhere the complete man.

The news of your resignation will touch the hearts of thousands of men throughout the country, who have felt the inspiration of your teaching; but they will, I believe, have a certain pride in the knowledge that you claim your rest in the full strength of unimpaired power. It is a rare thing that a chair in an American University, existing over a period of eighty-two years, should have been guided for seventy-two years entirely by two men, and by two such men as William B. Rogers and Francis H. Smith. This fact, with other obvious considerations, will make the task of filling the place made vacant by your resignation, one of the severest difficulty. I shall claim the privilege of leaning heavily upon you for guidance and counsel in this large responsibility.

I know that your great zeal will cause you to continue work in the higher reaches of your science, and I want you to know that the University will feel itself honored if you will think of its laboratories, especially your own laboratory, as open to you at all times, for the prosecution of any work you may have on hand, and you must not fancy that I shall spare you in seeking often to have you speak to our students and to our faculty for their good. It is assumed, of course, that you will not lay down your work here until after the close of the session 1906-1907.

I thank you for your kind expression of confidence in me. Such an expression gives me courage and hope for the task I have to perform.

Wishing for your green old age the pleasure of the scholar, and the satisfaction of an unselfish life, I have the honor to remain, with great respect and esteem,

**Resolved:** That the fund of twenty thousand dollars, ($20,000.) so generously given by Mrs. Thomas Nelson Page, be styled the "Barbour-Page Lecture Fund," and that the thanks of this Board be conveyed to the generous donor.

**Resolved:** That the Board of Visitors accept with gratitude the gift of one thousand dollars ($1,000.), from Richard B. Tunstall, for the establishment of the "Isabel M. Tunstall Memorial Library," and that the thanks of the Board be conveyed to the generous donor.

**Resolved:** That the thanks of the Board of Visitors be conveyed to Mr. Andrew Carnegie, for his generous gift of the Organ recently installed in the auditorium of Cabell Hall; and that the sum of $375.00 be appropriated for expenses incurred in the installation of the organ.

**Resolved:** That the Board of Visitors acknowledge with gratitude, the generous donation of $2,500. by the General Education Board of New York City to the Summer School of the University; and that the thanks of the Board be conveyed to the General Education Board.

**Resolved:** That the following resolution of the Building Committee of the Board of Visitors, passed at their meeting on March 4th, 1907, be and the same is hereby approved:

"Resolved, that the Superintendent of Buildings and Grounds be authorized to close a contract for the erection of the Dining Hall;—;and to invite bids for the President's House, reserving the right to reject all bids—;such bids when received, to be reported to a called meeting of this Committee."

**Resolved:** That the Superintendent of Grounds and Buildings be authorized to proceed with the erection of the Dining Hall, and to that end, to make the necessary contracts, and the Bursar is directed to make the necessary disbursements on the order of the Superintendent.

The Finance Committee is authorized to dispose of the Bonds in the hands of the Virginia Trust Company, which constituted the Sinking Fund for the former bond issue, which was refunded, and the amount realized from that source is hereby appropriated to the Building fund.

**Resolved, further,—;**It is the opinion of this Board that the President's house shall be proceeded with as soon as practicable, and the Building Committee are requested to proceed to get bids and make contracts for the same.

**Resolved:** That the sum of three hundred dollars be appropriated out of the current funds of the University, to defray the expenses incident to the establishment of night service in the University Library, for the residue of the session.

**Resolved:** That the annual appropriation heretofore made by this Board to the University of Virginia Summer School of $1,200.00 be increased to $1,500.00

**Resolved:** That in addition to the amount heretofore appropriated by this Board for the purpose of making a proper exhibit at the Jamestown Exposition, there be appropriated the further sum of one thousand five hundred ($1,500 00) dollars (only 100000)

**Resolved:** That all claims for the return of tuition and other fees of students, be referred to a special committee of this Board, composed of Mr. Harmon, the President and the Dean of the University, with full power to act.

**Resolved:** That Pavilion No. VII West Lawn, be rented to the Faculty Club of the University, at an annual rental of $150.00, and that the University put the buildings in such repair as to make it available for the purposes of the Club.

**Resolved:** That the Finance Committee is authorized by unanimous vote to direct and bring about the investment in such securities as may be considered safe, a fund of about $10,000.00 now on deposit in the Charlottesville bank.

**Resolved:** That Mr. Wm. H. White is requested to represent the Board as its attorney in the suit now pending, or any suit that may hereafter be filed involving the construction of the will of the late Edward W. James, so far as the litigation may affect the interests of the University, with power to employ associate counsel in the Richmond suit.

On motion the Board adjourned.

I respectfully resign my office as Professor of Natural Philosophy in the University of Virginia; the resignation to take effect at the close of the present session.

\[President's "Financial Budget", referred to on Page 212.\]

I respectfully resign my office as Professor of Natural Philosophy in the University of Virginia; the resignation to take effect at the close of the present session.

Will you kindly transmit the accompanying open letter to the Rector at the next meeting of the Board of Visitors?

This action on my part has been long contemplated. The hour seems to me plainly to have come when I ought to resign to younger and abler hands, the duties of my office.

I lay down my work with a heart full of gratitude for the kindness and forbearance of a long line of distinguished men, visitors, professors, and students, with whom it has been my honor and my good fortune to be associated. Among these happy years, I count those not least which I have spent under your presidency. I cannot say all that I feel, but I retire from the University in the hearty faith that her best days are to come.

I beg to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 3rd inst., conveying to the Rector of the University, the Honorable Armistead C. Gordon, and to myself, your resignation of the professorship of Natural Philosophy in the University of Virginia.

It is difficult for me to tell you how sincerely I regret that you have reached this conclusion. I am aware, as a mere matter of fact, that you have reached an age when earnest men have earned rest and freedom from constant toil. But you will permit me to say that I cannot see that age has touched you at all, in spirit, in method, in point of view, and in capacity of real work, and it would give me profound satisfaction if you could feel that it was best for you to go on with the work which you have carried forward so splendidly for fifty-seven years, and which you are doing to-day with the vigor and enthusiasm of youth.

I count it one of the privileges of my life, as a college president, to have been associated with you; to have known something of your fairmindedness and just spirit, of your scholarly ideals, and of your gentleness mingled with strength, which marks everywhere the complete man.

The news of your resignation will touch the hearts of thousands of men throughout the country, who have felt the inspiration of your teaching; but they will, I believe, have a certain pride in the knowledge that you claim your rest in the full strength of unimpaired power. It is a rare thing that a chair in an American University, existing over a period of eighty-two years, should have been guided for seventy-two years entirely by two men, and by two such men as William B. Rogers and Francis H. Smith. This fact, with other obvious considerations, will make the task of filling the place made vacant by your resignation, one of the severest difficulty. I shall claim the privilege of leaning heavily upon you for guidance and counsel in this large responsibility.

I know that your great zeal will cause you to continue work in the higher reaches of your science, and I want you to know that the University will feel itself honored if you will think of its laboratories, especially your own laboratory, as open to you at all times, for the prosecution of any work you may have on hand, and you must not fancy that I shall spare you in seeking often to have you speak to our students and to our faculty for their good. It is assumed, of course, that you will not lay down your work here until after the close of the session 1906-1907.

I thank you for your kind expression of confidence in me. Such an expression gives me courage and hope for the task I have to perform.

Wishing for your green old age the pleasure of the scholar, and the satisfaction of an unselfish life, I have the honor to remain, with great respect and esteem,
