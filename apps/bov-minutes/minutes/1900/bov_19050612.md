On motion the Board adjourned to meet at 9:30 A. M.

I have your favor of June 3 enclosing copy of action of the Board of Visitors of the University relative to sales of real estate held by the Trustees under the will of Arthur W. Austin, and inquiring what action, if any, the Trustees have taken relative to sales of real estate.

We have succeeded in disposing of all the real estate in the City of Chelsea, as follows:-

62 Fifth St. was sold in November for $2,000., the purchaser paying $500. cash and giving a mortgage for $1,500. on which $100 has since been paid, reducing the mortgage to $1,400.

60 Fifth St. was sold in December for $2,000., the purchaser paying $400. cash and giving a mortgage for $1,600, on which $100 has since been paid, reducing the mortgage to $1,500.

24-28 Second St. was sold in April for $2,750., the purchaser paying $250. cash and giving a mortgage for $2,500.

There seems no immediate prospect of effecting a satisfactory sale of any of the other real estate at present. I think, however, the disposal of the Chelsea real estate has relieved us of the most undesirable property of this kind.

"Whereas it appears from the report of the Proctor, that there will be a deficit in the current expenses for the year, for which it is necessary to make immediate provision, and

Whereas a doubt has been raised as to the authority of this Board under the law to borrow money for the purpose of meeting such deficit, it is agreed that the individual members of this Board will execute such contract as may be required, to be spread upon records of this Board, binding themselves jointly for the payment of such sum not exceeding $11,000.00, as may be required from time to time, to meet such deficit on the credit of which the Proctor, with the approval of the Executive Committee, is directed to borrow the funds to the limit above mentioned necessary to meet immediate requirements, and the Proctor is directed to repay the amounts borrowed, out of the current income of the University as the same comes into his hands." and,

Whereas an agreement has been made between the Proctor of the University, with the approval of the Executive Committee of the Board of Visitors, and the said Fidelity Savings and Trust Company, of Charlottesville, Va., for the loan by the said Company to the said Proctor, at the rate of three per cent per annum on such sums not exceeding eleven thousand dollars ($11,000.00) in the aggregate, as may be required from time to time to meet any deficit in the current expenses of the University for this fiscal year, said loan or loans to be evidenced by negotiable notes payable on or before October 15th, 1905, to be paid by the Proctor out of the current income of the University as the as the same comes into his hands, such sum so furnished to be credited (by credits on said notes) by the said Fidelity Savings and Trust Company with any deposits made at any time by said Proctor and no notes for such sums or any part thereof to be renewable after the fifteenth day of October, 1905,

Now, therefore, if the said Fidelity Savings and Trust Company is paid such sums above specified and evidenced, with interest at the rate of three per cent per annum until paid, then this obligation to be void otherwise to remain in full force.
