June 13, 1900, the Board met, pursuant to adjournment of yesterday.
Present: The Rector, and Messrs. Bryan, Harman and Moore, Messrs. Miles, Glass, Irvine, Chandler and Downing having been excused.
The following was enacted:
Resolved that the salary of the Demonstrator of Anatomy be increased to $80000 per annum, this increase to be in force for the next year only.
Resolved further that a Dormitory free of rent be assigned to the second assistant demonstrator of anatomy.
In consideration of the additional work to be performed by Dr. J. S. Davis by reason of the rearrangement of the schools in the Medical Department,
Resolved that the salary of Dr. Davis be increased to $2750.00
Resolved that the sum of $6,500.00 be appropriated for the Hospital Fund to be used in building the hospital.
The Board of Visitors desire to call the attention of the Faculty to the establishment of Fellowships in connection with certain schools which appeared to require their services in order that provision might be made for securing assistance to Professors from year to year instead of electing assistants as heretofore. The Board desire the Faculty to consider the expediency of extending these Fellowships to other schools, and to make a report upon the whole subject, and propose such rules as they may deem proper.
Resolved that the Board, thinking it unfortunate that the students should leave the University before the close of the session, earnestly request the Faculty to adopt such measures as may be deemed best to insure their presence here during and for participation in the commencement exercises.
Whereas the estimated income for 1900-1901 is as follows:
Note:-
On a basis of the collections for the present session it is estimated that the per capita for the next session would be $113. It is estimated that to provide for the working expenses of the Medical Department, for Anatomical material, and Laboratory work in Histology, Bacteriology, Chemistry and Physics this per capita should be lowered by $3.00. thus the sum of $110. is arrived at:—;
Be it resolved that the income for 1900-1901 be and is hereby appropriated as follows:
The following is an itemized statement of amounts above appropriated.
The resignation of Dr. Chas. A. Young as Instructor in Hebrew having been received by the Board, it is ordered that the same be accepted, and the Board of Visitors, in accepting his resignation as instructor in Hebrew, desires to assure him of their satisfaction with his services to the University in giving instruction in Hebrew, and in teaching the several classes formed for the study of the English Bible. They are glad that so promising a beginning has been made of what many friends of the institution trust will be a permanent feature of its future teaching. They wish also, in connection with this acknowledgment, to convey to Mr. Young their hearty thanks for contributing by his words in private and in public during his recent travels through the land in the interest of the Endowment of the Bible work here, to the better understanding by the people of what we are trying to do here and to the removal of certain prejudices as to the moral status of the institution, which has been of long standing.
The Board of Visitors, having learned with great satisfaction that the $25,000. Endowment of the John B. Cary Bible Lectureship is now assured, desires to express to the widow and children of the late John B. Cary, and to all who by their gifts or interest have contributed to this unselfish and significant movement, its grateful and appreciative recognition of their kindness, and to assure these donors of its hearty sympathy with the objects of this donation, and of its cooperation in all plans and measures designed to preserve and perpetuate the non-sectarian and evangelical character of this English Bible instruction.
Resolved that this expression of the Board's sentiments be conveyed to Mrs. Jno. B. Cary, of Richmond, and Mrs. Helen E. Moses, of Indianapolis.
On a consideration of the petition of Prof. Noah K. Davis in regard to his place of lecturing, the Board decided that he be permitted to use, as a lecture room, when the Board of Visitors is not in session, the room now occupied by the Board of Visitors, known as the Board of Visitors room,- 
On motion, the meeting adjourned sine die.
There are 175
Law students,
187
Medical students,
270
Academic students,
24
Engineering students.
Total, 656
I have the honor to submit to you a report of the financial transactions of the University for the fiscal year ending June 30th 1900.
It is a pleasure to state that the session now closing has been unprecedently prosperous - the number of matriculates being 656 - the largest number that has ever attended the University, 645 having been the next largest number in attendance in the session 1856-7. Of the 656 students attending the University this session, 136 are Virginia Academic students who are exempt from the payment of tuition fees by #1554, Code of Va. 1887. There are also 22 holders of scholarships who are exempt, and 22 Virginians in professional schools taking academic studies, who are exempt from fees in that Department.
It is gratifying to report to the Board that the Legislature at its last session restored the annuity of the University to $50,000 to includes as heretofore the $10,000 to meet the interest on the $200,000 debt incurred by the restoration of the University buildings after the fire. The Legislature also appropriated $10,000 to the University for the erection of an electric plant and to extend its steam heating apparatus. A special committee has been appointed by the Board and the contract is taken for a plant of 1200 lights, 16 candle power, to be finished and ready for operation by September 1st of this year. On account of the retroactive effect of the law of appropriations in this case, to Oct. 1st 1899, the University has credit for this fiscal year ending June 30th, 1900 for $48,750.
It is advisable in my opinion in the constitutional convention to be held next year, to have the annual appropriation to the University made on the basis of a small percentage of the taxable values of the State, so as to give it a fair and equitable income without the necessity of a petition for its allowance at every meeting of the Legislature. The free tuition here in all Academic studies, without limit, entitles the University to be put on this footing.
It will be recollected by the Board that at its last meeting ten thousand dollars ($10,000) had been received from the Fayerweather fund. Of this amount eight hundred dollars, ($800) as usual, by order of the Court, had to be returned to the counsel, Messrs. Putney and Bishop. Nine thousand, two hundred dollars the remainder, was put at interest at the rate of three per cent on certificate of deposit, in the People's National Bank of Charlottesville. At the instance of Miss Sally Coles of Albemarle County, Captain Lorraine Jones of Virginia, now a resident of St. Louis, generously added five hundred dollars to this sum. This, with interest, now amounts to over ten thousand dollars ($10,000).
By authority of the Board of Visitors, a contract has been entered into with Messrs. John P. Pettijohn & Co. for the main building of the Hospital for the sum of twenty six thousand, six hundred dollars ($26,600). I regret to state that the trustees of the Fayerweather fund have failed to distribute the remainder of the funds of the estate on account of law suits recently entered against it. There would have been some ten thousand dollars above the expenses of the University this session to aid in building the Hospital but but for the law suit brought by James S. Phillips for unpaid work and materials claimed on the new buildings, which suit was compromised by the payment of five thousand and thirty nine dollars ($5,039) including expenses of counsel and witnesses, also one thousand and eighty two dollars and thirty five cents ($1,082.35) paid for the auxiliary water works recently erected, and five hundred dollars ($500) paid for outlet of sewer system. There will still be available from this year's receipts nearly ..... thousand dollars to be added to the hospital fund. It is earnestly to be desired that the hospital building shall be completed without delay, and whilst the Board is prohibited by law from incurring debt, it can allow a contract to be made on reasonable time, and we have precedents in the past for such action.
An order has been issued by the Post Office Department in Washington for the discontinuance of the University Post Office and for its transfer to Charlottesville on the first of July next. This will be a serious blow to the University. It will tempt the students to frequent the city during the intervals of the mail delivery and collection and is likelt to lead to trouble. I hope the transfer may be prevented.
The two hotels on West Range changed hands at the beginning of the present session, one being occupied by Mrs. Perkinson and the other by Mrs. Yancey. Both hotels were put in thorough order by the University before being rented. At the request of Mrs. Yancey early in the session, the Mess Hall, with kitchen and store room appurtenances, was entirely separated from the private dwelling house and sub-let by her to Mr. John Campbell, she herself taking some eighteen boarders in her private dining room. This plan is found to work well; the long list of failures under the old system demonstrates that the hotel plan cannot be successfully operated by ladies. On the other hand the increase and success of private boarding houses around the University show the signal success and advantage of that plan.
The Gymnasium has been thoroughly refitted with two boilers - one for hot water heating and one for hot water bathing for members. The pipes have been properly reset and the radiators changed from indirect to direct, to the great advantage of the heating arrangement. The lower floor has been painted and the porch tinned and painted.
The stone house occupied by Mr. Noreck has had an ample area, ten feet deep in one place, dug around it and walled up with stone, brick and hydraulic cement, in order to make the lower story entirely dry and healthy, and I am glad to report it has had the desired effect and saved the house to the University as a desirable place of occupation.
The amount $1075., specified in the annual account for lights, expresses only half the cost of gas and electricity to the University for the reason that specific appropriations not included in it are made by the Board for the different Departments, which will amount, together with the above sum, to over $2000 annually. The gas pipes having been put down in 1855 are rusty and leaky and although the leaks are repaired as often as discovered, considerable loss occurs annually from this source, as a large metre at our boundary charges all that passes through to the University. The policy of the University is obviously to substitute gas by electricity, the plant for which is about to be put in for lighting the University, and to run a small galvanized pipe to our laboratories for gas, the metres for which should be at the laboratories and not, as now, at the boundary, subjecting us to the collection of all dues and the loss of all leakage whether for the University or for others.
Ultimately the heating of all the dormitories except perhaps Carr's Hill, should be done by hot water, in the interest of economy and safety. The present piping is suitable, as far as it goes, for that purpose, the radiators to be exchanged for hot water radiators at small expense. The heat is more uniform and satisfactory than steam and furnished at half the expense.
A yearly appropriation for the introduction of this system in the event we should have no specific endowments for this purpose, would establish a self-sustaining and economical heat for the University.
Should the Alumni Association adopt a plan, it is my purpose to suggest another story to the present Alumni Hall, affording a large hall and several rooms. The greater portion of the money for this purpose is in hand, and a conference with the architect, Mr. Paul J. Pelz, shows the plan to be entirely feasible. Should the Alumni Association approve of the plan, it will be at once submitted to you during this session for your approval.
The heavy wrought iron frames required by the contract in the skylights of the new buildings but substitued by the contractors with inadequate folds of copper sheeting, have been made to order and substantially out in place, making the skylights entirely safe.
It is understood that Mr. Jas. D. Jones, the worthy and excellent clerk of your Board, will resign the place on account of ill-health. In that event I urge the appointment of Mr. I. K. Moran, the clerk of my office, for the position. The office is germane in every sense to that of the Proctor's, the records being kept in the latter and being the chart by which it is guided. Mr. Moran is a fully equipped and most faithful clerk of long experience, his books being models of book-keeping and his salary small - $600. He was a soldier in Pickett's immortal Division of Virginians and lost his leg above the knee. A more faithful and efficient clerk cannot be found. I ask that the office be given him and the salary pertaining to it be added to his present small salary.
The attention of the Board is asked to the accompanying itemized statement of receipts and expenditures embracing actual transactions to this date, and estimated expenditures for the balance of this month - the end of our fiscal year.
June 12, 1900, the Board met in pursuance of adjournment on yesterday.
Present: The same members as on yesterday, except Mr. Glass.
The following was enacted
Resolved that the resolution passed by this Board at its session, Oct. 10, 1899, acknowledging the receipt of the gift of Mr. Geo. H. Byrd, of New York, establishing the "Albert Henry Byrd Endowment Fund in aid of the Library of the University." be and is hereby in its fourth clause so as to read as follows: "Fourth: In no event shall the principal be reduced for any purpose, nor shall any portion of the income be used for any purpose not indicated above.
In view of the fact that Mr. Jno. V. Allen, a student, occupied room No. 29, W. Lawn, for a shot time at the beginning of the session, as a guest of another and without making any contract with reference to it, express or implied, and that inadvertently he has been charged with the payment of, and has paid the sum of $8.00 for servant's attention to the room, it is resolved that said sum of $8.00 be refunded to Mr. Allen.
Resolved, in accordance with the recommendation of the Faculty (numbered 7 in their annual report) that after the session ending June, 1901, instruction in Hebrew shall be discontinued in the University of Virginia.
Resolved: The Board of Visitors accept with gratitude the gift of the portrait of the late Professor Geo. Frederick Holmes, made by his daughter, Miss L. E. L. Holmes; and will order that the portrait be placed in the Library with or near the books which formerly belonged to Prof Holmes.
Resolved that a Committee consisting of three members of the Board be appointed to co-operate with a Committee of the Alumni Association in an effort to advance the interests of the University in regard to gifts, endowments, and in the general manner recently suggested to the Board by Dr. Thomas Nelson Page, and that the Alumni Association be notified of this action.
The Rector appointed Messrs. Moore, Bryan and Harmon to act as said Committee to confer with Committee from Alumni Association.
It is ordered that Dr. Barringer's propositions for changes in the executive management made in his recent communication to the Board be referred for consideration and report to the Committee entrusted with the revision of the laws of the University.
Resolved, in accordance with the recommendation of the Faculty (numbered 9 in their annual report) that Dr. Barringer be authorized during this summer to devote such time as he can spare to make a personal effort to secure additional funds for the Hospital; and the sum of $250.00, or so much thereof as may be necessary, is hereby appropriated to defray his necessary travelling expenses.
Resolved, that $500.00 be and is hereby appropriated for the use of the law department library.
Whereas, Mr. G. B. McLemore, a student of the University during a portion of the past session, withdrew from the University before entering upon the last half of the session, and asks an abatement of $2500 from the charges against him on the books of the University on that account. Therefore, resolved that the said sum of $25.00 be allowed Mr. McLemore as an abatement pursuant to his request.
Resolved: The application of Miss Bessie Hullihen \[?\] to stand the M. A. examination in Latin with the view of obtaining an official certificate of graduation, be laid on the table; and the Rector is requested to inform Miss Hullihen \[?\] that three years ago the Board of Visitors repealed the resolutions under which such an examination as she desires was held.
Whereas it is desirable to extend the good-will of this University outside of the State of Virginia, and build up its patronage; Therefore be it
Resolved: That the Board of Visitors establish three scholarships to be known as "The Board of Visitors' Scholarships," of Two Hundred and Fifty Dollars each; and, Resolved further, that one of these scholarships e assigned to the Academic Department, one to the Medical Department and one to the Law Department.
Resolved further that these scholarships e given to residents of States outside of Virginia in compliment to the patronage extended to this University by these states since it was founded.
Resolved further that the Chairman of the Executive Committee upon recommendation of the Chairman of the Faculty award these Scholarships and restrict them as far as they may be able to discern to young men who could not otherwise attend the University.
Resolved further that no one of these scholarships be awarded to the name student more than for one session.
Resolved that a Committee consisting of Mr. Harmon and Professors Page and Kent be appointed to consider sec. 21 of the report of the Faculty, and do what may be proper and expedient touching the recommendations therein made, and also to consider and report on a suggestion that an effort be made to establish a medium of publication in connection with the University work.
Resolved: The sum of $423.00 be and is hereby returned to the working fund of the Observatory in accordance with the request of the Faculty, the above amount having been used in 1896 for the payment of insurance on the Observatory Buildings.
Resolved, in accordance with the recommendation of Prof. Stone, that Messrs. Herbert R. Morgan, Heber D. Curtis, and J. P. McCallie, be and the same are hereby appointed Fellows in Astronomy for the ensuing year.
Resolved that Mr. Tinsley Perick Junkin be and he is hereby appointed to the John Y. Mason Fellowship for the session of 1900-1901; and that Mr. H. M. Hays be and he is hereby recommended to the Chairman for as liberal arrangements as practicable for fees in the further prosecution of his work at the University.
Resolved that Mr. Harman and Mr. Moore of this Board be and are hereby appointed a Committee to meet with a Committee from the Miller Fund Board to consider during the summer the proper method for the expenditure of the income from this fund to report to a meeting of this Board to be held in October next.
Whereas, this Board has received the following communication from the Miller Board, by R. T. W. Duke, Jr., Secretary, to-wit -
"Mr. Nicholas C. Hammer has been nominated by the Miller Board to the scholarship given to a pupil of the Miller School, and his election by the Board of Visitors is requested. (signed) R. T. W. Duke, Jr. Secretary. June 12, 1900."
Therefore, resolved, in accordance with the foregoing recommendation, that Mr. Nicholas C. Hammer be and he is hereby appointed to the Miller Scholarship for the ensuing year.
Resolved that Prof. Richard H. Wilson be and he is hereby elected Professor of Romance Languages at the salary of $3,000.00, and a residence at $300.00 as commutation therefor.

Resolved that the thanks of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia be offered to the Western Union Telegraph Co., for the courtesies extended to Eclipse Expedition of the Leander McCormick Observatory which contributed materially to the success of its work.
The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, in session June 12, 1900, were officially notified of the death of Mr. Leander J. McCormick, of Chicago, February 20, 1900, and thereupon entered upon the records by unanimous vote the following minute:
"This Board has heard with regret of the death of Mr. Leander J. McCormick of Chicago, one of the wise benefactors of the University of Virginia, whose generous munificence has enabled this institution to take and hold high rank in an important branch of scientific investigation, and it desires to express to his family assurance of its respectful sympathy with them in their grief.
Resolved that Prof. Wm M. Thornton be granted a year's leave of absence from his lecture work in Applied Mathematics for the purpose of inviting gifts and endowments for this University, and of presenting its claims upon the wealth and benevolence of America.
Resolved further that the sum of $1500.00, or so much thereof as may be necessary, be and is hereby appropriated for the purpose of securing an Assistant to carry on the work and lectures of the Department of Applied Mathematics, and that Prof. Thornton be authorized to select and name this Assistant.
Resolved further that the sum of $1000.00, or so much thereof as may be necessary, be and is hereby appropriated for the purpose of defraying the travelling expenses of Prof. Thornton while engaged in this work.
Resolved that there be established the following two Fellowships, to-wit: A Fellowship in English Literature and a Fellowship in Teutonic Languages, the compensation for each to be $200.00 per annum, the appointments to be made upon the recommendation of the Professor in charge of the respective schools, and the holder of such fellowship to render such assistance to the Professor in charge as may be assigned to him.
Resolved that Dr. P. B. Barringer be authorized to appoint an assistant for one year to take subordinate charge of the subject of Materia Medica, Dr. Barringer to retain responsibility for the teaching of that subject, and that an appropriation be made of $300.00 to carry out this arrangement.
The Board has learned that the Post Office Department has ordered that University Station be closed as an office. Such contemplated action is viewed with alarm, and, if carried into effect, will greatly inconvenience this institution, and may seriously affect the government of its students; and the Proctor is hereby directed to take such steps by presenting petitions and memorials to the proper offices praying that no such change in the Post Office facilities of the University of Va, as is contemplated, be made.
It is ordered, in accordance with the recommendations of section 24 of the report of the Faculty, that local Alumni Associations be allowed to make their appointments to Alumni scholarships for next session, even though they may have failed to comply with the technical requirements of the plan heretofore adopted for making such appointments.
Resolved, that in order to provide for the instruction in the four-year course in Medicine, the Proctor is authorized and directed to place annually to the credit of the Physical Department $2.50 for each of the first year Medical students, and $1.50 for each of the 2nd year Medical students, and that the Proctor be directed to make the same charges to the credit of the Chemical Department.
Resolved that Mr. W.m M. M. Thomas be and is hereby appointed to the Bierly Scholarship for the session of 19001901.

Resolved that the sum of $6,500.00 be appropriated for the Hospital Fund to be used in building the hospital.
The Board of Visitors desire to call the attention of the Faculty to the establishment of Fellowships in connection with certain schools which appeared to require their services in order that provision might be made for securing assistance to Professors from year to year instead of electing assistants as heretofore. The Board desire the Faculty to consider the expediency of extending these Fellowships to other schools, and to make a report upon the whole subject, and propose such rules as they may deem proper.
Resolved that the Board, thinking it unfortunate that the students should leave the University before the close of the session, earnestly request the Faculty to adopt such measures as may be deemed best to insure their presence here during and for participation in the commencement exercises.
