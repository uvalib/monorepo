Proctor's Report.

Various School Reports.

Various and sundry petitions, applications, etc.

After due consideration, the following resolutions were adopted:—;

Resolved that all tuition fees, University fees, contingent deposits, rents of rooms in University buildings and charges for services in same, are payable upon entrance. Under special conditions, the Chairman is authorized to allow credit; but these deferred payments are in all cases to be properly secured.

The Proctor having laid before the Board the application of T. G. Peyton & Son, agents of certain Fire Insurance Companies, to be allowed to renew $40,000 of Fire Insurance which will expire the 26th June, 1901,—;The Proctor is hereby authorized to renew $20,000 of said Insurance with said T. G. Peyton & Son, provided the rate is as low and the companies as secure and policies as favorable as the Proctor can otherwise obtain, and provided no interest of the University is adversely affected by so placing said insurance;- and the balance of said insurance he shall place with L. T. Hanckel & Son on their proposition submitted.

Resolved that the application of A. G. Robinson for rat- able return of fees be rejected.

Resolved that Eighteen Hundred ($1800) Dollars or so much thereof as may be necessary be appropriated to renew the insurance on the University buildings.

Resolved that that portion of the University lands known as the University farm, situated North of the Chesapeake & Ohio R. R. be and is hereby set apart for the use of the General Athletic Association of the University, in lieu of any grant heretofore made.

Resolved, further, that the said Athletic Association be and is hereby permitted to relay the present sewer pipe through the property, provided it is done in an efficient and workmanlike manner, and that any permission heretofore granted in connection with said sewer pipe be and is hereby modified in accordance with this resolution.

Resolved, further, that this permission is subject to revocation at the will of the Board.

Resolved that there be paid to the architect of the hospital, Mr. Paul J. Pelz, the sum of $750.00, the balance of fees and traveling expenses due him.

Resolved that there be appropriated for supplying the hospital with a heating apparatus the sum of $2800.00.

Resolved that the annual appropriation of $600.00 heretofore made for the general maintenance of the hospital be increased by the sum of $1450, so that the total shall be $2050.00

Resolved that the Supt. of Grounds and Buildings be authorized to carry out the arrangement suggested in paragraph 5 of the Faculty's Report relating to conveying water to the Cemetery.

Resolved that the recommendation of the Faculty in paragraph 8 of their Report, respecting the three Board of Visitors Scholarships, commonly known as the athletic scholarships heretofore established, is affirmed, and that such scholarships be and they are abolished.

Resolved that the sum of $300 be appropriated to continue the publication of the Bulletin.

Resolved that the Board appreciates the consideration of Mr. Charles Broadway Rouss in presenting a marble bust of himself to the University, and directs that the same shall be placed and preserved in the Physical Laboratory with which his liberality has connected the name of Mr. Rouss. The Secretary of this Board will transmit to Mr. Rouss a copy of this resolution.

The Rector and Visitors, of the University of Virginia return their thanks to John L. Williams, Esq., for the splendid portrait of Chief Justice Marshall which he has placed in the library of this institution. The Board takes especial pleasure in recognizing this tribute of affection from an alumnus who, having won its highest academic honor, now brings to his Alma Mater for the benefit and encouragement of those who follow him the picture of a great examplar of wisdom, learning, purity, and patriotism; and it is resolved that the Secretary be directed to transmit a copy of these resolutions to Mr. John L. Williams.

Resolved that the request of the Law Faculty for an additional appropriation of five hundred ($500.00) dollars with which to purchase law books be and the same is hereby granted for the ensuing year.

Resolved that the recommendation contained in paragraph 20 of the Faculty's report relative to the announcement of a course of study for those wishing to enter the government consular service be affirmed.

Resolved that students who present a baccalaureate degree or diplomas of graduation in Pharmacy, Dentistry or Veterinary Medicine, will, in accordance with the rules of the Association of American Medical Colleges, be entitled to the privilege of undertaking studies of the second year together with those of the first year.

Resolved that the recommendations of the Committee of the Medical Faculty contained in sections 3 and 4 of their report, with reference to keeping the hospital open during the summer be approved, and that the Medical Faculty are hereby authorized to put said recommendations into practical operation if in the judgment of said Faculty it is best to do so.

Resolved that Thomas Towles, who is under 16 years of age, be permitted to enter the University and attend the academic schools, on the same terms as students who are over 16 years; that he shall not be required for next session to pay any fees in the academic department. This is done out of our appreciation for the valuable services of his father, the late Dr. W. B. Towles who died while a professor of this University.

At this time, shortly after noon, Mr. H. H. Downing arrived and joined in the deliberations of the Board.

Resolved that, Dr. Barringer having withdrawn his resignation of the Chairmanship, there be paid him as his compensation for the ensuing year the sum of $500.00 in addition to the regular salary provided by section 104 of the laws in consideration of the extent and importance of the work that unusual conditions will impose on the Chairman in the near future; this arrangement to be regarded as temporary and not as permanently increasing the salary fixed by said section.

Resolved that Professors John Staige Davis and Raleigh C. Minor shall each hereafter receive the salary and have the use of a residence or the commutation in lieu thereof attached to a full professorship by sections 82 & 83 of the Laws,- and that Professor J. M. Page be made a full professor in his department and be entitled to the same salary and allowance.

Upon the recommendation and nomination of Mr. Albert S. Brown - Resolved that Jesse W. Downy, an applicant, be given the Valentine Birely Scholarship for the year 1901-1902.

Resolved that the following appropriations be made to be expended by the the Superintendent of Grounds & Buildings, for the following purposes

Resolved that the recommendation of the faculty be adopted and the appropriation for the library be increased to $1000.00 for the next year, and further that an additional appropriation of $200.00 be made for the services of an assistant to the librarian, and that the library be kept open at night until such hour as the faculty may direct, the said assistant to be appointed for the next year by the Chairman of the faculty with the advice and consent of the librarian.

Resolved that the action of the Miller Board in the appropriation of Three Hundred Dollars for an additional scholarship for the ensuing year, in accordance with the resolution of the Faculty which this Board has approved and the nomination of Mr. Peyton H. Bragg to fill said scholarship, be and the same is hereby approved by this Board.

The report of H. H. Downing and others, Committee appointed at the last November meeting to consider the propriety of permitting the Charlottesville City & Suburban Street Railway Co. to enter the grounds of the University, filed their report adverse to such privilege being granted, which report was adopted and ordered to be filed

"To the Rector and Board of Visitors of the University of Va.

Your Committee appointed at the November, 1900, meeting of the Board to consider the application of the Charlottesville City and Suburban Street Railway Co. for permission to enter the University grounds, begs leave to report that, since your Committee was appointed, considerable opposition has developed to the application of the said Street Railway Co., both by the Faculty and the student body of the University, and your Committee deems it inexpedient to allow said Street Railway Co. any other or further rights in the grounds of the University than those now enjoyed.

In response to your request for a statement of my views regarding the essentials of agricultural education, I would respectfully submit the following

Agriculture, as I understand it, is primarily the art of cultivating the soil with a view to profit: in its usual sense it includes the successful raising and marketing of crops alike of plants and of animals, or of their products.

Its theory is based upon the sciences of Chemistry, Botany, and Zoology, and its intelligent practice involves the application of their facts and principles, and those of other allied but less definitely fundamental sciences, such as Geology, Physics and Mechanics. Agricultural education demands, therefore, at the outset, instruction in these fundamental sciences in their relation to the art in question, and subsequently the discussion of its principles and processes as based upon them.

Instruction in these fundamental sciences in their relation to agriculture might properly include in the case of Chemistry not only the leading facts and laws of the science but also its methods and its technique, as applied alike to analysis and to synthesis: the chemical (and associated physical) structure of soils the composition of vegetable and animal substances and the chemical processes involved in the lives of plants and animals: the composition and intelligent compounding of fertilizers in relation to various crops of plants, and of food stuffs in their relation to stock-feeding: the composition and characteristics of vegetable and animal products in relation to their preservation and storage: and other subjects of a kindred nature.

In the case of Botany such instruction might properly include the discussion of the structure of the various types of plants, and their systematic classification as based thereon: the principles of vegetable physiology in general, and in particular the laws of nutrition, growth and multiplication, special attention being given on one hand to the higher groups from which the leading crop-plants are derived, and to the lower groups which compose the greater number of forms injurious to the plants and animals in which the agriculturist is interested; in connection with the former might be pursued the study of the origin, history and modes of production of cultivated varieties, and with the latter the study of the diseases and parasites of crop-plants which form in a number of cases the most serious obstacle to crop-raising, as well as the relation of the organisms in question to the infectious diseases of live-stock with other allied topics. In the case of Zoology such instruction would include a similar consideration of the fundamental facts and laws of animal life, the structure and classification of animals, and the study of their vital processes, especially of the anatomy and physiology of the highest types of animals, which includes nearly all the species involved in stock-farming: the habits and life-histories of insects, particularly those that are either injurious or bebficial: the nature and treatment of external and internal animal parasites: and the like.

A discussion of the general theory or principles of Agriculture based upon such fundamental knowledge of the most important sciences as is indicated above may properly include the consideration of soils as regards their composition, situation and exposure: the methods of reclaiming waste lands: the principles of drainage; tillage and the management of crops in such manner as to obtain profitable returns without diminution of fertility the choice and rotation of crops; the principles of husbandry, as applied to the storage and care of crop-products and food supplies: the housing and care of stock the hygiene of the farm, and the best methods of protection against the insect pests and fungous or bacterial plagues to which staple crops are subject: the specific care and culture of particular crops the methods and value of intensive farming the conduct and significance of agricul- tural experimentation: and many other similar subjects.

This discussion may perhaps be summarized as follows:

Agricultural Education involves the study of

A.—;The sciences upon which the art of crop-raising is directly based, namely,

Chemistry, including

General Chemistry as a science;

Chemistry as related to agriculture.

Botany, including

Botany as a science;

Botany as related to agriculture.

Zoology, including

Zoology as a science;

Zoology as related to agriculture.

B.—;The Principles of Agriculture as based upon these sciences, and the rationale and economics of the various processes involved.

June 11,- 1901, the Board met pursuant to adjournment of yesterday.

Present: The Rector, Mr. C. P. Jones, and Messrs. Harmon, Miles, Downing, and Moore.

The following was enacted:-

Resolved that Mr. Miles be appointed a Committee on the Austin bequest to ascertain and report what further arrangements should be made relative to it. The Proctor shall pay such expenses as Mr. Miles may find it necessary to incur.

Resolved that Mr. Harmon and Col. Carter be appointed a Committee to consider Mr. Wills' proposition to occupy a lot on the University grounds for the erection of a drug store, and to make such a contract with Mr. Wills as they may think best, the same to be expressed in a proper, written instrument.

The attention of the faculty is called to the fact that the Board has been generous in the appropriations for the session 1901-02. In order to meet these appropriations it will be necessary for us to have 700 students. This cannot be accomplished without the zealous and earnest efforts of the members of the faculty during the coming vacation, and we confidently expect that they will not fail to bring about this result. The Secretary is requested to communicate a copy of this resolution to the Chairman of the faculty at once.

In as much as Mr. Bradley Walker accepted a Board of Visitors Scholarship last year with the expectation that the same should be continued, and as he has been an excellent student, be it resolved that the said scholarship is continued in his favor for the next session.

The following is an estimate of the receipts for the year 1901-1902.

Out of the income of the University for the year 19011902, the following appropriations are made:

Estimated Deficit - - - -

Note:—;

Instead of a deficit, the season now closing would have shown a handsome surplus—;about $14,000.00—;if there had not been large expenditures ordered during the session—;$10,900.00 for Hospital construction, about $765.00 for extra Infirmary expenses caused by cases of typhoid fever and smallpox, nearly $1,250.00 for installation of electric lights, and about $1,200.00 for legal counsel, suits, etc. Even with all this extra expenditure, the accounts of the session would pretty nearly balance if all sums due from students could be collected. On May 24th, there remained due and uncollected from this source $3,073.70; it is estimated that about $600.00 will be paid between that date and the end of the session, leaving an estimated deficit as above stated.

On motion the Board adjourned.

Resolved that the Board appreciates the consideration of Mr. Charles Broadway Rouss in presenting a marble bust of himself to the University, and directs that the same shall be placed and preserved in the Physical Laboratory with which his liberality has connected the name of Mr. Rouss. The Secretary of this Board will transmit to Mr. Rouss a copy of this resolution.

The Rector and Visitors, of the University of Virginia return their thanks to John L. Williams, Esq., for the splendid portrait of Chief Justice Marshall which he has placed in the library of this institution. The Board takes especial pleasure in recognizing this tribute of affection from an alumnus who, having won its highest academic honor, now brings to his Alma Mater for the benefit and encouragement of those who follow him the picture of a great examplar of wisdom, learning, purity, and patriotism; and it is resolved that the Secretary be directed to transmit a copy of these resolutions to Mr. John L. Williams.

Resolved that the request of the Law Faculty for an additional appropriation of five hundred ($500.00) dollars with which to purchase law books be and the same is hereby granted for the ensuing year.

Resolved that Thomas Towles, who is under 16 years of age, be permitted to enter the University and attend the academic schools, on the same terms as students who are over 16 years; that he shall not be required for next session to pay any fees in the academic department. This is done out of our appreciation for the valuable services of his father, the late Dr. W. B. Towles who died while a professor of this University.

At this time, shortly after noon, Mr. H. H. Downing arrived and joined in the deliberations of the Board.

Resolved that, Dr. Barringer having withdrawn his resignation of the Chairmanship, there be paid him as his compensation for the ensuing year the sum of $500.00 in addition to the regular salary provided by section 104 of the laws in consideration of the extent and importance of the work that unusual conditions will impose on the Chairman in the near future; this arrangement to be regarded as temporary and not as permanently increasing the salary fixed by said section.

Bragg to fill said scholarship, be and the same is hereby approved by this Board.

The report of H. H. Downing and others, Committee appointed at the last November meeting to consider the propriety of permitting the Charlottesville City & Suburban Street Railway Co. to enter the grounds of the University, filed their report adverse to such privilege being granted, which report was adopted and ordered to be filed

"To the Rector and Board of Visitors of the University of Va.

Your Committee appointed at the November, 1900, meeting of the Board to consider the application of the Charlottesville City and Suburban Street Railway Co. for permission to enter the University grounds, begs leave to report that, since your Committee was appointed, considerable opposition has developed to the application of the said Street Railway Co., both by the Faculty and the student body of the University, and your Committee deems it inexpedient to allow said Street Railway Co. any other or further rights in the grounds of the University than those now enjoyed.

In response to your request for a statement of my views regarding the essentials of agricultural education, I would respectfully submit the following

Agriculture, as I understand it, is primarily the art of cultivating the soil with a view to profit: in its usual sense it includes the successful raising and marketing of crops alike of plants and of animals, or of their products.

Its theory is based upon the sciences of Chemistry, Botany, and Zoology, and its intelligent practice involves the application of their facts and principles, and those of other allied but less definitely fundamental sciences, such as Geology, Physics and Mechanics. Agricultural education demands, therefore, at the outset, instruction in these fundamental sciences in their relation to the art in question, and subsequently the discussion of its principles and processes as based upon them.

Instruction in these fundamental sciences in their relation to agriculture might properly include in the case of Chemistry not only the leading facts and laws of the science but also its methods and its technique, as applied alike to analysis and to synthesis: the chemical (and associated physical) structure of soils the composition of vegetable and animal substances and the chemical processes involved in the lives of plants and animals: the composition and intelligent compounding of fertilizers in relation to various crops of plants, and of food stuffs in their relation to stock-feeding: the composition and characteristics of vegetable and animal products in relation to their preservation and storage: and other subjects of a kindred nature.

In the case of Botany such instruction might properly include the discussion of the structure of the various types of plants, and their systematic classification as based thereon: the principles of vegetable physiology in general, and in particular the laws of nutrition, growth and multiplication, special attention being given on one hand to the higher groups from which the leading crop-plants are derived, and to the lower groups which compose the greater number of forms injurious to the plants and animals in which the agriculturist is interested; in connection with the former might be pursued the study of the origin, history and modes of production of cultivated varieties, and with the latter the study of the diseases and parasites of crop-plants which form in a number of cases the most serious obstacle to crop-raising, as well as the relation of the organisms in question to the infectious diseases of live-stock with other allied topics. In the case of Zoology such instruction would include a similar consideration of the fundamental facts and laws of animal life, the structure and classification of animals, and the study of their vital processes, especially of the anatomy and physiology of the highest types of animals, which includes nearly all the species involved in stock-farming: the habits and life-histories of insects, particularly those that are either injurious or bebficial: the nature and treatment of external and internal animal parasites: and the like.

A discussion of the general theory or principles of Agriculture based upon such fundamental knowledge of the most important sciences as is indicated above may properly include the consideration of soils as regards their composition, situation and exposure: the methods of reclaiming waste lands: the principles of drainage; tillage and the management of crops in such manner as to obtain profitable returns without diminution of fertility the choice and rotation of crops; the principles of husbandry, as applied to the storage and care of crop-products and food supplies: the housing and care of stock the hygiene of the farm, and the best methods of protection against the insect pests and fungous or bacterial plagues to which staple crops are subject: the specific care and culture of particular crops the methods and value of intensive farming the conduct and significance of agricul- tural experimentation: and many other similar subjects.

This discussion may perhaps be summarized as follows:

Agricultural Education involves the study of

A.—;The sciences upon which the art of crop-raising is directly based, namely,

Chemistry, including

General Chemistry as a science;

Chemistry as related to agriculture.

Botany, including

Botany as a science;

Botany as related to agriculture.

Zoology, including

Zoology as a science;

Zoology as related to agriculture.

B.—;The Principles of Agriculture as based upon these sciences, and the rationale and economics of the various processes involved.

June 11,- 1901, the Board met pursuant to adjournment of yesterday.

Present: The Rector, Mr. C. P. Jones, and Messrs. Harmon, Miles, Downing, and Moore.  

The following was enacted:-  

Resolved that Mr. Miles be appointed a Committee on the Austin bequest to ascertain and report what further arrangements should be made relative to it. The Proctor shall pay such expenses as Mr. Miles may find it necessary to incur.

Resolved that Mr. Harmon and Col. Carter be appointed a Committee to consider Mr. Wills' proposition to occupy a lot on the University grounds for the erection of a drug store, and to make such a contract with Mr. Wills as they may think best, the same to be expressed in a proper, written instrument.

The attention of the faculty is called to the fact that the Board has been generous in the appropriations for the session 1901-02. In order to meet these appropriations it will be necessary for us to have 700 students. This cannot be accomplished without the zealous and earnest efforts of the members of the faculty during the coming vacation, and we confidently expect that they will not fail to bring about this result. The Secretary is requested to communicate a copy of this resolution to the Chairman of the faculty at once.

In as much as Mr. Bradley Walker accepted a Board of Visitors Scholarship last year with the expectation that the same should be continued, and as he has been an excellent student, be it resolved that the said scholarship is continued in his favor for the next session.

The following is an estimate of the receipts for the year 1901-1902.  

Out of the income of the University for the year 19011902, the following appropriations are made:

Estimated Deficit - - - -

Note:—;

Instead of a deficit, the season now closing would have shown a handsome surplus—;about $14,000.00—;if there had not been large expenditures ordered during the session—;$10,900.00 for Hospital construction, about $765.00 for extra Infirmary expenses caused by cases of typhoid fever and smallpox, nearly $1,250.00 for installation of electric lights, and about $1,200.00 for legal counsel, suits, etc. Even with all this extra expenditure, the accounts of the session would pretty nearly balance if all sums due from students could be collected. On May 24th, there remained due and uncollected from this source $3,073.70; it is estimated that about $600.00 will be paid between that date and the end of the session, leaving an estimated deficit as above stated.

On motion the Board adjourned.
