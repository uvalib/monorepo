We wish for them the highest success in their new undertakings.

The Board adopted the following resolution:

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the Hospital Accounts Committee be and it is hereby authorized to charge off as uncollectible accounts Schedules 715, 718, 719, 722, 725, 726, 729, 732 and 733, aggregating $94,332.24, as recommended by it.

The following resolution was adopted by the Board:

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the Committee on Student Accounts be and it is hereby authorized to charge off as uncollectible accounts Schedules 10 and 12, aggregating $8,412.53, as recommended by it.

Recommending approval of a proposal by Dean Abbott for an increase of $100.00 in tuition for all students, both Virginians and non-Virginians, in the Graduate School of Business Administration, President Darden pointed out that the resulting total tuition costs ($500.00 for Virginians and $850.00 for non-Virginians) would still be lower than the tuition rates of comparable graduate business schools.

The Board adopted the following resolution:

**RESOLVED** by The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that tuition in the Graduate School of Business Administration be and it is hereby increased by $100 for all students, effective for the academic session 1958-1959.

Inaugurating a discussion of the problem of instructional costs and the out-of-state student, President Darden presented the following letter from the Comptroller:

In an effort to determine the costs per student in the Law School, I have consulted with the State Auditors who made the last detailed cost study of the University. This study was made for the fiscal year 195253. Applying the general procedures of that study to our present costs, I have come up with the following:

The current out-of-state tuition in the Law School is $625.00.

The following resolution was adopted by the Board.

**RESOLVED** by The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that tuition for non-Virginia students in the School of Law be and it is hereby increased by $100.00, from the present rate of $625.00 to $725.00, effective for the academic session 1958-1959.

Proposals by Dean Cherry for increased Summer Session fees were presented and recommended by the President.

The Board adopted the following resolution:

**RESOLVED** by The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the following schedule of Summer Session fees be and it is hereby adopted, effective for the 1958 Summer Session.

President Darden presented, recommending approval, a memorandum from the Provost of the University setting forth the following proposals by the Athletic Council regarding Mr. Ben S. Martin, Head Coach of Football:

1. That Coach Martin's salary be increased to $11,500, as of February 1, 1958, to February 1, 1959.
2. That Coach Martin's contract also be extended for three years, from February 1, 1959, to February 1, 1962 at $12,000.

The Board resolved that the President be authorized to proceed in this matter in accordance with the foregoing recommendation by the Provost and the Athletic Council.

The Rector presented to the Visitors several communications, together with maps and plats, relative to the choice of a permanent location for the Northern Virginia College, which now occupies leased quarters at Bailey's Cross Roads. The following letter was read to the Board:

I have your Special Delivery letter of November 27 requesting that I provide a set of written proposals to the Board of Visitors covering the sites recommended to the Board by our Board of Control in our letter of November 15th. I regret that you have not had a more prompt response, but I did not receive your letter until December 3rd (Tuesday) when it was forwarded to me in Richmond where I was on the General Assembly inspection tour. I have just returned from this duty.

I assume that by "written proposals" the Board desires a description of the three properties which we have recommended. It is very difficult to describe these adequately by letter because two of them are parts of larger and multiple parcels, and this is especially true when it comes to giving an adequate description of typography, approaches to the property, surroundings, etc. Only by a physical inspection could these details be fully appreciated. It was for this reason we suggested that we should be happy to go over the properties involved in person. I shall, however, try to comply with your request the best I am able. Descriptions of the three properties follow, listed according to alphabetical designation of the tracts by name.

It should be said at the outset that the Board of Control, in considering dozens of parcels of land, adhered as closely as possible to the following criteria:

1. The site should be as near as possible to both the geographical and estimated population center of the populous areas to be served.
2. The site should be as easy of access as possible and adjacent to arterial highways for ease of transportation.
3. The site should have approximately 150 acres available, it having been suggested by Mr. Darden that between 100 and 200 acres would be desirable.
4. The site should have access to sewer and water.
5. The site should have the best possible approaches and acceptable surroundings.
6. The site should be within the reasonable financial capacities of the four communities, bearing in mind that the ultimate value of capital improvements and convenience of the public would far offset original land costs.

With the above criteria in mind, the Board agreed that property close to the new circumferential highway between Annandale and Merrifield should have priority of treatment, primarily by reason of ease of access to the largest number of people within the whole district.

### Site 1, or the Brenizer Tract

This site, located on the north side of old Lee Highway, just beyond Merifield, is composed of two tracts, one of 99 acres and one of 44 acres. There are additional acres available. It is clear, meadow-type land, immediately usable for development. It is within a few hundred yards of the new circumferential highway, and just off Lee Highway upon which there is public transportation. Fairfax County has just authorized a trunk sewer line within a quarter of a mile of the property. It will be necessary, however, to have a pump station on the property to reach the sewer. Water is available. On two sides the property is bordered by undeveloped land, on the third side is a projected residential development. The fourth side, adjacent to Lee Highway, is presented zoned for business. On the southwest side of the property there is a strip 250 ft. wide by approximately 1100 ft. long now occupied by several houses, which should be ultimately included in the property in order to round out its bounds. There are two very large brick-cement barns on the property. They could be readily converted to temporary class-room space. This latter factor did not, however, have any bearing with the Control Board.

### Site 2, the Childs Tract

This tract of 150 acres more or less lies on the south of Route 50 and east of Gallows Road. It is directly adjacent to the new circumferential highway, and one corner of the property would be on the interchange. It is opposite the property recently acquired by the Fairfax Hospital, a $6,000,000 institution. Sewer and water are available, and there is public transportation on Route 50. None of the property adjacent thereto is developed, the Fairfax County Board has complete control of zoning. The land is wooded, largely with 30 to 40 year growth, mostly hardwoods. There are no buildings.

### Site 3, or the Ravensworth Tract

This property of 150 acres is part of the historic Ravensworth Farm. It is just south of Braddock Road and approximately one and a half miles south of Annandale. It is adjacent to the circumferential highway and an interchange is on one corner of the property. It is composed of two tracts under different ownership, both of which are syndicates. That portion proposed by the Board of Control does not have any buildings, but extends from the circumferential interchange to the Ft. Belvoir reservoir, which property is owned by the Federal government. The property has both sewer and water adjacent thereto, it is undeveloped on three sides. The fourth side is being developed into a community of small homes. Fairfax County has control of the zoning. Part of the property is clear and part is densely wooded. An area of approximately twenty-three acres is stream land and is only suitable for development as a park. The property is approximately three miles east of the much argued about proposed Burke Airport. Since none of the projected runways or flight patterns go over or near the property, it is the consensus of all real estate developers that neither this nor the adjacent property will be affected.

It should be pointed out as set forth in our letter of November 15th that the Board was not unanimous in the endorsement of this property, the vote being 7 to 1. The chairman of the board was instructed to advise the Board of Visitors of the University that, in its judgment, it is the least desirable of the three tracts for the reasons stated in our letter of November 15th.

I enclose marked maps which show as nearly as possible the locations of the three sites. Since all of these maps were loaned to the Board of Control and are not its property, we would appreciate it if they are returned as soon as they have fulfilled their purpose.

If I can supply further information, or conduct representatives of the Board of Visitors on a tour of the properties, I shall be most happy to do so.
