ATTACHMENT C RESOLUTION ON APPRECIATION OF SERVICE BY FOUR FORMER MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OF VISITORS Sponsored by Reps. DeNoia, Brown, and Gray April 19, 1994
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Whereas, the Student Council at the University of Virginia gratefully appreciates the service and dedication of Dr. Thomas Hulvey Leigh B. Middleditch Freddie W. Nicholas and S. Buford Scott during the years of their service to the Board of Visitors and the University of Virginia;

Whereas, Student Council as representatives of the student body and on behalf of the larger University community, recognizes the continued efforts of these former Board members to carry the torch for Mr. Jefferson's University;

Whereas, Student Council acknowledges that their accomplishments, achievements, and contributions indelibly shaped the University's future, and to that end, Student Council expresses its gratitude to these former members;

Whereas, Student Council acknowledges that Mr. Buford Scott's decision to place the interests of the University community as a whole above his personal willingness to serve embodies Mr. Jefferson's ideas of selflessness and self-governance. Let his actions be a beacon for future challenges that the University and University community face.

Be it therefore resolved, that these four individuals, Dr. Thomas Hulvey, Leigh Middleditch, Freddie Nicholas, and S. Buford Scott, be commended for their dedication and service.
