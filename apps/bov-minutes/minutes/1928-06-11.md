The annual meeting of the Rector and Visitors was held on this date at 10 o'clock A. M., lasting until 6 P. M., with intermission for lunch, followed by a session on the morning of the 12th which convened at 9:30 o'clock.

There were present Visitors Carson, Hull, McIntire, Munford, Rinehart, Scott and Williams, and the Rector C. Harding Walker, and President Alderman.

The minutes of the meeting of April 25th which had been copied and sent to the members for examination were approved.

The President announced the following gifts:

An appropriation from the International Education Board for the development of graduate instruction and research in chemical, physical, and biological sciences, over a period of not more than seven years, $175,000. On motion duly made and seconded the following resolution was unanimously adopted:

RESOLVED, That the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia officially sanction the request by the President of the University, made to the International Education Board for the appropriation of $175,000, for the development of graduate instruction and research in the chemical, physical, and biological sciences. It will be the purpose of the Rector and Visitors to undertake to do all in their power to carry out the tentative apportionment of the sums voted by the Board in accordance with the following plan:

At a meeting of the members of the Board of Trustees of the International Education Board held May 25, 1928, the officers presented your letter of February 2, 1928, in which, on behalf of the trustees of the University of Virginia, you request the Board's cooperation in strengthening and stimulating research in the physical and biological sciences. It was observed that in addition to sums now available, annual sums approximating $45,000 would be required eventually to carry out your program of development in chemistry, physics and biology, and that there was reasonable assurance that beginning with the fiscal year July 1, 1930, the authorities of the University would be in position to provide annually increasing sums for this purpose, so that within a period of from five to seven years the University would be able to assume the increased annual expenditure of $45,000.

I have the honor to inform you that the Board acted favorably on your request and authorized the executive officers, in their discretion, to commit the Board to an appropriation to the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia, of a sum not to exceed $175,000 for the development of graduate instruction and research in the physical and biological sciences in general conformity with the plan outlined above, the Board's appropriation to be available over a period of not more than seven years.

The amount to be made available each year is to be determined by the executive officers after conference with the University authorities. Below I give the tentative apportionment of the sums voted by the Board:

I should like to be informed if the request to the International Education Board for this assistance has been officially sanctioned by the trustees of the University. Upon receiving word to this effect, the officers are prepared to make available the sum required for 1928-1929.

Contributions to Institute of Public Affairs $6,625 and pledges $3,510.

On motion, it was resolved that the President be, and is, hereby authorized to accept the foregoing gifts and to express to the several donors the thanks and appreciation of the Rector and Visitors.

The resignation of Professor James R. McKeldin, Assistant Professor of Philosophy was presented and accepted in the following resolution:

RESOLVED, That the Rector and Visitors of the University accept the resignation of Professor James R. McKeldin, Assistant Professor of Philosophy. Professor McKeldin has carried forward his work with ability and energy, and the Rector and Visitors wish him continued success in his new field.

Upon the recommendation of the President the following were elected to the faculty:

Dr. Edwin P. Lehman, Professor of Surgery and Gynecology, at a salary of $10,000, incumbency to begin with the session 1928-29.

Dr. Sidney Wm. Britton, Professor of Physiology, at a salary of $4,500, incumbency to begin with the session 1928-29.

Miss Adelaide A. Mayo, Assistant Professor of Nursing Education, at a salary of $2,500, on a nine month's basis, incumbency to begin with the session of 1928-29. Miss Mayo's salary is to be paid out of money accumulated to the fund for the Chair of Nursing.

Mr. Alexander H. Bass, Acting Assistant Professor of Mechanical Engineering, at a salary of $2,000, incumbency to begin with the session 1928-29.

Mr. Archibald Bolling Shepperson, Acting Assistant Professor of English, at a salary of $2,000, for the session 1928-29.

Dr. W. H. Stouffer, Associate Research Professor of Rural Social Economics, for a period of one year, beginning September 1, 1928, at a salary of $3,000.

Dr. Isaac T. Musser, Research Associate in Finance for a period of two years, beginning June 15, 1928, at a salary of $3,000 per year.

In order that vacancies in the faculty be filled during the summer, the following resolution was unanimously adopted:

RESOLVED, By the Rector and Visitors, that the President of the University, in consultation with the Deane and Committees appointed by the President from the staff, be empowered during the summer to employ those professors who have been authorized by the Board, but who have not yet been selected. It is understood that all actions of the President and Committees will be brought to the Board for ratification at its next meeting.

Upon the recommendation of the President the following promotions were made in the faculty:

Charles N. Hulvey, M.S., LL.B., Assistant Professor to Associate Professor of Commercial Law. His salary remains unchanged, $3,050, but he is to be relieved of the correction of papers in the Law School, which means an addition to the College Budget of $1200.

Alexander Vyssotsky, Ph.D., Instructor to Assistant Professor of Astronomy, at a salary of $2,500.

Piet Van de Kamp, Ph.D., Instructor to Assistant Professor of Astronomy, at a salary of $2,500.

The following special appropriations were authorized:

An Appropriation from the Money of the International Education Board for Research in the Natural Sciences 1928-29

The Budget for the Institute of Public Affairs as follows was adopted:

A resolution from the Professorial staff concerning an increase in the salary schedule was presented, and on motion, the Committee consisting of Messrs. Hull, Buchanan, and Carson was appointed to study the whole question of the salary scale and report to the Rector and Visitors at as early a meeting as it is practicable.

The New Buildings Committee submitted the following report:

The New Buildings Committee met on this date at the Colonnade Club at 3 o'clock with Messrs. Rinehart, Scott, McIntire, Hull, and Williams present. There were also present Mrs. Munford and Judge Carson, and President Alderman.

The Architects presented preliminary plans for the proposed dormitories and academic building, which were examined and discussed, after which the whole group visited the proposed sites for the respective buildings.

The Committee then held a meeting for further consideration of the plans and locations, when the following action was taken:

RESOLVED, That the locations selected for the proposed dormitories on the western slope of Monroe Hill and for the academic building on the site of the Mallet House, be and are hereby approved, subject to minor changes in location.

RESOLVED, That the plans for the dormitories be approved in general, and the architects are requested to submit final plans after a further detailed study, to the Committee, for approval and adoption.

RESOLVED, That the preliminary plans for the academic building be approved in general, with the understanding that a further study be made of the needs for offices and lecture rooms, submitting final plans to the Committee for approval and adoption.

On the foregoing report the following action was taken:

RESOLVED, That as soon as the final plan for the new dormitories and academic building are received and approved by the New Buildings Committee, they are hereby authorized to secure bids for the erection of the same and if they be within the sum appropriated for the respective buildings, they be empowered to let the contracts therefor and proceed with their erection.

With respect to building sites heretofore allocated to fraternities on which to erect chapter houses, which sites have now been taken up in the proposed locations for the new dormitories, the following motion duly made and seconded was adopted:

Whereas, This Board had allocated certain parcels of land for erection of fraternity buildings, located on the Towles and Barracks Roads on the northwest side of the Monroe Hill, and

Whereas the locations for the proposed dormitories will take up the sites for the fraternity houses, therefore be it

Resolved, That the said sites be withdrawn and that the Buildings & Grounds Committee be requested to investigate other suitable sites for fraternity houses and report to this Board for action.

In the matter of creating the office of Business Manager of the University and the filling of the position, the President presented the following

After mature reflection upon the proposal to create the office of Business Manager of the University of Virginia, I have formed the judgment that, at least for the immediate future, it is the part of wisdom to vest the duties of this officer in the person of the Assistant to the President.

There are many reasons in support of this judgment, which I will give if called upon, but I think it particularly important in view of the fact that time is essential in order to more clearly and accurately define the duties of this proposed new officer.

The Assistant to the President would assume responsibility under the President for the supervision of the Superintendent of Buildings and Grounds, the Superintendent of the Hospital, the Superintendent of the Cafeteria, and such other managerial duties as the President or the Rector and Visitors may from time to time delegate to him.

I beg to recommend for the consideration and the action of the Rector and Visitors the following resolutions:

Resolved first, that J. L. Newcomb, Assistant to the President be and is hereby directed to assume on July 1, 1928, the managerial duties outlined above.

Resolved second, that he he and is hereby directed to employ a Superintendent of Buildings and Grounds as a successor to Dr. W. A. Lambeth, at a salary not in excess of $4,000 per annum.

Resolved third, that on account of these added duties his salary as Assistant to the President be increased from $1500 to $3000 per annum.

Resolved, fourth, that the Assistant to the President he, and he is hereby directed, to make a report to the President for transmittal to the Rector and Visitors of his managerial duties after one year of service. In the report he should make recommendations concerning a more accurate definition of the duties of a business manager.

Mr. Scott, Chairman of the Finance Committee, presented a report as of May 25, 1928, which was received and ordered read.

The largest single maturing investment included above, was an item of $103,600 School & College 6% Certificates which were called for payment by the State of Virginia at par on January 1, 1928. $100,000 of these were held in the Corcoran Fund. To replace this large investment at a time when high grade bonds were selling at prices which returned lower yields than for many years past, of course, worked a hardship upon the University. It was necessary to accept a lower return in order to obtain anywhere nearly commensurate safety.

Investments sold and matured during the year netted us a profit of $2,886.83 over their book value to us. Of this amount the largest item $1,656.45 was a profit on the sale of 12 shares of Stock of the Rossia Insurance Company. Ten shares of thos stock was taken over by us from the estate of Arthur W. Austin at the then market price and the remaining two shares we subscribed to under rights issued to us as holders of the above ten shares.

We have received during the year in securities the following additional donations and bequests:

Total endowment funds under our direction in the various funds at their book value (i.e. cost to us or market price at the time they were given to the University) are $2,108,000. These holding have a present market value of $2,392,000. or $284,000 greater than their cost.

The funds are invested as follows:

The current income is $117,412.50 which is a return of 5.6% on the cost price or $4.90% on the market value of the endowment.

We have been most fortunate in recent years in receiving several large bequests in the form of excellent investment stocks. While we would not have felt justified in buying this class of security for the funds, it has seemed wise to hold the stocks thus given us and we have been rewarded by material advances in the value of many of them. The University has thus been able to participate in the fruits of the country's industrial prosperity.

Tunstall, Treasurer of the Alumni Board of Trustees of the University of Virginia Endowment Fund, communicated to the Board the following resolutions, adopted by his Board at a meeting held April 24, 1928, to be considered by the Rector and Visitors.

The President stated that for a number of years he had been interested in having established here a plan for old age annuities for professors, instructors and administrative officers, but not until this year had he been able to find the necessary funds with which to carry out the plan. Funds now being in hand for the purpose, he presented the following resolution, which, on motion, was unanimously adopted:

A RESOLUTION PROVIDING FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT IN THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA OF A PLAN FOR OLD AGE ANNUITIES FOR PROFESSORS, INSTRUCTORS AND ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICERS WHO HAVE ENTERED THE SERVICE OF THE UNIVERSITY SINCE NOVEMBER 17, 1915.

RESOLVED, That the following plan for the establishment of old age annuities for the professors, instructors and administrative officers of equivalent rank, devoting their entire time to the service of the University of Virginia, who have entered its service since November 17, 1915, be and is hereby adopted:

1\. Any professor, instructor, or administrative officer of equivalent rank in this University, devoting his entire time to the service of the University in such position, may become entitled to the benefits of the annuities hereby established, by agreeing to contribute annually, in monthly installments five per cent of his salary toward an old age annuity.

2\. The University will contribute annually in monthly installments, during the period of employment, an amount equal to five per cent of the annual salary of each member making contributions as provided in Section 1.

3\. The deferred Annuity Policy, Teachers Retirement Plan, of the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America, is made the basis of the annuity plan of the University. The contract provides, ordinarily, for a monthly deferred annuity to begin at the age of sixty-five, the amount of the annuity being determined, in accordance with the policy, by the amount and number of the contributions paid. The contract provides also alternate methods of settlement, with the effect that the member controls the date at which the annuity may begin and may, at the time of retirement, choose that form of annuity best adapted to his needs. The various forms of annuity available to a member at retirement, either upon the life of the member or upon the joint lives of himself and wife, or with a possible return to his estate, are fully stated in the policy.

4\. Should the holder of such a contract die before payment of the annuity has begun, an amount equal to all contributions on his policy paid by himself and by the University, with compound interest at three and one-half per cent, and any additional interest that may be voted by the Trustees of the Association, will be paid to his wife, or other designated beneficiary, or to his estate, in one hundred and twenty equal monthly installments. Should the annuitant so request, this amount may be paid in a single payment. Should his wife or other beneficiary of the immediate family so request, it will be paid in the form of an annuity covering her life. A member leaving the service of the University to go to a university, college, or other institution devoted primarily to education or research may continue his annuity accumulation upon such terms of joint contribution as he may arrange with that college or university, or continue his contributions independently, or allow the contributions already made to accumulate without further contribution, or he may begin the receipt of his annuity at once. Should he withdraw altogether from the work of teaching or research, he will remain the owner of his policy; he will be entitled to the full benefit purchased by the contributions already made, and, if he so desires, he will have the privilege himself to continue the accumulation by the payment of premiums at the rate stated in the policy, but without reduction on account of a preferred occupation. Or he may allow the accumulation to continue without the payment of further premiums, or he may begin the receipt of his annuity at once.

5\. The amount contributed by each member shall be deducted monthly from the salary of such member, and, together with the monthly contribution of the University on his or her account, shall be paid direct to the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association.

6\. Any member desiring to make contributions in excess of five per cent of his salary has opportunity to do so in accordance with the terms of the deferred annuity contract. Such contributions in excess of five per cent will not be duplicated by the University.

7\. The University will assist those of its members who desire to secure the convenient privileges of monthly payments of premiums on individual annuity contracts or on life insurance contracts by arranging for the automatic deduction of their premiums from salary and their payment direct to the Association.

8\. The University reserves the right to modify, amend, or repeal this plan as experience may prove desirable. Any such changes, however, shall not affect any benefits acquired prior to the adoption of these changes, except upon specific agreement between the members concerned and the University.

The President presented certain resolutions of the Virginia League of Woman concerning the establishment at the University of a co-ordinate college for women, and the construction of a dormitory for women. After some discussion of the matter it was the sense of the Board that there was not sufficient time at this meeting for an adequate discussion of the matters, whereupon, on motion, the question was deferred to the next meeting of the Board.

The following resolution presented by Mr. Scott, Chairman of the Finance Committee, was unanimously adopted:

RESOLVED, That the Rector be and is hereby authorized, on behalf of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, to sign certificate for stock subscription right of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company for sixty-six and two-thirds shares, either for sale or for subscription, as may be determined by the Chairman of the Finance Committee.

The following resolution entering into a lease to the Peoples National Bank for the rental of a room in the Entrance Building was adopted

RESOLVED, That the Rector be and is hereby authorized to execute, on behalf of this Board, a lease with the Peoples National Bank of Charlottesville, Va., for the rental of the entire room and basement thereof instead of for a portion of the banking room only as now occupied, in the Entrance Building. Said lease to be made at a monthly rental of $125.00, to be dated when the room is ready for occupancy, and to expire March 1, 1933, without the privilege of any renewal.

Application of the Alpha Tau Omega Fraternity for a building site was referred to the Buildings and Grounds Committee of the Board for action and report back to the Board.

A special committee consisting of Messrs Williams, Rinehart and Scott was appointed to confer with the Committee of the Faculty to consider the question of establishing a broadcasting station at the University.

The following instructors, assistants, scholarship and fellowship holders were appointed for the session 1928-29:

On motion the meeting then adjourned.

At a meeting of the members of the Board of Trustees of the International Education Board held May 25, 1928, the officers presented your letter of February 2, 1928, in which, on behalf of the trustees of the University of Virginia, you request the Board's cooperation in strengthening and stimulating research in the physical and biological sciences. It was observed that in addition to sums now available, annual sums approximating $45,000 would be required eventually to carry out your program of development in chemistry, physics and biology, and that there was reasonable assurance that beginning with the fiscal year July 1, 1930, the authorities of the University would be in position to provide annually increasing sums for this purpose, so that within a period of from five to seven years the University would be able to assume the increased annual expenditure of $45,000.

I have the honor to inform you that the Board acted favorably on your request and authorized the executive officers, in their discretion, to commit the Board to an appropriation to the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia, of a sum not to exceed $175,000 for the development of graduate instruction and research in the physical and biological sciences in general conformity with the plan outlined above, the Board's appropriation to be available over a period of not more than seven years.

The amount to be made available each year is to be determined by the executive officers after conference with the University authorities. Below I give the tentative apportionment of the sums voted by the Board:

I should like to be informed if the request to the International Education Board for this assistance has been officially sanctioned by the trustees of the University. Upon receiving word to this effect, the officers are prepared to make available the sum required for 1928-1929.

RESOLVED, That the locations selected for the proposed dormitories on the western slope of Monroe Hill and for the academic building on the site of the Mallet House, be and are hereby approved, subject to minor changes in location.

RESOLVED, That the plans for the dormitories be approved in general, and the architects are requested to submit final plans after a further detailed study, to the Committee, for approval and adoption.

RESOLVED, That the preliminary plans for the academic building be approved in general, with the understanding that a further study be made of the needs for offices and lecture rooms, submitting final plans to the Committee for approval and adoption.
