**Leadership Discussion**

**Free Speech Principles**

President Ryan began by reporting the success of 2021 Final Exercises amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, with the Class of 2020 and 2021 able to hold in-person final exercises that included a procession from the Rotunda to Scott Stadium at the Carl Smith Center. The ceremonies, seven of them in total, included both in person and virtual speeches and performances. Professor Melody Barnes was the keynote speaker for the 2020 ceremonies, and alumnus Alexis Ohanian was the keynote for 2021. He then moved to free speech issues at the University, and how a diverse committee was formed in January 2021 that included University leaders, students, and professors - to ensure that the expression of different viewpoints remains integral to the UVA learning experience. The committee developed a statement favoring open expression of all viewpoints in every aspect of university life which was endorsed unanimously. The Board voted to affirm the statement.

On motion, duly seconded, the following resolution was approved by the Board. The full Statement of the Committee on Free Expression and Free Inquiry follows the resolution.

**ENDORSEMENT OF STATEMENT OF THE COMMITTEE ON FREE EXPRESSION AND FREE INQUIRY**

WHEREAS, in February 2021 President Ryan and Provost Magill formed a committee charged with articulating the University’s commitment to free expression and free inquiry and the role these play in the academic enterprise, that expresses the University’s values, its history, and its legal obligations; and

WHEREAS, the composition of the Committee on Free Expression and Free Inquiry (the Committee) includes individuals with widely divergent viewpoints and experiences; and

WHEREAS, following several listening sessions engaging members of the University and Charlottesville communities, the Committee developed the attached statement, which is endorsed by all of the members of the Committee and President Ryan and Provost Magill; and

WHEREAS, the Statement of the Committee on Free Expression and Free Inquiry (the Statement) notes that Thomas Jefferson’s “vision for the University included the aspiration that ‘here we are not afraid to follow truth wherever it may lead, nor to tolerate any error so long as reason is left free to combat it’”; and

WHEREAS, the Committee also notes that as a public university, the University is bound by the Constitution, including the First Amendment; and

WHEREAS, the Committee’s statement includes a recognition that the University may regulate the time, place and manner of expression “for reasons unrelated to its content, including maintaining the normal operations of the University” and that “\[f\]ree expression also does not protect speech that violates the law;” and

WHEREAS, the Statement sets forth the University’s position on free expression and free inquiry and suggests how we might act in accordance with our aspirations, as follows:

The University of Virginia unequivocally affirms its commitment to free expression and free inquiry. All views, beliefs, and perspectives deserve to be articulated and heard free from interference. This commitment underpins every part of the university’s mission. Free and open inquiry is the basis for the scientific method and all other modes of investigation that produce, expand, and refine knowledge. It is at the heart of the principles of academic freedom that protect faculty from interference with their research and their views. Likewise, the educational endeavor for students requires freedom to speak, write, inquire, listen, challenge, and learn, including through exposure to a range of ideas and cultivation of the tools of critical thinking and engagement. These tools are vital not only to students’ personal intellectual development but also to their futures as citizen leaders equipped to assess contending arguments and to contribute to societal progress. For all of these reasons, expression of ideas should be given the widest possible latitude…

Free and open inquiry inevitably involves conflicting views and strong disagreements. Indeed, some ideas may be offensive, noxious, and even harmful. We act as responsible members of a shared community when we engage as empathetic speakers and generous listeners. We further our common project of academic inquiry with mutual respect and intellectual openness. Even as the University affirms values of mutual respect, however, both the First Amendment and principles of free inquiry forbid these values from becoming a basis for closing off discussion. The University must not stifle protected expression, permit others to obstruct or shut down such expression, or regulate the tone or content of responses that stop short of interfering with others’ speech or violating the law. Rather than seek to control speech or countenance its silencing, the University must promote values of mutual respect, while emphasizing that their vitality rests with the self-governance of speakers and listeners.

RESOLVED, the Board of Visitors unequivocally endorses the Statement of the Committee on Free Expression and Free Inquiry; and

RESOLVED FURTHER, the Board thanks the members of the Committee for their impressive efforts in gathering input and crafting an eloquent and concise statement.

**Statement of the Committee on Free Expression and Free Inquiry**

The University of Virginia unequivocally affirms its commitment to free expression and free inquiry. All views, beliefs, and perspectives deserve to be articulated and heard free from interference. This commitment underpins every part of the university’s mission. Free and open inquiry is the basis for the scientific method and all other modes of investigation that produce, expand, and refine knowledge. It is at the heart of the principles of academic freedom that protect faculty from interference with their research and their views. Likewise, the educational endeavor for students requires freedom to speak, write, inquire, listen, challenge, and learn, including through exposure to a range of ideas and cultivation of the tools of critical thinking and engagement. These tools are vital not only to students’ personal intellectual development but also to their futures as citizen leaders equipped to assess contending arguments and to contribute to societal progress. For all of these reasons, expression of ideas should be given the widest possible latitude.

We endorse principles of free expression and free inquiry not because every idea is equally good. To the contrary, universities test and assess ideas every day, through myriad processes of research and inquiry. These processes identify errors and generate breakthroughs of immense value for local, national, and global communities. Indeed, the University has endeavored to acknowledge its own complex legacy while promoting the free exchange of ideas that creates future advances and progress. Academic commitment to free inquiry reflects the view that every idea must be heard so that it may be subjected to the rigorous scrutiny necessary to advance knowledge. This process requires deep critical engagement, as well as humility in the recognition that many commonly accepted views have proved mistaken, while many ostracized views have illuminated the path toward truth.

The University of Virginia has a unique connection to principles of free expression and inquiry. James Madison introduced the Bill of Rights, including what is now the First Amendment, as a member of Congress representing the district that would become home to the University. James Madison and Thomas Jefferson’s Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions were among the earliest extended interpretations of the First Amendment, which, as the Supreme Court observed years later, “carried the day in the court of history” and “first crystallized a national awareness of the central meaning of the First Amendment.”**[\[1\]](#footnote-1)** Jefferson’s vision for the University included the aspiration that “here we are not afraid to follow truth wherever it may lead, nor to tolerate any error so long as reason is left free to combat it.”**[\[2\]](#footnote-2)**

At the same time, the University has not always fulfilled its aspirations, exploiting enslaved laborers and excluding Black Americans, women, and groups and viewpoints disfavored by the majority. Principles of academic freedom have not always withstood the pressures and fashions of the day, which remains an ongoing challenge. But freedom of speech is among the most powerful tools by which wrongs are righted and institutions are improved or abolished. Principles of free inquiry extend to robust discussion and critical examination of the past. Equally importantly, they live in the present and extend to the future, in a shared commitment to free expression for all speakers and all views.

The University’s commitment to free expression and free inquiry arises not only from its role as an academic institution but also from its status as a public university. State institutions are bound by the Constitution, including the First Amendment. As Justice Thurgood Marshall wrote for the Supreme Court, “To permit the continued building of our politics and culture, and to assure self-fulfillment for each individual, our people are guaranteed the right to express any thought, free from government censorship.”**[\[3\]](#footnote-3)** Actions by the University implicate not only academic values but also this legal principle and the ideals behind it.

Under American law, principles of free expression have important limits. The University may regulate the time, place, and manner of expression for reasons unrelated to its content, including maintaining the normal operations of the University. Free expression also does not protect speech that violates the law, including legally defined categories of incitement, defamation, threats, privacy violation, and intellectual property infringement. In addition, various types of prohibited conduct can be partially or entirely composed of speech, including stalking, harassment, and unlawful discrimination. These exceptions are defined by law and represent narrow and necessary limits to an otherwise expansive commitment.

Free and open inquiry inevitably involves conflicting views and strong disagreements. Indeed, some ideas may be offensive, noxious, and even harmful. We act as responsible members of a shared community when we engage as empathetic speakers and generous listeners. We further our common project of academic inquiry with mutual respect and intellectual openness. Even as the University affirms values of mutual respect, however, both the First Amendment and principles of free inquiry forbid these values from becoming a basis for closing off discussion. The University must not stifle protected expression, permit others to obstruct or shut down such expression, or regulate the tone or content of responses that stop short of interfering with others’ speech or violating the law. Rather than seek to control speech or countenance its silencing, the University must promote values of mutual respect, while emphasizing that their vitality rests with the self-governance of speakers and listeners.

The University’s commitment to free expression and free inquiry represents a living ideal, reflected in policy and embodied in the actions of community members every day. We rearticulate and reaffirm it here, as a foundation for the University’s third century and beyond.

**Strategic Plan Progress**

President Ryan reviewed the progress of the 2030 Strategic Plan. The strategic plan has 4 goals: strengthen UVA’s foundation, cultivate the most vibrant community in higher education, enable discoveries that enrich and improve lives, and make UVA synonymous with service. The 10 key initiatives are dynamic ways in which these goals can be met, and Mr. Ryan demonstrated the website dashboard’s status tracker of each initiative, along with a new Timeline tool.

He stated that expanding Second Year housing is in the exploration stage, establishing the Data Science school is in the intermediate stage, and creating a new community engagement office is in the complete stage. He also listed several accomplishments regarding the Plan: approved designs for buildings at Emmet-Ivy; established new community partnerships and scholarships; met community healthcare needs during the pandemic; and began paying a Living Wage to all employees. Funding for the 2030 Strategic Plan comes from the strategic investment fund, philanthropy, and matching funds.

**Thomas Jefferson Awards**

The Thomas Jefferson Awards were conferred by President Ryan and Provost Magill. Because they were not awarded in 2020, they conferred four awards this year, two for scholarship and two for service. These prestigious awards are given to members of the University community who exemplify in character, work, and influence the principles and ideals of Thomas Jefferson and thus advance the objectives for which he founded the University.

Provost Magill presented the awards for scholarship to Willam A. Petri, M.D. and Professor Dennis R. Proffitt. Dr. Petri is a leading expert on GI illnesses and infections. He has been at UVA for over 40 years. During the pandemic, he played a role in vaccine development, educated the public, mentored students and physicians, and much more. Dr. Petri said a few words of thanks and remarked that although Jefferson failed both personally and politically by not abolishing slavery, the words he wrote in the Declaration of Independence defined democracy and are still creating a positive stress between what the country was defined as and what it is today.

Dennis Proffitt, Commonwealth Professor of Psychology emeritus. His research has been around how a person’s physical state influences the person’s perceptions of the world, and how the way a person perceives the world translates into action. He has had a 40-year career at UVA. He is one of the most cited individuals in the field of cognitive psychology. He is a popular teacher and mentor. His scholarship has shaped the study of psychology. Professor Proffitt gave brief remarks thanking the Department of Psychology, his students, his wife an evolutionary biologist, and the University. He said undergraduates at UVA “are like nowhere else.”

President Ryan presented the awards recognizing excellence in service to Senior Vice President for Operations and State Governmental Relations Colette Sheehy, and former dean of the McIntire School of Commerce Carl Zeithaml. He said Ms. Sheehy was one of the two first female vice presidents at UVA. She began work at UVA in 1982 and has worked her way through the budget and finance areas. Ms. Sheehy is well respected in state government as well. Ms. Sheehy spoke briefly and thanked those who made her career possible, particularly former Executive Vice President Leonard Sandridge.

Dean Zeithaml was honored by President Ryan, who said his 23-year leadership of the McIntire School profoundly transformed the school. Dean Zeithaml thanked the Alumni Board of Trustees for their support of the award, and he said he had the pleasure of spending one third of his life working and living at the University. He said his accomplishments were made possible by his “two families”—McIntire and his wife, Charlotte, and their children.

**Remarks/Reports**

**Remarks by the Rector**

Rector Murray said UVA is coming out of a very difficult time and did it successfully. He thanked the Board and leadership. He asked for a round of applause for leadership.

The Rector recognized the lifetime achievement award given to Dr. Britt from the American College of Surgeons, and said the Board is proud to claim Dr. Britt as a member. He highlighted accomplishments at UVA including funding the Institute of Democracy, which should prove to be one of UVA’s signature achievements of the next decade; the importance of the statement from the Committee on Free Expression and Free Inquiry; and the Democracy Dialogues, which are a laudable first step to re-establishing a culture of open-mindedness.

The Rector said the decision to repatriate sacred objects from the Kluge/Ruhe aboriginal art collection is important to note. He also remarked on progress on initiatives in northern Virginia; the phenomenal performance of the University of Virginia Investment Management Company (UVIMCO), which enables the bond offering without risking the triple A bond rating; the creation of a data dashboard; the affordable housing initiative moving forward with requests for proposals going out this fall; athletics successes this year amid the pandemic, including national championships; and a planned debt sale that should position the University well for many years.

**Remarks by the Student Representative**

Ms. Mehta spoke primarily about student advising. She said that student advising should be a priority at the University. Currently, advisors and students in the College of Arts & Sciences are matched through decisions such as COLA enrollment, which results in a lack of uniform support for tailored career advising. Additionally, many students and advisors only interact semesterly, which will pose greater problems post-pandemic, as students have larger gaps in academic preparedness and knowledge of opportunities for involvement on-Grounds.

She stated that essential skills with which UVA students should graduate include navigating the increasingly competitive job market, interviewing well, and experiencing intellectual growth, all of which can be strengthened through restructuring advising. She emphasized that UVA has a wealth of resources for mentorship and career advising, so these tools should be used cohesively with official academic advising.

**Remarks by the Faculty Senate Chair**

Mr. Hockensmith outlined the structural changes, accomplishments, and dynamics of the Faculty Senate for the past year. The Faculty Senate structural changes, partially driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, were the following: new inclusion of procedural guidelines (quorum, parliamentarian, etc.); electronic voting; and streamlined deliberative processes, all helping with better communication and representation. Regarding this year’s Faculty Senate accomplishments, there were a number of resolutions regarding racial equity; the creation of a Handbook of the Faculty Senate in order to write and record policies; and Open Access Guidelines to assure equitable distribution of advanced knowledge by the University. Lastly, Mr. Hockensmith remarked that there was greater consensus among senators this year than in the past, with 85% of members supporting COVID vaccination requirements for students, and other voting items receiving large majorities.

**20\. REPLACEMENT OF HUME MEMORIAL WALL INSCRIPTION**

(approved by the Buildings and Grounds Committee on June 4, 2021)

WHEREAS, at the September 2020 meeting of the Board of Visitors, the Board formally requested that the University Committee on Names undertake to determine if rededication of the Hume Memorial Wall (also known as the “Whispering Wall”) is appropriate and feasible, or if the memorial should be removed, and make a final recommendation to the Board at a future meeting; and

WHEREAS, in 2021 the University Committee on Names was discontinued and President Ryan charged a newly constituted Naming and Memorials Committee with researching the matter and making a recommendation to the President and Board about the future disposition of the Hume Memorial; and

WHEREAS, the Naming and Memorials Committee completed their work on the future of the Hume Memorial and submitted a memo (Attachment A) to President Ryan in May 2021, concluding that “\[I\]t is not appropriate to continue to honor Frank Hume. A name adorning a monument on Grounds should be an emblem of our values. Those whom we choose to honor must reflect what we believe in and who we as a community aspire to be. Recognizing that the inscription on the Whispering Wall is commonly read as a “symbol of support for slavery and inequality” (BoV 09 20 Meeting Minutes, p. 11498) the Committee—following an interval of study, consultation, community comment, and reflection—respectfully recommends the wholesale replacement of any and all inscription-bearing blocks in the Whispering Wall with blank blocks of a suitable material, thereby removing the name and memorialization that they have carried;” and

WHEREAS, the Naming and Memorials Committee also noted that Frank Hume did not have a direct tie with the University; rather, his two sons, who were alumni, funded the construction of the Hume Memorial; and

WHEREAS, in recent years the University has removed or renamed a number of symbols of unequal treatment of racial minorities on Grounds, including changing the names of several buildings, removing the Confederate War Memorial plaques from the Rotunda, constructing the Memorial to Enslaved Laborers, and naming a residence hall for a formerly enslaved couple who lived and worked at the University;

RESOLVED, the Board of Visitors requests that the University, following receipt of all necessary approvals, remove the inscription on the Hume Memorial, hereinafter to be known as the “Whispering Wall”, replace the blocks containing the inscription with blocks of a contrasting color to mark the change, and include the story of the Hume Memorial as part of the digital contextualization of statues and memorials on Grounds; and

RESOLVED FURTHER, the design, color, and placement of new material on the Whispering Wall shall be decided collaboratively among the University Architect, the chair of the Buildings and Grounds Committee, and the chair of the Naming and Memorials Committee.

**Attachment A**

**_Naming and Memorials Committee Recommendation on the Frank Hume Memorial_**

Charged by the Board of Visitors to make a recommendation about the future disposition of the Hume Memorial, the Naming and Memorials Committee respectfully submits the following proposal to President Ryan and the Board.[\[5\]](#footnote-5)

**Mr. Frank Hume:** Born in Culpeper (1843), Frank Hume was raised in Alexandria and Washington, DC. As the Civil War was starting, the eighteen-year-old Hume joined the Volunteer Southrons, remaining in the Confederate Army until the conclusion of the war. Hume was subsequently a successful businessman and was twice elected to the Virginia House of Delegates. He also served as a supervisor for the County of Alexandria and as a member of the Washington Board of Trade. Known in northern Virginia for his civic engagement and philanthropy, he donated land to build a school and playground in Arlington. The Hume School was closed in 1958; the building currently houses the Arlington Historical Museum.

Mr. Hume has no discernable connection to the University of Virginia other than the fact that, some twenty years after his death, his alumni sons John Edmund Norris Hume and Howard Hume donated funds to the University to erect a bench with a curved wall and fountain honoring their father. Because more than 75 years have passed since a structure was named for him as a consequence of philanthropy, it is in keeping with established UVA naming protocols to review the status of that naming and how it accords with the University’s values today.

**The Hume Memorial:** Following approval of the gift by the Board of Visitors, Edmund S. Campbell, UVA Dean of Art and Architecture, created the design for the fountain and bench and in 1937 commissioned the Vermont Marble company to execute it. The structure was originally sited in the north portico of Monroe Hall. In 1988, when Monroe Hall was enlarged, the structure was disassembled and crated for storage. Several years later, the fountain and bench with its whispering wall became the focal point of the Monroe Newcomb Plaza. That site has long been a place of student activity (e.g., “tabling” by student groups and informal socializing).

**The Committee’s Recommendation:** The Naming and Memorials Committee fully agrees with the Board of Visitors that it is not appropriate to continue to honor Frank Hume. A name adorning a monument on Grounds should be an emblem of our values. Those whom we choose to honor must reflect what we believe in and who we as a community aspire to be. Recognizing that the inscription on the Whispering Wall is commonly read as “a symbol of support for slavery and inequality” (BoV 09 20 Meeting Minutes, p.11498), the Committee—following an interval of study, consultation, community comment, and reflection—respectfully recommends the wholesale replacement of any and all inscription-bearing blocks in the Whispering Wall with blank blocks of a suitable material, thereby removing the name and memorialization that they have carried.[\[6\]](#footnote-6)

In making this recommendation, however, we in no way wish wholly to erase the history of the University’s original decision and its subsequent tacit ratification over a span of many years. In removing the inscription, we concomitantly affirm our commitment not to silence the history of UVA decision making that led to the creation and perpetuation of a memorial to Frank Hume.

Accordingly, the Committee further recommends that replacement blocks of a contrasting color be used to mark the permanent change that has been made to this structure. (At the request of the Committee, a rendering of this design is to be supplied to the Board through the Office of the University Architect.) The University should not remove the inscription on the Whispering Wall without materially signaling to future generations our need as a community to reassess our understandings and to express our values as we work for a more just and equitable society.[\[7\]](#footnote-7) We must continue to interrogate and grapple with our past for the sake of a better future. 

In addition, we encourage the nascent Digital Contextualization Working Group to tell the story of what was once the Hume Memorial in such a way that members of the UVA community and visitors to Grounds can learn about and, crucially, learn from the history of this structure and the catena of decisions that that led to the memorialization of Frank Hume at our University over the course of more than eight decades.

It is our hope that the newly configured and repurposed fountain and bench, with its whispering wall stripped of all memorializing inscription, together with the landscaped plaza and surrounding environment on which it stands, will be a place that fosters authentic community, promotes nuanced and complex historical understandings, and occasions debate. It is our hope that this important site will stimulate critical thinking about the value-laden pedagogical power of what and how we remember—and why that matters for our aspirations as a university community committed to fostering the common good.

Our aim, then, in making this recommendation to President Ryan and the Board is neither to erase history nor to change it, but to enliven present and future generations—whose lives, like ours, are invested in our ambitious educational enterprise—to the circumstances under which a significant feature of the built environment on our Grounds was created and named. We seek to inculcate a deeper understanding of why history matters to our University culture and to the values we publicly espouse.

Financials: Estimates from the Office of the University Architect suggest the total cost of removing the blocks above the bench and replacing them in contrasting stone would be approximately $430,000. (The estimate for removal of the monument and requisite modifications to the plaza on which it had stood is a figure between $1,500,000 and $2,000,000.) We are grateful to Alice Raucher and her team for providing this information.
===============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Sequelae: The Virginia Art and Architecture Review Board (AARB) would necessarily review any BoV resolution to alter the Hume Memorial because it stands on property owned by the Commonwealth of Virginia. (We should also note that the proposed modification of the memorial would not require excavation; accordingly, archaeologists would not be consulted.)
==================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Were our recommendation accepted, all future University publications, whether printed or electronic, should henceforth refer to the site as the Whispering Wall. The name “Hume Memorial” should no longer to be used.

**UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA INTERNAL AUDIT CHARTER - CHANGES**

**Purpose:**

Internal Auditing is an independent, objective assurance and consulting activity designed to add value and improve an organization’s operations. It helps an organization accomplish its objectives by bringing a systematic, disciplined approach to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of risk management, control, and governance processes. The UVA Office of Audit and Compliance assists UVA’s Board of Visitors and University management in the discharge of their oversight, management, and operating responsibilities by providing independent assurance and consulting services to the University community. Our services add value by improving the control, risk management and governance processes to help the University achieve its business objectives.

**Internal Auditing Policy:**

It is the policy of the of the University to establish and support the Office of Audit and Compliance to assist the University in accomplishing its objectives by bringing a systematic and disciplined approach to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of the University’s governance, risk management, and internal controls. The internal audit activity’s responsibilities are defined by the Audit, Compliance, and Risk Committee (ACR Committee) of the Board of Visitors (Board) as part of its oversight role.

**Authority:**

The internal auditor, with strict accountability for confidentiality and safeguarding records and information, is authorized to have full, free, and unrestricted access to any and all of the University’s records, physical properties, and personnel pertinent to carrying out an engagement.

All employees are requested to assist the Audit Department in fulfilling its roles and responsibilities. The internal audit activity will also have free and unrestricted access to the ACR Committee and its chairman.

**Organization:**

The Chief Audit Executive will report on behalf of the internal audit activity (functionally) to the ACR Committee chairman, and administratively (day to day operations) to the President Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of the University.

The ACR Committee will:

*   Periodically review and approve changes to the Audit Department charter.
*   Approve the risk-based audit plan.
*   Approve the internal audit budget and resource plan.
*   Receive communications from the Chief Audit Executive on the Audit Department’s performance relative to its plan and other matters.
*   Approve decisions regarding the performance evaluation, appointment, or removal of the Chief Audit Executive
*   Approve the remuneration of the Chief Audit Executive
*   Make appropriate inquiries of management and the Chief Audit Executive to determine whether there is inappropriate scope or resource limitations.

The Chief Audit Executive will communicate and interact directly with the ACR Committee, including in executive sessions and between ACR Committee meetings as appropriate.

**Professional Standards**

UVA’s Office of Audit and Compliance will govern itself by adherence to The

Institute of Internal Auditors’ mandatory guidance, which includes the Core Principles for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing, the Code of Ethics, the International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing, and the Definition of Internal Auditing.

The Office of Audit and Compliance will adhere to the University’s relevant policies and procedures as well as the _Generally Accepted Governmental Auditing Standards_ of the Government Accountability Office.

**Core Principles for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing:**

The Office of Audit and Compliance will continuously strive to be effective by operating in a manner consistent with the IIA’s Core Principles:

*   Demonstrates integrity.
*   Demonstrates competence and due professional care.
*   Is objective and free from undue influence (independent).
*   Aligns with the strategies, objectives, and risks of the organization.
*   Is appropriately positioned and adequately resourced.
*   Demonstrates quality and continuous improvement.
*   Communicates effectively.
*   Provides risk-based assurance.
*   Is insightful, proactive, and future-focused.
*   Promotes organizational improvement.

**Independence and Objectivity:**

The internal audit activity will remain free from interference by any element in the University, including matters of audit selection, scope, procedures, frequency, timing, or report content to permit maintenance of a necessary independent and objective function. The Chief Audit Executive must disclose such interference to the ACR Committee and discuss the implications.

Internal auditors will have no direct operational responsibility or authority over any of the activities audited. Accordingly, they will not implement internal controls, develop procedures, install systems, prepare records, or engage in any other activity that may impair internal auditors’ independence or judgment. Internal auditors may provide assurance services for areas previously consulted, provided the consulting services did not impair objectivity.

Internal auditors will exhibit the highest level of professional objectivity in gathering, evaluating, and communicating information about the activity or process being examined. Internal auditors will make a balanced assessment of all the relevant circumstances and not be unduly influenced by their own interests or by others in forming judgments.

The Chief Audit Executive will annually evaluate reporting lines and responsibilities and confirm to the ACR Committee the organizational independence of the Office of Audit and Compliance.

**Responsibility:**

The scope of internal auditing encompasses, but is not limited to, the examination and evaluation of the adequacy and effectiveness of the University’s governance, risk management, and internal controls as well as the quality of performance in carrying out assigned responsibilities to achieve the University’s stated goals and objectives. This includes:

*   *   Evaluating the design, implementation, and effectiveness of the

organization’s ethics-related objectives, programs, and activities.

*   *   Evaluating risk exposure relating to achievement of the University’s

strategic objectives.

*   *   Assessing whether the information technology governance of the organization supports the organization’s strategies and objectives.
    *   Evaluating the reliability and integrity of information and the means used to identify, measure, classify, and report such information.
    *   To enable this responsibility, the Office of Audit and Compliance will participate in the planning, development, implementation, and modification of major computer- based and manual systems to ensure that:
        *   adequate controls are incorporated into the system;
        *   thorough system testing is performed at appropriate stages;
        *   system documentation is complete and accurate; and
        *   the resultant system is a complete and accurate implementation of the system specifications.
    *   Evaluating the systems established to ensure compliance with those policies, plans, procedures, laws, and regulations which could have a significant impact on the University.
    *   Evaluating the means of safeguarding assets and, as appropriate, verifying the existence of such assets.
    *   Evaluating the effectiveness and efficiency of resource utilization.
    *   Evaluating operations or programs to ascertain whether results are consistent with established objectives and goals and whether the operations or programs are being carried out as planned.
    *   Assessing and making appropriate recommendations for improving the governance process in its accomplishment of the following objectives:
        *   Promoting appropriate ethics and values within the organization
        *   Ensuring effective organizational performance management and accountability
        *   Communicating risk and control information to appropriate areas of the organization
        *   Coordinating the activities of and communicating information among the board, external and internal auditors, and management.
    *   Monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of the

organization’s risk management processes.

*   *   Performing consulting services related to governance, risk management, and control.
    *   Reporting significant risk exposures and control issues, including fraud risks, governance issues, and other matters needed or requested by the ACR Committee or management.
    *   Evaluating specific operations at the request of the ACR Committee or management, as appropriate.
    *   Reporting periodically on the purpose, authority, and responsibility of the Office of Audit and Compliance and performance relative to its plan.

**Internal Audit Plan**:

At least annually, the Chief Audit Executive will submit to senior management and the ACR an internal audit plan for review and approval. The internal audit plan will consist of a work schedule as well as budget and resource requirements for the next year. The Chief Audit Executive will communicate the impact of resource limitations and significant interim changes to senior management and the Board.

The internal audit plan will be developed based on a prioritization of the audit universe using a risk-based methodology, including input of senior management, the ACR, and Board.

The Chief Audit Executive will review and adjust the plan, as necessary, in response to changes in the organization’s business, risks, operations, programs, systems, and controls. Any significant deviation from the approved internal audit plan will be communicated to senior management and the ACR through periodic activity reports.

**Audit Department Services:**

The Chief Audit Executive is empowered to conduct assurance services, special audit projects, reviews, or investigations at the request of the Board, ACR Committee, President, General Counsel, EVP Provost, EVP Chief Operating Officer, EVP Health Affairs, or their designee, to assist management in meeting its objectives, promoting economy and efficiency in the administration of, or preventing and detecting fraud and abuse in its programs and operations. The Office of Audit and Compliance may also provide consulting services, beyond assurance services, to assist management in meeting its objectives. Examples may include facilitation, process design, training, and advisory services.

**Coordination with External Auditing Agencies:**

The Chief Audit Executive, with the goal of avoiding duplication of work, will coordinate the office’s audit efforts with those of the Commonwealth of Virginia’s Auditor of Public Accounts, or other external auditing agencies as applicable, by participating in the planning and definition of the scope of proposed audits so the work of all auditing groups is complementary and their combined efforts provide comprehensive, cost- effective audit coverage for the University.

**Reporting and Monitoring:**

A written report will be prepared and issued by the Chief Audit Executive or designee following the conclusion of each internal audit engagement and will be distributed as appropriate. Internal audit results will be available for review by the ACR and the Board of Visitors.

The internal audit report will include management’s response and corrective action taken or to be taken regarding the specific findings and recommendations.

Management's response to audit findings and recommendations should include a timetable for anticipated completion of action to be taken and an explanation for any corrective action that will not be implemented.

The Office of Audit and Compliance will be responsible for appropriate follow-up on its engagement findings and recommendations. All significant findings will remain in an open issues file until cleared. The ACR will receive periodic reporting from the Chief Audit Executive on the status of management’s action plan implementation.

The Chief Audit Executive will periodically report to senior management and the ACR on the internal audit activity’s purpose, authority, and responsibility, as well as performance relative to its plan. Reporting will also include significant risk exposures and control issues, including fraud risks, governance issues, and other matters needed or requested by senior management, ACR, or the Board.

**Quality Assurance and Improvement Program:**

In alignment with the IIA _Standards_ the Chief Audit Executive must develop and maintain a quality assurance and improvement program that covers all aspects of the internal audit activity. The program must include both internal and external assessments to evaluate the internal audit activity’s conformance with the Standards and an evaluation of whether internal auditors abide by the Code of Ethics.

Internal assessments are conducted at the conclusion of each engagement in accordance with the quality standards described in greater detail in the Internal Audit Policies and Procedures Manual. The results of ongoing internal assessments are communicated to the ACR on an annual basis.

External assessments must be conducted at least once every five years by a qualified independent assessor or assessment team from outside the organization.

The Chief Audit Executive must discuss with the ACR Committee:

*   The form and frequency of external assessment;
*   The qualifications and independence of the external assessor or assessment team, including any potential conflict of interest.

The program will also assess the efficiency and effectiveness of the internal audit activity and identify opportunities for improvement. The Chief Audit Executive must communicate results of the quality assurance and improvement program to senior management and the ACR Committee.
