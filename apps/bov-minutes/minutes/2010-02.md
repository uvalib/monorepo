February 25-26, 2010

The Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia began its meeting in Executive Session, at 1:00 p.m., on Thursday, February 25, 2010, in the Board Room of the Rotunda, to consider the appointment of a student member to the Board of Visitors in accordance with Section 2.2-3711 (A) (1) of the Code of Virginia; John O. Wynne, Rector, presided.

Present were Daniel R. Abramson, A. Macdonald Caputo, Ms. Susan Y. Dorsey, Ms. Helen E. Dragas, W. Heywood Fralin, Rahul Gorawara, Robert D. Hardie, Randal J. Kirk, Austin Ligon, Vincent J. Mastracco, Jr., The Honorable Lewis F. Payne, Warren M. Thompson, and E. Darracott Vaughan, Jr., M.D. Absent were The Honorable Alan A. Diamonstein, Ms. Glynn D. Key, and Don R. Pippin.

That we vote on and record our certification that, to the best of each Board member’s knowledge, only public business matters lawfully exempted from open meeting requirements and which were identified in the motion authorizing the closed session, were heard, discussed or considered in closed session.

*   **\- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -**

The Rector called the Preliminary Meeting of the Full Board to order at 1:15 p.m., on Thursday, February 25, 2010, with all persons who attended the prior Executive Session in attendance. David J. Prior joined the meeting at this point.

The Rector called on Mr. Fralin to lead the Pledge of Allegiance.

Appointment of Non-Voting Student Member to the Board of Visitors

The Rector said the Executive Committee met the day before to interview candidates and select a candidate to recommend to the full Board. The full Board met in Executive Session prior to the Preliminary meeting, and agreed on a Student Member to the Board for 2010-2011. On motion, the Board approved the following resolution.

APPOINTMENT OF NON-VOTING STUDENT MEMBER TO THE BOARD OF VISITORS

RESOLVED, Stewart Hill Ackerly, a graduate law student, from Richmond, Virginia, is elected the Student Member of the Board of Visitors. Mr. Ackerly’s term will begin on June 1, 2010, and will run until May 31, 2011.

Approval of the Minutes of the Board Meetings on November 16-17, 2009 and January 11, 2010

On motion, the Minutes of the Board meetings on November 16-17, 2009, and January 11, 2010, were approved.

Resolution for Additions to the Agenda

On motion, the Board adopted the following resolution approving the consideration of addenda to the published Agenda of the meeting:

RESOLVED, the consideration of addenda to the published Agenda of this meeting of the Board of Visitors is approved.

Comments by the Rector

The Rector said the Retreat will be July 9 and 10, 2010, in Virginia Beach. Rooms have been reserved at the Sheraton and the Rector will host events during that time.

He reminded the Board that the Association of Governing Boards annual trusteeship meeting is in March and if any Board member is interested in attending to speak to Susan Harris.

The Rector commended Mr. Casteen and Mr. Sandridge for recognition by the General Assembly. He said Mr. Casteen will be honored by both houses on March 2nd.

He added that Ms. Dragas was also recognized as the “First Citizen” of Virginia Beach, an unusual achievement for someone so young. The General Assembly is recognizing this honor also.

The Rector said a few words about Bill Dudley. He was a great football player, a successful businessman, a mentor, a coach, and a friend of the University all of his life. He said with all of those achievements he was one of the most humble people you would ever meet.

President’s Report

The Rector asked President Casteen to give his report. Mr. Casteen began with comments about the legislative session currently underway. He said there were attempts to limit the number of bills, but there were 2,700 bills and resolutions introduced. A number of bills have policy implications.

More bills attempting to limit out-of-state enrollment were introduced than in past years. All were tabled in committee. The real issue is the number of spaces for in-state students in the more selective state institutions. None of the institutions has been able to grow substantially since the 1980s without additional funding. The University has absorbed some 1,500 additional students over that period. The College of William and Mary has taken the position that it will not grow. The College of William and Mary is dealing with thin margins, but the principal cost control mechanism for them is that they do little research.

Virginia Tech has expanded at the same pace as the University and they are dealing with the same operating restraints as the University. Virginia Tech receives research funding through the land grant appropriations requirement, the Hatch Act.

James Madison University expanded dramatically in the 1980s and 1990s and has attempted to accommodate some of the need. However, the only University with the space to grow enough to meet the need is the University of Virginia. That would require growing to 35 to 38 thousand students. The legislature is not defining the issue this way; they want to talk about limiting the number of out-of-state students. It is the bitterest issue in this session.

Mr. Sandridge said that if an in-state student applied to Virginia Tech, William and Mary, James Madison University, and the University of Virginia, they would have a 96% chance of admission to one or more of the schools.

President Casteen said the issue is not going away. The good news is the Governor has created a Commission on Higher Education as a priority for the second half of his term. Mr. Wynne said it has moved to the first half of the term and they will report out by the end of the year.

Other bills have implications for students. One bill is to eliminate the mandate that employees have health insurance, which has been extended to college students. This could affect the University’s requirement of health insurance for all students. The Governor may be asked to amend the bill to protect colleges’ ability to require insurance.

An amendment is proposed to the Conflict of Interests Act, and to legislation on threat assessment teams that would protect the teams’ records.

The President discussed the budget proposals. Governor McDonnell chose not to submit his own budget proposal, but submitted recommendations. The Governor recommended protecting the colleges from additional reductions, adding five furlough days, and awarding a 3% employee bonus in December 2011. The University has proposed paying the state instead of taking furlough days.

There are a number of targeted reductions, including some Centers at the University. There are capital projects in the House budget, and the Senate budget proposes charging a fee to in-state students for capital debt service. The Secretary of Finance is to submit a plan for scheduling the issuance of debt on authorized capital projects. Both the House and the Senate have eliminated the proposal to take the balances from auxiliary enterprises and put them into the General Fund.

The President talked about some proposals that will affect retirement contributions and care of indigent patients. Adjournment day is March 13. The Governor has until April 12 to amend, approve, or veto bills. The reconvened session is set for April 21.

The President moved on to the Capital Campaign and recited the development events that have occurred in recent months.

Gifts and Grants Report

The President said philanthropic giving to the University and its related foundations is $133,382,403.09 through January 31, 2010. This is a decrease of $32,048,317.52, or 19.37% below the results of the previous fiscal year. This decrease can be attributed in large part to substantial gifts collected in the previous two fiscal years for the Batten School for Leadership and Public Policy.

Significant gifts received since the last meeting include a Batten Foundation pledge payment of $10,000,000 to the Batten School for Leadership and Public Policy, and anonymous gifts of $3,118,289 and $2,915,282 to the Virginia Athletics Foundation for the basketball program and football program, respectively.

Mr. Paul Tudor Jones II and Ms. Sonia Klein Jones made a pledge payment of $4,058,955 to the Virginia Athletics Foundation for the John Paul Jones Arena, and a gift of $1,000,000 to the College and graduate School of Arts and Sciences for the Environmental Sciences Department.

Mrs. Hunter J. Smith made a pledge payment of $2,500,000 for the Band Rehearsal Hall in the College and Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.

The Claude Moore Charitable Foundation paid $3,000,000 to the School of Medicine for the Claude Moore Medical Education Building, and the Alumni Board of Trustees gave $1,190,284 for the President’s Contingency Fund and $638,216 to various other initiatives supporting the following: the College and Graduate School of Arts and Sciences; the Schools of Law, Engineering and Architecture; the Curry School of Education; the Darden School of Business; the President’s Office; and the Office of the Provost.

The Rice Family Foundation paid a pledge of $950,000 to the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences for the IT Building Fund, and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation gave a grant of $870,000 to the University Library for the Born-Digital Collections.

The Joseph and Robert Cornell Memorial Foundation gave $750,000 to the University Art Museum for the Joseph and Robert Cornell Memorial Foundation Acquisitions Endowment.

Significant new pledges since the last meeting include an anonymous pledge of $8,424,605 to the Virginia Athletics Foundation for the football program, $750,000 from Klockner Pentaplast of America for the Children’s Hospital Building Fund, an anonymous challenge pledge to support Dr. David Jones’ research in lung cancer, and a pledge of $500,000 from Mr. Trey Beck to the College and Graduate School of Arts and Sciences for the Legacy of Distinction Fund.

On motion, the Board accepted the Gift and Grants Report.

The Rector acknowledged President-delegate Teresa Sullivan, and he asked Dr. Vaughan to be prepared to give a presentation to the full Board in June on strategic plans of the Medical Center.

The Rector recessed the Preliminary Meeting at 1:55 p.m., to begin the Finance Committee meeting.

Executive Session – Friday, February 26th

The Board resumed meeting as a full Board at 12:50 p.m., on Friday, February 26th. All Members, save Ms. Key and Messrs. Mastracco and Pippin, were present.

After adopting the following motions, the Board went into Executive Session and met until 1:45 p.m.

That the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia convene in Closed Session for the purpose of discussing and/or approving personnel actions involving the appointment, reappointment, transition, nomination, evaluation, performance, compensation, and resignation of specific University officers and employees as provided for in Section 2.2-3711 (A) (1) of the Code of Virginia.

     That the Board of Visitors convene in Closed Session to consult with General Counsel regarding his privileged legal report to the Board on pending and anticipated litigation affecting the University, as provided for in Section 2.2-3711 (A) (7) of the Code of Virginia.

At 1:45 p.m., the Board resumed in open session. On motion, the Board adopted the following resolution certifying that its deliberations in Executive Session had been conducted in accordance with the exemptions permitted by the Virginia Freedom of Information Act:

That we vote on and record our certification that, to the best of each Board member’s knowledge, only public business matters lawfully exempted from open meeting requirements and which were identified in the motion(s) authorizing the closed session, were heard, discussed or considered in closed session.

WORDING OF FOSTER SITE HISTORICAL MARKERS

Historical Marker 1

History Underfoot

Text

Traces of those who came before are all around us. This spot, for example, held clues to the life of Catherine Foster, a free black seamstress and laundress, who purchased 2 1/8 acres here, in 1833, for herself and her family.

As this “reveal” shows, there are bricks and cobblestones still below ground, not just rubble, but stones laid with purpose. To what end?

These bricks and stones are part of a path leading to the Foster home.

Archaeology on the site also uncovered foundations and basement of the Foster home, a well, a paved courtyard (possibly used for the family laundering business), and many small artifacts.

While each unearthed feature has been covered again for preservation, transparent protection over this feature allows visitors to see something of what lies underfoot and to imagine the generations of Fosters who walked this ground.

Historical Marker 2

Shadow Catcher

Text

At this place, on the site of Catherine Foster’s home, this “shadow catcher” links the visible with the unseen. Even as it pulls the eyes upward to the sky, it creates a shadowy, grid-like outline of the house that once stood at this location.

The meandering paths lead away from the home site across the Fosters’ yard to a family and community burial ground.

Historical Marker 3

‘Burying’ Ground

Text

The Foster family kept their ancestors close. Sheltered on a portion of the 2 1/8 acre plot purchased in 1833 by free black Catherine Foster, this burial ground still contains several dozen graves.

Rediscovered in 1993, the Foster cemetery most likely contains the remains of not only family members but also neighbors from the local community called Canada.

In deference to those buried here, the graves remain undisturbed, but no longer uncelebrated. Gentle mounds and depressions recall the contours of other historic African American cemeteries. A stone wall embraces the elevated ground, inviting the introspection of passersby.
