-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In August 1981 the University of Virginia issued a Request for Proposal for a Hospital Information System to improve operating efficiency and the availability of management information. University Management, in cooperation with the State's Office of Management Analysis and Systems Development (MASD) reviewed proposals received in October 1981 from six major healthcare system vendors. The selection committee determined that no one vendor offered an acceptable comprehensive system. Two firms were selected in October 1982 to meet the system needs of the Hospital: SMS Systems for the financial systems and Technicon Data Systems for the healthcare systems. The State Health Commission approved a Certificate of Need for the procurement of a Hospital Information System.

A contract with SMS Systems was negotiated by the University and approved by the Board of Visitors in March 1983. The projected value of the SMS contract was $4.5 million.

A contract with Technicon Data systems was negotiated by the University and approved by the Board of Visitors in August 1984. The projected value of the Technicon contract was $5.4 million.

A contract with IBM for hardware and software to support the Technicon software was approved by the Executive Committee of the Board of Visitors in November 1984 and ratified by the January 1985 Board of Visitors Meeting. The total amount of the IBM contract was $1,114,000.

The contract with SMS Systems provided that the University Hospital would initially operate its financial systems on a shared basis using systems located at SMS Systems corporate headquarters. The University Hospital pays a monthly fee to SMS Systems based upon the volume of transactions and reports. The contract also allows for a conversion from a shared basis to an "in-house" option whereby SMS System licensed software is run on a University owned computer.

Due to the potential savings derived by the in-house option, University management recommends that the University Hospital financial systems be converted from a shared to University operated basis at this time.

The estimated operating savings which would result from the conversion of the University Hospital's financial systems from a shared to University operated basis is $1,150,000 per year. The total cost of acquiring the necessary hardware and software is approximately $3,256,000 as follows: IBM 4381 Group III Processors and Required Peripherals$2,252,000IBM Operating System Software177,000SMS Systems Software827,000Total$3,256,000

The University requests Board of Visitors approval to contract with IBM and SMS Systems subject to the review and approval of contract documents by the Legal Adviser's Office and University Management.

Section 5. The Board (a) covenants to fix, revise, charge, and collect that component of the comprehensive student fee known as the "Auxiliary Services Fee" for or in connection with the Student Activity Building Project and other auxiliary enterprise facilities supported by the Auxiliary Services Fee, and (b) pledges the Auxiliary Services Fee to the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on that portion of the Bonds issued to finance the Student Activity Building Project, provided that the current expenses of operating the Student Activity Building Project and the other auxiliary enterprise facilities supported by the Auxiliary Services Fee (the "Auxiliary Services Current Expenses") shall be a first charge on such Auxiliary Services Fee.

The University is planning to construct an addition to Observatory Dining Hall. The project is expected to be completed in July, 1984 at a cost of $871,500 including utilities. We have requested approval of the total project by the General Assembly, and we would like the project to be included in a revenue bond issue for permanent financing.

In the vicinity of Observatory Dining Hall, the University is constructing housing for 650 students. Since the present contract facilities are operating at capacity, additional dining space is needed at Observatory Dining Hall to accommodate the students residing in the new housing. The addition will include space for approximately 200 seats, another hot service line, a walk-in cooler and/or freezer and a small storage area for additional volumes of foodstuffs.

Payment of the debt will be from food service contract sales. In calculating the debt payment schedule, an interest rate of 12% was used and the payments were extended over 20 years which resulted in coverage of approximately 110%.

The University is planning construction of an addition to Sponsors Hall. This addition will provide additional on-grounds housing facilities for participants in Darden's Executive Programs. The structure is expected to be completed in 1984-85 at a cost of $2,305,500 including utilities. We have requested approval of the total project by the General Assembly, and we would like the project to be included in a revenue bond issue for permanent financing.

One of the objectives of the Darden School is to conduct intensive short courses, conferences, and executive training programs for individuals in business. It is most desirable to have eating and living facilities integral with the academic classrooms for these programs.

In September .1979, our present facility consisting of Sponsors Hall and Program Center housing (36 units) was opened. When the Darden School planned for Executive Programs housing, it was felt that 36 units would be adequate for the size of class we would attract. The attractiveness of the offerings has been so great that it has been impossible to house all the participants in Sponsors Hall facilities. It is anticipated that the program will not expand to more than 60 participants per program; therefore to avoid the undesirable condition of having a portion of the program participants in other areas, an additional 24 units are needed.

The dining area will also be enlarged in order to accommodate the increased number of participants staying in Sponsors Hall facilities. Also, included in the project is a general purpose room which will be used as a meeting room for introductory, evening, and final sessions.

Sponsors Hall and Executive Programs Housing are totally self-supporting. Payment of the debt on the additional 24 housing units will be from revenues received from overnight room rent. Rental rates for the addition are expected to be $35 per night. The charge per person per night is at the discretion of the Executive Program and can be varied to meet whatever costs are incurred. In calculating the debt payment schedule, an interest rate of 12% was used and payments were extended over 20 years resulting in coverage of approximately 110%.

The University has constructed a Student Activity Building which will accommodate approximately 800 persons. The structure will provide activity space for large meetings and social activities for both on-Grounds and off-Grounds students. The project was completed in November 1984 at a cost of $564,700 including utilities and sitework. The General Assembly authorized the inclusion of this project in a revenue bond issue for permanent financing.

For a significant period of time student groups and organizations have faced a scarcity of activity space for large meetings and social activities which would protect them from the elements. Currently, there are approximately 150 student organizations that are in need of activity space. In addition, there are approximately 50 fraternities and sororities that on occasion are in need of space. One of the three buildings previously being used for social activities, Halsey Hall, is being converted to academic space. Since they are smaller in size, the other two facilities do not fully meet the needs of the student body.

Payment of the debt will be from a student fee to be assessed to all full-time, regular session students in the amount of $7 per session. In calculating the debt payment schedule, an interest rate of 9.5% was used and the payments were extended over 20 years resulting in coverage of approximately 117%.
