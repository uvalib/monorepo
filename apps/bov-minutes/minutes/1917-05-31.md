The regular annual meeting of the Rector and Visitors was held on this date at 10:30 A. M., with the following members present: Rector Gordon and Visitors Hatton, Irvine, Michie and White. Mr. Turnbull did not arrive until 5:30 P. M., just at the close of the meeting. President Alderman was present. Reading of the minutes of the last meeting was dispensed with.

President Alderman announced a gift of $10,000.00 from Mrs. Chas. H. Senff, for the further purpose of grounds and roads improvements; and he was requested by the Board to prepare a suitable resolution extending to Mrs. Senff the thanks and appreciation of the Board for her benefaction.

President Alderman announced the receipt of $7,843.97 covering the bequest to the University by Daniel B. Fayerweather. The Rector thereupon stated that he had signed, on behalf of the University, the release deed in the matter of payment of the aforesaid sum to the University and requested that his action be ratified by the Board, which was done.

The Bursar was directed to pay to Mr. Robert Harrison, of New York, the sum of $100, covering his fee as special attorney for the University in the settlement of the Fayerweather bequest.

On motion, it was

**RESOLVED:** That the Fayerweather bequest be used toward equipping the Chemical Laboratory, and that said laboratory equipment be completed out of such other funds as may be found available for the purpose.

On the recommendation of President Alderman, the following were elected:

Mr. F. J. Hyde, Acting Adjunct Professor of Law at a salary of $1,500.

Mr. E. F. Shewmake, Jr., Adjunct Professor of English at a salary of $1,000.

That an Adjunct Professor of Chemistry be secured instead of a full professor, thus effecting a saving of $1,200.

A communication was received from Prof. Heck, asking that the University make the needed repairs to Pavilion # 2, consisting of inexpensive painting and papering the four rooms. In connection with the foregoing application, the following was adopted:

**RESOLVED:** That, in view of the existing conditions brought about by the war, and the necessity of retrenchment in every direction by the University, the Board feels constrained to decline the request of Prof. Heck.

The President presented a report of the Special Committee on Efficiency and Economy, appointed by him for the purpose of looking into the feasibility of decreasing the number of lecture rooms, and such other economies as might aid in decreasing the consumption of coal for heat and light.

The report showed that certain buildings and lecture halls could be discontinued during the session of 1917-18, and that the classes heretofore meeting in them could be arranged for in other buildings, and estimated that a saving of $2,000. per annum could be effected thereby. The report of the committee was adopted.

The Superintendent of Grounds and Buildings reported that he was experiencing considerable difficulty in securing sufficient coal for the University, owing to the shortage of cars, and suggested that he be authorized to purchase 1,000 tons to be stored ready for use when the heating season begins; whereupon, the following was adopted:

**RESOLVED:** That the Superintendent of Buildings and Grounds be and is hereby authorized to secure at least 1,000 tons of coal at the best price obtainable, to be used as an emergency supply for the winter's needs.

The President reported that owing to the unsettled conditions due to the war, it had been found impossible to appoint the instructors and assistants from the student body for the coming session, and asked that the following resolution be adopted, which was done:

**RESOLVED:** That the President, in co-operation with the heads of the departments, be authorized to fill vacant Instructor-ships and Assistantships, reporting the names in each department to the Board for their ratification at a later meeting.

The following letter from Prof. C. G. Maphis was presented, and read, when the following action was had thereon:

**RESOLVED:** That after due consideration of the letter of Prof. Maphis, the Board feels constrained to adhere to its resolution suspending the rule of automatic increase in professorial salaries:

I have been advised by the Bursar that the rule of the Board of Visitors, which has been in operation for some years, granting an automatic increase of ten per cent in the salary of those professors who have served for a term of six years has been suspended for the coming year.

Under this regulation, the benefits of which are being enjoyed by most members of the faculty, I thought I had a right to look forward to an increase of ten per cent in my salary during the coming session, and was planning accordingly.

I do not wish to be considered unsympathetic with the difficulties which have been thrust upon the Board by our present war crisis, or unwilling to "do my bit" for the University or for my country, but I do feel that there is one phase of the matter which doubtless you and the Board may have overlooked. That is, the result of this decision would be practically requiring me and one or two others to whom the rule would apply this year, to make a contribution of ten per cent of our salary; whereas, there would be nothing levied upon other members of the faculty to help out in this distressing situation. I am perfectly willing to make this contribution, if the Board thinks it necessary, but I should greatly prefer, because I think it just, that my salary increase be allowed under the regulation, and that I be permitted to contribute this amount directly to the University. I can't help feeling that a suspension of this regulation of the Board in the case of two or three of us would be a discrimination which neither the Board nor yourself intend or desire to make, but which, nevertheless, would be unjust to us.

I am writing simply to bring this phase of the matter to your attention, but shall willingly abide by the final decision of yourself and the Board, if you cannot see it as I do.

It is

$4,625.00

The equipment for the other chemical courses will cost

$5,730.30

Cost of total furnishings not already contracted for,

$10,355.30

The committee appointed to consider ways and means for teaching Chemistry next session reported to you that part of the new chemical laboratory would have to be furnished if the lectures in Chemistry and the courses in Analytical Chemistry are to be given at all. The makeshift adopted since the fire was an utterly impossible situation, and we are deprived of this by the closing of Peabody Hall next year.

You asked for an estimate of the cost of this partial furnishing of the new chemical laboratory.

This is the price received today. The estimate given you under date of April first was withdrawn, due to an increase of $400.30 in the price of materials. A further increase of something over $800. additional is announced for the near future, and the builders say that the rise in price by the fall will be another 20%, or near $2,000; that is, more than the price quoted above.

It is manifestly proper for me to call your attention to this outlook; because the announced advance in cost by the fall figures out to be the equivalent of six per cent interest for three and a third years, and it would be a good business proposition to borrow the money needed for finishing the laboratory rather than lose it through payment to contractors.

I should add that the above price quoted by the Charlottesville Lumber, Co., is over $3,600, under the next lowest bid we received.

The Thomas F. Ryan Scholarships were elected for the session 1917-18, as follows:

The following scholarship nominations for the session of 1917-18 were confirmed:

#### Bennett Wood Green Scholarships:

C. H. Parsons,

T. R. Snavely, (appointed for a period not to exceed two years)

#### Herndon Scholarship:

Donald M. Faulkner.

#### Daniel Harmon Scholarship:

R. B. Geither.

#### Miller Scholarship:

J. A. Pegau.

On motion, the Board then adjourned.
