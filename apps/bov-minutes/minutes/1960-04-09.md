The Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia convened at 10:00 A. M. on this date in executive session in the Office of the Chancellor of Mary Washington College, at Fredericksburg, with the following present. Visitors Berkeley, Blanton, Bryan, Camp, Coxe, Faulconer, Fenwick, Greear, Hartfield, Jones, Lantor, Lewis, McWane, Martin, Montague, and Pollock. Absent: Visitor Paschall.

The minutes of the meeting of 20 February 1960, previously distributed, were approved as corrected.

Following a brief period of balloting, the Board announced through its temporary Chairman, Mr. Hartfield, that Mr. Albert Vickers Bryan had been elected Rector of the University of Virginia, to succeed Mr. Frank Talbott, Jr., for the remainder of the four-year term ending on 28 February 1962.

President Shannon entered the room at this point. Chancellor Simpson and Bursar Woodward were present throughout the discussion of Mary Washington College matters.

The Rector reported that the Secretary had received a letter from the former Rector, Frank Talbott, Jr., dated 29 March 1960, and asked the Secretary to read the letter to the Board. At the conclusion of the reading, the Secretary was instructed to include the letter in the permanent minutes of the Board. The letter is as follows:

> I know that I did not have the right words to tell you of my gratitude for your kindness which was heaped up in such abundant measure at our last meeting on February 20. I did not deserve what was said and done but knowledge of this does not diminish in the least the pleasure which the occasion gave to Margaret and me. The handsome tray with its engraving is my proudest possession.
>
> I owe the University for a great part of the pleasure which I have been able to get out of life (which is no little) and for whatever I have been able to develop in the way of professional competence, so I came on the Board in 1949 hoping that I might be able, by working hard, to pay back at least some of this debt. Now, at the end of my service on the Board, the irony of it is that I feel myself in greater debt than before. The reason is that my life has been made richer by my association with all of you. Never before have I had the experience of working with a group of so much ability, character, and wit, and I know I never will again.
>
> I hope not to lose touch with you, but even if I should, the memories of the past eleven years will still be my happiest.

The following resolution was adopted:

The President reported in detail on the recent refusal of admission to Mrs. Doris B. Kwasikpui who had applied to enter the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.

The President presented a detailed report on the intercollegiate athletic program at the University. Following his report, a discussion ensued which was joined in by several members of the Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the President stated that, in view of the financial situation, he would continue his studies and report to the Board on future developments.

Messrs. L. B. Gunn, R. B. Hardaway, and D. S. Willcox of the State-Planters Bank of Commerce and Trusts of Richmond presented a detailed report on the University of Virginia Consolidated Endowment Fund for the year ending 25 January 1960. At the conclusion of the presentation, a copy of the report was ordered to be filed with the permanent records of the Board.

The President reported that the State-Planters Bank of Commerce and Trusts of Richmond had been having trouble in obtaining the transfer of securities registered in the name of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia to Hamac and Company, the street name and nominee of the State-Planters Bank. The State-Planters Bank had therefore prepared a resolution and recommended to the President that it be adopted by the Board, under the terms of which resolution the Bank will continue to be responsible to the University for the actions of Hamac and Company as provided in the agency agreement now existing between the University of Virginia and the State-Planters Bank of Commerce and Trusts.

The following resolution was adopted:

### RESOLVED

by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the Rector or President or Comptroller, be and are hereby authorized on behalf of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia to assign and transfer any and all securities of any company, corporation or association now or hereafter registered in the name of or belonging to The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia to Hamac and Company, and be it further

RESOLVED, that the said companies, corporations and associations, their transfer agent or agents, their registrar or registrars and their respective administrators, executors, successors and assigns, be and hereby are authorized to treat Hamac and Company as holders in fact and owners of said shares and certificates representing the same for any and all purposes including but not limited to the payment or issuing of dividends in money or stock to said Hamac and Company, and be it further

RESOLVED, that the said companies, corporations and associations, their transfer agent or agents, their registrar or registrars and their respective administrators, executors, successors and assigns, be and hereby are absolved from any and all responsibility in following the said shares as being the property of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia.

The President presented a detailed report on the action of the Governor and the General Assembly concerning the University's budget requests for the biennium 1960-1962.

The following resolution was adopted:

### RESOLVED

by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the Board express to Lady Nancy Astor on her eighty-first birthday the University's best wishes to her and its warm appreciation of her demonstrated loyalty to this institution. Not only has she made tangible gifts, such as generous contributions to the University Library and to the tennis courts which are named in her honor, but over the years and in more intangible ways she has shown her devotion to Virginia and to its University. With wit, affection, and gaiety of spirit she has delighted and assisted untold students and alumni. It seems appropriate that we should greet her on this occasion, extend to her the University's good wishes and esteem; express our pride in her as a loyal Virginian of international distinction, and voice the hope that she will soon return to visit Albemarle County and Mr. Jefferson's University.

The President announced the following gifts and grants:

The Rector reported that the Secretary had received a letter from Mr. C. O'Conor Goolrick expressing his gratification for the action of the Board at its meeting on 20 February 1960 in which the Board announced its intention of naming the contemplated building at Mary Washington College to be used for Health and Physical Education purposes in honor of Mr. Goolrick. After the letter from Mr. Goolrick, dated 7 March 1960, was read to the Board, the Secretary was instructed to incorporate the letter in the permanent minutes of the Board. The letter is as follows:

> I was pleasantly surprised and greatly pleased when Dr. Simpson and Mr. Woodward were good enough to call at my office one day last week and present to me the letter and resolution of the Board informing me that the projected physical education building at Mary Washington College was to bear my name.
>
> I would like you to know that this action has given much pleasure to my wife and she joins with me in expressing to every member of the Board, to Dr. Simpson and to Mr. Woodward our deep appreciation for the honor which has been conferred.
>
> I have a deep interest in both the University and Mary Washington College, and I have watched through the years the growth of the College with much pleasure, and I feel that under the present administration its future is assured.

Chancellor Simpson reported that Mrs. Charles Greene of Greeneville, Tennessee (sister of the late Emil R. Schnellock, Associate Professor of Painting at Mary Washington College) had forwarded to the College, in memory of her brother, $1,000 as an endowment fund to establish an annual cash award to a student in painting at the College. Mrs. Greene has also sent an additional $25 to be used for the 1960 award. Mrs. Greene has expressed the desire that the donor remain anonymous.

Schnellock Award.

Darden, Jr. Mr. Cecere explained in detail the make-up of the proposed medal. The Chancellor also reported that a joint committee of faculty and students at Mary Washington College had recommended that a replica of the first award be presented to Mrs. Colgate W. Darden, Jr.

On motion the meeting was then adjourned.

I know that I did not have the right words to tell you of my gratitude for your kindness which was heaped up in such abundant measure at our last meeting on February 20. I did not deserve what was said and done but knowledge of this does not diminish in the least the pleasure which the occasion gave to Margaret and me. The handsome tray with its engraving is my proudest possession.

I owe the University for a great part of the pleasure which I have been able to get out of life (which is no little) and for whatever I have been able to develop in the way of professional competence, so I came on the Board in 1949 hoping that I might be able, by working hard, to pay back at least some of this debt. Now, at the end of my service on the Board, the irony of it is that I feel myself in greater debt than before. The reason is that my life has been made richer by my association with all of you. Never before have I had the experience of working with a group of so much ability, character, and wit, and I know I never will again.

I hope not to lose touch with you, but even If I should, the memories of the past eleven years will still be my happiest.

I was pleasantly surprised and greatly pleased when Dr. Simpson and Mr. Woodward were good enough to call at my office one day last week and present to me the letter and resolution of the Board informing me that the projected physical education building at Mary Washington College was to bear my name.

I would like you to know that this action has given much pleasure to my wife and she joins with me in expressing to every member of the Board, to Dr. Simpson and to Mr. Woodward our deep appreciation for the honor which has been conferred.

I have a deep interest in both the University and Mary Washington College, and I have watched through the years the growth of the College with much pleasure, and I feel that under the present administration its future is assured.
