**VOICING OF COMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS BY HUMAN SUBJECTS**

The following resolution was adopted: **RESOLVED** by The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the following is adopted as the official policy with respect to the Policy of the University of Virginia for the Protection of Human Subjects:

The Policy of the University of Virginia for the Protection of Human Subjects is to assure that in the plans and conduct of sponsored projects and activities that include human subjects:

1. The rights and welfare of subjects are adequately protected.
2. The risks to subjects are outweighed by potential benefits.
3. The informed consent of subjects will be obtained by methods that are adequate and appropriate.

The complexity of the University of Virginia requires that there be two review committees, with a separate chairman for each, responsible for protecting human subjects who may be "at risk"\*\
\*Exposure of an individual to the possibility of harm--physical, psychological, sociological, or other--as a consequence of any activity which goes beyond the application of those established and accepted methods necessary to meet his needs.\
in research, training, demonstrations or other University activities. Both committees are responsible to the Vice President and Provost of the University.

Exposure of an individual to the possibility of harm--physical, psychological, sociological, or other--as a consequence of any activity which goes beyond the application of those established and accepted methods necessary to meet his needs.

All applications which include human subjects who may be "at risk," whether in research, training, demonstrations or other, and originate in the Medical Center will be reviewed by the Clinical Research Committee, which is appointed by the Dean of the Medical School. The committee is composed of ten members from varying backgrounds to assure complete and adequate review. Most of the members will be engaged in private practice as well as research. (See Appendix A, "Current Membership and Qualifications of the Clinical Research Committee.")

All applications which include human subjects who may be "at risk," whether in research, training, demonstrations, or other, and originate in the University outside the Medical Center will be reviewed by the Human Subjects Committee, which is appointed by the Vice President and Provost. This committee is composed of at least six members with representation from the Schools of Education, Engineering and Law and the Departments of Psychology and Sociology and Anthropology. (See Appendix B, "Current Membership and Qualifications of the Human Subjects Committee.")

The Chairman of each committee will serve as ex officio member of the other. The Human Subjects Committee member from the School of Law may serve as consultant to the Clinical Research Committee, upon request. Conversely, applications to the Human Subjects Committee which have medical implications will be referred to the Clinical Research Committee for review and approval. A committee reviewing a project which involves the use of experimental new drugs will include a quorum including not less than two persons licensed to administer drugs, and one who is not so licensed.

No individual shall participate in the review of the research activities in which he is involved, except to provide information to the committee. A committee member will absent himself during the discussion of and voting on his own application.

The chairman of either committee shall be responsible for determining the need for and obtaining expert advice whenever necessary for the competent review of an application. The source and nature of such advice shall be reported to the Vice President and Provost, along with the committee's decision. Similarly, the review committee shall inform each investigator of the need for and suggest sources of expert advice or consultation during the conduct of the investigation. This information will form a part of the committee's decision report.

A majority of the committee members constitute a quorum, a majority of which may pass on an application. The result of such vote, along with appropriate attachments, shall be reported immediately to the Office of Sponsored Programs and to the Vice President and Provost.

Unless specifically noted otherwise, procedures are equally applicable to both the Clinical Research Committee and the Human Subjects Committee.

The committee will meet as often as the need arises. Research described in applications and contract proposals shall, whenever possible, be given institutional review and approval prior to submittal to the sponsor.

There may be occasions when a second review by the committee will be required before the research project is initiated. Also, the committee shall require the project or program director to report for review any emergent problems or proposed procedural changes which might affect the status of the research with regard to the committee's review criteria. No such changes, except those necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards, will be allowed without prior approval of the committee.

Prior to submittal of a grant application to the committee, the principal investigator should discuss his application with his department head during its preparation, and submit it to the review committee before the application is sent to the sponsor. The proposal or application should be appropriately marked in the spaces provided or, when missing, the following statement should be typed on the lower or right-hand margin of the page bearing the name of the institutional official signing the application or proposal for the institution:

**HUMAN SUBJECTS---REVIEWED AND APPROVED ON (date).** (This date should be no more than 90 days prior to the submittal date and must not be more than 12 months prior to the proposed starting date).

If it is necessary to delay the review, the proposal should be appropriately marked in the spaces provided on the forms or, if missing, the following statement should be typed in the lower or right-hand margin of the page bearing the name of the institutional official authorized to sign or execute applications or proposals for the institution:

**HUMAN SUBJECTS---REVIEW PENDING ON (date).** (This date should be at least one month earlier than the proposed starting date of the project to avoid possible conflict with the award date).

Pending reviews will be completed as much in advance of the stated pending review date as is practicable. If the final action is disapproval, or is approval contingent on substantive changes in the proposal, the Director of the Office of Sponsored Programs will be asked to so notify the operating agency and, where appropriate, will formally withdraw the application from further consideration by that agency.

The committee will carefully examine the research plan from each investigator to arrive at an independent determination of the possible hazards involved. In particular, the committee will be alert to the possibility that the principal investigator may unintentionally introduce unnecessary or unacceptable hazards or fail to provide adequate safeguards. The committee will consider the research plan as a whole in order to determine that the normally minor and acceptable risks are not aggravated by the design of the plan. The committee must be assured by the investigators that proper precautions will be taken to deal with emergencies that may develop even in the course of routine procedures.

The committee will assist in the development of a proper and appropriate investigation consent form. The guidelines for the wording of such forms, for the methods by which patients or subjects are to be informed in a valid manner, and for the limitations and exceptions to the rule that all subjects or their guardians must be informed and be given written consent, are derived from those issued on August 24, 1966, by FDA commissioner J. P. Goddard (Title 21, Part 130.37, as published in the Federal Register of August 30, 1966). The basic guideline has been expanded, however, to include not only the use of new drugs but all other investigative procedures as well.

Consent will be obtained whenever possible from the subject himself. Whenever the subject is not legally or physically capable of giving informed consent because of age, medical incapacity or inability to communicate, or when the attending professional investigator believes that the giving of full information would be contrary to the best interest of the subject, a review committee may consider the validity of consent of the next of kin, legal guardians or other responsible third parties who represent the subject's interest. The committee will determine if the consent, whether secured in writing or orally, or implicit in the voluntary participation in a well advertised activity, is adequate in the light of risks to the subject and the circumstances of the research. The committee will also determine if the information to be given to the subject or responsible third parties, orally or in writing, is a fair explanation of the procedures, the possible benefits, and the attendant hazards.

Even though informed consent has been obtained or can be anticipated, the committee will carefully consider the relative weights of the risks and benefits of the procedures to the subjects.

When the committee's overall recommendation concerning a research project is favorable, it will prescribe restrictions or conditions under which research may be conducted, define areas of possible pertinent changes in the research plans which should be brought to the investigator's attention, and determine the nature and frequency of interim review procedures to insure continued acceptable conduct of the research. Unfavorable recommendations concerning the proposed research project cannot be removed except by the committee. Under no circumstances shall proposed research or proposed changes in research plans not approved by the research committee be implemented with sponsor funds. In the event of unfavorable recommendations, the investigator proposing the research will be informed of the reasons for any adverse actions taken by the committee.

The application should be discussed by the principal investigator with his department head during its preparation and subsequently submitted to the review committee before or as soon as possible after submittal to the sponsor.

The committee chairman will study each application, seek clarification and obtain expert advice or consultation as needed, and schedule it for committee consideration. Each application will be discussed carefully and unhurriedly, and the final decision and recommendation will be communicated in detail to the principal investigator. Disapproval of an application may be appealed to a full meeting of both committees and the Vice President and Provost, with the investigator appearing in person with his department head and other expert consultants to support his appeal. The final decision will be by written ballot with the Vice President and Provost voting. Confirming disapproval at this point precludes further appeal.

If the investigator agrees to the committee decision report and this is properly signed, he is free to begin his investigation when funded. If he disagrees, he may request a re-hearing for modification of the conditions of the committee decision. When all is in agreement, the Vice President and Provost will be so notified. The Director of the Office of Sponsored Programs will not authorize an expenditure from sponsor funds until all questions concerning research protocol involving human subjects have been appropriately settled.

Each investigator and each department head in signing the committee decision report affirm their respective pledges: the investigator (1) to follow faithfully the protocol spelled out in his application (with amendments, if any are recommended by the committee), (2) to report promptly any departure from protocol or untoward occurrences to his department head, and (3) to modify or terminate his investigation at the decision of the department head or committee; the department head, (1) to share in the responsibility for the conduct of the investigation, (2) to consult with the review committee regarding any significant departure from protocol or the occurrence of any untoward developments, specifically, permanent disability or death, and (3) to respond to the annual request for reports of work in progress, correcting any deficiencies of supervision as they become obvious. The committee reserves the right to terminate the experiment at any time if by majority vote it decides that the risks of further experimentation are prohibitive. In the event of such an occurrence, the Director of the Office of Sponsored Programs will so notify the sponsoring agency.

The committee shall require the project or program director to report to the committee for review any emergent problems or proposed procedural changes which may affect the status of the research with regard to the committee's review criteria. No such changes except those necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards will be made without prior approval by the committee. The committee shall carry out interim reviews of the conduct of all research projects at appropriate intervals.

The formal records of the committee are as follows:

1. **Minutes of Meetings** - A copy will be furnished to each committee member and the Vice President and Provost. The Minutes will identify each application by title, intended sponsor, identifying number (if shown), project period, and principal investigator(s), with appropriate source and substance of any expert advice made part of the review, and will record any pertinent discussion, tabulated vote, and the final decision on each application. Also, the committee decision reports will be recorded as soon as possible.
2. **Committee Decision Report** - Three copies are to be completed for each application. This form includes the date of the meeting, the number of members present, the title, the identifying number, principal investigator(s), the majority decision, any suggestions concerning possible need for expert advice and consultation or utilization of special professional assistance or facilities, specific recommendations of methods to be used in obtaining informed consent, the requirement that all departures from protocol, untoward developments, etc. be reported to the department head, the request that the department head periodically review this investigation as part of work and progress in his department, and the signatures of the committee chairman, the principal investigator(s) and the department head.
3. **Annual Reports** - The committee will request a statement of satisfactory progress in January from each department head under whom a principal investigator has begun or continued a previously approved investigation during the previous year. These reports are to be kept in the committee files, and a summary will be sent to the Vice President and Provost for his records.

At the University of Virginia Medical Center there are extensive facilities and personnel available to protect the health and safety of human subjects, particularly those who require emergency care. The University of Virginia Medical Center is registered by the American College of Surgeons, the American Medical Association, and the American Hospital Association and is fully accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals. All internships and residencies are approved by the Council on Medical Education and Hospitals of the American Medical Association.

Human subjects who wish to voice complaints or concerns about their involvement in a particular research, training, demonstration or other activity may do so to the committee which first approved the activity. In the event that the human subject is not satisfied, further administrative review is available. Appeal from the review of the Clinical Research Committee is to the Dean of the School of Medicine, then the Vice President and Provost, and finally the President of the University. Appeal from the review of the Human Subjects Committee is to the Vice President and Provost and then the President.

### REVISION AND REENACTMENT OF THE BOARD'S STANDING POLICY ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF ATHLETICS AND THE ADVISORY COUNCIL ON ATHLETICS

That the administration of the Department of Athletics shall be under the supervision of the President and administrative authorities of the University, and that decision on all questions involved in its operation shall, as in other phases of the University's activities, be subject to review and final determination by the Board of Visitors.

### PATENT POLICY FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA

**PATENT POLICY FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA**\
**Administrative Responsibilities**\
**Distribution of Royalties to the Inventor(s)**\
**Inventions and Discoveries which are not the Result of University Research**

The following resolution was adopted: **RESOLVED** by The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the following is adopted as the official policy with respect to the Patent Policy for the University of Virginia:

**Policy**

The policy of the University of Virginia is to consider and, where appropriate, assist in the patenting and commercial development of any discovery or invention which is the product of University research. Any person who may be engaged in University research shall be required to execute a patent agreement with the University in which the rights and obligations of both parties are defined.

This policy is intended to:

1. provide an incentive to creative intellectual effort and the advancement of knowledge for the welfare of mankind;
2. insure that the respective interests of the researcher (as faculty or staff member or student), the University, any supporting sponsor, and society are considered and protected through the development of fair contracts and procedures;
3. assist the researcher and the University to realize tangible benefits from inventions or discoveries; and
4. advance and encourage further research within the University with whatever funds accrue to the University from inventions resulting from University research.

**Definition of University Research and Researcher**

For the purpose of this Patent Policy and any documents developed for its implementation, University research is defined as research and related activities by any person a) which are related in any way to duties or responsibilities for which he has been compensated either by or through the University or b) for which facilities owned, operated, or controlled by the University are used.

Products of research eligible for copyright protection are excluded from this definition.

Modification of this definition of University research may be effected by the terms of a contract between the University and another public or private agency or, in exceptional circumstances, in the patent agreement with an individual University researcher.

A researcher is any person who may be engaged in University research.

1. **Associate Provost for Research**

Responsibility for the administration of the University of Virginia Patent Policy is assigned to the Associate Provost for Research.

The Associate Provost for Research shall

1. develop standards and procedures appropriate for the implementation of this policy;
2. obtain, maintain, and insure compliance with signed patent agreements 1) between the University and each researcher and 2) between the researcher and a sponsor agency as required by the terms of a grant or contract;
3. judge whether an invention or discovery is the product of University research;
4. determine whether an invention or discovery which is the product of University research is patentable;
5. determine whether the University should claim equity in the patenting of an invention or discovery which is the product of University research, or whether all rights should be waived in favor of the inventor. In the latter case, the inventor should be informed in writing by the Associate Provost for Research that the University relinquishes all claims to the invention or discovery;
6. investigate possible courses of action for the patenting and/or marketing of an invention or discovery in which the University has an equity;
7. after soliciting the review and comments of the appropriate academic dean on (3), (4), (5) and (6), investigate and select alternative plans for implementation of the chosen course of action for the patenting and/or marketing of an invention or discovery in which the University has an equity;
8. recommend for the signature of the University Comptroller any formal agreement between the University and an outside agency which may be required in executing the course of action in (7);
9. be responsible, with appropriate support from the Office of Sponsored Programs, for preparing all reports for inventions, discoveries, and patents which are the product of University research;
10. maintain a file for each disclosure which will contain complete records of all actions;
11. prepare an annual report for the University Research Policy Council.

All actions shall be taken and decisions made within a reasonable time so that an inventor's options are not compromised unfairly.

2. **The Office of Sponsored Programs**

In implementing the Patent Policy, the Office of Sponsored Programs shall

1. inform the Office of the Associate Provost for Research and principal investigator of all requirements regarding patents in any grant or contract accepted by the University of Virginia;
2. with the aid of the principal investigator and in conjunction with the Office of the Associate Provost for Research, provide all invention reports and other pertinent information regarding patents as required by the terms of a grant, contract, or agreement.

3) **The University Patent Committee**

A Patent Committee, appointed by the President from recommendations by the University Research Policy Council, will consist of at least five members, including representation from the Schools of Engineering, Arts and Sciences, Medicine, Law and Graduate Business. The University Patent Committee shall

1. review and recommend to the University Research Policy Council for approval the standards and procedures and any amendments thereto developed by the Associate Provost for Research for the implementation of the Patent Policy;
2. when agreement among the parties cannot be reached, serve as a board to which the researcher may appeal decisions of the Associate Provost for Research, subject to appropriate review standards and procedures, and make subsequent recommendations to the University Research Policy Council;
3. consult with the Associate Provost for Research when requested.

4) **The University Research Policy Council**

The University Research Policy Council shall

1. recommend to the President appointments to the University Patent Committee;
2. approve the standards and procedures and any amendment thereto developed by the Associate Provost for Research for the implementation of the Patent Policy;
3. conduct an annual review of the patent program with the Associate Provost for Research;
4. administer the special fund which shall be established for any royalties accruing to the University as a result of the implementation of this policy;
5. where the actions of the Associate Provost for Research are appealed to the University Patent Committee, review the recommendations of the University Patent Committee and instruct the Associate Provost for Research on appropriate subsequent action.

In general, the inventor(s) will receive from any product of University research fifteen percent of the gross royalties which accrue from inventions for which the University obtains and holds patent.

An institutional agreement between the University and an outside patent management firm, such as Research Corporation, or between the University and a Federal agency, such as the National Institutes of Health, will specify a distribution of royalties.

Individual grants or contracts for sponsored University research with public or private agencies may specify an assignment of patent(s) ownership and distribution of royalties of which the researcher shall be informed before research is conducted under such an award or contract.

The University normally will relinquish any claim to an invention or discovery which is judged by the Associate Provost for Research not to be the product of University research. However, in such cases the researcher may request that the invention or discovery be appraised by and, if appropriate, assigned to the University. In such cases, the terms of the agreement will be determined by the inventor and the University.

The Student Affairs and Athletics Committee of the Board heard arguments by Mr. Larry S. Carlisle and his attorney, Mr. Waverly Parker, on April 5, 1973, and received from Mr. Carlisle and Mr. Parker certain documents as exhibits.

Upon the recommendation of the Student Affairs and Athletics Committee, the following resolution was adopted:

**WHEREAS**, The Rector and Visitors, by its resolution of 5 June 1970 concerning student activity fees, established procedures by which persons aggrieved by the approval or disapproval by Student Council of allocations from the Student Activity Fund might prosecute appeals, such resolution indicating that if no appeal was taken from the decision by Student Council approving an allocation then the allocation would be made;\
**AND WHEREAS**, Mr. Christian S. White and others, not including the petitioner Mr. Larry S. Carlisle, on or about 28 November 1972, in accordance with the procedure established by the Rector and Visitors, appealed from a decision by Student Council approving an allocation of funds to the Gay Student Union, but did not appeal other allocations, such allocation to the Gay Student Union being later approved by the Student Activities Committee but thereafter denied by the President and also by the Rector and Visitors in its resolution of 2 February 1973;\

**AND WHEREAS** a majority of Mr. White's colleagues then withdrew from this new attack upon the allocation of funds, Mr. White then being joined by the petitioner, Mr. Carlisle and others, who had participated in the appeal from the allocation of funds to the Gay Student Union; and Mr. White and his new Colleagues then sought to intervene in the inquiry by the Student Activities Committee ordered by the Rector and Visitors in its resolution of 2 February 1973, such intervention being denied by the Chairman of the Committee upon the advice of Counsel;\
