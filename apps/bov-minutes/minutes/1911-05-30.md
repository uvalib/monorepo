Board of Visitors' minutes, Accession # RG-1/1/, Special Collections Dept., University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Va.

Minutes of meetings of the university's governing body which is the legal owner and operator of the institution. Recorded in the minutes are appointments and other personnel decisions concerning faculty, decisions about construction of facilities, gifts to the university, and all other board actions, decisions and resolutions.

At a called meeting of the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia on above date in the Presidents' Office.

Present: The Rector, Visitors White, Shackleford, Harmon, Drewry, and President Alderman,

The Board having been called to order at 10:00 by the Rector, the following was adopted:-

Resolved: That George Boardman Eager, Jr., be elected Adjunct Professor of Law in the Department of Law of the University of Virginia, at a salary of $1,500, his duties to begin on the 12th of September 1911.

Resolved: That President Alderman be empowered to make such arrangements as may be necessary for the other appointments needful for the carrying forward of the University work during the summer months, subject to the ratification of the Board at their fall meeting in October.

Resolved: That the McCormick Scholarship be awarded to Mr. Lant Rader Slaven for the session of 1911-1912.

In pursuance of a resolution of November 18th, 1910, the committee appointed to consider a communication from Mr. R. Hall McCormick, submitted the following report, which was adopted, and ordered spread upon the record,—;

To the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia:

Your Committee, to whom was referred the correspondence with R. Hall McCormick, Esq., Trustee of the Estate of Leander J. McCormick, making certain suggestions as to the proper scope of the work of the Professor of Astronomy and Director of the Leander McCormick Observatory, beg leave to report.

Mr. McCormick, in his letter of June 11, 1911, addressed to the President, summarizes his conclusions as follows:

"First, that the donor of the telescope and observatory made his gifts for the purpose of their being used along lines of scientific astronomical research, which is the only lines along which they can be used.

"Second, that it was the intention of the Alumni who made the endowment to provide the observatory with a trained astronomer, all of whose time should be devoted to the use of the telescope."

An analysis of these conclusions leads to the result that as the whole time of the professor should be devoted to the use of the telescope and the telescope should be used only along lines of scientific astronomical research, the whole time of the professor should be devoted to research work. This would exclude not only all teaching in Theoretical Astronomy, but also a part of the teaching in practical astronomy.

The memorial presented to the Rector and Visitors by the Society of Alumni on June 29, 1881, turning over the funds collected for the endowment of the Professorship and Working Fund of the Leander McCormick Observatory, contains the following: "Another condition is imposed upon the gift in accordance with the earnest desire of Mr. McCormick to promote active astronomical work by his foundation, and that is that the Directors of the Observatory, (Professor of Astronomy) shall have no teaching to do except in practical or theoretical astronomy."

The action of the Board of Visitors is shown by the following resolution adopted by them at a meeting held March 30, 1881:

"That a new `School' shall be established at the University to be known as `The School of Astronomy,' which shall be opened as soon as the buildings shall be in a suitable state. The salary of the Professor shall be the same as those of other \`Schools' and he shall teach theoretical and practical astronomy and no other subject. He shall be Director of the McCormick Observatory, and shall devote his time, when not occupied with instruction of classes, to astronomical investigations and practical use of the observatory for systematic exploration and work."

It thus appears that the work of teaching is the primary duty of the Professor, and he is to devote his time to astronomical investigation only when not occupied with instruction of classes. The University is primarily an educational institution and this is recognized by Mr. McCormick in his letter of June 5, 1882, acknowledging notification of the election of his nominee, Professor Stone. We quote as follows:

"And I feel confident that with Professor Stone in the Chair of Astronomy and in charge of the Observatory, the educational interests of the State will be greatly advanced."

The present scheme has been worked out as the result of the best thought and most zealous care of those in charge; it is believed to conform in letter and spirit to the conditions imposed by the generous donors.

As a matter of fact, research work of great importance has been engaged in continuously, as is illustrated by a memorandum attached, showing work done in the last few years.

We wish again to put on record the resolution of the Board of Visitors at its meeting of June 26, 1884, which expresses the sentiment which always has and always will control the management of the University's endowments.

"Resolved: That the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia take pleasure in giving assurance to Leander J. McCormick, Esq., the munificent benefactor of the university, that the liberal fund he has donated to the University has been, and will continue to be regarded as a sacred fund, never to be diverted in any manner from the original purposes contemplated by the generous donor."

I beg to submit to you the following reports from the Faculty of the Department of Graduate Studies of the University of Virginia and the Faculty of the College of the University of Virginia, the two comprising the Academic Department of the Institution. I submit these reports with my entire approval and endorsement. They are the result of patient study of specially appointed committees of these faculties extending over a period of two years. They have been carefully considered and discussed by the Faculties themselves in utmost detail. In some cases they have been held up for months with a view of obtaining the best information on all subjects connected with the curriculum and the methods of teaching in modern colleges. They have passed the Facilties of the Department of Graduate Studies and of the College with practical unanimity. The report of the Faculty of the Graduate Department is unanimous, and the report from the Faculty of the College comes to you with only one dissenting vote. The fundamental purpose in these proposed modifications is to increase the power, to elevate the standards, and to place on a surer pedagogic basis all instruction given at the University of Virginia.

The reasons for the action of the Faculty of the College are set forth in detail, and demonstrates, I believe, that if the modification be adopted the work of the College in amount, in intensive value, and in proper adjustment to teaching and private study, will be immensely advanced. In the case of the Graduate School, the highest standards of this School are maintained, and yet arrangement is made by which the Graduate School of the University of Virginia can bear that relation to the colleges of this State and nation that graduate schools should bear in their very nature to the educational forms just below them. The reasons influencing the Faculty of the Department of Graduate Studies are also set forth in detail. It is my hope that it will be within your wisdom to ratify these actions of the two faculties.
