A resolution adopted by the Board on July 6, 1942, concerning use of motor vehicles by first-year students, was discussed and reinstated, with modifications, as follows:

**RESOLVED** that no first-year students in the College, Engineering, or Education departments shall, while the University is in session, maintain or operate a motor vehicle in the University, the City of Charlottesville, or the County of Albemarle, without the written consent of the Associate Dean of the Lower Division.

Mr. W. Allan Perkins, Attorney for the University, made the following statement to the Board.

In settlement of the Estate of the late Dr. Walter M. Seward, the University became the owner of Lots 10, 11, 12 and 13 fronting 40 feet each on the south side of James Avenue and Lots 21, 22, 23 and 24 fronting 40 feet each on the north side of Highland Avenue, all of which are located in the subdivision known as Highland Park, in the Town of Colonial Heights, Virginia, just outside of Petersburg.

On Thursday, July 18, 1935, Mr. E. I. Carruthers and I went to Petersburg and with the help of Mr. M. H. Guthrie, a real estate agent in Petersburg, we inspected and appraised these lots as being worth from $1,600 to $2,400. Again on October 29, 1946, I had an estimate of the value of these lots made by Mr. E. V. Moore of the C. F. Faison Realty Company, who then estimated the value of Lots 10, 11, 12 and 13 at $250.00 each and Lots 20, 21, 22 and 23 at $300.00 each - a total of $2,200.00.

On August 7, 1948, we had an offer from a Mr. Herbert R. Crowder to purchase these eight lots at $1,800.00, which I declined to submit to the Board.

On April 20, 1950, Churchill Gibson Dunn, of Petersburg, who has worked with me in representing the University in the settlement of other matters connected with Dr. Seward's estate, submitted an offer from a client of his of $1,500.00.

On May 5, 1950, Louis C. Shell offered $1,900.00 for the eight lots.

And on May 8, 1950, I received a letter from Faison Realty Company offering $2,200.00 for the lots, less a commission of $200.00 to be paid to them for making the sale, or a net of $2,000.00 to the University, this offer having been made by N. B. White. I think this is an entirely reasonable offer and recommend its acceptance.

It was, thereupon

**RESOLVED** that the offer of N. B. White, made through C. F. Faison Realty Company of Petersburg, to purchase Lots 10, 11, 12 and 13, 20, 21, 22 and 23 in the subdivision of Highland Park in the Town of Colonial Heights, Virginia, at the price of $2,200.00, of which $200.00 is to be paid as commission to C. F. Faison Realty Company, making a net price of $2,000.00 to the University, be and is hereby accepted, and Colgate W. Darden, Jr., President is hereby authorized and directed to execute a deed conveying said property, with special warranty of title, to said N. B. White, and Vincent Shea, Secretary of this Board, is hereby instructed to affix the corporate seal thereto and to deliver said deed to the purchaser upon payment of the purchase price in full.

Mr. Perkins, Attorney for the University, made the following statement to the Board.

Mr. Perkins stated that as Attorney for the University he had received the following offers from Mr. Albert H. Case and Mrs. Sarah A. Case, his wife, formerly of Tampa, Florida, and now of Charlottesville.

(1) To purchase the property owned by the University and situated on Rugby Road, known as "Four Acres," at the price of $40,000.00 cash. This is the same property which the University purchased from Mrs. Lillian P. Edwards, August 20, 1947, at the price of $40,000.00 cash.

(2) That Mr. and Mrs. Case would like to make a gift to the University of $60,000.00 in cash provided the University will agree to pay to them jointly during their joint lives and to the survivor so long as he or she shall live an annuity of five percentum per annum upon said $60,000.00.

It is proper to add that Mr. Case is now 75 years of age and Mrs. Case is 76 years of age.

I am of the opinion that the University has the legal right to sell the property known as "Four Acres." I am also of the opinion that probably under the general powers of the University to execute any trusts in which it has an interest, which powers are vested in it by Sec. 23-69 of the Code of 1950, it has full authority to accept this gift and pay the annuity, but in view of the provisions of an Act of the General Assembly, approved March 16, 1916, (see Acts of 1916, pp. 491-492) there can be no shadow of doubt as to this right.

I have discussed these two offers with President Darden and understand that he has also discussed them with members of the Executive Committee of this Board and that the consensus of opinion is that both offers should be accepted.

The written consent to and approval of the acceptance of this gift by the University (required by Section 22 of the Appropriation Act of April 8, 1948 -(see Acts of 1948, p. 1318) has been given by Governor John S. Battle, with the understanding that the interest installments agreed to be paid Albert H. Case and Sarah A. Case, his wife, will not be paid from or constitute a charge upon State appropriations, and the original signed copy of this consent is attached to this report.

I submit herewith such form of a deed and of a contract as I think should be executed by Mr. and Mrs. Case and on behalf of the University to the end that the contemplated conveyance may be made and the trust created and administered.

After discussion of the foregoing report the following resolution was proposed by Mr. Mears, seconded by Mr. Gravatt, and unanimously adopted:

(1) **RESOLVED** that the offer of Albert H. Case and Sarah A. Case, his wife, to purchase the property owned by the University, situated in the City of Charlottesville, Virginia, on Rugby Road, and known as "Four Acres," at the price $40,000 cash be and is hereby accepted. And Colgate W. Darden, Jr., President, is hereby authorized and instructed to execute a deed in the name and on behalf of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia conveying said property to said Albert H. Case and Sarah A. Case, his wife, and Vincent Shea, Secretary of this Board, is hereby instructed to affix the corporate seal to said deed, attest the same and deliver said deed to Mr. and Mrs. Case upon payment by them to him as Bursar of the University of the sum of $40,000.00 in cash.

(2) And be it further

**RESOLVED** that the offer of said Albert H. Case and Sarah A. Case, his wife, to give the University the sum of Sixty Thousand Dollars ($60,000.00) in cash, provided the University will agree to pay to them jointly during their joint lives and to the survivor so long as he or she shall live, an annuity of five per centum per annum upon said $60,000.00, be and is hereby accepted; the contract presented to this Board by Mr. Perkins setting out the terms and conditions of said gift is hereby approved and Colgate W. Darden, Jr., President, is hereby authorized and instructed to execute said contract in the name and on behalf of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, and Vincent Shea, Secretary, is hereby instructed to affix the corporate seal thereto, attest the same, and deliver said contract to the said Albert H. Case and Sarah A. Case, his wife, upon payment to him, as Bursar of the University, by said Albert H. Case and Sarah A. Case, of the sum of $60,000.00 in cash.

The Board approved payment to Mr. William Stevens of a commission of $1,000 on the sale of "Four Acres."

A progress report from Mr. Garnett was received and the Secretary was requested to file it.

Mr. Perkins, Attorney for the University, reported that the personal property of the Kaprielian estate had been sold at auction, yielding $1,474. The original appraisal was $1,500.

The Board approved a proposal by the International Affairs Association of the Woodrow Wilson School of Foreign Affairs that it be authorized to designate an honor student in the School of Foreign Affairs to live in the Woodrow Wilson room at 31 West Range, subject to the regulations governing such rooms.

The Board approved a proposal by the Zeta Chapter of Kappa Sigma that it be authorized to continue to designate one of its members to occupy the room at 46 East Lawn, where the Kappa Sigma Chapter at the University of Virginia was founded in 1869, such occupancy to be subject, of course, to the regulations governing such rooms.

Mr. Gay stated that the Finance Committee had discussed the possibility of selling some of our common stocks on the present high market and purchasing either government bonds or AAA industrial or utility bonds, because the Committee believed that there would probably be a decline before long in the stock market and we could then go back into the market and buy stocks at a lower price.

It was the sense of the Board that the Finance Committee should request the State-Planters Bank to study our common stock holdings in the light of the present market and, if it deemed advisable, to recommend appropriate action to the Finance Committee.

The working drawings for the Addition to the Medical Building were approved. The President was authorized to advertise for bids.

Preliminary plans for the Student Union were approved.

Working drawings for the Women's Dormitory were approved and the President was authorized to advertise for bids on this project.

Upon recommendation of Dr. Combs, the following resignations and election were approved.

Dr. Matila Ghyka, Professor of Art of the East, who is completing his third year at Mary Washington, has resigned to accept a position in Dublin, Ireland, so as to enable him to be with his family who are in Europe.

Dr. H. Logan Cobb, Assistant Professor of Spanish, who has been on the faculty for three years, resigned to accept an associate professorship in the department of modern languages and literature at the James Millikin University, Decatur, Illinois.

Miss Tannye Burnett, Instructor in Physical Education, who is completing her second year at the college, has submitted her resignation because she wishes to pursue additional graduate work.

Mr. Levin James Houston, III, elected Assistant Professor in Piano at a salary of $3,420 for the session of nine months, incumbency to begin September 18, 1950.

The following resolution was adopted.

**RESOLVED** that the expenditure of Mary Washington College funds for providing furniture for the public rooms at "Brompton," heretofore made in the amount of $3,500, be and the same is hereby approved.

Dr. Combs made the following statement to the Board.

Mr. K. D. Scott, of James A. Scott and Sons of Lynchburg, has contacted the college relative to furnishing the parents of students with an accident policy on a group basis.

The proposed plan is to be presented to the parents of the students in the envelope with the statement of college expenses for the fall semester together with a proposed letter to be signed by a college official.

When this plan was first presented to us, it was our feeling that such procedure would be in violation of State policy, if not State law. However, Mr. Scott presented the matter to the Attorney General through his representative, Honorable Mosby G. Perrow, Jr., of Lynchburg. (A copy of the proposed letter to the parents was shown to members of the Board, together with Mr. Perrow's letter to the Attorney General and his reply.)

In view of the letter from the Attorney General, it appears that such practice would be permissible, and it is recommended that the proposed insurance plan be available to the parents of the students in the manner prescribed above.

The following resolution was adopted.

**BE IT RESOLVED** that the accident insurance policy proposed by James A. Scott and Sons, as described above, be made available to parents of students, on a voluntary basis.

Dr. Combs stated that the State Highway Department had requested the college to deed to them certain properties bordering on the alternate Highway No. 1 from the No. 3 highway over-pass extending to Hazel Run, in order that the highway may be widened at this point in this section to permit the construction of what is termed a limited access highway.

The matter was referred to Dr. Combs with power to act.

A report on the distribution of academic grades was received and the Secretary was requested to file it.

The Mary Washington Committee met in the office of President Combs on Thursday night, May 11, 1950. Committee members present were Mrs. Wailes, Mrs. Willis, and Judge Garnett.

A number of faculty members of Mary Washington College wished to appear to protest a charge of alleged intimidation of the faculty by the president. The Committee conveyed to Dr. Clifton B. McIntosh through Dean Alvey its willingness to hear him also on this matter if he wished to come. He replied in the affirmative. Judge Garnett was asked to take charge of the hearing and he requested Mr. E. E. Woodward to take notes for a record of proceedings.

Dr. McIntosh reiterated the statement which he had made by letter of April 13th to the Rector, viz., "At the last meeting of the Faculty of Mary Washington College of the University of Virginia President Combs informed that faculty that any member of the faculty who went to the Board of Visitors with complaints would never receive an increase in salary or a promotion as long as he had anything to do with it.

I wish to object most strongly to this kind of intimidation and threat of reprisal in the

"May I request that you present this matter to the Board of Visitors in order that they may take whatever action they may deem advisable."

On request, Dr. McIntosh suggested names of colleagues who in his opinion would give an accurate account of statements made at the faculty meeting in question. Forty-seven were so listed. Dean Alvey was asked to get in touch with as many as possible. Some were present in the building as members of the original group requesting the hearing.

The Committee interviewed between forty and fifty faculty and staff members concerning this matter. The question was asked whether Dr. Combs used the language attributed to him in the above letter of April 13th, or whether any language was used by the President from which an inference might be made that the President was endeavoring to intimidate or threaten any faculty member who went to the Board of Visitors with complaints. Of the forty-six members who were given the opportunity to express themselves either singly or in a group, all except two stated that the language used by Dr. Combs was not interpreted by them as a threat or intimidation either overt or implied. Two of the members interviewed stated that in their opinion the language used might have been construed to constitute a threat.

The Committee, therefore, recommends that the charge or charges be dismissed.

The Board approved the report of the Committee in the above matter, dismissing the charges made by Professor McIntosh, as recommended by the Committee.

Since the $500,000 appropriation for new dormitories made by the 1950 Legislature was a conditional one only, Dr. Combs brought up the possibility of a loan under the Housing Act of 1950 for the purpose of providing facilities to house 500 students. The Mary Washington Committee reiterated the very great need for additional dormitory space in order to relieve existing congestion in the present dormitories and to provide quarters for students now housed off campus. The Committee, therefore, recommended to the Board that the matter of determining the best method of financing dormitory construction be referred to the Finance Committee for immediate consideration.

A resolution to carry out the recommendations of the Mary Washington Committee concerning possible financing of new dormitories was adopted.

A resolution was adopted authorizing the college to pay $2,000 per year to Oak Hill Stables to partially defray the cost of transporting students between the college and the stables.

On motion the meeting was then adjourned.
