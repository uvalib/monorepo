President Shannon informed the Board that the Governor had approved a new faculty salary scale which became effective in September 1959. The new salary scale, which was ordered to be spread on the minutes, is as follows

Special Approval

President Shannon announced to the Board the death of Mr. James Hart, Professor of Political Science, on 14 September 1959, after a brief illness. Mr. Hart had served on the faculty since 1936.

There were expressions of the affection and esteem in which Mr. Hart was held, and the Secretary was directed to record in the permanent minutes the deep sense of loss felt by the Board and the gratitude of the Visitors for his devoted and valuable services to the University.

President Shannon stated that, as directed by the Board at its meeting on 13 June 1959, he had assumed the duties of President of the University of Virginia on 22 August 1959.

President Shannon presented the University's biennial budget request for 1960-1962 that had been presented to the Governor and the General Assembly. He pointed out that the request had received the prior approval of the Finance Committee and now requested that the Board give its approval. In addition, he informed the Board as to the meetings that had been held with the Governor's Advisory Board on the Budget and the State Council of Higher Education.

The Board adopted the following resolution:

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the University's biennial budget request for 1960-1962, which has heretofore been reviewed by and received the approval of the Finance Committee, is hereby approved.

President Shannon asserted that the requirements of the U. S. Department of Defense required action of the Board in designating by name the President and the Comptroller as the only two officers of the University empowered to sign Department of Defense contracts. In view of his assumption of office, the President stated that it was now necessary to pass a new resolution inserting his name in place of the name of former President Colgate W. Darden, Jr.

The following resolution was adopted by the Board

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that President Edgar Finley Shannon, Jr. and Comptroller Vincent Shea be and they are hereby specifically designated as the only University officers having the authority and responsibility for the negotiation, execution, and administration of Department of Defense contracts.

The Rector announced that the Executive Committee had acted on two matters in the interim since the meeting of the Board on 13 June 1959. The actions taken were an increase in the salary of Mr. C. Venable Minor, Special Counsel of the Board, and approval of certain expenditures for the renovation of the President's House on Carr's Hill. He asked that these two actions of the Executive Committee be approved.

The following resolution was adopted by the Board

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the actions of the Executive Committee (1) under the date of 11 July 1959 establishing the salary of Mr. C. Venable Minor, Special Counsel of the Board, at the annual rate of $4,200, effective 1 January 1959, and (2) under the date of 25 August 1959 authorizing the proper officers of the University to proceed immediately (a) to make needed alterations in the President's House on Carr's Hill at a cost not exceeding $35,000, and (b) to purchase for the President's House such furniture and furnishings as may be needed and specified by the President at a cost not exceeding $7,000, are hereby approved.

President Shannon recalled to the attention of the Board the action taken on 14 June 1958 approving the establishment of the "Alderman Library Life Histories Documentation Fund of the University of Virginia." Under the terms of this Trust, the fund was to be administered by a committee composed of the Librarian of the University and two other persons nominated by him and appointed annually by the Board of Visitors. In a letter dated 10 July 1959, Librarian John Cook Wyllie had nominated Miss Louise Savage and Mr. E. S. C. Handy to serve with him on the committee. The President recommended the approval of the Librarian's recommendation.

The Board adopted the following resolution

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the action of the Librarian of the University, Mr. John Cook Wyllie, in nominating Miss Louise Savage and Mr. E. S. C. Handy to serve with him as a committee to administer the Trust entitled the "Alderman Library Life Histories Documentation Fund of the University of Virginia" and to continue as committee members on an annual appointment basis, as provided in the Indenture set forth in the Minutes of the Board of 14 June 1958, is hereby approved.

The President stated that former President Colgate W. Darden, Jr., in a letter to the Rector, Mr. Frank Talbott, Jr., dated 19 August 1959, had proposed the establishment of the Edward R. Stettinius Memorial Chair of Foreign Affairs which was to be supported by certain funds that were to become available. President Shannon announced that he was in thorough accord with Mr. Darden's proposal and recommended its adoption by the Board.

The following resolution was adopted

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the Edward R. Stettinius Chair of Foreign Affairs is hereby established in the Woodrow Wilson Department of Foreign Affairs.

President Shannon summarized the contents of a letter addressed to Mr. Vincent Shea, Comptroller, dated 26 June 1959, in which Dr. Andrew D. Hart, Director of the Department of Student Health, had recommended the abandonment of the practice of total or partial refund of student medical fees to students who withdraw at varying periods following registration. In his letter, Dr. Hart stated that the students who withdrew had received the full value of the medical fee, because of certain health examinations and other services that were provided for them, and that, in his view, the refund of any part of the fee was an unsound practice. The President also noted that this proposal had received the approval of the Comptroller in a letter dated 2 July 1959. He proposed that Dr. Hart's recommendation be approved.

The Board adopted the following resolution

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that in the future neither all nor any part of the student medical fee shall be refunded.

President Shannon reported that Board action was required because of the University's position as a legatee of the late Hugh E. Vincent of New Orleans, Louisiana. The proposed action, which was incorporated in a resolution which President Shannon presented, had received the prior approval of Judge Wayne Borah, the University's representative in the matter, and Mr. C. Venable Minor, Special Counsel of the Board.

The Board adopted the following resolution

RESOLVED that The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, a body corporate, as a universal legatee of the late Hugh E. Vincent, acknowledges that in the sale to Biloxi Marsh Lands Corporation by Hugh E. Vincent by act before Felix J. Dreyfous, notary, on February 18, 1936, registered in St. Bernard Parish conveyance book 41 folio 90, there were included, among other things, either by specific description or under the omnibus provisions thereof, all of the rights, title, and interests of the vendor in and with respect to that certain property in St. Bernard Parish, La., fully described in the petition filed July 23, 1959, by Biloxi Marsh Lands Corporation in proceedings no. 6938 in the 25th Judicial District Court for the Parish of St. Bernard, La., entitled "Biloxi Marsh Lands Corporation v. Mrs. Mildred Saffold Vincent et al", and as alleged therein and that Edgar F. Shannon, Jr., the President of this board, be and he is hereby authorized to sign and execute, on behalf of this corporation, such instruments and documents as he deems necessary for this purpose.

The President stated that the full amount of the tuition increases authorized by the Board at its meeting on 13 June 1959 was not needed because the new salary plan as finally approved by the Governor did not require for its implementation the total revenue which would have been realized. He reminded the Board that the increase had been set at $50 per year for Virginia students and $100 per year for out-of-state students, except for students in the Graduate School of Business Administration and out-of-state students in the School of Law. President Shannon further asserted that he had authorized a decrease in the tuition charges to $40 per year for Virginia students and $80 per year for out-of-state students. This action became necessary because the Board in its resolution of 13 June 1959 had directed that the entire amount of the additional revenue accruing from the tuition raise be used exclusively for financing the increase in faculty salaries. He recommended that the tuition rates as reduced be approved.

The following resolution was adopted

WHEREAS, the amount of revenue accruing from the tuition increase authorized by the Board at its meeting on 13 June 1959 would have produced more revenue than was needed for the support of the faculty salary plan as finally approved by the Governor,

Now therefore be it resolved by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the action of President Edgar F. Shannon, Jr. in reducing the tuition increases to $40 per year for Virginia students and $80 per year for out-of-state students, except for students in the Graduate School of Business Administration and out-of-state students in the School of Law, is hereby approved.

One of the final actions of former President Colgate W. Darden, Jr., the President pointed out, was the appointment of a committee of the faculty to design an official academic costume for the Rector. In order that the Rector's academic costume, as designed by the committee might be officially prescribed, President Shannon recommended action by the Board to accomplish this end.

The Board adopted the following resolution

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the academic costume of the Rector shall be as herein described: The bonnet shall be of navy blue faille with soft crown and stiff oval brim measuring approximately fifteen inches from front to rear. The gown shall be of navy blue faille cut full in regular doctoral gown pattern with a yoke of the same material, the bell sleeves shall be of orange velvet and the front trim shall also be of orange velvet in five-inch width bands extending from the base of the front yoke down to the hem of the gown.

Mr. Fenwick, Chairman of the Athletics Committee, laid before the Board, copies of "Intercollegiate Athletics Report of Receipts and Disbursements for the Period July 1, 1958 to June 30, 1959." Summarizing the contents of the Report, Mr. Fenwick invited inspection by the Visitors and requested the Secretary to submit the Report in triplicate to the Director of the Budget and to hold one copy in the files of the Board.

The Rector presented for consideration the proposed 50-year lease between the YMCA and the University covering Madison Hall, owned by the YMCA, which was discussed at the 13 June 1959 meeting of the Board. A detailed report with respect to the suggested lease, dated 23 September 1959, prepared by Mr. Vincent Shea, Comptroller, had been sent to all the members. A further discussion was had particularly with respect to the acceleration clause, based upon the consumer price index desired by the YMCA, as set forth fully in the Comptroller's report. That report points out that changes had been made in the lease first discussed in that the lease now contains a provision giving to the University the privilege of cancelling the lease upon the expiration of any five-year rental period by giving 90 days' written notice to the YMCA. While this provision may not furnish full protection to the University in the contemplated expenditure of considerable sums in the repairing of Madison Hall, it was further noted that the YMCA Board spends all of its funds on a program for the students of the University, so that whatever rental is paid to the YMCA will be used in the interests of this institution.

The following resolution was adopted

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the President and the Secretary be and they are hereby authorized to execute and deliver, on behalf of the University, a lease with the YMCA Board for Madison Hall in the form prepared by Mr. Hardy Dillard of the Law Faculty, and approved by counsel for the University.

As a mark of appreciation for the long service to the University of Professor Emeritus Wilson Gee, President Shannon reported that former President Colgate W. Darden, Jr. on 13 August 1959 had changed the name of the Institute for Research in the Social Sciences to the Wilson Gee Institute for Research in the Social Sciences.

Mr. Coxe, Chairman of the Buildings and Grounds Committee, reported that Professor Gordon Whyburn of the Department of Mathematics had accepted the Committee's offer of Pavilion III as a residence.

The customary resolution for the charging off of certain uncollectible accounts at the University Hospital was submitted by President Shannon. A discussion ensued as to the uncollectible hospital accounts with special emphasis on debts. It was decided that the Comptroller and the Hospital Director be requested to prepare and present to the Board at its meeting on 12 December 1959 a complete report on the problem of bad debts at the Hospital.

Following this discussion, the following resolution was adopted by the Board

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the Hospital Accounts Committee be and it is hereby authorized to charge off as uncollectible accounts Schedules 852, 855, 856, 858, 861, 862, 865, 868, 869, 871, 872, 875, and 876, aggregating $171,267.38 as recommended by it, consisting of the following

President Shannon read to the Board a letter he had received from Mrs. C. James Andrews, Chairman of the Restoration Committee of the Garden Club of Virginia under date of 24 September 1959, in which the Committee stated its interest in cooperating with the University in the restoration of the East Lawn gardens. He stated that arrangements were being made for a meeting of the Restoration Committee of the Garden Club of Virginia with the University Committee on the Restoration of East Lawn Gardens and that such a meeting would probably be held before the next meeting of the Board in December. Accordingly, he asked that the Board authorize him to enter into negotiations with the Garden Club of Virginia for the restoration.

The Board adopted the following resolution

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that President Edgar F. Shannon, Jr. be and he is hereby authorized to enter into negotiations with the Garden Club of Virginia for the restoration of the East Lawn gardens.

President Shannon reported briefly on the status of the construction of the Life Science Building. He asserted that detailed working plans were now being prepared. He also displayed to the Board an architectural design of the building and reported on certain changes that were being proposed by the Art Commission. These changes related to certain outside rearrangements but no fundamental alterations were being requested.

The President reported that, as of 22 August 1959, he had appointed Mr. Weldon Cooper on a part-time basis as Assistant to the President.

President Shannon stated that prior to the construction of the present building operated as the Children's Rehabilitation Center, the property was subject to an easement for road purposes 18â² in width for the benefit of lands lying to the West thereof, that at the time such construction was in process an oral understanding had been entered into between the interested parties shifting such easement so that it ran along the western boundary of the property instead of across the middle thereof and increasing its width from 18â² to 27â², that it was now deemed desirable to express such understanding in the terms of a formal grant. In this connection the President submitted to the Board for consideration draft of a proposed deed of easement, which had been approved by the University Special Counsel, whereby, in consideration of the extinguishment of the existing 18â² easement over said land, the University granted as appurtenant to the lands lying to the west thereof, a new easement 27â² in width running along the westerly boundary of the University's land.

After consideration, upon motion duly made, seconded, and carried, the following resolution was adopted

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the Board deeming such action beneficial to the property of the University, that the President be and he is hereby authorized, empowered, and directed to execute on behalf of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, the deed of easement as submitted to this meeting and that the Secretary be and he is hereby authorized, empowered, and directed to affix its corporate seal thereto and to attest the same, and to deliver said deed of easement to the grantees named therein.

President Shannon stated that the changes authorized by the Board for the North approach to the Rotunda had been completed and invited the Board members to inspect the site personally if possible. He also reported that former President Colgate W. Darden, Jr. had expressed his delight on seeing the completed project at the time of the Inauguration on the previous day.

The Board adopted the following resolution

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the following persons be and they are hereby elected to the faculty of Mary Washington College

Chancellor Simpson stated that former President Colgate W. Darden, Jr., had indicated an interest in establishing an annual award for the outstanding academic student at Mary Washington College. Mr. Darden, the Chancellor reported, had given permission for the award to bear his name. In addition to the monetary award, estimated to be no less than $100 annually, the student would also be presented with a medallion to be paid for by the College. The Chancellor reported that a design for the medallion would be presented for review by the Board if the award was approved.

After expressions of gratification for the generosity of Mr. Darden, the Board adopted the following resolution

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the Chancellor of Mary Washington College be and he is hereby authorized to negotiate with former President Colgate W. Darden, Jr. for the establishment of the Colgate W. Darden, Jr. Award, and to prepare a design for a medallion to be presented for approval.

Mr. Greear, Chairman of the Mary Washington College Committee, reported on behalf of the Committee that the new dormitory which had been completed should now be named. During its discussions, the Committee considered the question as to whether buildings either at Charlottesville or elsewhere should be named after living persons. It was brought out in the discussion that the custom at the University had been for no buildings to be named for living persons, but that one building at Mary Washington College had been named for a person who was living at the time and is still living.

After considerable discussion, the Board decided to defer the matter of naming the new dormitory until a later date.

The Chairman of the Mary Washington College Committee, Mr. Greear, stated that the College had received a letter dated 1 October 1959, from Mr. William J. Gibson, of the firm of Coleman and Gibson in Fredericksburg, emphasizing the embarrassment that had been caused by the failure of the College to fulfill its commitments to the Natural Gas Service Company for the partial conversion from coal to gas for heating purposes as authorized by the Board of Visitors at its meeting on 13 December 1958. Mr. Gibson pointed out that the College had been counted on as the principal single customer of the gas company, that the project was approved by the State Corporation Commission on the strength of a letter from the College dated 17 December 1958, reporting the Board's actions, and that the College's participation had been a primary factor in obtaining the financing of the project by a New York banking firm. Mr. Greear asserted that the contract for the conversion had not been entered into because of a ruling by the Director of the Budget that the project was of such a magnitude that it required the prior approval of the Governor.

After considerable discussion of both the specific problem at Mary Washington College and the relationships between the State Budget Office and the Board of Visitors in the government of the University, the Board adopted the following resolution

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the Rector is hereby directed to appoint a special committee of the Board to confer with the Governor concerning the relationships between the State Budget Office and the Board of Visitors in the government of the University, including the appropriate functions of the Budget Office and the Board respectively with regard to the proposed contract with the Natural Gas Service Company.

President Shannon read a letter from Mrs. Morgan Combs, addressed to former President Colgate W. Darden, Jr. under the date of 18 July 1959, expressing her gratification for the naming of the new science building at Mary Washington College as the Morgan Combs Science Hall and asking Mr. Darden to express her deep appreciation to the Board.

President Shannon stated that the U. S. Housing and Home Finance Agency prior to its approval of the faculty housing bonds for Clinch Valley College required that certain parietal rules be established applicable to faculty housing. He submitted a resolution concerning this matter, which had been approved by Mr. C. Venable Minor, and recommended its adoption.

The Board adopted the following resolution
