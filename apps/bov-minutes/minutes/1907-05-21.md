Resolved, that whereas John B. Moon has for the past ten years acted as general counsel for the University of Virginia in such matters as have been referred to him by the Board of Visitors, but his duties and compensation have not been fixed beyond an annual retaining fee paid for general advice, and it is deemed now desirable in view of the increased business and endowments of the University to specify his duties more particularly, and fix his annual compensation for all services rendered, so that he may give regular attention without specific instructions from the Board to all matters of business in which his services may be needed. Therefore, be it Resolved, that the Rector, acting by and with the approval of the Finance Committee, be authorized and empowered to make arrangements as above stated with the said Moon in regard to his duties as general counsel for this Board, and fix his annual compensation as such counsel, the same to be in full of all his services as such counsel.

A resolution adopted by the Academic Faculty, May 7th, 1907, and transmitted in letter of Dean Page, was approved by the Board, and is recorded as follows,-

"Resolved: It is recommended that Mr. J. Thompson Brown be permitted to substitute the M. A. Course in Anglo-Saxon for the second year of Graduate work in German in his program as candidate for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy."

The petition of the "Colonnade Club" conveyed to the Board, through letter of their President, Dr Thomas Walker Page, was granted. The letter follows,-

At a recent meeting the Board of Governors of the Colonnade Club of the University adopted a resolution requesting the President of the Club to petition the Board of Visitors for a reduction in the rent of Pavilion VII., West Lawn. The rent as fixed by the Board at their last meeting is $150.00, and we now beg the Board to consider reducing this to the nominal rental of $50.00.

The ground on which this request is made is, that the members of the Club do not see a way to make the revenues of the Club at present in sight, meet the necessary annual expenditures. The difficulties experienced in launching the Club and getting it on a sound financial basis are very great. It is hoped that in the future these difficulties will disappear, and the Club will be in a position to pay the full rent of the building they occupy. The prime purpose of the organization is to serve the University, and that it can render useful service in many directions is very obvious. Not a few, however, that are eligible for membership are deterred from joining by the unfavorable financial outlook for the Club, and unless its memoership is large and representative of all classes and grades of our Faculty, and Alumni, its usefulness will be greatly diminished.

The Board of Governors hope that the Visitors will give favorable consideration to their petition, and that, in view of the unselfish spirit in which it is made, they will pardon this additional request for aid.

The claim of Messrs. Fuller and Pitcher against the University was referred to the Executive Committee.

Resolved: that Adjunct Professor, L. G. Hoxton, be placed in charge of the School of Physics for session 1907-'08.

Resolved: That section 95 of Chapter 2 of the Laws of the University of Virginia be amended so as to read as follows. "All Instructors and Assistants in the University of Virginia shall be placed upon a definite salary basis, which shall not of necessity include free dormitory rent and free tuition. All Fellows and Instructors in the University, as far as compatible with their teaching duties, shall devote themselves to advanced studies of their several departments under the direction of the professors of the departments."

Resolved: That the petition of the Literary Societies for an appropriation of Fifty Dollars ($50.00) for a "Board of Visitors' Debater's Medal" be, and the same is hereby granted.

Resolved: That the petition of the Kappa Sigma Fraternity be referred to a special committee, consisting of Visitors Craddock and Flood.

On motion, the Board adjourned.
