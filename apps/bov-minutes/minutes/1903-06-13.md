The Board was called to order by the Rector, and the following resolutions were adopted.

**Resolvedâ€”;**

1. That the Training School for Nurses in connection with the University of Virginia Hospital which has been in operation for the last two years is hereby officially recognized by the Visitors.

2. That its management is continued under the direction of the Medical Faculty, which is charged with the duty of providing for the instruction to be given in a course of two or more years.

3. That the Medical Faculty is authorized to confer upon nurses who have satisfactorily completed the prescribed course certificates of graduation as trained nurses.

4. That these certificates are authorized for the candidates now completing their course.

5. That the names of those receiving the certificates in question are to be printed on a separate page of the commencement programme.

**Resolved-**

That the Faculty be authorized to admit anyone who has heretofore graduated in medicine at this University, who so desires, to candidacy for a new degree in Medicine upon presentation of satisfactory evidence that time equivalent to the difference between that at present represented by the degree in question and that represented by the degree at the time of graduation has been spent either as a bona fide student in a medical school of good reputation, or in a recognized hospital, or as an instructor in a reputable medical school; or partly in one and partly in another of these methods; and that to any candidate so qualified who passes satisfactory examination in all of the professional subjects added to the course since his graduation the Faculty may grant a diploma in Medicine of current date, in which the facts in this case are stated.

2. That the action embraced in the above be printed in the catalogue.

The Board having read a communication from James B. Sener, touching a resolution entered by this Board on October 17th last, relating certain medals given by him, finding that the word annually, in that resolution, was inadvertently entered, orders that it stand as recorded save that the word annually be omitted therefrom.

**Resolved-**

That the election of a President for the University be postponed to July 28th next, and that when this Board adjourns from its present session it adjourn to meet on said date at 12 o'clock M. at the University, and that a committee of the Board to consist of the Rector and three members to be named by him, take such steps as they may deem best to bring before the Board such further information on the subject as may be available.
