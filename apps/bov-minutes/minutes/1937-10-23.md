A called meeting of the Board of Visitors was held on this date at 10 o'clock A.M. with the Rector, Fred. W. Scott, and Visitors Corbitt, Garnett, Hall, Rinehart, Stuart, L. C. Williams and R. Gray Williams, and President Newcomb present. Absent Mr. Goolrick and Mrs. Munford.

The President made the following announcements:

Upon the recommendation of the President the following actions were taken:

Leave of absence granted Miss Louise Oates, Professor of Nursing Education, from September 1, 1937 to June 1, 1938, without pay, in order to pursue further graduate work in Nursing Education at Teachers College, Columbia University.

Ratification of the following appointments made during the summer:

Dr. Kenneth W. Spence, Acting Assistant Professor of Psychology for the session of 1937-38, at a salary of $3,000.

Mr. John Joseph Smith, Acting Assistant Professor of Commerce and Business Administration, at a salary of $2,800.

Miss Clare M. J. Wangen, Superintendent of Nurses, University of Virginia Hospital, at a salary of $2,100, replacing Miss Josephin McLeod, resigned.

Mr. Edward Angelo Colonna, full-time Instructor in the School of Romanic Languages, at a salary of $2,000.

Report of cost of Constructing and Equipping the New Engineering Building (Thornton Hall) now completed.

The Federal Government having disposed of all the bonds issued for this project, we are advised that the balance of $2,024.98 will be paid by it to the University in cash.

The Special Committee on sale of "Pantops" reported that the sale had been completed, payment received, stock on the premises sold. The equipment is yet to be disposed of.

Request from the Lawrenceville Baptist Church for a reduction in the interest rate on its $4500.00 from 5% to 4½% was not granted.

The request of the Executive Committee of the McIntire Tumor Clinic Fund for the transfer of $5,000 of the accumulated surplus income to the principal endowment account was approved.

Mr. F. Gray Williams, Chairman of the Committee on the Miller Farm, reported on his investigation of the Farm and as to certain offers of purchase, recommending that sale not be considered at this time which was approved by the Board.

In connection with the settlement of the estate of Dr. Charles M. Fauntleroy, the President made the following statement:

"It will be recalled that at a meeting of this Board held on June 14th, 1937, I read certain letters which had passed between my office and Messrs. Smith, Wild, Beebe and Cades, Attorneys of Honolulu, representing the widow and daughter of Dr. Charles M. Fauntleroy, deceased, by whose will a portion of his estate was left to the University, and at said meeting the following resolution was adopted.

\`RESOLVED, that subject to verification of all the facts recited in these letters and subject further to the approval of the President and of the Attorney for the University, the Board consents to the release proposed.'

"The release referred to in this resolution was of a portion of Dr. Fauntleroy's estate which his widow and daughter and their attorneys believed Dr. Fauntleroy did not intend should be included in the portion of the estate bequeathed by him to the University.

"Since June 14th, last, Mr. Perkins and I have had lengthy correspondence, not only with the Attorneys for Mrs. Fauntleroy and her daughter, but with the firm of Anderson, Marx, Wrenn and Jenks, Attorneys of Honolulu, representing the University'y interest in this estate, at our request.

"We absolutely satisfied ourselves as to the correctness of a majority of the statements made in the letters referred to in said resolution. We found that through lack of accurate information on the part of the Attorneys representing Mrs. Fauntleroy and her daughter some of these statements were not absolutely accurate. After a thorough analysis of the whole situation, on September 17th, last, we wrote to Messrs. Smith, Wild, Beebe and Cades, stating exactly upon what basis the University of Virginia was willing to make settlement. That letter, in part, reads as follows:

\`In order that no possible misunderstanding may arise, we will restate the University's agreement as follows:

(1) We will accept one-third of the Rawallan securities;

(2) We waive all rights in and to any of the securities held by Corn Exchange Bank in the joint custodian account;

(3) We will accept 33 shares of the United States Steel stock and will pay Mrs. Fauntleroy any and all income derived from said stock by the University from the date of receipt of the stock by it to the date of Mrs. Fauntleroy's death.;

(4) We will accept 11 shares of Radio stock,

(5) We will accept one-third of the $1250.00 in the hands of Washington Loan and Trust Company, in which Dr. Fauntleroy has a remainder after the death of Miss Ann Fauntleroy,

(6) We are to receive one-third of any assets of the estate in addition to those hereinbefore enumerated, if any such additional assets are hereafter discovered.

"Under date of October 1st, I received a cablegram from Messrs. Smith, Wild, Beebe and Cades, which reads as follows.

\`TERMS OF AGREEMENT RE FAUNTLEROY ESTATE AS CONTAINED LETTER YOUR ATTORNEYS SEPTEMBER SEVENTEENTH AGREEABLE STOP PLEASE WIRE COLLECT DEFINITE ACCEPTANCE BY YOU OF SETTLEMENT ON OUTLINED BASIS STOP AGREEMENT WILL BE PREPARED BY US AND PROBATE PRODEEDINGS CAN GO FORWARD'

"While, of course, it will be seen that our letter of September 17th, clearly stating our offer of settlement and this telegram of October 1st accepting that offer, concluded the agreement between the parties, in accordance with the request contained in the cablegram 1 sent a cablegram to Messrs. Smith, Wild, Beebe and Cades, on October 2nd, reading as follows:

\`THE UNIVERSITY CONFIRMS OFFER OF SEPTEMBER SEVENTEENTH AND ACKNOWLEDGES YOUR ACCEPTANCE THEREOR BY CABLE OF OCTOBER FIRST.'

"As the letter and two cablegrams above referred to effected a final agreement upon the subject of this estate, leaving nothing more to be done on our part, I have felt that the matter should be reported to this meeting and beg to ask that a resolution will be adopted confirming the action of our Attorney and myself in making the foregoing settlement."

The foregoing report was duly considered by the Board, and it was, thereupon,

RESOLVED that the settlement made by the President and Attorney for the University, with the Attorneys and the widow and daughter of Dr. Charles M. Fauntleroy, as outlined in the foregoing report of the President, be and the same is hereby approved, ratified and confirmed in all respects.

The President called the attention of the Board to the covenant entered into by the Board with the purchasers of its Library Revenue bonds under Resolution adopted by the Board January 16, 1937 as follows:

"It is hereby covenanted and agreed that the institution, upon the completion of said project and acceptance thereof, will charge and collect for or in connection with the use, facilities or services of the project and replacements thereof, or services rendered therein, such fees and charges as the Board of Visitors of the Institution shall deem so that the project shall always have sufficient receipts and revenues, determined as provided by sub-section (e) section 6 of the Act first above cited, to provide for the payment of all expenses of operation and maintenance of the project, as defined in said resolution, in addition to the discharge, in due course, of any liabilities or debts of the institution incurred in connection with the project, including the principal of and interest on the bonds of the issue of which this bond is one; and that a part of any such fees and charges so collected, sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on the bonds of said issue as such principal and interest respectively become due, will annually be set aside in the said bond and interest Sinking Fund Account, in the manner and to the extent provided in said Resolution.",

and stated that the following rule or plan for collection of these library fees has been put in operation for the Session 1937-38, that is to say

"Each student taking more than one course at the University of Virginia, regardless of the Department or Departments in which he or she may be registered, shall be charged the full library Fee of $20.00."

After a full discussion, it was

RESOLVED, that the rule for collection of Library fees as above stated by the President be and the same is hereby approved, ratified and confirmed, and said rule shall continue in full force and effect until hereafter amended or replaced by further action of this Board.

Extension of time on the Library project:

Upon the recommendation of the President the following was adopted.

RESOLVED, by the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the Rector and Secretary be and they are hereby authorized and directed to execute on behalf of this Board an application to the Public works Administration for extension or time for the completion of the Few Library Building -PWA Project Va. 1075-D; and also to execute on behalf of this Board the waiver of liquidated damages under the contract.

The Students' Admission Application Committee submitted a detailed report of application denied and payments made therefor to the students so denied who are attending other universities, from May 4th, 1937 to Sept. 17, 1937, which was approved in the following resolution adopted.

RESOLVED, by the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the report of the Committee known as the "Students' Admission Application Committee" recommending that admission be denied to the following students, and scholarships awarded to each of them in the amount set opposite their names, under authority of Chapter 352 of the Acts of the General Assembly of 1936, be and the same is hereby ratified and approved:

Mr. Stuart, Chairman of the special committee to study cause of failure of Law School Graduates, submitted, on behalf of the Committee a very full report of their investigations and studies of the question, which was read and their recommendations discussed at some length, With respect to the recommendation of the Committee that two additional members be added to the law faculty, President Newcomb stated that one had been added for the present session and that he had included another which had been requested in the bi-ennial budget.

With respect to the recommendation for raising the entrance requirements for the Law Department, Mr. Corbitt offered the following, which, being duly seconded, was adopted:

RESOLVED, by the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, that beginning with the Session 1939-40 all candidates for admission to the Department of Law shall be required to present evidence that for three years at least they have pursued as residents in a standard college course acceptable to a baccalaureate degree; and that they shall have successfully completed at least 45 session-hours toward this degree.

Report of Special Committee on the Law Department.

This committee consists of the following members of the Board: Messrs. Lewis C. Williams, R. Gray Williams, Christopher B. Garnett, James H. Corbitt, C. O'Conor Goolrick, and Wm. A. Stuart, Chariman. The committee did not find it possible to have a complete meeting. At the meeting called for May 22, 1937, at the University, only Mr. Lewis C. Williams and the Chairman were able to attend. That meeting was very instructive, however, to the two members of the committee who were present, due to the preliminary discussion with President Newcomb, followed by a prolonged discussion with the committee of the Law Faculty consisting of Messrs. Eager, Ribble, White, Nash and Dillard. Since that meeting there has been some correspondence between the members of the committee and a number of informal conferences between individual members.

The work of the committee grouped itself naturally around three questions:

(1) - What changes in the curriculum and in the order of subjects studied could be made to provide better preparation for the students taking the Virginia State Bar examination?

(2) - What changes, if any, should be made in the requirements for admission to the Law Department?

(3) - Is the personnel of the Law Faculty sufficient to carry the present and prospective teaching load?

With regard to the first question, your committee reports that during the year that has elapsed since the subject was first mooted, the Law Faculty has taken important steps to improve the preparation of students taking the Virginia State Bar examination. These steps have consisted, first, in rearranging the course of study, so that those subjects which might be expected to be most helpful for the purposes of the bar examination are now grouped so that they will be freshest in the minds of the students at the time when most students take the bar examination, namely, at the end of the second year of the course; second, by expanding the courses relating to Virginia pleading and practice; third, by explaining to students well in advance the scope and character of the bar examination and impressing upon them the importance of making careful preparation; fourth, by enforcing a more stringent elimination of unpromising law students during their first year. These changes were made in time to become partially effective in advance of the bar examination of June, 1937. The results of that examination, so far as students of the Law Department of the University were concerned, showed a marked improvement over the disappointing record of the immeidately preceding years. Seventy-four students of the University Law School took the examination and 65 passed or 87.8%. Ninety-four and seven-tenth per cent of the graduates passed (only one failed) and 85.5% of the second-year men passed (eight failed). These results afford an extraordinary contrast to those of the bar examination of June, 1936, at which 11 graduates of the Law School passed out of 21 taking the examination, or 52.4% and 24 second-year men passed out of 41 taking the examination, or 59%. Your committee is of opinion that since the bad situation that had developed was called to the attention of the Law Faculty, they have made earnest, and largely successful, efforts to deal with it. However, your committee feels that the results of the bar examinations should be carefully watched in future by the appropriate authority in the Law Faculty, and that reports thereon should be promptly and regularly made to the President of the University.

(2) - With regard to the question as to the adequacy of the present requirements for admission to the Law School, your committee has found that six American law schools now require an academic degree for admission, namely, Harvard, Yale, Pennsylvania, Pittsburgh, Georgetown and California. Thirty other American law schools require three years of college academic work. Among these are North Carolina, Duke, West Virginia, George Washington, and William and Mary. The present requirements for admission to the University Law School is only two years of academic work. That is the same as the minimum requirement of the state law. In other words, the standards of admission to the University Law School are no higher than the minimum requirements for admission to the bar fixed by the state law. This necessarily means that the University Law School to-day is not taking a leading position in the efforts being made to turn out better educated and better equipped lawyers, but, on the contrary, is content to accept material that measures up only to the minimum of the general state requirements for admission to the bar. Your committee considers this position unsatisfactory, and recommends that the requirements for admission to the law school be raised to three years of academic work beginning with the session of 1939-1930. Your committee has given inquiry and thought to the question whether such an increase in requirements would result in too sudden and drastic a reduction in the number of applications for admission to the Law School. The Law Faculty were unanimous in their opinion that such a result was not to be apprehended, due to the fact, first, that only the first-year class would be affected in 1938, and, second, that the number of applications has shown a marked upward tendency during recent years. The University Law School has enjoyed deserved distinction in the past, which, however, it cannot hope to maintain unless it raises its standards so as to keep them abreast of current progress in this field. It cannot hope to maintain a position in the front rank if its student material is interior to that of its competitors. At the request of the committee, the office of the dean of the Law School furnished a tabulation showing the academic training and the average grades made by the first-year law students over the past five years. This tabulation shows that 236 first-year students, having two years of academic preparation, made an average grade of 84.576; 166 first-year students having three years of academic preparation made an average grade of 85.907; 191 first-year students having academic degrees made an average grade of 87.979. When it is remembered that the passing mark in the law school is 83, these figures demonstrate very strikingly by what a precarious margin the average first-year student, with only two years of academic preparation, is able to maintain himself beyond the passing mark. On the other hand, the greater measure of success immediately attained by the students with better academic training is striking.

(3) - With regard to the sufficiency of the present teaching staff of the Law School, your committee reached the definite conclusion that the Law Faculty is overworked, and that at least two more additions are urgently needed, besides the additional professor provided this session. There has been a steady expansion, boty in the number of students in the Law School and in the variety of subjects of instruction during recent years. Corresponding provision for the needed additional teaching staff has not been made. A reasonable amount of spare time for study and research must be provided for the members of the faculty if the Law School is to hope to maintain a distinguished position. The burden upon the present faculty is entirely too great to allow them this essential opportunity. Your committee have compared the teaching loads in the other leading American law schools with that of this University, and the results strikingly attest a state of over-work based upon comparative standards. The situation is frankly pointed out by the executive committee of the Association of American Law Schools which made its inspection of the Law School in March, 1937. In the report, made by Dr. H. W. Arrant of the Ohio State University Law School, the following is said upon this subject:

"The Executive Committee feels that the faculty should be substantially enlarged just as soon as possible. I was advised when at the school that definite arrangements had been completed for the addition of one member to the faculty. This is a start, but there whould be two or three more additions just as soon as possible. I have written Dean Eager to this effect and have sent him a copy of the report which I made, which he will doubtless show you. The Executive Committee hopes that you will find a way to make the substantial additions to the faculty which we regard as necessary to enable the law school at the University to maintain and augment the enviable position it has enjoyed in legal education since the the days of the great Minor."

Your committee earnestly joins in this recommendation, and believes that its accomplishment is of fundamental and pressing importance.

The meeting then adjourned.

"It will be recalled that at a meeting of this Board held on June 14th, 1937, I read certain letters which had passed between my office and Messrs. Smith, Wild, Beebe and Cades, Attorneys of Honolulu, representing the widow and daughter of Dr. Charles M. Fauntleroy, deceased, by whose will a portion of his estate was left to the University, and at said meeting the following resolution was adopted.

\`RESOLVED, that subject to verification of all the facts recited in these letters and subject further to the approval of the President and of the Attorney for the University, the Board consents to the release proposed.'

"The release referred to in this resolution was of a portion of Dr. Fauntleroy's estate which his widow and daughter and their attorneys believed Dr. Fauntleroy did not intend should be included in the portion of the estate bequeathed by him to the University.

"Since June 14th, last, Mr. Perkins and I have had lengthy correspondence, not only with the Attorneys for Mrs. Fauntleroy and her daughter, but with the firm of Anderson, Marx, Wrenn and Jenks, Attorneys of Honolulu, representing the University'y interest in this estate, at our request.

"We absolutely satisfied ourselves as to the correctness of a majority of the statements made in the letters referred to in said resolution. We found that through lack of accurate information on the part of the Attorneys representing Mrs. Fauntleroy and her daughter some of these statements were not absolutely accurate. After a thorough analysis of the whole situation, on September 17th, last, we wrote to Messrs. Smith, Wild, Beebe and Cades, stating exactly upon what basis the University of Virginia was willing to make settlement. That letter, in part, reads as follows:

\`In order that no possible misunderstanding may arise, we will restate the University's agreement as follows:

(1) We will accept one-third of the Rawallan securities;

(2) We waive all rights in and to any of the securities held by Corn Exchange Bank in the joint custodian account;

(3) We will accept 33 shares of the United States Steel stock and will pay Mrs. Fauntleroy any and all income derived from said stock by the University from the date of receipt of the stock by it to the date of Mrs. Fauntleroy's death.;

(4) We will accept 11 shares of Radio stock,

(5) We will accept one-third of the $1250.00 in the hands of Washington Loan and Trust Company, in which Dr. Fauntleroy has a remainder after the death of Miss Ann Fauntleroy,

(6) We are to receive one-third of any assets of the estate in addition to those hereinbefore enumerated, if any such additional assets are hereafter discovered.

"Under date of October 1st, I received a cablegram from Messrs. Smith, Wild, Beebe and Cades, which reads as follows.

\`TERMS OF AGREEMENT RE FAUNTLEROY ESTATE AS CONTAINED LETTER YOUR ATTORNEYS SEPTEMBER SEVENTEENTH AGREEABLE STOP PLEASE WIRE COLLECT DEFINITE ACCEPTANCE BY YOU OF SETTLEMENT ON OUTLINED BASIS STOP AGREEMENT WILL BE PREPARED BY US AND PROBATE PRODEEDINGS CAN GO FORWARD'

"While, of course, it will be seen that our letter of September 17th, clearly stating our offer of settlement and this telegram of October 1st accepting that offer, concluded the agreement between the parties, in accordance with the request contained in the cablegram 1 sent a cablegram to Messrs. Smith, Wild, Beebe and Cades, on October 2nd, reading as follows:

\`THE UNIVERSITY CONFIRMS OFFER OF SEPTEMBER SEVENTEENTH AND ACKNOWLEDGES YOUR ACCEPTANCE THEREOR BY CABLE OF OCTOBER FIRST.'

"As the letter and two cablegrams above referred to effected a final agreement upon the subject of this estate, leaving nothing more to be done on our part, I have felt that the matter should be reported to this meeting and beg to ask that a resolution will be adopted confirming the action of our Attorney and myself in making the foregoing settlement."

"The Executive Committee feels that the faculty should be substantially enlarged just as soon as possible. I was advised when at the school that definite arrangements had been completed for the addition of one member to the faculty.
