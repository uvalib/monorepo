The regular annual meeting of the Rector and Visitors was held on this date, at 8 o'clock P. M., with the following members present: Visitors Dillard, Duke, Greaver, Hart, McIntire, McVea, Oliver and Scott, and President Alderman.

In the absence of the Rector, Mr. Scott was elected Rector pro tem.

The minutes of the previous meeting having been copied and sent to the members of the Board, were approved.

The President announced the following gifts and he was authorized to prepare suitable resolutions of thanks in each case:

From the Estate of Dr. J. R. Humphrey $5,000.00, being a legacy to establish a scholarship for needy and deserving students.

From Mrs. Legh R. Watts, of Portsmouth, Va., the law library of Judge Legh R. Watts containing about 1400 volumes.

From Mr. H. Gordon Gilpin, Springfield, Ohio, rough draft of a communication written by Thomas Jefferson to someone, presumably Prof. Emmet, making certain suggestions in regard to the establishment of a Professorship of Botany in the University.

From Dr. Gardner L. Carter, of the University, to the Department of Music, a small library of music and books of music.

From Madame Marie Jonnesco, Roumanian writer and poet, a copy of her book "Roumania". Mr. F. A. DePilis, of New York City, interested Madame Jonnesco in sending a copy to the Library of the University of Virginia.

From Seale Harris gift of $1000.00, payable $100.00 a year to establish a loan fund in the Medical School.

Upon the recommendation of the President, the following election, transfer and resignation of members of the faculty were approved:

* Request of Dr. T. R. Snavely concerning his salary, $250.00.
* Dr. Bean asked an additional appropriation of $500.00 for his instructor in Anatomy. He inadvertently put down $1,000.00, instead of $1,500 and it was carried in the Budget as $1,000.00.
* Additional appropriation of $104.68 to supplement the $74.00 which was appropriated to cover the bill for improvements and repairs to Prof. FitzHugh's projectoscope.
* Resolution was adopted authorizing the President to sign and transfer certain Liberty Bonds to provide funds with which to construct the McIntire wing to the Hospital and to convert $500.00 of the Third Liberty Loan 4 1/4% bond for reinvestment.
* Resolution was adopted accepting the gift of $5,844 from the General Athletic Association for the purpose of tiling the swimming pool of the Memorial Gymnasium.
* Mr. C. H. H. Thomas, Manager of the McIntire Concerts, submitted the report for the session 1922-23 showing a deficit of $1,082.36. The question of continuing the concerts for another year was considered and resolution was adopted authorizing the continuance of the concerts, as follows:

  RESOLVED, That the McIntire concerts be continued and that the President, Mr. McIntire and Miss. McVea be appointed with full power to arrange the program.

The question of providing sewerage system for the Memorial Gymnasium was disposed of in the following resolution, unanimously adopted:

RESOLVED, That the sum of $5,000, which sum is in lieu of the $2,500.00 already appropriated, to construct a ten inch sewer line leading from the Memorial Gymnasium to a septic tank to be located on the western border of the land of Col. Eugene Massie, be and is hereby appropriated, provided the City appropriate a like sum and the adjoining property owners pay the balance of the cost of construction, the said sewer and tank to be constructed by the City and maintained by it in the future. Any plans for said construction shall have the approval of the Gymnasium Committee.

Upon the recommendation of the President the resignation of Prof. R. H. Dabney, as Dean of the Graduate Department, was accepted, and the appointment of Prof. J. C. Metcalf to fill the vacancy confirmed.

Prof. Charles Hancock submitted the following report on the New Central Heating Plant, which was considered, and such matters as need further study and consideration connected therewith were referred to a special committee consisting of Messrs. McIntire, Duke and the President for report to the Board:

It is a pleasure to report the completion of the first two units of the new heating plant and the successful operation of the same through its first heating season. There are now installed about 75 000 square feet of radiation surface, approximately 72% of the entire heating load for all permanent buildings south of Ivy Road.

Records of coal consumed in heating the buildings in the past which are now heated from the new station are not available. For comparison, therefore, I can only refer to the actual results to my estimate of probable fuel consumption. Making due allowance for fuel used in supplying live steam for the hospital sterilizers and for the fact that this heating season is about two degrees warmer than the normal, upon which my estimate was based, coal actually consumed, as determined by careful weighing, was 288 tons less than the estimated consumption. Or, as stated another way, the actual consumption was 16.5% less than the estimated consumption.

The comparison of the previous paragraph is of value only as indicating that the estimates, upon which the wisdom of the undertaking is based, are fairly trustworth. The anticipation seems fully justified that very real economies, as predicted, will appear upon the final abandonment of the old power and heating plant and the combined production of heating plant and the combined production of heat and power at the new plant.

These are the good results of the first season's operation. There is, however, one unsolved problem still before us. The accurate weighing of coal and comparison of results with the estimates indicated that fuel used for live steam that has been supplied to the hospital for operating sterilizers, steam tables and the distillation system seems out of all proportion to the service rendered. The cost of coal used for this service during the past six months is, at least, $2,500.00. Furthermore, for the summer months there will be an additional cost, as firemen must be retained for this service alone.

The situation demands immediate and careful investigation with a view to discovering and eliminating causes of waste.

Earlier in this report attention was called to the fact that actual consumption for heating was about 16.5% less than the estimated consumption. Three influencing causes may explain this gratifying result: conservatism and care in estimating, peculiar excellence of installation and conscientious care and faithfulness in plant operation.

While I wish, with unhesitating sincerity, to give Messrs. Almirall & Company a large meed of credit, which is their just due, I will insist, with equal sincerity, upon the vital importance of faithful and intelligent plant operation. The firing of coal is, really, an important art, and with less intelligent operation and care the result might easily have been the opposite-a substantial loss rather than a substantial gain. The saving of 288 tons at $7.00 a ton, or $2,016.00 is therefore, in my judgment, largely due to efficient supervision and hearty cooperation between foreman and operators. The foreman has cost us $600.00 dollars for four months, and impressively small sum in comparison with the fuel item alone.

Furthermore, there is a list of items of upkeep before me, performed personally by the foreman, which if evaluated in terms of the present expert pipe fitting costs, would go a long way toward paying the foreman's salary. In view of these facts the unwisdom of attempting to operate and maitain the plant without competent supervision would be momumental. I, therefore, most earnestly, request an appropriation of $1,050 for the employment of a competent foreman for seven months of the next season. This would provide sufficient time to go over the entire plant before beginning operation, and again after the close of the heating season. It is the least we may expect to do if the plant is to be kept in first class operating condition and a minimum of fuel consumed is to be assured.

Proceeding upon the assumption that occupants of university houses who get heat from the university will be expected to pay the actual cost of heat, I make the following recommendation: Fix the rate to include the proportional cost of labor and repairs plus the actual cost of coal consumed. The cost of labor and repairs is $6.00 per hundred square feet of radiation and the coal consumed this season is $20.00 per hundred. Allow the period of three years for readjustment from the old steam radiation to the hot water radiation. This season apply the rate to the steam radiation, consumers being thus charged just the same as in the past. Next season apply the rate to the steam radiation plus 1/3 the difference between the water radiation and the steam radiation. The following season add 2/3 of this difference, and the next season charge for the water radiation on the same basis, it being understood that the rate each season will be fixed by the actual cost of coal consumed plus the proportionate cost of labor and repairs. For an illustration take Pavillion 1, West Lawn. It had 612 ft. of steam radiation, it now has 1062 ft. of water radiation. The difference is 450 and one third of the difference is 150. This season charge for 612 ft. at $20.00. Next season charge for 762 ft. at a rate to be fixed next season as above indicated. The following season charge for 912 ft. at the rate to be fixed for that season. The next following season, and thereafter, charge for 1062 ft at a rate to be fixed each season.

This agreement is entered into this the 11th day of June 1923 between The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, of Charlottesville, Va., and the Department of Game and Inland Fisheries - Witnesseth - that for and in consideration of the sum of one dollar and the provisions of Chapter 93, Acts of the General Assembly of Virginia, 1922, an Act for the establishment of State Game Sanctuaries in this State, the said The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia assigns to the Department of Game and Inland Fisheries certain land described as follows:

All the grounds, agricultural and woodland belonging to the said Rector and Visitors of the University, consisting of 484 acres, situated at Charlottesville, Va., in Albemarle County, to be used by the said Department as a Game Sanctuary for a period of ten years during which time no wild birds or wild animals, except predatory birds and animals, are to be disturbed or killed thereon by any person. It is mutually understood and agreed that this assignment shall not prevent nor interfere with any farming or the operation of any other enterprise the owner of said land may desire. The purpose of this assignment being to create a refuge or haven where wild birds and animals may be unmolested at all times and remain undisturbed by trespassers and hunters. Given under our hands and seals this the 11th day of June 1923.
