Messrs. L. B. Gunn and D. S. Willcox of the State-Planters Bank of Commerce and Trusts of Richmond presented a detailed report on the University of Virginia Consolidated Endowment Fund for the year ending 25 January 1961. At the conclusion of the presentation, a copy of the report was ordered to be filed with the permanent records of the Board.

Mr. William H. McFarlane, Director, State Council of Higher Education, appeared before the Board to discuss the study of higher education in Virginia which the Council was to launch later this year. The purpose of the study was to develop a coordinated program for the development of higher education in Virginia. Mr. McFarlane pointed out that the Council was charged by statute with the preparation of such a plan and that the Council felt that the institutions concerned should participate in the study. He accordingly requested that the Board, (1) authorize the President to serve on an advisory committee to the State Council of Higher Education in the development and conduct of the study and, (2) that the Board select one of its members to serve on the committee along with the President.

After discussion, the following resolution was adopted:

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the Rector be and he is hereby empowered to select one member of the Board of Visitors to serve with the President on an advisory committee to the State Council of Higher Education in a study of the coordination of higher education in Virginia.

The President presented a current report on the status of admissions to the undergraduate colleges and schools of the University for the academic year 1961-1962. He reported that the number of applications had increased markedly over the number on hand at this time a year ago, and that the prospects were most favorable for a good entering class in each of the undergraduate schools. He placed special stress on the large increase in the number of applications from graduates of Virginia public schools. A copy of a profile prepared by the Dean of Admissions of the entering class for 1960-1961 in the College of Arts and Sciences was also distributed and discussed.

The President announced the following gifts and grants:

The following resolution was adopted:

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the following persons be and they are hereby elected to the faculty of Mary Washington College:

The Chancellor announced the following resignation:\
Mrs. John C. Russell, Assistant Professor of Home Economics, effective 1 February 1961, for reasons of health.

The Chancellor reported to the Board the death of Dr. Minnie Rob Phaup, Assistant Professor of Psychology, who died unexpectedly on 28 December 1960. Miss Phaup had been at Mary Washington College since September 1958, and only last June received her doctorate from George Washington University. Previously she had taught at Wells College and Converse College.

The Chancellor recommended that the new dormitory at Mary Washington College be named in honor of Mary Ambler Marshall, wife of Chief Justice John Marshall.

The following resolution was adopted:

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the new dormitory, occupied in September 1960, be and it is hereby named in honor of Mary Ambler Marshall.

The Chancellor reported on the increase, in September 1960, of student fees in the amount of $75 as authorized by the Board at its meeting on 10 June 1960. The revenue derived from this increase had been used exclusively to finance the new faculty salary scale which went into effect on 1 September 1960. Copies of the new fee schedule were distributed to each member of the Board and a copy was ordered to be placed in the Board files.

The Chancellor reported the receipt of an anonymous gift of five $1,000 bonds, issued by the American and Foreign Power Company. The bonds are 4.8 junior debenture 1987. The Secretary was instructed to write a letter of thanks to the donor for this gift.

The Chancellor reported that final arrangements had been concluded for the acceptance of the principal and the division of the income of the Gari Melchers Memorial Endowment Fund. The securities representing the principal have been delivered to the State-Planters Bank of Commerce and Trusts to be added to the Consolidated Endowment Fund of the University.

In order that the transfer might be officially concluded, the Chancellor proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution:

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the University accepts $112,707.53 in securities and $2,558.14 in cash representing the principal of the Gari Melchers Memorial Endowment Fund, as determined by the State Treasurer and the Auditor of Public Accounts and as approved by the Finance Committee of this Board and the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, and that the University agrees to the distribution of income which on 31 December 1960 amounted to $23,829.03.

The Chancellor reported that the standard teaching load at Mary Washington College had been 15 hours. He stated that long-range plans called for a gradual reduction of the teaching load to 12 hours, beginning in certain departments of the College. He pointed out that one result of this reduction would be the need for additional teaching personnel. His plans were to reduce teaching loads in certain departments to 12 hours and to request the instructors to devote the three hours formerly spent in teaching to counseling and guidance work and conferences with students.

Following the Chancellor's presentation, there was a general discussion of the financial implications of this proposal. Specific consideration will be given to this proposal when the 1961-1962 budget for Mary Washington College is presented.

The Chancellor presented a general review of the applications for admission for the academic year 1961-1962. A notable increase in the number of applications had resulted and it appeared that a larger percentage of the applicants given admission would be Virginians.

The Rector announced the appointment of Mrs. Belva Dunn Jones as Chairman of the Mary Washington College Committee, effective 11 February 1961, to succeed the late Fred B. Greear.

The following resolution was adopted:

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the following person be and he is hereby elected to the faculty of Clinch Valley College:\
Mr. Roy Lee Wells, Jr., as Instructor in Chemistry, for one year, effective 1 September 1961, at a salary of $5,100.

On motion the meeting was then adjourned.
