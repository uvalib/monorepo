I. That the title, Professor Emeritus, be established at the University of Virginia. That this title be conferred by the Rector and Visitors on faculty members of the University of Virginia upon the occasion of their retirement. (This title would automatically be conferred on all full professors retiring between the ages of 65 and 70 after at least 10 years of service at this University, and, in addition, all retiring members of the faculty may be considered for this title).

II. That the election of an individual as Professor Emeritus be announced at the Final Exercises in June and that thereafter his name and title be printed in the appropriate University catalogues.

After discussion the Board adopted, on motion of Mr. Hartfield, duly seconded, the following resolution

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia that the title of Professor Emeritus be and it is hereby established as an honorary rank in the faculties of the several schools and colleges of the University,

**RESOLVED further that a person holding the title of Professor Emeritus shall have his name listed in the appropriate catalogues of the University, but that the possession of this title shall not in itself entitle him to any salary or perquisites, nor to any specific duties, nor to any voice or vote in University faculties, nor to any official relationship to any department, school, or college of the University.**

In response to nominations by President Darden of Professors Balz and Manahan, who are retiring at the end of the present session, the Board adopted, on motion of Mr. Coxe, seconded by Dr. Emmett, the following resolutions

Referring to several gifts received in recent months from Mr. Langbourne M. Williams, President Darden read to the Board the following letter from Mr. Williams

***

I had been looking forward to having an opportunity to come to the University this fall and to discuss with you the John Langbourne Williams Memorial Fund about which I wrote you under date of January 18, 1955. As a result of Elizabeth's illness I was not able to carry out my plan. I provided in my letter that if I did not by December 31, 1956 designate how the income from this fund was to be used, the income was to be used for the general purposes of the University. Since I would like it to be used for a special purpose and since I have not for the reason mentioned been able to discuss it with you, I am writing this letter to set forth how I would like for this fund to be handled. If it is not satisfactory in every particular, I shall be delighted to come to the University some time next year to discuss it with you.

I would like the fund I have established in memory of my Grandfather to be known as the John Langbourne Williams Memorial Fund. The purpose of the fund is to further the love of learning at the University of Virginia I would like for there to be three trustees and suggest as the first three trustees Mr. Allan T. Gwathmey, Mr. Robert K. Gooch and Mr. William S. Weedon. While the language I propose obviously and intentionally gives the trustees quite broad powers, I would like to mention, as an example of the type of thing that I would like to see the income of the fund used to support, the Lower Division Seminars. The program has appealed to me very much as helping to provide the intellectual stimulation and the cultural preparation of the gentlemen and scholar that I like to think of as representing the University of Virginia.

I suggest that the trustees be self perpetuating and that they elect their own Chairman. If at any time the trustees fail to elect their successors or if for any other reason there should fail to be three trustees, I would like to provide that the trustees be appointed by the President of the University.

I would be glad if the committee would consult with me from time to time about the use to which they propose to put the income from the Fund but I would not like to stipulate that that be done.

As I have said, I hope that what I propose here will meet with your approval. If you have any suggestions of any kind, I shall be grateful if you will let me have them.

With warm personal regards and hoping to see you before long,

. . . Another subject has come up which I desire to present to you

The Fidelity-Philadelphia Trust Company was, as you may know, trustee of a trust under the will of Emily Swift Balch, the mother-in-law of our decedent, Emily Clark Balch. It was also trustee of the Estate of Edwin Swift Balch, the husband of our decedent.

The income from the estate of Edwin Swift Balch was payable to our decedent. The income from the Estate of Emily Swift Balch was, through the years, being accumulated for charitable purposes in accordance with the direction in Emily Swift Balch's will.

In preparing an account of the Emily Swift Balch Estate, the Trust Company has just discovered that an error occurred in 1939. A payment to our decedent in the amount of $500. was charged against the Estate of Emily Swift Balch instead of against the Estate of Edwin Swift Balch. The result, in substance, is that our decedent, in all probability, died $500. richer than she would have died if the error had not been made.

The question arises as to whether the Fidelity should stand the loss and reimburse the Estate of Emily Swift Balch in the amount of $500. or whether you and Mr. Minor would think it fair for the Fidelity to reimburse the Estate of Emily Swift Balch by a payment of $500. out of the respective shares of your two clients.

Trust Companies should not make errors but the curious similarity of the three Balch names does establish somewhat an excuse.

At a meeting with Mr. Malcolm Luck, Secretary of the University of Virginia Alumni Association, Mr. Knox Turnbull, Secretary of the Alumni Fund, Mr. Vincent Shea, Comptroller of the University, and myself, we agreed on January 31, and by subsequent letter approved, to recommend that

1. The University of Virginia agree, as requested by the Alumni Association, to contribute an additional sum of $12,500 yearly for the next three years. This contribution, plus the money now given, would total $25,000 paid annually by the University for the keeping of adequate records and other data necessary for University purposes.

2. At the end of three years, namely March 31, 1960, the Secretary of the Alumni Association, the Secretary of the Alumni Fund, the Comptroller and the Provost will reevaluate the existing situation at that time to make any changes or adjustments that may seem feasible and desirable.

In the light of recent discussions with Mr. Shea, Mr. Stacey and Dr. Bobbitt, I should like to request approval of a revision of the compensation arrangements in the Department of Clinical Pathology designed to bring them more nearly in line with scale in other schools and with the Department of Pathology in this school. It is proposed that all earnings from private ambulatory patients be segregated in a special fund in the Bursar's Office in the name of the Department of Clinical Pathology, that costs to the hospital for the maintenance of these services be paid from this fund and the remainder be used to supplement the salaries of individuals in the Department of Clinical Pathology, the limits on these salaries to be the same as those in the Department of Pathology, namely, the old pre-clinical scale plus up to 50%. Any surplus remaining is to used at the discretion of the Department.

Under this arrangement I should like to recommend that Dr. Bobbitt's total income for the year beginning July, 1957, be $15,000.00 and that Dr. Hougie's be $10,000.00 for the same period. I should also like to recommend that in planning the finances of the Department, provision be made for a position of a biochemist at a salary of $10,000.00 a year. I hope very much that these recommendations meet with your approval.

I have had some conferences and correspondence during the past several weeks with Charles E. Wheeler of Easton, Maryland, local counsel for this estate, with regard to the preparation of the second administration and distribution account and the Maryland estate tax return.

I enclose copy of the First Administration and Distribution Accounts filed at the time the Yoakum County Gas Company stock was turned over to Mrs. Moyston in order to liquidate that company. I also enclose copy of proposed Second Administration and Distribution Accounts, which I understand will be filed in the near future in the Orphans' Court for Talbot County, Maryland.

The value of the interest of the University in the Maryland estate distributed by these accounts (after deducting the value of Mrs. Moyston's life estate) would appear to be $581,220.13. Adding to this amount the value of the University's interest in "Little Timberneck" Farm, $6,107.48, the total value is $587,327.61. The Maryland inheritance tax on this amount (if it is decided to pay the tax at this time) would be $44,749.57. However, the Maryland estate tax payable by the estate in the event the University did not elect to pay the inheritance tax at this time would be $18,452.65, and since credit is given against this tax for inheritance taxes paid, the estate is willing, rather than pay this as Maryland estate tax, to contribute this amount toward the inheritance tax payable by the University, which would result in a net inheritance tax payable by the University of $26,296.92.

On the other hand, since the present value of the Maryland residuary estate is about $950,000. an inheritance tax of about $71,000. would be payable by the University at the time of the transfer of the assets to it if no payment is now made by the University and if there is no change in the present value of the assets.

We have been advised that adjustments on audit of the Federal estate tax return will result in a deficiency not to exceed $25,000. Any deficiency would result in an additional Maryland estate tax. In answer to my inquiry, Charlie Wheeler assures me that the estate would also pay over to the University an amount equal to any additional Maryland estate tax which the estate would otherwise be obligated to pay if the University had not elected to pay the inheritance tax at this time.

I believe, however, that the University should make the decision of whether it wishes to exercise the option to pay the tax at this time based upon the assumption that the Maryland inheritance tax payable at this time would be approximately $26,000. While the exact amount cannot be determined until the accounts are filed and approved and the Court passes upon a petition to determine the tax, I thought that it may be advisable to bring this matter to your attention so that a decision may possibly be made before the summer months and payment made at the appropriate time if it is determined that the option given by the Maryland Statute should be exercised.

If you have any questions concerning the matter or wish any further details, you will, of course, let me know.

I also enclose for the file of the Rector and Visitors certified copy of the final Decree of the Probate Court of Lea County, State of New Mexico, with respect to this estate. I previously advised you that the inventory value of the decedent's interest in real and personal property in New Mexico, as fixed by the appraisers of that State, is $532,990.85, and that the New Mexico inheritance tax (now 4%) will not be payable by the University until the property in that State is distributed to the University upon the death of Mrs. Moyston.

With best regards,

### REPORT OF BUILDINGS AND GROUNDS COMMITTEE

The Buildings and Grounds Committee presents a replica of the Rotunda, made by a student in the School of Architecture \[Mr. S. Rex Whitehurst] showing the original Jeffersonian design with elliptical rooms and towering dome. The completely documented plans are preserved in the Alderman Library. The interior was changed in 1895 by Stanford White, presumably for functional purposes.

The Rotunda has recently been listed in the Survey of Historical Buildings and Sites being recorded by the National Trust for Historic Preservation.

The Committee further reports negotiation with a Foundation in an effort to enlist interest and secure funds for the restoration of the Rotunda to the Jeffersonian design. No decision or commitment by this Foundation can be made until mid-winter, but interest has been evidenced by the expressed willingness of a representative to visit and examine the Rotunda. We place on file the correspondence with the Foundation together with its reply.

As Secretary of the Faculty I have the pleasant duty of enclosing the resolution which was adopted by the Faculty of Mary Washington College at its regular meeting on Monday night, May 13.
