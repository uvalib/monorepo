The following resolution was adopted:

**RESOLVED**, by the Board of Visitors of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that J. L. Newcomb, President, be and he is hereby authorized and directed to sign the Contract between the Civil Aeronautics Authority and the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, for the conduct of a Teacher Training Pre-Flight Aeronautics Course in Secondary Schools, in a sum not to exceed $630, to be paid by the Civil Aeronautics Administration.

The following resolution was adopted:

**RESOLVED**, by the Board of Visitors of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that J. L. Newcomb, President, be authorized and directed to sign on behalf of this Board a receipt for the Portrait of Walter F. Taylor, bequeathed to the University by will of Fielding Lewis Taylor, and delivered by Borden Helmer and The Chase National Bank of the City of New York, as Executors of the Estate of Fielding Lewis Taylor.

It is recommended that the following action be taken:

**RESOLVED**, by the Board of Visitors of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that J. L. Newcomb, President, be authorized and directed to sign a lease for the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia with the United States of America, covering rental of Rooms 20, 21, and 21-A in Minor Hall; Room 34 in the Alderman Library; and the two-story eight-room brick building known as House C., Dawson's Row, at a rental price to be paid by the War Department of $2.00 per square foot per year for Rooms 20, 21, and 21-A for the rental of Building C., Dawson's Row.

Mr. Perkins called the Board's attention to a resolution adopted at a meeting of this Board held on April 6, 1943, dealing with the exchange of New York and Harlem Railroad preferred stock which passed to the University under the will of the late Graham F. Blandy, for Second Mortgage 4% One Hundred Year Bonds of Harlem Railroad, guaranteed by New York Central Railroad Company, such bonds to be issued in the ratio of $125.00 face value of said bonds for each share of New York and Harlem Railroad $50.00 Preferred Stock.

Under the resolution referred to the President was authorized to accept these bonds in exchange for the 771 shares of preferred stock of Harlem Railroad held by the University.

We are now advised by Mr. Rayford W. Alley, the attorney who has been handling the matter for the University in New York, that a formal written consent to the exchange will be sent us in the near future, which consent must be executed on behalf of the University, and in order that there may be no delay with reference to execution and delivery of this consent, a resolution should be adopted specifically authorizing the President to execute and deliver the consent in question. It was, thereupon unanimously

**RESOLVED**, that the President be and he is hereby authorized, in the name and on behalf of The Rector and Visitors, of the University of Virginia, to execute formal written consent to exchange of the 771 shares of preferred stock of New York and Harlem Railroad Company of the par value of $50.00 per share for New One Hundred Year Non-Callable 4% Mortgage Bonds of New York & Harlem Railroad Company, guaranteed by New York Central Railroad Company on the basis of $125.00 principal amount of said bonds for each share ($50.00 par value) of preferred stock of New York & Harlem Railroad Company): and that the President be and is further hereby authorized to deliver such consent on behalf of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, and to do whatever may be necessary to complete said exchange.

Dr. William E. Hopkins died a resident of the City of Los Angeles February 5, 1940, leaving a will which was admitted to probate on March 11, 1940, in the Superior Court for Los Angeles County.

Said will contains a residuary clause by which all of Dr. Hopkin's property not otherwise disposed of was viven to Wells Fargo Bank and Union Trust Company of San Francisco, as Trustees, for certain uses and purposes set out in the will, the principal purpose being to pay the income derived from said property to the decedent's wife, Mrs. Clara Rodes Hopkins, as long as she shall live. The premises above referred to, consisting of a lot approximately 25 feet by 98 feet 9 inches, improved with a 5-story and basement brick store and apartment building, and situated at 132 West 28th Street, New York City, being part of the residuum of said estate, was held by said Trustees from the date of probate of Dr. Hopkins' will, above set out, down to January 13, 1943, on which later date the said Mrs. Clara Rodes Hopkins died. And upon the death of the said Mrs. Hopkins this property passed under Article XIV of Dr. Hopkins' will to the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia.

I have been in correspondence with Guaranty Trust Company of New York, which Company handled the rental and management of this property for the Trustees above-named. This Company is continuing to handle the property for the University. The store room and four apartments in are all rented at the present time and I am advised by Guaranty Trust Company that the net income for the year 1943 will be about $1240.00. In 1939 the property was operated at an actual loss of $264.00, and return for each of the years 1940, 1941, and 1942 has been considerably less than the estimated net income for 1943. I do not think it would be wise for the University to continue to hold this property as an investment.

I am further advised by Guaranty Trust Company that the property was appraised in 1940 by Brown, Wheelock, Harris & Stevens, Inc., Real Estate Brokers, and Appraisers, of New York, as having a total value of $22,500.00. In the opinion of this appraisal firm said property now has a market value of approximately $20,000.00 although it is assessed for real estate taxes for the year 1942-43 at $33,000.00. Guaranty Trust Company seems to think that it might be possible to sell the property for as much as $20,000.00 upon payment of a small amount of the purchase price in cash and the balance secured to be paid in small installments over a long period of years. They advise me if we wish to sell for cash the place would probably bring not over $15,000.00.

I think all of the questions arising with reference to the management or sale of this property should be turned over to a Committee, with full power to act. May I suggest, therefore, that a Committee composed of the Rector, the President, and Mr. Hollis Rinehart, be appointed to make further investigation with reference to advisability of holding or of selling this property, and that if this Committee should reach the conclusion that the property should be sold, then the Committee should have full power to accept any offer deemed adequate by them, and fix any terms that they may think wise. The resolution, appointing this Committee, should also contain a clause giving full authority to the Rector, or to the President, to execute and deliver a deed conveying said property and the Secretary should be authorized to affix the corporate seal thereto and attest the same.

After consideration of the foregoing report, it was ordered spread on the minutes of this meeting, and the following resolution, offered by Goolrick and seconded by Lewis Williams, was unanimously adopted -

**RESOLVED**, that a Committee composed of the Rector, the President, and Mr. Hollis Rinehart, be and is hereby appointed, whose duty it shall be to familiarize themselves with the possible value and potentialities of the premises situated at 132 West 28th Street, New York City, which passed to the University under the will of the late Dr. William E. Hopkins, and said Committee is hereby given full and complete authority to continue the rental of said premises in the hands of the present rental agent, Guaranty Trust Company of New York, or of such other agent as they may select.

And said Committee is further given absolute authority to offer said premises for sale, listing the property with any real estate agent or agents, broker or brokers they may desire, and at such price as, in their opinion, may be adequate, with full power to accept or reject any and all offers that may be made for said property.

And in the event said Committee or any two of its members shall be of the opinion that said property shall be sold they may fix the terms and conditions of sale as to them may seem best and in the event a sale is made and it becomes necessary to deliver a deed to said premises, J. L. Newcomb, President, is hereby fully authorized to execute such deed in the name and on behalf of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, and the Secretary, E. I. Carruthers, is hereby empowered to affix the corporate seal thereto, attest the same, and to deliver said deed to the purchaser upon compliance by such purchaser with the terms of sale.

Mr. Perkins then stated that he had recently received a letter from Messrs. David, Polk, Wardwell, Sunderland & Kiendl, of 15 Broad Street, New York, Attorneys, who have been representing the Hopkins Estate in New York, with which the enclosed two copies of a proposed agreement between the University as owner of the premises on West 28th Street, and Guaranty Trust Company of New York as rental and sales agent thereof, asking that we would have both copies executed and returned to them for execution by Guaranty Trust Company, one copy in final executed form to be returned to us.

Mr. Perkins further stated that he had gone over this contract with the President and that upon the whole its provisions were satisfactory and that the Rector and President recommend the execution and delivery of the contract on behalf of the University. The following resolution offered by Mr. Corbett and seconded by Mr. Goolrick, was thereupon unanimously adopted:

**RESOLVED**, that the contract dated May 29, 1943, whereby the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia constitute Guaranty Trust Company of New York rental and sales agent for the purpose of managing and selling the premises situated at 132 West 28th Street in the Borough of Manhattan, City of New York, which passes to the University under the last will and testament of William E. Hopkins, deceased, in the form presented to this meeting, be and is hereby approved and the President is hereby authorized to execute said contract in the name and on behalf of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, the Secretary being authorized and directed to affix the corporate seal to said contract, to attest the same, and to deliver said contract to Guaranty Trust Company of New York.

### Report of Bonds and Stocks purchases by the Finance Committee of the Board for the endowment funds of the University from July 1, 1942 to date:

**RESOLVED**, that the action of the Finance Committee in purchasing the above described bonds be, and is hereby, approved.

Under date of May 7, 1943, Mr. Christopher B. Garnett, to whom was referred for investigation the property mentioned in the will of Mr. Riley, wrote the Rector and President, as follows:

You will probably recall that at a recent meeting of the Board of Visitors the matter of the devise by Joseph Harvey Riley to the University of Virginia as remainderman of his property, containing 8.312 acres in Falls Church, Virginia, was referred to me.

I have ascertained from my Fairfax office that the property which is the subject of this devise, located in the town of Falls Church, Fairfax County, Virginia, contains 8.312 acres and a residence thereon. This property, with the improvements, was assessed in the year 1942 at $4874, carrying a tax rate of $108.69. Property in Falls Church is usually assessed at 33 1/3% of its value. Mr. James U. Kicheloe, Commissioner of Revenue for Fairfax County, informs us that if the house is in any kind of condition the property is worth $20,000.

For your files I am enclosing herewith a copy of the holographic will of Joseph Harvey Riley, which was admitted to probate in the Clerk's Office of Fairfax County, Virginia on February 24, 1942, at which time Mr. Riley's sister, Margaret R. Parket, one of the beneficaries under his will, qualified as administratrix S.t.a.

The President advised the Board that the Governor had requested the submission of three names from the University faculty from which to select one for appointment to the State Art Commission for the usual term. Messrs. F. C. Disque, J. E. Canaday, and E. S. Campbell were nominated.

The following Ryan Scholarships were awarded for 1943-44:

The question of amending the present existing contract with the Monticello Dairy for supplying milk to the University Hospital was referred to the President & Mr. Rinehart with power to act.

The following resolution was adopted:

**RESOLVED**, that no student in any department of the University of Virginia shall, while the University is in session, maintain or operate a motor vehicle in the University, the City of Charlottesville, or the County of Albemarle, without the written consent of the Dean of the University.

It was voted to postpone acting upon the Fraternity House Hearing Committee report until a future meeting.

A general discussion of the Governor's proposal to co-ordinate Mary Washington College with the University as a college of liberal arts, was had, and the matter disposed of in the following resolution, adopted:

**RESOLVED**, that the Board approve the general plan proposed by the Governor of the consolidation of Mary Washington College with the University as a liberal arts college for women.

The President explained to the Board that he had a letter of intent from the United States Navy requiring the use of the University's property and teaching services for the operation of a Naval V-12 Unit. It was thereupon

**RESOLVED**, by the Board of Visitors of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that J. L. Newcomb, President, be and he is hereby authorized and directed to sign a contract or contracts between the United States of America and the University of Virginia, for the training of a Naval V-12 Unit at the University of Virginia, beginning July 1, 1943, and

**RESOLVED**, FURTHER, that E. I. Carruthers, Secretary of this Board, be and he is hereby authorized and directed to attest the signature, affix the seal, and certify that this resolution was passed by authority of the Governing Body of the University, and is within the scope of its corporate powers.

The following statement of the matter was received from the Bursar:

Robert Hamilton Williams of Olympia, Washington, entered the University of Virginia in September 1932 to take pre-medical work for the sessions of 1932-33 and 1933-34. In 1934 he entered the Department of Medicine from which he graduated in 1938.

Dr. Williams' mother and father were dead and he had very limited funds and worked his way through the University by doing any odd jobs that he could find. Friends here provided him with room and board for a considerable part of his stay at the University. He proved to be a very good student, and in order to help him in his effort, the University accepted five notes aggregating $1,349.55 (interest to January 1, 1943 amounts to $416.75) in part settlement of his fees, which amounted to approximately $2,000 for the six sessions he was at the University.

In 1938-39, following his graduation he served his internship at the University of Virginia for one year and for two years in the Mason Clinic, Seattle, Washington. Upon completion of his internship he entered the United States Navy as Lt. (jg) in the Medical Corps. He served on the USS Portland on which he was killed in action on December 7, 1942.

On November 7 we had a letter from Dr. Williams in which he stated, "My continuous touring the seas since the start of the war has made possible an opportunity for me to accumulate almost a years' salary—now on the books and untouched. Although I have promised to send frequent payments on my account it has been impossible and unwise. Since it is possible, I now prefer to pay off my indebtedness in a lump sum in full. Some time within the next month or six weeks I expect to be in port and I would like to have a statement of my account with interest figured to January 1, 1943. I will forward a check promptly upon receipt of your statement on my first visit to port." Statement was mailed him November 17, 1942 but he was killed in action before it reached him.

In due time, we took the matter up with his widow, sending her a copy of Dr. Williams' letter of November 7 and our reply of November 17. She advised us that there was no administrator or administratrix appointed to settle the estate of her late husband, as the only part of it requiring settlement was $250 in postal money orders which were turned over to her by the post office. She stated that what money she had at the time of his death was used for living expenses and for starting out in a new business, and that she would like to see her way clear to liquidate "Bob's" notes, but did not feel that she could do this. She would, however, be willing to borrow $1,000 if the University would be willing to accept this amount in full settlement of principal and interest. I replied that the matter would have to be brought before the Board before a compromise settlement could be considered,

On motion, it was

**RESOLVED**, that indebtedness of Dr. Williams, as set forth in the foregoing communication, be remitted in full.

On motion the meeting then adjourned.
