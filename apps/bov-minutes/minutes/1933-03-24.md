The minutes of the previous meeting, which had been copied and mailed to the members, were approved.

Acting President Newcomb stated to the members that his reason for calling them together at this time was to have their help in formulating plans for presentation of the needs of the University to the Governor and Budget Committee for their consideration in connection with the budget recommendations for the biennium 1934-36. The matter was given general consideration without any formal action being had.

The following announcements were made:

Upon the recommendation of the Acting President, a leave of absence was granted to Dr. James C. Bardin as set forth in the following resolution, adopted:

**RESOLVED**, by the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, That leave of absence be granted to Dr. James C. Bardin, of the Department of Romance Languages, for the remainder of the session, for the restoration of his health. Dr. Bardin has suffered a nervous breakdown, which necessitates complete rest for the remainder of this session. This leave of absence will involve the University in no additional expense.

A request was received from the Zeta Psi fraternity to which the University had made a loan of **$20,000** for the purpose of erecting a chapter house here, for a reduction in the interest rate of **6%** on the said loan. After due consideration, the request was declined.

An application was received from the Montalto Corporation, the holding company owning the real estate and all the personal property occupied and used by the Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity, at the University of Virginia, for a loan of **$20,000** to take up maturing notes on said property. After due consideration, the application was declined.

Mr. Newcomb stated that the State Highway Department, in continuing highway **#29** northward from Ivy Road, desired to connect up same on a direct line with the road west of the Memorial Gymnasium, and that in order to do so it would be necessary to remove the filling station on the north side of said Ivy Road, and that the present owner had agreed to remove said filling station, provided the University grant him sufficient land on the east side of the proposed route abutting on the Ivy Road on which to relocate said filling station. It was therefore

**RESOLVED**, by the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, That they concur in a recommendation of the State Highway Department that a strip of the University's land thirty feet wide, on Route **#39**, and running out to nothing at the intersection of the property dedicated for an outlet to the Ivy Road Cottage Company's property, be conveyed by the Legislature of Virginia to Miss Carrie Davis for the use of a filling station. The purpose of this is to enable the State Highway Department to continue Route **#29** north on a straight line with its present location just west of the Memorial Gymnasium.

The Acting President read certain correspondence between Dr. J. C. Flippin, Dean of the Medical Department, and Governor Pollard with respect to additional funds from the State to provide medical treatment of the indigent sick which the University Hospital cannot now care for due to lack of funds. After due consideration, it was

**RESOLVED**, that if the Governor can provide additional funds for the care of indigent patients in the University Hospital, conditioned upon a reduction of **20%** in the salaries and wages of the personnel, then the President is authorized to put such reduction in said salaries and wages into effect.

Mr. Perkins, attorney for the University, presented a copy of the will of Benjamin Altschul, of the City of New York, which will was admitted to probate in the Surrogate's Court for the City of New York, on the 5th day of August, 1932. Under the second clause of this will, Mr. Altschul gives to the University of Virginia the sum of **$5,000.00** upon condition that the principal be retained intact for a period of twenty-five years from date of payment thereof, and that during said twenty-five years the income therefrom shall be used for the purpose for which the University was formed, and after said period of twenty-five years the principal may be used for any purpose lawful under the charter of the University. Said will contains a further provision that before said legacy is paid the University shall "through its duly authorized officers signify in writing its consent to accept such bequest with the condition above named, and such consent to contain an agreement on the part of such Institution to carry out the condition above named, to use only the income as above stated, and that in the event that such condition be broken that the amount of the legacy shall revert back to the Estate and be disposed of as provided for the disposition of the residuary estate, and such written consent to be filed with the executors within one year after the issuance of letters testamentary".

By a codicil to said will, Mr. Altschul provides that said bequest shall not be paid in cash but that it shall be paid in such securities as his Executrix, Mrs. Celia Altschul, may designate, said securities to be turned over to the University at their par value.

A copy of said will and codicil was presented to the meeting by Mr. Perkins, and was ordered filed with the minutes of this meeting:

Mr. Perkins also presented to said meeting a paper prepared by him, expressing the consent of the Rector and Visitors to the conditions of said bequest, and agreement on its part to carry out the conditions expressed in the will. He stated that the paper in its present form has been submitted to and approved by Mr. Joshua Sprayregen, of 1450 Broadway, New York City, attorney for the Altschul Estate. It was thereupon,

**RESOLVED**, that the Board doth hereby accept said bequest under the conditions set out in the will of said Benjamin Altschul, above referred to, and that we do hereby expressly agree to carry out the condition expressed in said will, to use only the income as required by said will and in the event such condition be broken by the University, the amount of said legacy shall revert back to the estate of the said Benjamin Altschul, to be disposed of in accordance with the provisions of said will, and in order that the further provisions of said will may be strictly complied with, the Rector is requested to execute, in the name and on behalf of the University, the written consent and agreement presented to this meeting, and the Secretary of this Board is requested to affix our corporate seal thereto.

The meeting then adjourned.
