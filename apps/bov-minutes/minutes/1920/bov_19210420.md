A called meeting of the Rector and Visitors was held on this date a 8 o'clock P. M., at which were present the Rector, John Stewart Bryan, and Visitors E. L. Greever, Harris Hart, Goodrich Hatton, Walter T. Oliver, Alex. F. Robertson and C. Harding Walker, and President Alderman.

The minutes of the previous meeting, copies of which had been mailed to each member for verification, were approved.

The President announced the following gifts:

$50,000 from the General Education Board to be used for salary increases from 1921-24.

John Bassett Moore Library of International Law, from Hon. John Bassett Moore.

$600.00 a year from State Board of Health to Venereal Clinic at Hospital.

$246.50 from the Education Club to the Department of Education.

Bronze tablet, in memory of his brother, the late Professor Harry Heck, from Mr. George C. Heck, of New York City, to the Heck Memorial Library.

Portrait of President Woodrew Wilson (by Duncan Smith) from the Norfolk and Portsmouth Alumni Association.

Portrait of Mr. John B. Cobb (by Eugene Speicher) for the Cobb Chemical Laboratory.

Portriat of Professor F. P. Dunnington (by Leon A. Makielski) from his former students.

Four books from Mr. Graham Harris, of Greenwood, Va., to the General Library.

Catalogue of Cruikshank and Dickens from W. A. Clark, Jr., to the General Library.

"The Lafayette Flying Corps", Vol. I and II, to the General Library, from Mr. A. Courtney Campbell.

In reference to the gift of Hon. John Bassett Moore, the following resolution was adopted:

RESOLVED, That the thanks of the Rector and Visitors be extended to John Bassett Moore by President Alderman for his very splendid and valuable gift to the University of Virginia.

The following letter was received from Mr. John Bassett Moore in reference to his gift:

On the approach of the Centennial Celebration, and on the Founder's birthday, I desire to enter upon the execution of a long-cherished design to present to my Alma Mater a library of international law. I would begin the collection this year, and would from time to time add to it, making a final contribution, including probably a part of my own library, under my will or such indications as my family would carry out.

To this gift the principal condition I attach is that the collection shall form a part of the Law Library and shall be kept intact. Although the volumes included in it would not all be what are commonly called law-books, yet they would all have some special relation to what I have found the needs of the student, the teacher, and the practitioner of international law actually to be. Moreover, having always been accustomed to look upon the body of rules governing the intercourse of nations as a branch of law, I wish in every way to emphasize the legal nature of the subject, and particularly to empress on those who would understand the system, and above all on those who would essay to expound it, the fundamental requisite of a thorough and comprehensive education in law, private as well as public.

I should also be glad if the collection might be distinctively preserved as the John Bassett Moore Library of International Law. This request is mainly prompted by the hope that the example, with which the collection thus named would be associated, of a life largely spent in the study, the exposition and the administration of international law, might quicken in others an interest in the subject and in the public service.

Believe me to be, as always,

On behalf of the Board, Dr. Alderman wrote Mr. Moore as follows:

It was my honnor and pleasure to make known to the Rector and Visitors of the University, at their meeting on April 20, 1921, your letter setting forth your gift - the John Bassett Moore Library of International Law - to the University of Virginia. I was directed by the Board to express to you their gratitude and appreciation of this splendid service to the University. The Board is largely composed of members of the legal profession, and you may imagine their pleasure and satisfaction at the thought of such new strength will be added to that side of our University life. I was also instructed to say that your letter will be spread upon the minutes and that all of the conditions will be faithfully adhered to.

Assuring you of the appreciation of the whole University, I have the honor to remail,

The General Education Board is holding its mid-winter meeting on February 24th, in New York City. I have just had a visit from the fiscal agent of that Board. I am convinced that the sum of $50,000 may be obtained through that Board from the sum given by Mr. Rockefeller some years ago for salary increases in American colleges. Certain sums have already been granted to the University of North Carolina, William and Mary, and the University of Alabama, under just the same circumstances. I could not bring the matter before the Board at the other meeting because I had not then had the visit of the representative of the Board here. It is necessary for the General Board to know that I am speaking by authority of the governing body, or they would not feel inclined to make any gifts to a State institution without fore-knowledge that it would be acceptable. Mr. Carruthers will explain any details connected with the situation. I am hoping to have a wire from you by Wednesday night, Hotel Wolcott, 31st Street, New York, authorizing me to present the inclosed application. It was specifically stated that action indicating the purpose to make this application by the Executive Committee would be sufficient.

On behalf of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, I am submitting, through you, to the General Education Board, an application for an appropriation of $50,000, to be applied to salary increases of the instructional staff in the University during the academic years 1921-22, 1922-23, 1923-24. It is desired to use the sum asked for both to relieve the present salary situation as regards increases already made and to make such further increases as would tend to stabilize justly the present salary schedule and to afford relief to those manifestly underpaid. The University expects to obtain the necessary funds within the time mentioned to take the place of this grant in order that they may guarantee the permanence of the increased scale and to increase it in so far as that may appear resonable and helpful to the institution.

The fundamental reasons for this request is the inability of the University to meet the need for salary increases without serious deficit and the constantly increasing demands of the unusual influx of new students due to the same causes which are operating in all American colleges and universities.

Pursuant to our conversation in Mr. Scott's office last Wednesday, the following is the estimate of the epxenses of the Endowment Fund campaign which I was to supply you. You will understand of course, that it is very difficult to make a close estimate, because we much be ready to meet conditions as they arise, which may call for additional and unforeseen expense:

If you deem it necessary to enlarge any on this by itemizing the expense of salaries of Crenshaw, his stenographers, and Trimmer and his stenographers, you may do so, as you have the figures available.
