The Rector, also, presented several letters which had been received by him from Mrs. Rodes. After the reading of the letter to the Governor and some consideration of the matter, it was referred to a special committee consisting of Williams and Scott to investigate and report back to the Board.

Mr. Scott was appointed to represent the Rector and Visitors at a meeting of the Governing Bodies of State Universities to be held in Chicago, November 12th and 13th.

In the matter of the lease of a lot to the Kappa Alpha Fraternity, a letter from Mr. Cyrus Beale to Mr. McIntire was read, and the matter of location of the proposed house generally discussed and disposed of in the following resolution:

RESOLVED, That the Kappa Alpha Fraternity was granted a site on McCormick Road for the purpose of erecting a fraternity house and the land approved was for a house to be a reproduction of Stratford, the plans to be approved by the University authorities.

Upon the recommendation of the President the fees in the Law School were remitted for Mr. Robert Lee Marshall.

Request of Mrs. Fickenscher and Mr. Makielski for permission to erect a garage connected with the small house in rear of Varsity Hall was granted subject to approval of Profs. Hudnut and Lambeth.

The following substitute lease to the Alpha Home Association, in lieu of the one made at the meeting of the Board, October 17, 1922, wherein a site was granted for the erection of a Chapter House, which had been prepared by the Attorney for the University, was presented by him, read and approved.

Attorney for the University recalled to the Board the fact that by a contract under date of November 1, 1922, the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia leased to Alpha Home Association a lot of land for the purpose of erection by said Alpha Home Association of a Fraternity House thereon. Mr. Perkins further stated that although said contract was executed on behalf of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, and on behalf of the Alpha Home Association, and an original copy delivered to each of these Corporations, that it has since been learned that at the time of said execution said Alpha Home Association had no corporated existence by reason of the fact that its charter was revoked and annulled in May, 1918, by failure of the Corporation to pay franchise tax to the State of Virginia.

Mr. Perkins further stated that a new organization of this Corporation had been effected and a new charter granted by the State Corporation Commission under date of July 12, 1923; that at a meeting held on the 25th of September 1923, at the home of Mr. Wm. H. Echols at the University of Virginia an organization of this new Corporation had been effected with Mr. William A. Kepner, President, Mr. Coleman C. Walker, Vice-President, and Mr. Thomas L. Rosser, Jr., Secretary-Treasurer, these three gentlemen constituting the Board of Directors and the membership of the Association being made up of some of the resident alumni of Alpha Chapter of Chi Phi and a number of active members of said Chapter.

Furthermore it seems that under date of May 9, 1923, said Alpha Home Association, although then without authority, by reason of the forfeiture of its charter, as aforesaid, entered into a contract with the Charlottesville Lumber Company of Charlottesville, Virginia, for the erection of a Fraternity House on the lot which had been leased from the University, the contract price for said house being $33,625.00; that upon faith of said contract said Lumber Company has proceeded with the work upon said house until now it is almost completed.

By a previous resolution of this Board a loan of $15,000.00 to said Alpha Home Association had been provided for and the greater portion of this fund is now in hand and ready to be lent to said Alpha Home Association.

Through said attorney for the University said Alpha Home Association now requests that this loan be increased to $20,000.00, bonds of said Association to be given to the University in evidence of this loan and secured by deed of trust constituting a first lien upon said Fraternity House and all right, title or interest held by said Association in the lot upon which it stands, by virtue of the lease above referred to.

Mr. Perkins further presented to the Board a new lease under date of October 12, 1923, indentical in form with the lease above referred to under date of November 1, 1922, except as to change of dates.

A full discussion of the situation was had and it was thereupon resolved that the Rector be, and is hereby requested to execute this new lease on behalf of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, and the Secretary of this Board be instructed to affix the seal of the Corporation thereto.

It is further resolved that the application of said Alpha Home Association for an increase on the loan above referred to from $15,000.00 to $20,000.00 be granted and the attorney for the University is hereby instructed to examine the bonds and deed of trust offered by said Association as security for this loan, the Bursar being directed not to turn over the funds until he is advised by Mr. Perkins that all legal formalities have been complied with by said Alpha Home Association, the terms of said loan to be fixed by the Finance Committee.

The Rector and Secretary were authorized to execute a contract with the City of Charlottesville and the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway for the removal of the present bridge over the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway tracks on Rugby Road and the erection in its place of a modern cement bridge, in the following resolution:

The attorney for the University presented to the meeting a copy of a contract under date of August 14th, 1923, between the Chesapeake & Ohio Railroad Company of the first part, the City of Charlottesville of the second part, and the University of Virginia of the third part, which contract, in its preamble, makes reference to the following facts:-

"Whereas at the Rugby Road Railroad crossing at present there is a foot bridge seven feet wide, built and owned jointly by the party of the first part and the party of the third part, under contract dated April 12, 1912, and a wagon bridge eleven feet wide, owned by the party of the second part, with the space of from twelve to fifteen feet between the two bridges.

"And whereas said City of Charlottesville is now erecting a modern highway bridge of concrete construction which is designed to take the place of both these bridges".

The contract further provides that in consideration of certain benefits enuring to said party of the first part by reason of the erection of this new bridge it will contribute $21,000.00 toward the construction thereof. And said contract contains a provision that-"the present foot bridge over the railroad is to be abandoned and removed by the party of the second part at its entire cost and expense; and the parties of the first and third parts thereto agree that upon abandonment and removal of said bridge, the aforementioned agreement dated April 12, 1912, is to terminate and become null and void".

Mr. Perkins further showed to the Board a blueprint, upon which plans and elevations of said proposed bridge were shown, and upon which it appears that said proposed bridge is to have roadway thirty-two feet wide with sidewalk on each side, said sidewalk to be nine feet, two inches in width.

After the discussion of the situation it was thereupon

RESOLVED, That it is the sense of this Board that the construction of said new bridge will be a decided improvement and greatly enhance the ease of approach to Lambeth Field, and that the interests of the University will be furthered by the execution of said contract and the abandonment of the old foot bridge, therefore the Rector is requested to execute said contract on behalf of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, and the Secretary of this Board is instructed to affix the seal of the Corporation thereto.

THIS AGREEMENT made and entered into this 14th day of August 1923 by and between The Chesapeake and Ohio Railway Company, party of the first part, the City of Charlottesville, Virginia, party of the second part and the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, party of the third part.

Whereas, the party of the second part is paving Water Street in Charlottesville from Main Street to Seventh Street, including the driveway at the passenger station, of the party of the first part, as shown on drawing No. 5948, a print of which is attached hereto, made a part of this agreement and marked for identification:

"THE CHESAPEAKE AND OHIO RAILWAY COMPANY CHIEF ENGINEER'S OFFICE - RICHMOND, VA. PROPOSED PAVING OF WATER STREET AND AROUND PASSENGER STATION CHARLOTTESVILLE, - VIRGINIA CLIFTON FORGE DIVISION

and the party of the second part is also erecting a modern highway bridge of concrete construction at Rugby Road in Charlottesville, as shown on drawing No. 5479, a print of which is attached hereto, made a part of this agreement and marked for identification:

"THE CHESAPEAKE & OHIO RAILWAY COMPANY CHIEF ENGINEER'S OFFICE RICHMOND, VA. PROPOSED HIGHWAY BRIDGE FOR RUGBY AVENUE THE CITY OF CHARLOTTESVILLE VIRGINIA CLIFTON FORGE DIV. MOUNTAIN DIST.

and, whereas, the paving of Water Street will much improve the public way to both the freight and passenger station of the party of the first part and will be an incentive to the general public to patronize these two stations, and

Whereas, at Rugby Road crossing, at present, there is a foot bridge 7 ft. wide, built and owned jointly by the party of the first part and the party of the third part under contract dated April 12, 1912, and a wagon bridge 11 ft. wide owned by the party of the second part, with a space of from 10 to 15 ft. between the two bridges. Rugby Road is the principal thoroughfare to the athletic grounds of the University of Virginia and most of the people attending athletic meets pass over these two bridges. Due to the large number of people using these bridges at the same time, there is danger is some of them being pushed over the sides of the bridges and also of automobiles falling through on the tracks.

In consideration of the reduced liability of accidents to persons and property at Rugby Road Crossing, account of the construction of the new concrete bridge, and further on account of the benefits to it account of the paving of Water Street and the driveway at the passenger station, the party of the first part agrees to donate to the party of the second part the sum of Twelve Thousand (12,000) Dollars toward the construction of the said concrete bridge at Rugby Road, the payment of same to be made at or before the completion of the said new bridge and said paving of Water Street and driveway at passenger station.

It is understood and agreed by and between the parties of the first and second part that the party of the second part will, upon its completion, maintain that portion of the paving which is located on the property of the party of the first part at the passenger station.

It is further understood and agreed by and between the party of the first part and the party of the second part that the party of the second part will upon its completion, own and maintain the new highway bridge over Rugby Road and the party of the second part further agrees that the work of constructing this bridge will be done so as not to interfere with the operation of the tracks of the party of the first part and that it, the party of the second part, assumes full responsibility for any injury to persons or damage to property which may occur during construction of the new bridge or in the operation and maintenance of same.

The parties of the first and second parts agree that the party of the second part will abandon and remove the present wagon bridge at Rugby Road at its entire cost and expense.

The parties hereto agree that the present foot bridge at Rugby Road is to be abandoned and removed by the party of the second part at its entire cost and expense, and the parties of the first and third parts further agree that upon the abandonment and removal of the said foot bridge, the aforementioned agreement dated April 12, 1912 is to terminate and become null and void.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the party of the first part has caused this writing to be signed by G. B. Wall its Vice-President thereunto duly authorized and its corporate seal to be hereunto affixed, the party of the second part has caused this writing to be signed by E. A.

## DEED OF GIFT OF $10,000.00 
FROM AN ANONYMOUS DONOR
TO THE RECTOR AND VISITORS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA 
TO ESTABLISH THE RICHARD HENRY WHITEHEAD SCHOLARSHIP FUND IN THE DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA

1. This Deed of Gift establishes for the Department of Medicine of the University of Virginia a Fund to be known as the Richard Henry Whitehead Scholarship Fund as a memorial to Richard Henry Whitehead, Professor of Anatomy and Dean of the Department of Medicine of the University of Virginia from 1906 to 1916. This memorial is to take the form of a scholarship or scholarships to students in the Department of Medicine of the University of Virginia, these scholarships to be known as the Richard Henry Whitehead Scholarships and referred to hereinafter as the Whitehead Scholarships.

2. To establish and maintain the aforesaid Richard Henry Whitehead Scholarship Fund,- the sum of $10,000 is herewith paid to the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia or their successors, hereinafter referred to as the Rector and Visitors or the holding board. The said Rector and Visitors or their successors shall invest the original capital fund of $10,000.00 and those additions to the same provided for in Section 3 in such securities as are at the time of investment customarily used by the trustees of American universities for the investment of their endowment funds, and shall use the income from these investments, as hereinafter directed. The Rector and Visitors are also empowered to receive, with or without restrictions as to investment, additions to the Whitehead Scholarship Fund from other sources, provided the income from these additions is expended for the same purpose and in the manner provided in sections 5, 6, and 7 of this deed of gift.

3. During the first twenty years after the establishment of the Whitehead Scholarship Fund, the Rector and Visitors shall on each anniversary of the establishment of the said Fund or on such other annual date as may best fit the business program of the University of Virginia add one-fifth of the income of the previous year to the principal of the Fund and from time to time, as the accumulated additions and the state of the investment market make investment desirable, invest the same in the securities indicated in Section 2 of this deed, pending investment the investment the annual additions shall be deposited on interest in Virginia savings banks. At the end of each twenty year period the Rector and Visitors may at their discretion increase or decrease the percentage of the annual income to be added to the existing principal of the Fund, provided that in no case shall this addition be less than one-fifth nor more than one-third the annual income.

4. The annual income remaining after the aforesaid addition to the principal shall be paid to the holder or holders of the Whitehead Scholarship or Scholarships, awarded by the committee of the Medical Faculty of the Medical Faculty of the University of Virginia as hereinafter provided.

5. The appointments to be Whitehead Scholarships shall be made by a committee of the Medical Faculty of the University of Virginia - hereinafter referred to as the Whitehead Scholarship Committee, - consisting of the Dean of the Department of Medicine, Chairman, ex-Officio, and the full professors of Gross and Microscopic Anatomy, Biochemistry, Physiology, Bacteriology, Pathology, and Pharmacology. The Whitehead Scholarship Committee is herewith authorized to make from time to time such changes in the personel of the Committee as they think wise, subject to the approval of the Rector and Visitors, as follows, the proposed change or changes in personel shall be submitted by the Whitehead Scholarship Committee at least three months in advance of the next meeting of the Rector and Visitors and shall go into effect immediately after the aforesaid meeting of the Rector and Visitors, unless disapproved by that time by the Rector and Visitors.

The said Whitehead Scholarship Committee is herewith charged with the duty of determining the terms upon which the scholarships shall be awarded, the number of such scholarships, and the stipend to be paid to each recipient, with the sole proviso that the terms of award of the scholarship adopted by the Whitehead Scholarship Committee are subject to the veto of the Rector and Visitors in the same manner and under the same conditions as provided in this section in the case of proposed changes in the personel of the Whitehead Scholarship Committee.

6. The donor would define his object in this gift as the establishment of a memorial to Dr. Whitehead in harmony with the ideals of service which characterized Dr. Whitehead's life work.

The donor believes that it is unwise to attach to such a gift perpetual and fixed restrictions since such restrictions might at some future time hamper the best use of the fund. Therefore the Whitehead Scholarship Committee with the approval of the holding board is authorized after forty years from the date of this gift to alter from time to time any of the restrictions, provided only that the fund used either directly or indirectly to aid deserving students to prepare themselves for any branch of medicine-whether it be teaching, research, or practice.

7. The income of the fund may be used to assist any deserving student in the Medical Department of the University of Virginia without regard to the time such students have previously spent in their medical studies. But, since it is the donor's hope that the fund will in general be used to aid students whose future work will contribute to the progress of medical knowledge, it is not probable that it will often be possible to judge a students' qualifications for this kind of work before the end of the second year of his medical studies. The donor believes that the purpose of the fund would be admirably served if it were used to encourage promising students of medicine to enter upon a career of medical teaching or medical research either in the medical sciences or in the clinical branches. To accomplish this object the Whitehead Scholarship Committee might consider it advisable to award the scholarship, with suitable obligations, to the same individual for a number of years.

The above deed of gift is herewith, at the request of the anonymous donor, transmitted through me, as Dean of the Department of Medicine of the University of Virginia to the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia.

## RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE WHITEHEAD SCHOLARSHIP COMMITTEE

These scholarships have been established in the Department of Medicine by an anonymous donor with the general purpose expressed in the two following paragraphs of the deed of gift.

"The donor would define his object in this gift as the establishment of a memorial to Dr. Whitehead in harmony with the ideals of service which characterized Dr. Whitehead's life work."

"Since it is the donor's hope that the fund will in general be used to aid students whose future work will contribute to the progress of medical knowledge, it is not probable that it will often be possible to judge a student's qualification for this kind of work before the end of the second year of his medical studies. The donor believes that the purpose of this fund would be admirably served if it were used to encourage promising students of medicine to enter upon a career of medical teaching or medical research either in the medical sciences or in the clinical branches."

The determination of the conditions of appointment and the appointments themselves are placed by the deed of gift in the hand of the Whitehead Scholarship Committee, consisting of the Dean of the Department of Medicine, chairman ex officio, and the full professors of the medical sciences. Accordingly the present committee consists of Drs. Hough, Bean, Jordan, Marshall, and Waddell. This Committee herewith makes the following announcement of the terms of appointment.

1. Two scholarships are established, the income of the Whitehead Scholarship Fund being divided equally between the two. For the session 1923-24 the emolument of each scholarship will be $200. It is expected to be somewhat larger than this in subsequent years, - about $240.00 for the session "24-25 and increasing slightly each year thereafter.

2. Appointments are open to all students who have completed the second or the third year of the medical course and also to Graduates of the Academic Department of the University of Virginia who have completed the first year of the medical course. The Committee however feels that only in exceptional cases will they be in a position to judge wisely of the qualifications of a student before the completion of his second year in medicine, nor is it likely that the student himself will often be in a position to decide wisely between the alternative of private practice or a career of medical teaching or research before the completion of the second year in medicine.

3. The appointment are made for a period of one year only; but may be renewed and will always be renewed for at least a second year on the basis of satisfactory attainments in scholarship. The tenure of the scholarship may be prolonged to three or even to a maximum of four years in the case of those who show distinct aptitude for and attainment in research.

4. Acceptance of an appointment to a Whitehead Scholarship implies that the student is attracted toward a career of medical teaching or medical research either in the fundamental medical sciences or in the clinical branches. The recipient assumes no contractual obligation to enter upon this career after graduation nor is it required that the money be repaid in case of change of decision as to his life work. It is, however, a gentleman's understanding between all recipients and the Committee that students will not apply for appointment unless they are really attracted toward those fields of medical work which, in the words of the deed of gift, "contribute to the advance of medical knowledge" and unless they have at the time of appointment the intention of giving the career of teacher or investigator a fair trial of at least one year after graduation. This may be done by acceptance of a teaching or research position after graduation, either in the University of Virginia or elsewhere.

5. The first appointment to a Whitehead Scholarship must always be made while the recipient is a student in the Medical Department of the University of Virginia; but reappointments may extend over one or more years following graduation, whether the student continues his studies in the University of Virginia or elsewhere. Reappointments after graduation will in no case be made for the year of an ordinary hospital internship. Reappointments after graduation however are consistent with the acceptance of teaching fellowships or research fellowships in the University of Virginia or elsewhere.

6. In all cases the recipient of a Whitehead Scholarship will be expected to prove his interest in the advance of medical knowledge by undertaking in addition to his required medical course some special study in the medical sciences or clinical branches and to submit before the end of the year a thesis giving the result of completed work or a statement of the progress of incompleted work.

7. Hereafter applications for appointment to a Whitehead Scholarship must be made prior to June 15 each year to the Dean of the Department of Medicine on blank forms supplied for this purpose. Applications for reappointment must similarly be made on the same forms accompanied by evidence of special work of a research character undertaken during the previous year of tenure.

I have thought for sometime that I wanted to do something for my Alma Mater - the University of Virginia - to which I owe so much; but when the drive was on for the University I had been in the Army for more than two years with my personal and family expenses more than three times what my income was and I was not certain about the future.

In my opinion there is already a shortage of doctors in the United States and in the near future the need of physicians will be more acute and I would like to do something to help some young man to take up the study of medicine at the University of Virginia. I therefore desire to establish a scholarship, at the University, of $1,000.00, payable in ten annual payments of $100.00 each, without interest, due on September 1st of each year; this scholarship to be known as the Dr. Charles Hooks Harris scholarship in memory of my father. The $100.00 a year is to be loaned by the University of Virginia to a student in the Medical-Department, the loan to bear interest at 4% and to be paid back to the University within four years after graduation of the student receiving the scholarship. A perpetual fund may be established in this way to be used to aid young men from the South in the study of medicine.

I was born and reared at Cedartown, Georgia, and if there is a student residing in Cedartown studying medicine, I would prefer the loan to be made to him; the student to receive the loan to be selected by the Superintendent and Principal of the High School of the Cedartown public schools and my brother J. C. Harris, Superintendent of the Georgia School for the Deaf, Cave Springs, Georgia. If no student from Cedartown desires this loan, it is to be given out by the University at the discretion of the President and Dean of the Medical Department of the University.

There is need for many such scholarships and there are many young men who would go to college if they could get $100 or $200 a year help. If this fact can be shown to our alumni, many will gladly give a hundred dollars a year to such a fund.

I am hoping that you will be visiting Birmingham sometime and, if so, will be delighted to entertain you in my home.

With best wishes for the University, and for yourself personally, I am

## RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE WHITEHEAD SCHOLARSHIP COMMITTEE

These scholarships have been established in the Department of Medicine by an anonymous donor with the general purpose expressed in the two following paragraphs of the deed of gift.

"The donor would define his object in this gift as the establishment of a memorial to Dr. Whitehead in harmony with the ideals of service which characterized Dr. Whitehead's life work."

"Since it is the donor's hope that the fund will in general be used to aid students whose future work will contribute to the progress of medical knowledge, it is not probable that it will often be possible to judge a student's qualification for this kind of work before the end of the second year of his medical studies. The donor believes that the purpose of this fund would be admirably served if it were used to encourage promising students of medicine to enter upon a career of medical teaching or medical research either in the medical sciences or in the clinical branches."

The determination of the conditions of appointment and the appointments themselves are placed by the deed of gift in the hand of the Whitehead Scholarship Committee, consisting of the Dean of the Department of Medicine, chairman ex officio, and the full professors of the medical sciences. Accordingly the present committee consists of Drs. Hough, Bean, Jordan, Marshall, and Waddell. This Committee herewith makes the following announcement of the terms of appointment.

1. Two scholarships are established, the income of the Whitehead Scholarship Fund being divided equally between the two. For the session 1923-24 the emolument of each scholarship will be $200. It is expected to be somewhat larger than this in subsequent years, - about $240.00 for the session "24-25 and increasing slightly each year thereafter.

2. Appointments are open to all students who have completed the second or the third year of the medical course and also to Graduates of the Academic Department of the University of Virginia who have completed the first year of the medical course. The Committee however feels that only in exceptional cases will they be in a position to judge wisely of the qualifications of a student before the completion of his second year in medicine, nor is it likely that the student himself will often be in a position to decide wisely between the alternative of private practice or a career of medical teaching or research before the completion of the second year in medicine.

3. The appointment are made for a period of one year only; but may be renewed and will always be renewed for at least a second year on the basis of satisfactory attainments in scholarship. The tenure of the scholarship may be prolonged to three or even to a maximum of four years in the case of those who show distinct aptitude for and attainment in research.

4. Acceptance of an appointment to a Whitehead Scholarship implies that the student is attracted toward a career of medical teaching or medical research either in the fundamental medical sciences or in the clinical branches. The recipient assumes no contractual obligation to enter upon this career after graduation nor is it required that the money be repaid in case of change of decision as to his life work. It is, however, a gentleman's understanding between all recipients and the Committee that students will not apply for appointment unless they are really attracted toward those fields of medical work which, in the words of the deed of gift, "contribute to the advance of medical knowledge" and unless they have at the time of appointment the intention of giving the career of teacher or investigator a fair trial of at least one year after graduation. This may be done by acceptance of a teaching or research position after graduation, either in the University of Virginia or elsewhere.

5. The first appointment to a Whitehead Scholarship must always be made while the recipient is a student in the Medical Department of the University of Virginia; but reappointments may extend over one or more years following graduation, whether the student continues his studies in the University of Virginia or elsewhere. Reappointments after graduation will in no case be made for the year of an ordinary hospital internship. Reappointments after graduation however are consistent with the acceptance of teaching fellowships or research fellowships in the University of Virginia or elsewhere.

6. In all cases the recipient of a Whitehead Scholarship will be expected to prove his interest in the advance of medical knowledge by undertaking in addition to his required medical course some special study in the medical sciences or clinical branches and to submit before the end of the year a thesis giving the result of completed work or a statement of the progress of incompleted work.

7. Hereafter applications for appointment to a Whitehead Scholarship must be made prior to June 15 each year to the Dean of the Department of Medicine on blank forms supplied for this purpose. Applications for reappointment must similarly be made on the same forms accompanied by evidence of special work of a research character undertaken during the previous year of tenure.

I have thought for sometime that I wanted to do something for my Alma Mater - the University of Virginia - to which I owe so much; but when the drive was on for the University I had been in the Army for more than two years with my personal and family expenses more than three times what my income was and I was not certain about the future.

In my opinion there is already a shortage of doctors in the United States and in the near future the need of physicians will be more acute and I would like to do something to help some young man to take up the study of medicine at the University of Virginia. I therefore desire to establish a scholarship, at the University, of $1,000.00, payable in ten annual payments of $100.00 each, without interest, due on September 1st of each year; this scholarship to be known as the Dr. Charles Hooks Harris scholarship in memory of my father. The $100.00 a year is to be loaned by the University of Virginia to a student in the Medical-Department, the loan to bear interest at 4% and to be paid back to the University within four years after graduation of the student receiving the scholarship. A perpetual fund may be established in this way to be used to aid young men from the South in the study of medicine.

I was born and reared at Cedartown, Georgia, and if there is a student residing in Cedartown studying medicine, I would prefer the loan to be made to him; the student to receive the loan to be selected by the Superintendent and Principal of the High School of the Cedartown public schools and my brother J. C. Harris, Superintendent of the Georgia School for the Deaf, Cave Springs, Georgia. If no student from Cedartown desires this loan, it is to be given out by the University at the discretion of the President and Dean of the Medical Department of the University.

There is need for many such scholarships and there are many young men who would go to college if they could get $100 or $200 a year help. If this fact can be shown to our alumni, many will gladly give a hundred dollars a year to such a fund.

I am hoping that you will be visiting Birmingham sometime and, if so, will be delighted to entertain you in my home.

With best wishes for the University, and for yourself personally, I am
