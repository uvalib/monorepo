WHEREAS said Loan Agreement has been read once in full to the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia at this meeting; and

WHEREAS said Loan Agreement has been heretofore approved by the Governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia, as evidenced by his signature affixed to the copy thereof heretofore read in full at this meeting; and

WHEREAS pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 49 of the Acts of the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Virginia, passed at the extra session of said General Assembly of 1933, and approved by the Governor of said Commonwealth of Virginia, on September 12th, 1933, The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia is authorized to cause the execution of said Loan Agreement, and to carry out fully and perform all of the terms and conditions thereof, and to adopt this Resolution:

Now, therefore, be it

## RESOLVED BY THE BOARD OF VISITORS OF THE RECTOR AND VISITORS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA, A STATE INSTITUTION IN THE COMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA, as follows:

Section 1. That the following Loan Agreement, referred to in the recitals hereof, and in form substantially as follows, be, and the same hereby is, approved:

1. Purpose of Agreement. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the United States of America, (herein called the "Government") will, by loan and grant not exceeding in the aggregate the sum of $208,500.00 (herein called the "Allotment"), aid THE RECTOR AND VISITORS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA, Charlottesville, Albemarle County, Virginia, (herein called the "Borrower") in financing a project, (herein called the "Project"), consisting substantially of the construction of a three-story and basement fireproof addition to existing hospital building at Charlottesville, Virginia, all pursuant to the Borrower's application (herein called the "Application"), P. W. A. Docket No. 4881. Title II of the National Industrial Recovery Act (herein called the "Act") and the Constitution and Statutes of the Commonwealth of Virginia, (herein called the "State").

2. Amount and Method of Making Loan. The Borrower will sell and the Government will buy, at the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest, $158,000.00 aggregate principal amount of negotiable coupon bonds (herein called the "Bonds"), of the description outlined below, or such other description as may be satisfactory to the Borrower and to the Administrator, bearing interest at the rate of 4 percent per annum, payable semi-annually from date until maturity, less such amount of the Bonds, if any, as the Borrower may sell to purchasers other than the Government.

(a) Date: January 1, 1935.

(b) Denomination: $1000.00.

(c) Place of Payment: At the office of the Bursar of the Borrower, Charlottesville, Virginia, or, at the option of the holder, at a Bank or Trust Company in the Borough of Manhattan, City and State of New York.

(d) Registration Privileges: Registerable as to principal only, or as to both principal and interest.

(e) Maturities: Payable, without option of prior redemption, on the first day of January in years and amounts as follows:

* 1937 - 1955, both inclusive, $5,000.00
* 1956 - 1964, both inclusive, $7,000.00

(f) Security: Special obligations of the Borrower, payable from and secured by a first and exclusive pledge of a fixed amount of the gross revenues and receipts derived directly or indirectly from the operation of the Project, which amount shall be sufficient to pay the interest and principal on such obligations when due and payable.

3. Amount and Method of Making Grant. The Government will make and the Borrower will accept, whether or not any or all of the Bonds are sold to purchasers other than the Government, a grant (herein called the "Grant"), in an amount equal to 30 per centum of the cost of the labor and materials employed upon the Project. The determination by the Federal Emergency Administrator of Public Works (herein called the "Administrator") of the cost of the labor and materials employed upon the Project shall be conclusive. The Government will make part of the Grant by payment of money and the remainder of the Grant by cancellation of Bonds or interest coupons, or both. If all of the Bonds are sold to purchasers other than the Government, the Government will make the entire Grant by payment of money. In no event shall the Grant, whether made partly by payment of money and partly by cancellation, or wholly by payment of money, be in excess of $60,000.00.

4. Bond Proceedings. When the Agreement has been executed, the Borrower (unless it has already done so) shall promptly take all proceedings necessary for the authorization and issuance of the Bonds.

5. Bond and Grant Requisitions. From time to time, after the execution of this Agreement, the Borrower shall file a requisition with the Government requesting the Government to take up and pay for Bonds or to make a payment on account of the Grant. Each requisition shall be accompanied by such documents as may be requested by the Administrator (a requisition together with such documents being herein collectively called a "Requisition").

6. Bond Purchases. If a Requisition requesting the Government to take up and pay for Bonds is satisfactory in form and substance to the Administrator, the Government, within a reasonable time after the receipt of such Requisition, will take up and pay for Bonds, having maturities satisfactory to the Administrator, in such amount as will provide, in the judgment of the Administrator, sufficient funds for the construction of the Project for a reasonable period. Payment for such Bonds shall be made at a Federal Reserve Bank to be designated by the Administrator or at such other place or places as the Administrator may designate, against delivery by the Borrower of such Bonds, having all unmatured interest coupons attached thereto, together with such documents as may be requested by the Administrator. The Government shall be under no obligation to take up and pay for Bonds beyond the amount which in the judgment of the Administrator is needed by the Borrower to complete the Project.

7. Grant by Payment of Money. If a Requisition requesting the Government to make a payment on account of the Grant is satisfactory in form and substance to the Administrator, the Government will pay to the Borrower at such place or places as the Administrator may designate against delivery by the Borrower of its receipt therefore, a sum of money equal to the difference between the aggregate amount previously paid on account of the Grant, and

(a) 25 per centum of the cost of the labor and materials shown in the Requisition to have been employed upon the Project if the Requisition shows that the Project has not been completed, or

(b) 30 per centum of the cost of such labor and materials if the Requisition shows that the Project has been completed and that all costs incurred in connection therewith have been determined;

provided, however, that the part of the Grant made by payment of money to the Borrower shall not be in excess of the difference between the Allotment and the amount paid (not including the amount paid as accrued interest) for the Bonds taken up by the Government. The Government reserves the right to make any part of the Grant by cancellation of Bonds or interest coupons or both, rather than by payment of money if, in the judgment of the Administrator, the Borrower does not need the money to pay costs incurred in connection with the construction of the Project.

8. Grant by Cancellation of Bonds. If the Borrower, within a reasonable time after the completion of the Project, shall have filed a Requisition, satisfactory in form and substance to the Administrator, then the Government will cancel such bonds and interest coupons as may be selected by the Administrator in an aggregate amount equal (as nearly as may be) to the difference between 30 per centum of the cost of the labor and materials employed upon the Project and the part of the Grant made by payment of money. The Government will hold Bonds or interest coupons for such reasonable time in an amount sufficient to permit compliance with provisions of this Paragraph, unless payment of such difference shall have been otherwise provided for by the Government.

9. Grant Advances. At any time after the execution of this Agreement the Government may, upon request of the Borrower, if in the judgment of the Administrator the circumstances so warrant, make advances to the Borrower on account of the Grant, but such advances shall not be in excess of 30 per centum of the cost of the labor and materials to be employed upon the Project, as estimated by the Administrator.

10. Deposit of Bond Proceeds and Grant; Bond Fund, Construction Accounts. The Borrower shall deposit all accrued interest which it receives from the sale of the Bonds at the time of the payment therefor and any payment on account of the Grant which may be made under the provisions of Paragraph 8, hereof, into an interest and bond retirement fund account (herein called the "Bond Fund") promptly upon the receipt of such accrued interest or such payment on account of the Grant. It will deposit the remaining proceeds from the sale of the Bonds (whether such Bonds are sold to the Government or other purchasers) and the part of the Grant made by payment of money under the provisions of Paragraph 7, hereof, promptly upon the receipt of such proceeds or payments in a separate account or accounts (each of such separate accounts herein called a "Construction Account"), in a bank or banks which are members of the Federal Reserve System and of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and which shall be satisfactory at all times to the Administrator.

11. Disbursement of Monies in Construction Accounts and in Bond Fund. The Borrower shall expend the monies in a Construction Account only for such purposes as shall have been previously specified in Requisitions filed with the Government and as shall have been approved by the Administrator. Any monies remaining unexpended in any Construction Account after the completion of the Project which are not required to meet obligations incurred in connection with the construction of the Project shall either be paid into the Bond Fund, or said monies shall be used for the purchase of such of the Bonds as are then outstanding at a price not exceeding the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest. Any Bonds so purchased shall be cancelled and no additional Bonds shall be issued in lieu thereof. The monies in the Bond Fund shall be used solely for the purpose of paying interest on and principal of the Bonds.

12. Other Financial Aid from the Government. If the Borrower shall receive any funds (other than those received under this Agreement) directly or indirectly from the Government, or any agency or instrumentality thereof, to aid in financing the construction of the Project, to the extent that such funds are so received the Grant shall be reduced, and to the extent that such funds so received exceed the part of the Grant which would otherwise be made by payment of money, the aggregate principal amount of Bonds to be purchased by the Government shall be reduced.

13. Construction of Project. Not later than upon the receipt by it of the first Bond payment, the Borrower will commence or cause to be commenced the construction of the Project, and the Borrower will thereafter continue such construction, or cause it to be continued to completion with all practicable dispatch, in an efficient and economical manner, at a reasonable cost and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, plans, drawings, specifications and construction contracts which shall be satisfactory to the Administrator, and under such engineering supervision and inspection as the Administrator may require. Except with the written consent of the Administrator, no materials or equipment for the Project shall be purchased by the Borrower subject to any chattel mortgage, or any conditional sale or title retention agreement.

14. Construction Work. All work on the Project shall be done subject to the rules and regulations adopted by the Administrator to carry out the purposes and control the Administration of the Act. By the act of executing this Agreement the Borrower acknowledges receipt of a copy of the rules and regulations set out in Bulletin No. 2, Non-Federal Projects revised March 3, 1934, entitled "P. W. A. REQUIREMENTS as to BIDS, CONTRACTORS' BONDS, AND CONTRACT, WAGE AND LABOR PROVISIONS AND GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS as to APPLICATIONS AND LOANS AND GRANTS", and covenants that said rules and regulations, with all blank spaces filled in as provided in said Bulletin, will be incorporated verbatim in ALL CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS for work on the Project.

15. Force Account. All construction work on the Project shall be done under contract, provided, however, that if prices in the bids are excessive, the Borrower reserves the right, anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, to apply to the Administrator for permission to do all or any part of the Project on a force account basis.

16. Restriction as to Contractors. The Borrower shall receive no bid from any contractor, nor permit any contractor to receive any bid from any sub-contractor, who has not signed U. S. Government Form No. P. W. A. 61, revised March, 1934.

17. Bonds and Insurance. Construction contracts shall be supported by adequate surety or other bonds or security satisfactory to the Administrator for the protection of the Borrower, or materialmen, and of labor employed on the Project or any part thereof. The contractor under any construction contract shall be required to provide public liability insurance in an amount satisfactory to the Administrator.

18. Information. During the construction of the Project the Borrower will furnish to the Government all such information and data as the Administrator may request as to the construction, cost and progress of the work. The Borrower will furnish to the Government and to any purchaser from the Government of 25 per centum of the Bonds, such financial statements and other information and data relating to the Borrower as the Administrator or any such purchaser may at any time reasonably require.

19. Representations and Warranties. The Borrower represents and warrants as follows:

(a) Litigation. No litigation or other proceedings are now pending or threatened which might adversely affect the Bonds, the security therefore, the construction of the Project, or the financial condition of the Borrower;

(b) Financial Condition. The character of the assets and the financial condition of the Borrower are as favorable as at the date of the Borrower's most recent financial statement, furnished to the Government as a part of the Application, and there have been no changes in the character of such assets or in such financial condition except such changes as are necessary and incidental to the ordinary and usual conduct of the Borrower's affairs;

(c) Fees and Commissions. It has not and does not intend to pay any bonus, fee or commission in order to secure the loan or grant hereunder;

(d) Affirmation. Every statement contained in this Agreement, in the Application, and in any supplement thereto or amendment thereof, and in any other document submitted to the Government is correct and complete, and no relevant fact materially affecting the Bonds, the security therefor, the Grant or the Project, or the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement has been omitted therefrom.

20. Bond Circular. The Borrower will furnish all such information in proper form for the preparation of a Bond Circular and will take all such steps as the Government or any purchaser or purchasers from the Government of not less than 25 per centum of the Bonds may reasonably request to aid in the sale by the Government or such purchaser or purchasers of any or all of the Bonds.

21. Expenses. The Government shall be under no obligation to pay any costs, charges or expenses incident to compliance with any of the duties or obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the cost of preparing, executing and delivering the Bonds, and any legal, engineering and accounting costs, charges or expenses incurred by the Borrower.

22. Waiver. Any provision of this Agreement may be waived or amended with the consent of the Borrower and the written approval of the Administrator, without the execution of a new or supplemental agreement.

23. Interest of Member of Congress. No member of or Delegate to the Congress of the United States of America shall be admitted to any share or part of this Agreement, or to any benefit to arise thereupon.

24. Validation. The Borrower hereby covenants that it will institute, prosecute and carry to completion in so far as it may be within the power of the Borrower, any and all acts and things to be performed or done to secure the enactment of legislation or to accomplish such other proceedings, judicial or otherwise, as may be necessary, appropriate or advisable to empower the Borrower to issue the Bonds and to remedy any defects, illegalities and irregularities in the proceedings of the Borrower relative to the issuance of the Bonds and to validate the same after the issuance thereof to the Government, if in the judgment of the Administrator such action may be deemed necessary, appropriate or advisable. The Borrower further covenants that it will procure and furnish to the Government, as a condition precedent to the Government's obligations hereunder a letter from the Governor of the State stating that if in the judgment of the Administrator it may be advisable to enact legislation to empower the Borrower to issue the Bonds or to remedy any defects, illegalities or irregularities in the proceedings of the Borrower relative to the issuance thereof or to validate the same, said Governor will recommend and co-operate in the enactment of such legislation.

25. Naming of Project. The Project shall never be named except with the written consent of the Administrator.

26. Undue Delay by the Borrower. If in the opinion of the Administrator, which shall be conclusive, the Borrower shall delay for an unreasonable time in carrying out any of the duties or obligations to be performed by it under the terms of this Agreement, the Administrator may cancel this Agreement.

27. Conditions Precedent to the Government's Obligations. The Government shall be under no obligation to pay for any of the Bonds or to make any Grant:

(a) Financial Condition and Budget. If, in the judgment of the Administrator, the financial condition of the Borrower shall have changed unfavorably in a material degree from its condition as theretofore represented to the Government, or the Borrower shall have failed to balance its budget satisfactorily or shall have failed to take action reasonably designed to bring the ordinary current expenditures of the Borrower within the prudently estimated revenues thereof;

(b) Cost of Project. If the Administrator shall not be satisfied that the Borrower will be able to complete the Project for the sum of $208,500.00, or that the Borrower will be able to obtain, in a manner satisfactory to the Administrator, any additional funds which the Administrator shall estimate to be necessary to complete the Project;

(c) Compliance. If the Administrator shall not be satisfied that the Borrower has complied with all the provisions contained in this Agreement or in the proceedings authorizing the issuance of the Bonds, theretofore to be complied with by the Borrower;

(f) Maturity of Bonds Sold to Government. If, in the event that some of the Bonds are sold to purchasers other than the Government, the maturities of the remaining Bonds are not satisfactory to the Administrator;

(g) Bond Resolution. If the Borrower shall not adopt a bond resolution satisfactory in form, substance and sufficiency to the Administrator;

(h) Rate Ordinance. If the ordinance fixing the rates and charges for services rendered by the Project is not satisfactory in form and substance to the Administrator.

Section 3. The proceeds derived from the sale of said bonds shall be used for the construction and equipment of a private wing addition to the Hospital Building of the Institution, (hereinafter sometimes called the "Project"), as a part of the Institution's building system, and for other and incidental purposes, all as more specifically mentioned and described in Resolutions heretofore adopted, and particularly in a certain Loan Agreement, authorized by Resolution adopted January 11th, 1935, and dated as of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, 1935, between the Institution and the United States of America. It is hereby determined that interest on said bonds during the period of such construction and the cost of issuance of the bonds shall be deemed a part of the cost of such construction for the financing of which said bonds are authorized. It is also hereby determined that the construction, erection and equipping of such project is a purpose for which bonds may lawfully be issued under the provisions of the Act hereinabove referred to.

Section 4. Said bonds shall be special obligations of the Institution, payable only from, and secured by a first and exclusive pledge of, a part, fixed as hereinafter provided, of the revenues and receipts derived directly or indirectly from the project.

Section 5. The Institution shall fix, maintain and collect rents for the rooms in said project, which such rents shall be sufficient at all times to pay the interest on and principal of the bonds hereby authorized as and when the same become due and payable, and to provide for the reserve for contingencies hereinafter described, and to pay the cost of operation and maintenance (including insurance) of the project.

Section 6. The Institution shall set aside, as collected, and deposit a portion of the rentals aforesaid, in a "Bond and Interest Sinking Fund Account", (herein referred to as the "Sinking Fund"), to the extent only hereinafter in this Section provided. So long as any of the bonds authorized by this Resolution shall remain outstanding, the moneys in the Sinking Fund shall be pledged to and used solely for the purpose of paying the interest on and the principal of such bonds. During each of the fiscal years, ending 1936 to 1955, both inclusive, there shall be set aside and paid into such Sinking Fund, out of the rentals aforesaid, an amount equal to one hundred and ten per centum (110%) of the amount of interest payable on the bonds outstanding, and one hundred and ten per centum (110%) of the aggregate principal amount of the bonds maturing in each such year. The amount by which such payments into the Sinking Fund exceed the aggregate amount of interest and principal payable in such years shall be held in the Sinking Fund as a reserve for contingencies and shall be used only in accordance with the provisions of this Resolution. During each of the fiscal years ending 1956 to 1965, both inclusive, the amount so set apart and paid into the Sinking Fund shall be equal to one hundred per centum (100%) of the amount of interest payable on the bonds outstanding, and one hundred per centum (100%) of the aggregate principal amount of bonds maturing in each such year; provided, however, that no further payments need be made into said Sinking Fund when the amount of money held in said Sinking Fund (including the reserve for contingencies) equals the amount of the interest and principal that will be payable at the time of the maturity of all of the bonds then outstanding. If, in any fiscal year, the Institution shall fail to pay into the Sinking Fund the full amount hereinabove stipulated, then an amount equal to the amount of such deficiency shall be set apart and paid into the Sinking Fund from the first available revenues or receipts of the following fiscal year or years. If the Institution shall fail to make such payment into the Sinking Fund as aforesaid during any fiscal year, any funds then held in the Sinking Fund, as a reserve for contingencies, as above provided, shall be used for the payment of any portion of the interest on and principal of the bonds becoming due in such fiscal year, on which bonds there would otherwise be a default, but the amount by which such reserve is so reduced by such payment shall be replaced from the first available rentals of the following fiscal year or years in excess of the required payment for the then current fiscal year. All moneys held in the Sinking Fund as a reserve for contingencies shall be paid into the Treasury of the Commonwealth of Virginia to the account of the Institution, and as a special fund for the use of the Institution.

Section 7. The Institution shall keep complete and accurate accounts of all sums of money received and disbursed in connection with the erection, equipping, operation and maintenance of the project, including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, a complete and accurate record of all amounts received from rentals of private rooms and collected from patients admitted to and treated in the new wing or addition to the Hospital Building, and all sums disbursed for the payment of the interest on and principal of the bonds. The Institution shall also prepare and furnish to the Government, so long as the Government holds any of the bonds, and upon request, to any holder of any of the bonds, not more than thirty days after the close of each six months fiscal period complete operating and income statements of the project, covering such six months period in reasonable detail, and not more than sixty days after the close of each fiscal year, complete financial statements (certified by the Borrower's auditors) of the project, and the unit of which it is a part, covering such fiscal year. Such operation and income statements may be certified by independent auditors if demand for an independent audit shall be made by the holder or holders of 25% of the bonds at the time outstanding.

Section 8. So long as any of the bonds shall remain outstanding, the Institution will maintain insurance on the project for the benefit of the holders thereof of a kind and in an amount which usually would be carried by private corporations operating a similar project. The proceeds of any insurance, other than for loss of use and occupancy, shall, at the option of the Institution, be used only for—; (2) replacements or repairs, or—; (b) payments into the Sinking Fund. During the period of loss of use and occupancy, the proceeds of any use and occupancy insurance shall be paid into the Sinking Fund and applied according to the provisions relating thereto.

Section 9. So long as any of the Bonds shall remain outstanding the Institution shall not issue any additional bonds of any other authorized issue or other evidences of indebtedness payable from the amounts received from rental of rooms in said addition to the Hospital Building, unless the lien and security of such additional bonds or evidences of indebtedness on such amounts received from said rentals are made junior and subordinate in all respects to the lien and security of the bonds described herein.

Section 10. The holders of the bonds are, and shall be, entitled to all the benefits of and subject to the provisions of Section 7 of the Act referred to in Section 1 of this Resolution, and any Trustee appointed by the holders of the bonds pursuant to said Section 7 of said Act shall have the powers provided by sub-division (e) of said Section 7 of said Act.

## CERTIFICATE OF GOVERNOR

I, George C. Peery, Governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia, hereby certify that I have examined two Resolutions adopted by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, at a special meeting of said Board of Visitors, held at the President's Office at the University, at 8:00 o'clock, P. M., on Friday, January 11th, 1935, the first of said Resolutions authorizing the execution of a certain Loan and Grant Agreement between The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia and the United States of America, Docket No. 4881 of the Federal Emergency Administration of Public Works; and the second Resolution being entitled:

"Resolution Authorizing the Issuance and Sale of University of Virginia Hospital Bonds in the Aggregate Principal Amount of $158,000.00 and Determining the Form Thereof".

And I do hereby approve said Resolutions.

(Signed) Geo. C. Peery, Governor.

Mr. W. Allan Perkins, Attorney for the University, submitted the following report in the matter of the Whitmell T. Taliaferro will:

On November 16th, last, I was advised that Whitmell T. Taliaferro, of Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey, had recently died and that a paper, purporting to be a holographic will, was found among his effects, by which the whole of his Estate was given to his sister-in-law, Mrs. Cornelia McKernan, who, it seems, had lived with Mr. Taliaferro and cared for him during the last few months of his life.

This holographic will was offered for probate in the Monmouth County, New Jersey, Orphan's Court, and by order entered by said Court October 15th, 1934, probate thereof was refused on the ground that the will was not executed in the manner and form required by the statute law of New Jersey.

The Second National Bank & Trust Company of Redbank, New Jersey, was then appointed Administrator. When the Administrator opened the lock box of the decedent in the Corn Exchange Safe Deposit Company in New York an earlier will, dated in September, 1932, was discovered, and this will, after disposal of a few items of personal property, gives practically the whole of the Estate to the University of Virginia.

The amount of the Estate is estimated at approximately $65,000.00. The largest single asset is a mortgage for $25,000.00 secured upon real estate in Glen Ridge, New Jersey. There is approximately $10,000.00 in cash, a house in Atlantic Highlands, Monmouth County, New Jersey, valued at around $5000.00, and the rest of the estate consists of stocks and mortgages.

The matter was referred to me, as Attorney for the University, in November, last, and after investigating all the facts, I advise that there seems to be no doubt that Mrs. McKernan has a valid claim against the Estate for the services which she rendered the decedent It seems also that she is prepared to assert her claims if necessary.

In the meantime, the firm of Pitney, Harden & Skinner, of Newark, New Jersey, has been employed to represent the University in this matter, and through this firm probate of Mr. Taliaferro's will, dated in September, 1932, will be offered on January 31st, 1935. This situation, in all of its details, is too complicated to present at this time in the form of a written report. It is, therefore, recommended that this whole question be referred to a Committee, which Committee shall be given full power to do whatever may be necessary, and especially to negotiate with the said Mrs. Cornelia McKernan, and with the next of kin of said Whitmell T. Taliaferro, and to direct the President to enter into any contract or contracts, which to said Committee, may seem proper, looking toward the settlement of this Estate.

The following resolution with respect to the foregoing report was adopted:

## RESOLVED:

That a Committee, composed of three, be appointed by the Chairman of this meeting, and that such Committee be, and is hereby, given full power and authority to do any and all things in its opinion needful or necessary in connection with the settlement of the Estate of Whitmell T. Taliaferro, deceased, to negotiate and enter into any contract or contracts with Mrs. Cornelia McKernan and/or with the next of kin of said Whitmell T. Taliaferro, deceased, which may seem advisable to said Committee, in order that all questions with reference to the final settlement of any claim or claims against this Estate may be determined, and said Committee is fully empowered to employ such additional Counsel as, in its opinion, may be necessary, and to authorize the prosecution or defense of any suit or suits that to it may seem proper.

The Chairman thereupon appointed the following committee: Garnett, Goolrick and President Newcomb.

In re: Branch and Guthrie indebtedness to the Seward Estate:

W. Allan Perkins, Executor of Dr. Walter M. Seward, deceased, states that as the two-year period in which suit might have been brought to impeach Dr. Seward's will is now past, he wishes the Board to take some action with reference to settlement of the indebtedness of the Estate of W. J. Branch and of Mrs. Helen F. Guthrie to the Seward Estate. Mr. Branch and Mrs. Guthrie were both first cousins of Dr. Seward. Mr. Branch owed Dr. Seward some $4800.00 secured upon property in Dinwiddie County, Virginia, just outside of Petersburg, and Mrs. Guthrie owed Dr. Seward some $6500.00 secured upon property in Dinwiddie County, and in the City of Petersburg. Mr. Perkins' statement follows:

Shortly after Dr. Seward's death, Mr. W. J. Branch and Mr. M. H. Guthrie, Mrs. Guthrie's husband, had a talk with me in Lawrenceville, and both of them stated that they were not even able to pay interest on these debts, and offered to convey practically all of the land upon which they were secured to the University, if we would cancel the notes in return for such conveyance. I did not feel that it was proper at that time to deal with any of those who might have been Dr. Seward's heirs if he had died intestate, and so, while I brought the matter up and discussed it with the Special Committee heretofore appointed to confer with me upon the subject of the Seward Estate, I did not ask for any action. In the report of this Committee to the Board, made at the meeting of June 12th, 1933, the following statement appears:

"6th. That the Executor be requested to communicate with Mr. William J. Branch and Mrs. Helen F. Guthrie and say to them that in the opinion of this Committee any action with reference to their respective proposals for the settlement of their indebtedness to the Estate would, at this time, be premature, but at the proper time the matter will be taken up with the Board of Visitors and given careful and sympathetic consideration."

Mr. Branch died several months ago. I believe that the time has now come when this matter should be taken up and settled and I am going to ask that a Committee be appointed from this Board, with full power to agree with the widow and heirs of Mr. Branch, and with Mr. and Mrs. Guthrie, upon just what property shall be conveyed to the University in extinguishment of said debts, and that this Committee be empowered upon satisfactory conveyance being made, to cancel the bonds and notes of said William J. Branch and Helen F. Guthrie, now held by us as a part of Dr. Seward's Estate, and deliver them to the parties entitled to receive the same. It is, thereupon,

## RESOLVED,

Branch and Helen F. Guthrie indebtedness, to the Estate of Walter M. Seward, in any way that said Committee may deem best, and upon such settlement being made, satisfactory to said Committee, said Committee is further authorized and empowered to cancel and deliver to said Helen F. Guthrie and to the widow and heirs, or personal representatives of William J. Branch, deceased, all the bonds, notes, or other evidences of debt, executed by said Helen F. Guthrie or by said William J. Branch, and now held as a part of the Estate of Walter M. Seward, deceased, making all necessary releases of deeds of trust and doing all other things that may be needful or necessary in the premises.
