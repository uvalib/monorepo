The President announced the enrollment for the regular session of 1934-35, 2,435.

The President presented the following matters for consideration:

A letter from the Governor announcing a five per cent reduction in general fund appropriations for the fiscal year 1935-36, resulting in a reduction of the appropriation for the University of $21,100.50, and the President stated that such reduction would necessitate a revision of the budget of the University as adopted at the meeting on May 28th. He was authorized to make such changes in the budget as would be necessary to keep the estimated expenditures within the income.

A letter was presented from the Federal Emergency Administration of Public Works with respect to the $9,000 paid by the University for the plans and specifications for the New Engineering Building, advising that such expenditure was not chargeable as part of the construction costs to be paid from bond proceeds or grant for the said building. The President was authorized and instructed to enter a protest against the elimination of the said item.

Upon the recommendation of the President the following elections were voted:

Alfred Akerman, Associate Professor of Forestry, appointed Director of the Seward Demonstration Forest, in Brunswick County, and is transferred from teaching duty in the University to the management of this forest area.

It is understood that all actions of the President and Committees will be brought to the Board for ratification at their next meeting.

The President presented a budget in detail for the operation of the Seward Demonstration Forest for 1935-36, showing a total of $16,254.20, which was approved.

The President presented the recommendations of the Faculty for amending the requirements for degrees which, after examination by the Board, were adopted:

Degree requirements are stated in terms of courses. A course is the work covered in an organized, scheduled class, meeting normally three hours a week throughout the session. Beginners' courses in foreign languages, however, and certain first-year courses in mathematics may meet four or five hours weekly. Science courses with three hours of class work and six hours of laboratory work weekly are designated double-courses and are counted as two courses.

For graduation from the College of Arts and Sciences the candidate must have taken and passed a total of twenty courses, completed in conformity with the regulations prescribed for the several degrees.

Exemption from certain Required Courses may be obtained as set forth below. Such exemption increases the student's freedom of election, but does not reduce the total number of courses (20) required for a degree.

Qualifying examinations are scheduled at the beginning of the session, and no such examination may be taken more than once.

The candidate must complete a total of twenty courses, chosen in accordance with the following regulations:

The eight courses prescribed below must be completed at least one year before graduation. Not less than six of them must be completed at least two years before graduation.

* English: English A1.
  * Students passing a qualifying examination on English A1 will be exempted from further requirement in English.
* Foreign Languages: A first-year college course (A1) and a second-year college course (A2) in each of two foreign languages. A candidate for the degree of Bachelor of Arts must offer two courses in Greek or Latin. A candidate for the degree of Bachelor of Science must offer two courses in French or German.

  * A student who presents admission credit for two units of German, Greek or Latin, or for three units of French, Italian or Spanish, must enter the A2 course if he wishes to study the language in question. If he passes the A2 course he will be exempted from further requirement in that language.

  * Students passing a qualifying examination on the A2 course in any language will be exempted from further requirement in that language.
* Mathematics: Mathematics A1 or A2 or A3.
  * Students passing a qualifying examination on Mathematics A will be exempted from further requirement in mathematics.
* Natural Science: Biology B1 or Chemistry B1 or Geology B1 or Physics B1.

A student who has passed not less than six of the Required Courses two years before graduation, shall at the beginning of his next session select as his Field of Concentration a Major Subject taught in one of the Academic Schools. Before registration he must present, as part of his plan of study for the next two years, a program of not less than five nor more than seven courses approved in writing by an official adviser for his Major School. This program must include not less than three courses offered in the Major School and not less than two courses in subjects related to the Field of Concentration. No course offered by the candidate as a Required Course may be counted as part of the major program.

The remaining courses needed to make up the required twenty may be elected from courses in the Academic Schools for which the candidate has adequate preparation.

A candidate for a degree must make a satisfactory standing in a final comprehensive examination on his Field of Concentration, set by the faculty of his Major School. This examination shall be in lieu of separate final examinations in all courses in the Field of Concentration, taken in the session of graduation, which the Major School may include in it. It may be wholly a written examination, or partly written and partly oral.

The first-year course in the Department of Law or the first-year course in the Department of Medicine, of this University, may be substituted for four academic courses in the Field of Concentration. This substitution cannot be made unless the candidate has spent three full sessions in the College of Arts and Sciences of this University and has obtained credit for sixteen courses, including:

1. The eight Required Courses (not less than six of which must be completed at least two years before graduation). Exemption from Required Courses, as provided above, increases the student's freedom of election, but does not reduce the total number of courses (16) which must be completed in the College.

2. A program of four courses, to be taken during the candidate's third year in the College, and to be approved in writing before registration by an adviser designated by the Dean of the College.

3. Electives, chosen from courses in the Academic Schools for which the candidate has adequate preparation.

A candidate who includes the first-year course in Law or Medicine in his Field of Concentration is exempted from the Final Comprehensive Examination.

In addition to satisfying the requirements for graduation stated above, a candidate must complete a two-year course in physical education, unless excused on a physician's certificate. This work must be taken during the first two years and must be completed at least one year before graduation.

The President discussed with the Board the matter of making application to the Public Works Administration for loan and grant with which to erect a library building whereupon the following was voted:

RESOLVED, by the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, That the President of the University be, and he is hereby, requested to make application to the Public Works Administration for a loan and grant in the sum of one million dollars for the construction of a library building for the University.
