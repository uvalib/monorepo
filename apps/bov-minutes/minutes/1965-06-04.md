Mr. Walter R. Franke, Lecturer in Aerospace Engineering, died on 12 April 1965 after a brief illness. He had been on the staff of the University since 15 September 1956. From the Rector, the President, and the individual Visitors there were expressions of the affection and esteem in which Mr. Franke was held, and the Secretary was directed to convey to Mrs. Franke and to record in the permanent minutes of the Board the deep sense of loss felt by the Board and the gratitude of the Visitors, both as a body and as individuals, for Mr. Franke's distinguished and devoted service to the University.

Mr. William M. Griffin, Associate Professor of Government and Foreign Affairs and Assistant Director of the Institute of Government, died on 22 May 1965 after a lengthy illness. He had been on the staff of the University since 1 July 1960. From the Rector, the President, and the individual Visitors there were expressions of the affection and esteem in which Mr. Griffin was held, and the Secretary was directed to convey to Mrs. Griffin and to record in the permanent minutes of the Board the deep sense of loss felt by the Board and the gratitude of the Visitors, both as a body and as individuals, for Mr. Griffin's distinguished and devoted service to the University.

At the request of several members of the Board, the President asked four persons to appear before the Board and report on the current situation with respect to the Honor System. These individuals were Mr. B. F. D. Runk, Dean of the University, Mr. Benjamin C. Ackerly, Chairman of the Honor Committee, 1964-1965, Mr. George H. Morison, Chairman of the Honor Committee, 1965-1966, and Dean Hardy C. Dillard of the School of Law and a member of the Special Advisory Committee appointed by the Secretary of the Air Force to investigate the cheating scandal at the Air Force Academy.

***

### Dean Runk's remarks were as follows:

May I point out that I have been associated with the Honor System of the University for a period of nearly forty years. In addition, I have been privileged to work closely with the administration of the Honor System, both as a student and more lately as a member of the faculty and administration.

Over this span I have seen changes occur in the System and its application to our way of life. I well remember pledged dances held during my student days, the application of the pledge to athletic training, and the drinking pledge applied by the revered Dean Jimmy Page to those students who, at times, were inclined to imbibe too often and too freely. I also remember when the writing of a bad check was considered a violation of the Honor System unless a valid reason was given in a hurry.

Over the years changes have taken place and I believe will continue to take place as long as the System remains a part of our changing society. These changes came about through a change in the mores and thinking of our student body - the group in whose hands the Honor System rests.

Today the System as applied to the classroom works well and effectively. The number of violations is not great, but some do occur, and those students charged with a violation for the most part are found guilty and are dismissed.

There are certain areas which should be watched with concern and to which the Honor Committee should be particularly alert.

Too often today the question of intent is raised in questions of honor violations. This year a student entered Newcomb Hall after the building was secured for the night, and pried loose a speaker in one of the Hi-Fi music listening rooms. He took this back to his room in the dormitory and within the next day or so took it to Northern Virginia where he left it at the home of a friend. When charged with stealing, his plea was that he did not intend to keep the speaker and thus he was not guilty of a violation of the Honor System. He was found not guilty by the Honor Committee.

I do not consider a statement to the effect that "I did not intend to cheat" should free a man from the Honor System.

One of the procedural features of the present system is that both sides may be represented by counsel from the student body. Too often the defense counsel, normally a third-year Law student assigned to the case by the Honor Committee, will use the honor trial as a time and place to demonstrate his legalistic training.

The chairman of the Committee must be on guard constantly to assure that only the facts of the case are presented.

During the past few years there have been rumblings that the Honor System should be codified so that what a student can do and cannot do under the System is specifically spelled out. It does not appear to me that the spirit implied in the Honor System can or should be codified.

One particular aspect of present day attitudes that bothers me is the feeling on the part of some students that it is permissible to not be open and above board with those in the lower administrative brackets. It appears to be something of a game to get away with lying as a means for beating the University administration in the enforcement of motor vehicle rules and regulations. The use of decals to which they are not entitled, or the open falsification of registration decals is not considered by all students to be dishonest. Others do not even feel it is wrong to sign a card stating that they do not own or operate a motor vehicle at the very time they have a motor vehicle here to which they, as students, are not entitled. It appears that a dishonest mental reservation is being made by some in the perennial game of beating the administration.

I have recently been asked by the Student Government to refrain from requesting students to indicate by a monthly letter their compliance with a state of probation. The reason given is that this will place a strain on the Honor System. They also express the feeling that the Honor System is being used to enforce an administrative matter. Such illogical reasoning could lead to a condition where honorable conduct would be enforced only when it did not adversely affect a student's interests.

The Bad Check Committee is overworked and has a thankless job because of checks returned marked "Insufficient Funds." True, the banks do make many errors but the number of bad checks grows each year and the writing of such is no longer considered by many to be wrong.

The attitudes I have expressed are symptomatic of the present times. The concept of honor is no longer part of the life of many people. It is not always found in the home and often not in government. I fear that some of our students have come from backgrounds where the appreciation and understanding of honor is lacking. It is difficult for them to immediately understand all that is demanded here. Applications for admission to all schools now require the applicant to state that he is willing to subscribe to and support the Honor System. New faculty members should also be willing to live with and cooperate with our way of life.

We must all work together to keep and make more perfect the noble tradition which has been so much a part of the University since 1842.

***

### Mr. Ackerly's remarks were as follows:

The Honor Committee has made extensive efforts over the past year to improve its effectiveness and to protect itself and the University from possible charges that might develop out of such a situation.

With the help of some of our students in the law school the Honor Committee has sought the advice of experts in the respective fields of science criminology. Twice this year we have sent papers to Washington, D.C. to be examined by one of the foremost documents experts in the country. These papers have been checked for handwriting similarities, erasures and the time interval in which the work was done. On other occasions we have called in the services of scientific experts in the University community itself to aid us, and we work closely with the Department of Security.

These pretrial measures sometimes eliminate the necessity for any Honor Trial because they substantiate any doubt which the parties may have had. This expert advice is an invaluable service to the Honor Committee, and aids us a great deal in reaching a just verdict.

On the other side of the spectrum, we initiated some new procedures this year to protect the Honor Committee. When a student notifies the Honor Committee that he has been charged with an honor violation and requests a trial he is informed that he has to notify his parents of the fact. If he doesn't notify his parents then the Chairman of the Honor Committee does. If a student is in his first year his dormitory counselor is notified of the situation and advised to keep an eye out for the boy.

Arrangements have been made this year with Student Health and the University Hospital to take care of a student prior to or after a trial if we or a doctor feels that he is mentally upset and cannot control himself. (If a student was mentally unsound at the time of the offense then we request that he be dismissed from the University for medical reasons.)

Immediately following a trial the accused notifies his parents of the outcome of the trial. A first-year student's dormitory counselor is also notified of the results and advised to keep an eye out for the student.

These measures are designed so that the parents of the boy will be aware of the situation so in the event of an unforeseen accident the parents cannot claim that they did not know what was going on. Our measures are by no means foolproof, but we have had no unfortunate accidents that would reflect discredit on the Honor System or the University of Virginia.

This year we have been amazingly successful in obtaining admission to other colleges for those students who are dismissed from the University. We are trying to eradicate the air and feeling that exists here that an Honor Violation is the end of the world. This is a popular notion among students which certainly is not true and I believe to be unhealthy for the Honor System.

For those of you who have followed the situation at the Air Force Academy I may note that the University is certainly not above such a development. More than a month before the official report was released Dean Dillard of the Law School spoke to a closed session of the Honor Committee advising them of what had been discovered in their survey of the Air Force Academy. I can assure you that his advice fell on anxious ears and will be carried out to the letter.

As you well know the Honor Committee never publishes any of the names of the people involved in a possible honor infraction. If the case is dismissed all records and evidence are destroyed. If a student is found guilty a transcript of the trial is kept in file by the Honor Committee and the registrar is notified of the dismissal so that he may officially contact the parents. A notice appears in the "Cavalier Daily" stating the offense, but no names ever appear.

After a year of close work with the Honor System several pertinent problems have come to mind which will have to be dealt with shortly. The expanding enrollment, especially in the graduate schools, is making it doubly difficult for the Honor Committee to orientate everyone. Effective orientation is still maintained with first-year students through the dormitory complex, but no such control is available for graduate students. Second, there is a prevailing mood created by the generation in which we live to try to shirk authority and get away with what you can. It is no secret that personal honor is no longer regarded by all the way it was twenty or thirty years ago. Of course, this is a creeping problem and probably the most dangerous. The Honor System has successfully followed the train of time by denying any codification and I sincerely believe that this is the only way it can continue to exist. The students are the ones who interpret the Honor System and although it may not be as astringent as it has been it certainly reflects student opinion and this is the way it should be.

***

### Mr. Morison's remarks were as follows:

The maintenance of the System today continues to be a task of redefinition and alertness to potential dangers and weaknesses. As has been the case since its inception in 1842, the System remains entirely in the hands of the students and it is the student's individual responsibility to determine what is or is not an honor offense. It is the Honor Committee's responsibility to uphold the spirit of the Honor System in light of student opinion.

"Spirit" and "redefinition" are key words in the understanding of the Honor System. Whereas the tendency at institutions at large has been towards codification, we specifically avoid any such tendency here. Flexibility and an ability to adapt to the times have been important factors in the continued success of the Honor System. The history of the System has been one of changes, matters that were not considered honor offenses ten years ago are considered honor offenses today, and matters that were considered honor offenses ten years ago are not considered such today. It is the Honor Committee's task to continually redefine what is a "lie," a "cheat," or a "theft" in areas where the offense is not flagrant and the interpretation is vague.

In examining past case histories, observing the attitudes of the students through the eyes of people who have been here a great deal longer than myself, discussing the status of the Honor System today with past Chairmen and evaluating what one might call "the atmosphere of honor" that prevails on the Grounds, I think I can safely say that the Honor System is as strong today as it has ever been. It has the imperative and necessary respect of the students and almost complete cooperation of the faculty and the University community.

There are, however, continual dangers and concern. Overextension of the Honor System constitutes an area of danger. For example, earlier this year the Committee had to request that a Language Laboratory pledge be changed that had asked students to pledge that they "had listened to a tape recorder effectively." The student body did not feel that one should be guilty of an honor offense because he did not listen to a tape recorder "effectively," a word that is vague in itself. Another example is a gym instructor who told his students "to take ten laps or it was an honor offense." Students did not feel that this was a proper application of the Honor System. When students have such feelings concerning any aspect of the System, it leads to a lessening of respect that weakens the System as a whole.

The University's expansion to 10,000 students represents another potential danger. The problems involved in orientating a student body of that size, in maintaining personal contact, and in keeping a "personal" atmosphere that is so vital in establishing a feeling for the System, are paramount ones. The present Committee is investigating what steps must be made during this period of growth to maintain the Honor System at its present strength, and will present a report of its findings and suggestions to the incoming Committee of 1966-67.

A matter of concern to the Honor Committee is the identification card problem in the Athletic Department. This involves the fact that if a student forgets his identification card when going to Scott Stadium, Memorial Gymnasium, or any other athletic contest which requires paid admission, he cannot gain entrance by word of another student who does have his identification card and is willing to pledge that this boy is a student. The refusal of the Athletic Department to take another boy's word in these cases appears to refute the very principle that at the University a gentleman's word is the truth.

Potential dangers and weaknesses, however, will always exist and the before mentioned are merely some examples of ones that are present today. The Honor System as a whole, however, is strong and there are no indications that this strength will decline in the future. This year numerous steps, which Mr. Ackerly will report subsequently, have been taken to further safeguard the system and its consequences within the University.

The burden of maintaining the Honor System falls on the students, and they shoulder that burden gladly. As long as the System remains in the hands of the students, as long as the maintenance of the System is the responsibility of each individual student and no one else, and as long as the System receives the support of the faculty, the administration, and the University community, there need be no fear for the future of the Honor System at the University.

### Dean Dillard's remarks in summary were as follows:

Dean Dillard had been invited to appear before the Board to highlight in 10 minutes those aspects of the probe which might have a potential bearing on the future of the honor system and its operation at the University of Virginia.

Dean Dillard divided his talk into three parts. He first rapidly described the composition of the Special Advisory Committee and its method of operation, second, he mentioned several factors which had a tangential bearing on the honor system and, finally, he highlighted three aspects which bore more directly on the problem at Virginia with particular stress on the strains on the honor system resulting from recruiting athletes and treating them as a special subgroup.

The Committee was appointed by the Secretary of the Air Force following a nationally publicized cheating episode at the Air Force Academy, in which 105 cadets out of a student body of 2700 had resigned as a result of exposure by the Office of Special Investigation of the Air Force. The Chairman of the Committee was General Thomas D. White, former Chief of Staff of the Air Force. Other members, apart from Dean Dillard, were Lieutenant General Nazzaro, Deputy Commander of the Strategic Air Command, Robert Stearns, former President of the University of Colorado, and Charles Thornton, President of Litton Industries. The mission of the Committee was not limited to the cheating episode, although stimulated by it. The Secretary, Eugene Zuckert, made it known that he did not want any kind of whitewash and that the Committee report would be made public. This was done. The report ran to 94 pages of text and an additional 20 pages of appendices. The Committee interviewed, as a group, 119 witnesses and an additional 100 were interviewed by individual members of the Committee. The Committee met for 21 working days in Washington, Colorado Springs and California. It believes its report has a significance transcending the Air Force Academy.

Apart from interview, the Committee studied many documents (he estimated they cumulatively added up to about three feet). These included documents on the working of the system at Virginia and speeches made at Virginia. Indeed, some of the language of both his own and Professor Gooch's speeches before Virginia students are reflected in the report.

Among the tangential factors, Dean Dillard noted that the Air Force Academy suffered by virtue of its newness and lack of stability. The command changed frequently and even more significant oscillated frequently between emphasis on "Socrates" to emphasis on "Sergeant York." The problem of how to weld the two images was not successfully accomplished. This had a tangential effect because when you have uncertainty as to one phase of a total system, it tends to carry over into other phases. The "honor system" is not an isolated part of an institutional environment, and when the environmental values of one part are clouded by doubt the doubts tend to spill over into other parts.

Another tangential factor has to do with the fact that the Academy had no "heroes." Heroes are important because they tend to capture the imagination by symbolizing the finer aspirations of an institution or a profession. (Consider Marshall, Holmes, Brandeis, Cardozo and others in law.) Now in the absence of heroes, living or dead, there is a tendency to substitute purely quantitative standards in order to appear excellent. This is innocent enough but when it is overdone, as it was at the A.F.A., it tends to weaken the sense of "honor" because "honor" accents not the end result so much as the way it is reached Dean Dillard gave examples of this tendency.

Turning more specifically to those factors which might have a bearing at Virginia, Dean Dillard first emphasized that there is no use glossing over the fact that there can be a conflict of values between loyalty to friends and loyalty to an honor system. The conflict becomes all the more poignant because friends are concrete whereas honor is abstract. Yet it is of the very essence of an honor system that loyalty to the system transcend loyalty to any single individual or subgroup. Using the analogy of a poker game he explained why an honor system, if correctly understood and adequately communicated, attempts to eliminate doubt on this point and why such terms as "ratting," "squealing," etc. are not appropriate. A good deal of publicity from all over the nation has been directed to this point, so the Committee felt it should not merely state a conviction but spell out the reasons for it very strongly. It attempted to do this and to reinforce its reasoning by using analogies which pointed up sharply the potential conflict in our society between loyalty to friends and higher loyalty to society. This phase of the Committee's report is attached to this summary as an attachment.

The important point in any school with an honor system is to be sure this is clearly understood by all students and the faculty.

These observations brought Dean Dillard to the most critical finding of all. As at West Point ten years earlier so at the A.F.A., the core of the cheating and its spread was sharply centered on the recruited athletes and particularly those engaged in football and basketball. At this point, he showed the Board an elaborate chart graphically disclosing the progressive involvement of those who were and were not recruited athletes. The statistical findings were also eloquent. While only 4% of the entire Wing (as the student body is called) were implicated, no less than 44% of recruited athletes were implicated either as direct peddlers or users of examinations.

Dean Dillard suggested that the reasons for this heavy involvement were not too difficult to discern. They were not attributable, in his opinion, to any sweeping assumption that athletes are inherently morally inferior to others. The Committee considered such an assumption "grotesque." The evil lies in the psychological damage done to the recruited athlete before he comes to college whereby he is made to feel that he is so wanted that general rules don't apply to him, second by the policy of segregating him once he arrives as by special training tables, housing, etc., which reinforces the earlier damage, and third by the intensification of close personal friendships attributable to the tough shared experience which they undergo together. The Committee did not find that academic pressures were extreme, and very few of the athletes were in danger of failing. They just took the easier course and while aware of the system were not sufficiently aware of their higher loyalty to the Wing as a whole or the abstract values implicit in the system.

One wryly humorous remark emerged from an interview which Dean Dillard had with one of the football ring leaders. When questioned as to why he implicated Cadet X but not Cadet Y, he said, "We knew Cadet Y believed in the honor system, so we couldn't trust him. You couldn't trust fellows like Y."

The moral here for Virginia appears clear. It is to be sure so long as we do recruit, that (a) we make it abundantly clear that the student is to be treated on exactly the same plane as all other students, (b) that we imbue all members of the coaching staff with the need to stress this point. They are in a particularly good spot to exercise a healthy influence and to shape a healthy attitude among the squads committed to their charge. (c) While training tables may be a necessary adjunct to the toughening job, any other tendency to segregate the athletes should be resisted and, finally, (d) the whole trend toward bigger and bigger gate receipts and winning for the sake of winning should be resisted because of the subtle effect it has in distorting the values of a university and indirectly imposing a strain on the whole system, of which the honor system is a part. The Committee was quite strong on this point. It suggested that if intercollegiate athletes are deemed an integral part of the total educational experience, it should not be made to depend on gate receipts.

Another finding that might apply to Virginia but one to which the students are sensitive focuses on the need to limit the scope of the honor system. If it is made to bear too heavy a burden, then it might fall of its own weight. That is why, although it may seem illogical to refrain from extending it to all the manifold affairs of life, it is yet wiser to limit it to academic matters or, at least, to matters of honor which are focused on the academic community. At the Air Force Academy, the tendency was noted to stretch the system too far so as to make it cover trivial matters.

Dean Dillard ended on one other note. He said that at the A.F.A., as at West Point, the overwhelming majority of Cadets believed in the honor system and would have bitterly resented any attempt to eradicate it. Nor is there any evidence, in his opinion, that American youth has gone soft and irresponsible. On the other hand, the study on cheating undertaken by a social scientist at Columbia, which the Committee considered, does suggest that in those schools where there is no honor system cheating is pretty rampant, and even in those which have a system it is more prevalent than is generally believed.

NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that we express our collective and individual thanks to Mr. and Mrs. Currie for this gift and assure them that it will be put to good use by us and by our successors in the enhancement of the University's efforts, and

The following resolution was adopted:

## RESOLVED

by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the Hospital Accounts Committee be and it is hereby authorized to charge off as uncollectible accounts Schedules 1277 and 1278, aggregating $64,668.95, as recommended by it, consisting of the following:

The President reported that the renovation of Montebello is near completion and has already been occupied by Dean and Mrs. Hardy C. Dillard.

The President reported that the Miller Trust Fund, since its establishment in 1869 by Samuel Miller, has provided from its income fund for agricultural experiments under the direction of the University of Virginia. From its inception, the Fund has been invested by its Trustees in governmental and corporate bonds and in real estate bonds of individuals. This investment policy has resulted in only a slight increase in the corpus of the Fund to $105,833.55 in June 1964, as compared with a value of $100,000 in 1869. The President has received a request from Mr. William A Perkins, Jr., of the firm of Battle, Neal, Harris, Minor & Williams, on behalf of the Trustees of the Miller Trust Fund, seeking the advice of the Rector and Visitors as to possible change in the investment policy in order that more of the funds may be invested in growth stocks.

The following resolution was adopted:

## RESOLVED

by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that we believe that the investment by the Trustees of the Miller Fund in securities with the potential of capital appreciation would not be imprudent or detrimental to the University of Virginia as the beneficiary, and that we see no objection to action by the Trustees looking toward the investment of such portions of the corpus of the Fund in such securities other than bonds and in such a manner as the Trustees may from time to time deem appropriate.

The following resolution was adopted:

## RESOLVED

by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the following amendments to the agreement between the University of Virginia and the Geographic Full-time Clinicians of the Faculty of the School of Medicine for the period 1 July 1964 through 30 June 1967 be and they are hereby approved:

1. The Administration of the School of Medicine of the University of Virginia and the Geographic Full-time Clinicians agree that during the period July 1, 1964-June 30, 1967 the highest income ceiling of the Clinicians shall be $30,000, and provided earnings justify it, there will be further increases in income limits to the maximum permitted by the State of Virginia.
2. The present contract shall include provisions of the previous contract, July 1, 1961-June 30, 1964, specified in paragraphs 3 and 4 referring to the Pool Fund, paragraph 5 referring to departmental appointments, paragraph 6 referring to the "Merit Raise," paragraphs 7, 8, and 9 referring to illness, retirement, resignation, and death of clinicians and paragraph 10 referring to interpretation and adjudication of the contract as follows.
3. Believing that the "Pool Fund" should be very clearly defined, the Committee offers the following specifications:
   * (a) The Pool Fund is to be derived solely from contributions from each Clinical Department of only ten percent (10%) of its gross earnings exclusively from private practice and laboratory services.
   * (b) Contributions are to be made each month to the Pool Fund which will be held by the Bursar of the University of Virginia for appropriate distribution at or near the end of each fiscal year.
   * (c) The sole control of the Pool Fund shall rest in the hands of the Clinical Staff and the Dean of the School of Medicine. The Clinical Staff shall be represented by a committee of the Chairmen of all Clinical Departments and the Chairman of the Clinical Staff Standing Committee for Remuneration and Contracts. The Bursar, as custodian of the Pool Fund, shall recommend disbursements from the Fund which must be first approved by the Dean and the Committee of the Chairmen designated in 3(c) above.
   * (d) Disbursements from the Pool Fund are to be made by the Bursar to the proper Clinical Departments and, in turn, the Clinical Departments will, through the Bursar, distribute the money to the accounts of the individuals.
   * (e) The Pool Fund cannot be used for Hospital, Medical School or University purposes. It is to be used only for redistribution to Clinical Departments and as further specified in paragraph 4.
   * (f) The Clinical Departments are to use the Pool Fund first for assuring TIAA contributions of its practicing clinicians and the Dean of the School of Medicine, and second, for assuring, as far as possible, the attainment of their allowed income ceilings by practicing clinicians.
   * (g) If the Pool Fund should exceed its needs it shall be returned on a pro rata basis to those Clinical Departments whose contributions exceeded their receipts from the Pool Fund. Once returned to Clinical Departments it will be used as specified in paragraph 4.
4. Any money remaining in a Clinical Department account after its contribution to the Pool Fund, paying its general expenses, paying TIAA contributions for its members and paying its members their collections up to allowed income ceiling shall be distributed as follows one-third to its Reserve Fund, one-third to the Research and Development Fund, and one-third to the Pool Fund. Provided the Pool Fund does not need it the money will be divided equally between the Departmental Reserve Fund and the Research and Development Fund, up to its proportionate share in a Research and Development Fund which may accumulate annually a sum of $25,000. If deficits occur, it is understood that the Pool Fund Committee must provide for them.
5. A Departmental Chairman wishing to fill a temporarily vacated position or to establish a new position shall, as in the past, get the approval of the Dean and necessary money will automatically become a general departmental expense as specified in paragraph 4, exclusive of anticipated income from the Pool Fund.
6. The so-called $750 "Merit Raise" shall be, as in the past, a matter for the decision of the Departmental Chairman and the Dean and will automatically become a general departmental expense as specified in paragraph 4.
7. Prolonged illness of a clinician with consequent cessation of his earnings may be, at the discretion of the Department Chairman and the Dean, compensated for as a general departmental expense up to 100% of the clinician's ceiling for the first six months and thereafter the Departmental Chairman and the Dean are to make some suitable arrangement.
8. Clinicians who have retired from Departmental Chairmanships because of age (65) or other reasons, but remain as members of Clinical Departments until age 70 shall receive their earnings up to their allowed ceilings, less the usual deductions (Pool Fund, 10%, Departmental Expenses, 25%, Withholding Tax). Retired Chairmen who do not reach their allowed earned income ceiling must have the Dean's permission to have their income supplemented by their Department.
9. The estate of a clinician who dies while still a member of a Department shall retain indefinitely his rights to his earnings up to the time of his death. As a courtesy, however, money collected on his accounts shall be paid monthly to his heir or heirs without deductions for either the Pool Fund or Departmental expenses. Resigned or retiring clinicians likewise shall retain indefinitely their rights in their earnings up to the time of separation from the Department Each year, money collected on his accounts up to his allowed annual ceiling, shall be paid to him monthly after deducting ten percent (10%) for the Pool Fund and twenty percent (20%) for Departmental expenses.
10. Any question as to the interpretation of the provisions of this contract which shall arise during the time it is in force shall be adjudicated by the Clinical Staff Standing Committee for Remuneration and Contracts and the Dean of the School of Medicine.
11. A clinician who because of resignation wishes to surrender his TIAA-CREF contract shall procure from the Bursar of the University or the TIAA, whichever is empowered to make the payment, a refund of all money deposited by the clinician, by his Department and by the Pool Fund, plus accrued interest, and on the same basis, a refund of all sums deposited by the University provided he has completed three years of service on the faculty.
