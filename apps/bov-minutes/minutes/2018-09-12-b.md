Dr. Britt opened the meeting. After welcoming President Ryan, Dr. Niederhuber, Dr. Lukacs, Mr. Corey Feist, and Ms. J.J. Davis to their first meeting, he gave the floor to Dr. Shannon.

Reports from the Executive Vice President for Health Affairs

Dr. Shannon said the key to the Health System’s recent success has been its ability to recruit top talent despite being smaller than its competitors. To demonstrate, he reviewed a list of 16 top hires the University has recruited from Massachusetts General Hospital, Yale University, the University of Pennsylvania, Johns Hopkins University, the NIH, the Cleveland Clinic, Stanford University, the University of Chicago, and the University of Michigan. Dr. Shannon concluded with a status review of the Health System’s Operational Goals for FY 2019.

Health System Consolidated Financials Fiscal Year 2018 Year-End Report and Fiscal Year 2019 Year-to-Date Report

Mr. Doug Lischke reviewed the unaudited consolidated financials for FY 2018. The Health System’s budget for the year reflected the impact of the Epic scheduling, registration, and billing implementation. By year-end, it had recovered from the implementation. It also realized cost savings and experienced volume growth in May and June. As a result, the Health System ended the year with an operating income of $11.2 million versus the $1.8 million that had been budgeted. Mr. Lischke said that as of the end of August the Health System is on budget for Fiscal Year 2019.

The committee was pleased with the performance for FY 2018; several members noted the need to remain vigilant given changes and uncertainty in the health care market.

School of Medicine Report

Dr. Wilkes began with a report on accreditation and diversity. The School’s accreditation performance has been solid for eight years; a lack of faculty diversity is the only concern. The national average for faculty diversity is 6.2%. The School’s average had been 3.7%, but last year increased to 4.6%. The School’s diversity efforts have been recognized by Diversity Magazine which has given the School its Health Professions Higher Education Excellence in Diversity Award for six years in a row. As a part of its diversity efforts, the School is recruiting a Chief Officer for Inclusion and Wellness. Dr. Wilkes said upcoming changes to the admissions process by the Association of American Medical Colleges will make it harder to recruit minority students.

Dr. Wilkes said extramural research funding remains strong with the School receiving $223 million in FY 2018, a $21 million increase over FY 2017. He believes the $300 million extramural funding target can be reached within three years. Recent increases have been impacted by the strategic hires, which were responsible for $19.2 million of the $21 million increase for FY 2018.

Medical Center Chief Executive Officer Report

Ms. Sutton-Wallace reviewed the recent U.S. News & World Report rankings, which placed five Medical Center specialties and six children’s specialties in the top 50. The Medical Center was also named the number one hospital in Virginia for the third year in a row. Other national recognitions included a listing by Becker’s Hospital Review as one of the 100 Great Hospitals in America for 2018, 193 physicians ranked among the best in their specialties, and a listing as one of 60 honorees on the inaugural “Top Hospitals for Diversity” list.

Closed Session

At 11:50 a.m., the committee went into closed session upon the following motion made by Dr. Niederhuber, duly seconded, and approved.

Mr. Chair, I respectfully move the Health System Board into closed meeting to discuss proprietary, business-related information pertaining to the operations of the Medical Center and the Transitional Care Hospital including strategic personnel, investment, facility needs, growth initiatives, financial and market and resource considerations and efforts, update on joint ventures, affiliations, and partnership strategies, the long range financial plan and impacts of market and regulatory changes, and employee performance and other proprietary metrics; to consider confidential information and data related to the adequacy and quality of professional services, competency and qualifications for professional staff privileges, patient safety in clinical care and evaluation of the performance of specific personnel all for the purpose of improving patient care; and, in consultation with legal counsel, to discuss compliance with relevant federal and state legal requirements, licensure, legislative and accreditation standards, which involve proprietary business information of the Medical Center and Transitional Care Hospital and where disclosure at this time would adversely affect the competitive position of the Medical Center and Transitional Care Hospital.  The foregoing motion is authorized by Sections 2.2-3711 (A) (1), (6), (8) and (22) of the Code of Virginia.
