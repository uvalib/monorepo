**Also attending the orientation were Teresa A. Sullivan, Patrick D. Hogan, Thomas C. Katsouleas, Richard P. Shannon, M.D., Susan G. Harris, David W. Martel, Debra D. Rinker, Nancy A. Rivers, Gregory W. Roberts, Roscoe C. Roberts, and Farnaz Thompson.**

**At their places, the new members and other participants in the session were provided written materials on the orientation presentations and a copy of the University’s Code of Ethics.**

**Rector Goodwin welcomed the new members and gave opening remarks. He emphasized the importance of member participation in meetings. He said all members are welcome to attend all committee meetings even if they do not sit on the committee.**

**President Sullivan gave a short history of the University, remarking on its rocky start and several historical periods when UVA came perilously close to folding. She then spoke about some of the big issues the Board will be dealing with over the next few years. She called these issues the “whales in our pool”, i.e. those matters that UVA must tackle. The current “whales” are intergenerational turnover of faculty and administrators, including how to inculcate new members of the community in the University’s unique culture; alcohol and substance abuse and other mental health issues facing our students; and health care reform and its effects on the University.**

**“Large fish”, on the other hand, include the 10-year reaccreditation underway by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS), enrollment strategy, and bicentennial plans and the Campaign for the Third Century—the University’s future capital campaign. She said a strategy around enrollment must be addressed because the current plan, adopted in 2010, concludes in fall 2017. The University’s bicentennial will be celebrated beginning in October 2017 until 2026, but primarily focused on 2017 when the first cornerstone was laid to build the University, and 2019, the 200th anniversary of the University’s founding. President Sullivan provided an opportunity for participants to ask questions.**

**The Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Patrick Hogan provided a portfolio overview and reviewed the University’s financial position in some detail. He said UVA is financially sound because of a growing endowment and increasingly efficient and effective operations as well as a strategic investment fund, all of which allow for funding of the University’s Academic Division and Medical Center strategic plans. He said the size of the endowment is a little misleading, however, because most of the funds are restricted by donors to specific purposes. UVA’s financial strength is reflected in its triple A bond rating from the three rating agencies; the University is just one of three public universities in the country to receive the highest rating from all three agencies.**

**Mr. Hogan focused on UVA’s diverse revenue base and its Organizational Excellence program, which has a goal of achieving $150 million of savings and efficiencies over seven years (2015-2022). He pointed out that the Medical Center does not get any funding from the state General Fund.**

**Mr. Hogan explained the purpose of the Strategic Investment Fund, which was established by the Board of Visitors at the February 2016 regular meeting, and spoke briefly about the University’s capital program, including expenditures on capital construction over the past ten years. He concluded with a UVA “report card” of national rankings regarding affordability, quality, student debt, and return on investment. He said UVA is a “strong brand”.**

**Mr. Thomas Katsouleas, Executive Vice President and Provost, explained the Provost’s roles and responsibilities, including appointing deans of the schools, overseeing faculty hiring, and overseeing tenure decisions. Also in his portfolio are academic planning; global, arts, and outreach activities; and the University’s academic budget.**

**Mr. Katsouleas said faculty hiring is one of the big issues currently. He explained the predictions of generational turnover and spoke about cluster (strategic) and targets of opportunity (TOPS--opportunistic) hiring plans. Both require substantial funds for startup costs. He said faculty diversity is important and a consideration in hiring decisions.**

**Mr. Katsouleas reviewed the University’s strategy for investment in research in some detail, and spoke about the Pan-University Institute program, which brings together faculty from different schools who are working in a particular area. Two Pan-University Institutes have been approved, in Data Sciences and in studying the brain (UVA Brain Institute). He said more are on the horizon, and these are designed to sunset at some point in the future when the issues they are addressing are no longer at the forefront. He said research is not a money-making venture; the University engages in it as part of its mission. Academic research attracts quality faculty and students, and benefits society.**

**Mr. Katsouleas also spoke briefly about the Course Design Institute (CDI) which focuses on learner-centered pedagogy, and he concluded with a list of his current priorities.**

**Dr. Richard Shannon, Executive Vice President for Health Affairs, spoke about the UVA Health System. He said the Health System derives strength from being part of one of the world’s greatest public universities. He gave an overview of the various entities within the Health System, which include the Medical Center, the School of Medicine, the Claude Moore Health Sciences Library, Ambulatory Services, and other entities.**

**Dr. Shannon said the Health System goals are to become the safest place to receive care, to be the healthiest work environment, to provide the highest level of clinical care, to generate biomedical discovery that betters the human condition, to train the health care workforce of the future in teams, and to ensure value-driven and efficient stewardship of resources. He reviewed notable achievements in 2016 include ranking as the number one hospital in Virginia and providing the first pediatric liver transplant in Virginia. He said UVA is the only place in Virginia that does all solid organ transplants for both adults and children. He sees the Medical Center achieving top 10 status in certain specialties: Cancer, Diabetes, Biomedical Engineering, and Infectious Disease.**

**Dr. Shannon provided an overview of the Medical Center’s finances, explaining that the Medical Center has very sick patients which mean more revenue but also more expense in terms of supplies and other costs. The Medical Center is financially sound, with a 5.1% operating margin and strong cash flow.**

**Dr. Shannon said the Medical Center is investing in human and physical assets, but there are also headwinds facing the Health System in the future, particularly the state’s failure to expand Medicaid which will result in a $35 million hit, and Medicare’s rollback of facilities fees, a $40 million bogie.**

**The Medical Center has broken ground on a new bed tower that will allow a change to all private rooms. Three floors of the bed tower will be unprogrammed initially.**

**Dr. Shannon concluded with a message about the importance of eliminating waste including harm, overtreatment, failures in care delivery, failures in care transitions, excessive administrative costs, and fraud and abuse. If there is no defect and no error in care, healthcare can be affordable.**

**Roscoe Roberts, University General Counsel, spoke briefly about the attorneys representing the University, all of whom are appointed by the Virginia Attorney General. He introduced Farnaz Thompson, Assistant General Counsel. Mr. Roberts said there would be a presentation on the Freedom of Information Act and other legal issues with the full Board at the retreat.**

**The orientation session concluded at 2:30 p.m.**

**\----------**

**Retreat**

**The Board of Visitors began the annual retreat at 3:00 p.m. with Rector William H. Goodwin Jr. presiding. Present were Frank M. Conner III, Mark T. Bowles, L.D. Britt, M.D., Whittington W. Clement, Elizabeth M. Cranwell, Thomas A. DePasquale, Kevin J. Fay, Barbara J. Fried, Frank E. Genovese, John A. Griffin, Babur B. Lateef, M.D., John G. Macfarlane III, Tammy S. Murphy, James B. Murray Jr., James V. Reyes, Jeffrey C. Walker, Nina J. Solenski, M.D. faculty representative, and Phoebe A. Willis, student representative.**

**Also participating in some or all sessions were Teresa A. Sullivan, Patrick D. Hogan, Thomas C. Katsouleas, Richard P. Shannon, M.D., Susan G. Harris, Donna P. Henry, W. Thomas Leback, David W. Martel, Debra D. Rinker, Nancy A. Rivers, Roscoe C. Roberts, and Farnaz F. Thompson.**

**Presenters for specific sessions included Robert W. Battle, M.D., Melody S. Bianchetto, Jeffrey D. Blank, Karin S. Evans, Thomas F. Farrell II, Mark M. Luellen, Alice J. Raucher, Gregory W. Roberts, and Colette Sheehy.**

**Retreat Overview and Introduction of New Members**

**Rector Goodwin opened the retreat and asked Kevin Fay to say a few words about a model of the Emmet-Ivy corridor that would be on display in the evening.**

**Visioning Session with Faculty**

**At 3:20 p.m. members of the Board and approximately 60 faculty from across the University and The University of Virginia’s College at Wise began a session, facilitated by Darden School Professor Michael Lenox, to brainstorm about the future of higher education and specifically the University of Virginia as it enters its third century of existence. Deans, tenured senior faculty, and junior tenure-track faculty, as well as President Sullivan and other senior administrators, participated, with approximately 90 participants in all. A week before the session all participants were sent read-ahead materials on the future of higher education as well as the University’s strategic plan, the Cornerstone Plan, as background information.**

**The participants were divided into 10 small groups, each with a topic to consider. Mr. Lenox asked the groups to consider the following questions:**

1.  **What will higher education look like in 20 years?**
    1.  **Identify two key uncertainties or pivot points--things beyond our control — true uncertainties, not choices.**

*   1.  **Think broadly about higher education (not just UVA) and generate four scenarios from resulting 2x2.**

*   1.  **Have fun fleshing out stories - what does the world look like?**
    2.  **Come up with a creative title for each scenario (optional).**

1.  **What are the implications for UVA in each scenario?**

*   **Derive two (and no more than two) implications for UVA in each scenario.**

1.  **What opportunities flow from these implications?**
    1.  **Come up with actionable initiatives — verb + object.**
    2.  **Discuss ideas as a table.**
    3.  **Aim for three to four items.**

**After an hour in the small groups, a representative of each group presented to the larger group. The session ended at 5:30 p.m.**

**Reception and Dinner**

**At 6:30 p.m. the Board hosted a reception and dinner in the Pavilion of the Boars Head Inn. Guests included the visioning session participants and their spouses and other guests. At 8:10 p.m., Mr. Larry Sabato spoke about the presidential election and answered questions from the audience. The evening concluded at 8:45 p.m.**

**Monday, August 15**

**At 8:30 a.m. the Board Retreat resumed in the Pavilion of the Boar’s Head Inn; all members of the Board were present. Rector William H. Goodwin Jr. presided.**

**Business Matters—Approval of Signatory Authority for Medical Center Procurement of a Patient Monitoring System**

**After introductory remarks by Mr. Goodwin and recognition of the new members of the Board, Mr. Hogan explained the need for a resolution approving the contract for a patient monitoring system because the annual value of the contract exceeds administrative approval authority. Upon motion, the following resolution was approved unanimously:**

**SIGNATORY AUTHORITY FOR MEDICAL CENTER PROCUREMENT OF A PATIENT MONITORING SYSTEM**

**RESOLVED, the Board of Visitors authorizes the Executive Vice President for Health Affairs to execute a multi-year contract for the procurement of a patient monitoring system, based on the recommendation of the Chief Executive Officer of the Medical Center and the Executive Vice President for Health Affairs, and in accordance with Medical Center procurement policy.**

**Discussion on Emmet/Ivy Corridor**

**Mr. Fay introduced Ms. Alice Raucher, University Architect, who described the proposed plan for the Emmet/Ivy Corridor. She said the “star of the show” is the model that was on display in the lobby, developed by Dumont/Janks, landscape architects. She said connectivity to North Grounds for pedestrians and bicycles has been added to the plan, plus vehicular and pedestrian improvements at the Emmet/Ivy intersection. State funding received by the City of Charlottesville will contribute to the improvements proposed for this intersection.**

**The recommendations include adding an additional southbound right and northbound right turn on Emmet Street and revising traffic signal timing to improve vehicular wait time, which will reduce delay time by about 20%. In addition, the traffic island next to Nameless Field will be eliminated, which currently requires pedestrians to cross both the street and the turn lane.**

**Ms. Raucher described a plan to remove the Cavalier Inn and create green space on the northwest corner, which would also include wider and safer sidewalks for pedestrians and bike lanes. She said the programming for new buildings has not been done; the model shows where buildings could be placed to maximize green space potential and provide necessary stormwater management. Drawings showing the proposed improvements are attached to these Minutes (Attachment A).**

**Ms. Raucher reviewed next steps, which include capitalizing on the opportunity to coordinate with HB2/SmartScale funding for streetscape improvements, studying phasing possibilities to achieve University goals, developing details of pedestrian, bicycle, and vehicular connectivity to North Grounds, and developing plans for green space. Mr. Fay explained that these phase one improvements will achieve much of what the Board wanted to achieve and have a big impact on the corridor.**

**Committee Accomplishments for FY 2016 and Work Plans for 2017**

**Each of the committee chairs were asked to present their committee accomplishments for the past year and their plans for the coming year. Ms. Fried presented the Academic and Student Life Committee accomplishments and work plan. Mr. Griffin presented the Advancement Committee accomplishments and work plan, and asked that each member of the Board think of three names for the capital campaign chair. The Rector asked Mark Luellen to do a “pro” and “con” on having multiple or regional campaign chairs. Mr. Genovese presented the Audit, Compliance, and Risk Committee accomplishments and work plan, and Mr. Fay did the same for the Buildings and Grounds Committee.**

**Mr. Hogan presented the Finance Committee accomplishments and work plan, and Dr. Shannon, along with Dr. Britt, presented the Medical Center Operating Board accomplishments and work plan. For the Committee on The University of Virginia’s College at Wise, Chancellor Donna Henry outlined accomplishments and Mr. Macfarlane presented the work plan. The Ad Hoc Committee on Research work plan was combined with the next item on the agenda regarding research.**

**The work plans are attached to these Minutes (Attachment B).**

**Research Discussion**

**Mr. Walker provided opening remarks, and Mr. Katsouleas outlined the initial questions to be asked by the newly-formed Ad Hoc Committee on Research, and showed the “virtuous cycle” for research. An example of strategic research is Ben Calhoun, whose expertise is self-powered medical devices. He has over $4 million in active funding with a lab of 11 staff and students. He created a separate start-up company named PsiKick based on the technology. Mr. Calhoun also teaches multiple digital circuit and computer architecture classes.**

**Mr. Katsouleas outlined how research is organized at the University. He pointed out that some of it is decentralized in the individual schools, and some of it is across schools and overseen by the Vice President for Research office. He said the challenge is to double the level of research in the next seven to 10 years, with a goal of $500 million in research within seven years.**

**In answer to a question about why the committee is needed, Mr. Walker said the ad hoc committee is a task force which will sunset at some point in the future.**

**Mr. Goodwin asked for school-specific information to be provided to the committee. Mr. Katsouleas said the Pan-University Institutes are connective tissue among schools. Mr. Goodwin said he would like to see more aggressive growth in research. Mr. Katsouleas said you need resources and time to grow. He showed a slide on what it takes to grow, comparing UVA with other research universities, and a slide on research funding by school for those schools who receive significant external funding.**

**Mr. Reyes introduced the biomedical research part of the discussion. He said the strong are getting stronger and the good news is we are on our way. The hospital is very healthy, which is a great base.**

**Dr. Shannon said biomedical research is all about extramural funding—how much of other people’s money can we attract because of our ideas. The low point was 2014 when 21 faculty left, and now we have recovered back to the 2010 level. He showed a slide on what it will take to achieve our goals. Adding $50 million of NIH dollars to the School of Medicine will cause a rankings move from 40th to 29th nationally. UVA must recruit 25 more people and manage the existing individuals who are focused on research. UVA has a large number of basic scientists, only half of whom are meeting the minimum expectations in terms of funding. Underperformers must be managed within the tenure structure—as important as bringing in new researchers.**

**Commercialization is important: the School of Medicine continues to have an increase in disclosures, patent filings, and deals. This can provide another source to support the enterprise. Philanthropy is also extremely important in research. Dr. Shannon said researchers at UVA are developing a cure for a congenital form of blindness. He gave other examples, including eradicating a cause of diarrhea in developing countries, and developing an early signal for pancreatic cancer. There is not enough money to invest in everything and we must manage out underperformance.**

**Discussion ensued about the kinds of individuals UVA should attract. In order to build out the program, we need to attract mid-career researchers who are about to break through. Senior faculty have more research funding than junior faculty, so they must be replaced over the next five years.**

**Board members said they would like to have a presentation on what it will take to elevate research and research funding in each of the schools.**

**Mark Luellen, Vice President for Advancement, spoke about philanthropy related to the research enterprise. There is significant growth in corporate and foundation relations, but much more should be done. He said there should be more personnel dedicated to this area—right now there is one person and a staff assistant. It is necessary to train fundraisers differently so they know what the top priorities are in research. It is important to get the “doer” with the donor more quickly—faculty can be great salespeople. Investments in research help donors to become interested because we have a story to tell to excite donors to be partners in a research project.**

**David Martel presented on the public relations efforts with regard to research. There are challenges with the media, but we are consistently outperforming negative storytelling over the past 12 months with positive and neutral stories. The biggest story by far has been Jonathan Kipnis’ lab breakthrough on discovering a lymphatic system in the brain: 2.2 million page views.**

**Mr. Martel said it is important to continue to invest and raise the profile of the research performed at UVA. He showed a 60-second video called “Shared Energy”.**

**Freedom of Information Act**

**Following a short break for lunch, General Counsel Roscoe C. Roberts conducted a briefing on the Virginia Freedom of Information Act and showed a video produced by the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia (SCHEV). He referred members to a memo on legal responsibilities he sent to the Board as well as a memo from the Attorney General’s office on FOIA.**

**Bicentennial Planning and Third Century Campaign**

**Mr. Conner reviewed the agenda for the session and said the goal is to position the University for the next 200 years. He introduced Robert W. Battle, M.D., and Thomas F. Farrell II, the Bicentennial Commission co-chairs, who spoke about their plans for the Bicentennial Commission.**

**Mr. Farrell said we want to commemorate and celebrate the past 200 years, but also look to the future. He spoke about the Commission Charter and explained that the Bicentennial should have lasting impact. One outcome will be a document about the future of higher education and the University’s unique role — the University should be a leader. He read from a letter by Jefferson to Peter Carr about his reasons for creating the University of Virginia. Mr. Farrell described the structure of the Commission in some detail.**

**Dr. Battle explained the timeline. The first “hard date” is October 6, 2017, which is 200 years to the day that the first cornerstone was laid at the location of Pavilion VII, with three U.S. presidents in attendance. He spoke about a young slave, a Mr. Thrimston Hern, who may have physically laid the stone. We will never know a great deal about the role of slaves because there is very little documentation. Dr. Battle outlined other events that will be commemorated. He quoted William Faulkner from _Requiem for a Nun,_ “The past is never dead. It’s not even past.”**

**Dr. Battle spoke quite eloquently about commemorating all of the University’s history and our hopes for the future of the University. He quoted a Rita Dove poem, and said the world has called and we need to answer with honesty, honor, and humility, but also with inspiration, creativity, unbridled enthusiasm, and unself-conscious diversity.**

**President Sullivan introduced Kari Evans, Executive Director of the Bicentennial, and addressed work that has been done on programming for the Bicentennial. Many other institutions were surveyed about their commemorations. She said possible events include:**

*   **October 5 - 6, 2017 – Launch event to commemorate 200th anniversary of the laying of the cornerstone.**
*   **April 13, 2018, Founder’s Day Rotunda Ball.**
*   **January 25, 2019 – Charter Day; 200 events around the world involving UVA Clubs in the U.S. and abroad.**
*   **Fall 2019 – Presidential Ideas Festival at the Miller Center – This will be a three-day event that will convene scholars, authors, thought leaders, policy makers, and members of the media to discuss the presidency.**
*   **Fall 2019 – Launch of the Third Century Campaign.**
    *   *   **Ongoing lecture series to attract high-profile speakers, including people with ancestral connections to Jefferson or descendants of slaves who built the University’s original buildings, and those with subject-matter expertise in certain topics.**
        *   **Exhibit at the Fralin Art Museum, “Jefferson and Architecture” in spring 2018.**
        *   **Exhibit at the Harrison Institute, “A History of the University in 100 Objects,” to complement the UVA Press book _Object Lessons._**
        *   **Final Exercises - The academic regalia for students graduating in 2017, 2018, and 2019 will include a yoke embroidered with the bicentennial logo.**
            *   **Theme-based tours, for example:**
            *   **Gardens**
            *   **Architecture**
            *   **Arts and Sculpture**
            *   **Literary**
            *   **African-American**
            *   **Women**

**Mr. Luellen and Mr. Martel explained marketing and communication strategy, and Mr. Luellen addressed plans for the Third Century Campaign. Ms. Sullivan said the campaign will be launched in 2019 and is likely to be seven years. She added that there will be additional Bicentennial celebrations in 2026: the first class graduated, Mr. Jefferson died, and it is the anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.**

**Mr. Murray remarked that 2019 is the 400th anniversary of the first legislative assembly in the new world, the first Africans in the new world, the first European women in the new world, and the first thanksgiving, all of which occurred in Virginia. The Yorktown Commission is determined to make a big celebration, so there may be some overlap. Conversations have begun with the Miller Center; it would be nice to consider all of this.**

**Access UVA and Strategic Investment Fund**

**Mr. Goodwin announced that he was forming an ad hoc committee between this meeting and the September meeting to make recommendations about the Strategic Investment Fund in terms of plans for asset allocation. He selected Mr. Macfarlane, Mr. Murray, Ms. Murphy, Dr. Britt, and Mr. Bowles, with Mr. Conner as chair.**

**Mr. Goodwin said some of the discussion in the papers is incorrect or they are working on the wrong assumptions. He directed everyone to a document on the Board website and elsewhere that provides answers to the statements that have been made. It was done to help set the record right.**

**Mr. Goodwin said the Board and administration have worked really hard to have need-blind admissions and provide 100% of need to families. The two $1,000 step increases did not go to operations; they flow into additional aid to help lower debt. UVA is the lowest in the state in net tuition for families earning under $125,000.**

**Mr. Goodwin said Mr. Hogan is making an effort to make the University more efficient. Mr. Katsouleas is new, and he knows that there is work to do with regard to the faculty. The statement that we are “cavalier” and don’t think about students is not a correct statement.**

**Mr. Goodwin said he will say “I” and be responsible for the creation of the Strategic Investment Fund. He looked at public financial information, not private, and available to everyone, about three years ago, and he could see big numbers. He began chatting about it a couple of years ago with Victoria Harker and Pat Hogan, and together they figured out how to protect the Triple A rating. He said he thought the State of Virginia has about $9 billion in reserves, and if they did the same thing, they would have $450 million of extra income to support the state budget. The idea of cash management and using the funds to generate income is fairly new. Mr. Goodwin said he thought others will learn from what UVA has done and do it themselves.**

**Mr. Goodwin said part of the money was already in endowment. The purpose of the Strategic Investment Fund is to take a normal endowment draw off this money and try to use it to help all facets of the University. He stressed that there is no list right now of what the fund will support. If the grants are for three years, the amount is not that large. He asked the ad hoc committee to think in terms of asset allocation: how should we think about allocating this money? How do we make the University better than it is today, in educational terms, in faculty compensation terms, in student tuition terms? Ultimately, UVA should be able to gain value from this.**

**Mr. Goodwin explained the sources of the funds. He said approximately $700-800 million is strictly from earnings by the University of Virginia Investment Management Company (UVIMCO), not quite one-third is from the money freed up by the line of credit, and one-third is from reserves that have been funded. It is not a mystery and nothing “funny” has been done. In the last couple of years those involved were able to see a way to do some planning to take advantage of this asset.**

**Mr. Goodwin said the University is leading-edge. This is another example of doing a good job. This kind of thing is done in private life very easily.**

**Mr. Conner said this work will come to be seen, in time, as creative and innovative. All of the public universities have reserves, and they should be considering utilizing them in the same ways. The public rolling out of this was pre-empted and that is unfortunate. The Board and the University have chosen not to respond to the poison of prejudicial prose with similar advocacy because that would be losing sight of why we are here in the first place.**

**Mr. Conner said he met Captain Humayun Khan’s father a few days before, and the father said he wanted to convey how proud Mr.Khan was of his association with the University of Virginia. The funding effort is a way to focus on that purpose, and when it is characterized inaccurately we lose sight of this.**

**Mr. Goodwin transitioned into a discussion about financial aid, and he asked President Sullivan to present. Ms. Sullivan said Access UVA provides 100% of need for all students, and the application is “need blind.” “Need blind” means students are admitted without regard for their financial status. Financial need is met through different kinds of resources, but debt is limited to $4,000 for low income Virginians and $7,000 for out of state students who are low income. UVA has been recognized nationally for being one of the best values in higher education.**

**Ms. Sullivan showed Money Magazine’s methodology on value. Estimated price, also called “cost of attendance”, includes tuition, fees, room and board, books and transportation. UVA is tied for third in the state for estimated price (cost of attendance); William & Mary and Virginia Commonwealth University have a higher cost of attendance. If financial aid is taken into account, the estimated price drops to $12,000, which is the lowest in the Commonwealth. The chart also shows job earnings of graduates, which are very competitive with everyone on the list. Student debt shows that UVA is a top buy nationally.**

**The net price calculator, required by the U.S. Department of Education, which is total price less grants, shows that at UVA net price for a family of four, one student in college with income of $40,000, would be $4,666 a year. With loans and work-study, the net price is $660. Ms. Sullivan showed other scenarios with different family income levels. UVA has the best net price in the state for a family of four with income of $40,000, a family of four with income of $80,000, and tied with others for a family of four with income of $100,000. Even at $125,000 family income, UVA is very competitive with the other institutions in Virginia. With loans and work-study, it is lower than the others.**

**Ms. Sullivan showed a profile of the students receiving aid. Many are first generation and are underrepresented minorities. The same demographic applies to out-of-state students on aid.**

**Members of the Board pointed out that the cumulative (four year) cap on loans for low income in-state students was reduced last year from $14,000 to $4,000. Across income categories, the cap on total debt is $18,000. Mr. Fay pointed out the facts are clear that the out-of-state students are not being subsidized, and are subsidizing in-state students. Mr. Goodwin said the level of out-of-state aid is a question that may be addressed in the future. Ms. Fried said geographic diversity benefits Virginians, and President Sullivan pointed out that many truly outstanding students would not be here except for Access UVA. Virginians are given the opportunity to be with these truly outstanding students from elsewhere. Mr. Macfarlane calculated that the out-of-state students pay 64% of tuition and they represent 30% of the student body.**

**Mr. Goodwin summarized what he has heard from legislators about the Strategic Investment Fund. He said the comments vary greatly; the majority have been mindful and supportive of what UVA is doing.**

**The final part of the session consisted of questions and comments by members of the Board. Faculty representative Dr. Solenski commended Mr. Goodwin for the vision and for being very proactive in investing. Ms. Fried said it is hard to overcome lying soundbites, but we have to do so; it is important to continue to make the case in an affirmative way. Mr. Fay reminded everyone that no student is paying the full cost of their education at the University — everyone is benefiting from the work of UVIMCO and the largess of the endowment and donors.**

**Mr. Goodwin mentioned that the President and he will be meeting with a joint legislative committee on August 26. Mr. Hogan reminded the Board that the Auditor of Public Accounts and the Office of Inspector General are also looking into the creation of the fund and they will issue a report. Mr. Goodwin said he hoped that what is done in September will look good to most people. Mr. Genovese recommended that the University hire a full-time person in strategic planning looking out 20 or more years from now.**

**Closed Session**

**After adopting the following motion, the voting members present plus Nina Solenski, Phoebe Willis, Teresa Sullivan, Roscoe Roberts, Susan Harris, and Farnaz Thompson participated in a closed session at 4:10 p.m.:**

**I move that the Board of Visitors go into closed session to deliver and discuss an evaluation of the University President’s performance, specifically a discussion of progress on goals for academic year 2015-2016 and development of goals for academic year 2016-2017, which includes a personnel discussion of other University administrators. The relevant exemption is Section 2.2-3711(A)(1) of the Code of Virginia. This discussion in closed session is further authorized by Section 23-2.03(A) \[23.1-1303 (B)(8) after October 1, 2016\] of the Code of Virginia.**

**At 5:00 p.m., the Board concluded the closed session and approved the following motion unanimously by roll call vote. Voting in the affirmative: Mr. Goodwin, Mr. Conner, Mr. Bowles, Dr. Britt, Mr. Clement, Ms. Cranwell, Mr. DePasquale, Mr. Fay, Ms. Fried, Mr. Genovese, Mr. Griffin, Dr. Lateef, Mr. Macfarlane, Mr. Murray, Mr. Reyes, and Mr. Walker. Ms. Murphy was not present during the closed session meeting.**

That we vote on and record our certification that, to the best of each Board member’s knowledge, only public business matters lawfully exempted from open meeting requirements and which were identified in the motion authorizing the closed session, were heard, discussed or considered in closed session.

**\----------**
