A special meeting of the Rector and Visitors was held on this date with Rector C. Handing Walker, and Visitors Dillard, Hall, Hart, Rinehart, and Williams, and President Alderman present.

The minutes of the previous meeting were approved.

The President reported an enrollment of 1937 students to date.

The following gifts were reported and the President directed to prepare the usual resolution of thanks on the part of the Board:

From Dr. J. Shelton Horsley, of Richmond, Va., $10,000 for the establishment of a prize based upon research for a thesis in Surgery, or the allied medical sciences having a relationship with the development of Surgery. This prize is open for competition to graduates of the Medical Department of the University of Virginia who have been in the field of active work for not more than fifteen years.

From Mr. Hollis Rinehart, of Charlottesville, Va., $1,600, from the interest on which sum, $100.00 in gold shall be an annual prize to be given for the most meritorious piece of scientific research, by any member of the academic staff, during the year, the prize to be known as "The President and Visitors' Prize."

From Judge John Barton Payne, of Washington, D. C., $1,200 for improvements in the new home of the Department of Art and Architecture.

From Dr. W. W. Yen, of Peking, China, formerly Minister in Foreign Affairs, Prime Minister of China, Ambassador from China to Germany, $1,000, to be used in the work of the University, in any way that the governing body thinks best.

From Mr. Blewett Lee, of New York City, valuable collection of books on the military history of the Confederacy, including biographies of many of the Confederate leaders, collected by his father, General Stephan D. Lee.

From Stuart Fuller, Alonzo Barbour and Lewis Barbour, Committee on collecting fund for furnishing colored ward at University Hospital, $425.13.

From Alice Gordon, Chairman Jefferson School (Colored) children for colored ward at University Hospital, $163.00.

The President reported the resignation of Dr. Harold L. Alden as Associated Professor of Astronomy, whereupon the following resolution was adopted:

RESOLVED, That the Rector and Visitors of the University accept with regret the resignation of Dr. Harold L. Alden, Associate Professor of Astronomy. Dr. Alden has carried forward his work with ability and devotion at this University, and the Rector and Visitors wish him continued success in his new field.

The Board heard with deep regret the President's announcement of the death of Dr. Theodore Hough, Dean of the Medical Department, and Professor of Physiology, which occured November 30, 1924. Whereupon the following resolution was adopted:

The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia desire to place on record their sense of genuine and profound loss in the death of Theodore Hough, Dean of the Department of Medicine, which occured on November 30th, 1924.

Theodore Hough had served the University as Professor and Dean of the Medical Department for seventeen years. In these services he had given evidence of high scholarship, intellectual ability of a high order, and great devotion to his duty. His services to the University in the contest over the proposed removal of the Medical Department of the University to Richmond were of a most distinguished character, and entitle him to the lasting gratitude of the Institution.

It is the desire of the Rector and Visitors that these resolutions be spread upon the minutes of the Board, and that a copy be sent to the widow of Dr. Hough.

Upon the recommendation of the President, Dr. James Carroll Flippin was appointed Acting Dean of the Department of Medicine.

Upon the recommendation of the President the elections and promotions as contained in the following resolutions were duly made:

RESOLVED, by the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, That Mr. George B. Zehmer be and is hereby elected Director of Extension, at a salary of $3,750, incumbency to begin on July 1, 1925.

The President announced that arrangement had been made with Harvard University for a Virginia-Harvard Course in Architecture by which a student of the University of Virginia receiving his B. S. in Architecture could, upon a completion of a two year course at Harvard, receive the degree of M. Arch. The proposed course was approved by the Board in the following resolution adopted:

RESOLVED, That the agreement entered into between the President, Prof. Hudnut, and Dean of the Department of Architecture of Harvard University establishing the Virginia-Harvard Course in Architecture be and is hereby approved, and the course as arranged for be spread upon the minutes.

It is proposed to offer a professional course in architecture to be given jointly by the faculty of the School of Architecture of Harvard University and the faculty of the McIntire School of Fine Arts of the University of Virginia.

An outline of this course, giving the subjects to be taught in each year, is attached to these notes. This outline is offered merely as a basis for discussion; not all the details for the proposed course are decided upon.

The work of the first four years, indicated upon this outline, would be given at Virginia; that of the last two years at Harvard. The work at Virginia comprises those cultural subjects which are essential to an architect's education, (such as mathematics, French, history, and the history of the arts) and those subjects which form the basis of his professional education (such as drawing, design, and problems in ordinary construction). The work at Harvard comprises advanced professional study.

The degree B. S. in Architecture would be given at the end of the four years study by Virginia. The degree M. Arch would be given by Harvard upon completion of the course.

At present Virginia offers a four-course in architecture which is taken up almost entirely with technical studies. Harvard offers a course of professional study which can be completed by the average student in four years; but no student may take this course unless he has first received the degree B. A. (or B. S.) from a university or college. The advantages of the proposed course, as compared with either of these existing courses, are the following:

1\. It is a course in which cultural and technical subjects are associated, in a systematic way, throughout six years of study.

The technical subjects necessary for an architect's training require in themselves four years of study. But architecture ought not be taught as a craft only; it is obviously, a learned profession which ranks with law and medicine. The extension of the course to six years will permit the inclusion of cultural subjects without abridging in anyway the necessary technical study. But this cultural study will not, as in the usual B. A. or B. S. course be disassociated with professional study. It is hoped that both types of discipline may be related in this course in some balanced scientific manner.

2\. It will postpone the period of advanced professional study and yet provide for an early development of the artistic faculties.

The average student who has not advanced beyond high school grade is not prepared to approach properly the major subjects of a profession. Yet it is essential that an architect should begin at the earliest possible moment to learn to draw, to develope an appreciation for beauty in form and line, to become familiar with artistic ideas and the history of these ideas, and to have some experience with the artist's way of working. The usual undergraduate professional course, such as now given at Virginia, does not provide properly for this development; nor is it usually provided for in a B. A. or B. S. course.

3\. It will permit a student to take the fullest advantage of the special qualities of the two schools which are associated in this course.

Virginia is the best possible university for a Southern student, but we are obviously poorly equiped for instruction in the major subjects of and architect's education. Such instruction requires an extensive equipment, a large architectural library, museums, a faculty of specialists, and a civic environment. The proposed course will include in the first four years given at Virginia sufficient professional work to serve as a basis for the future practice of architecture should the student be unable to continue his study at Harvard. At the end of these four years he will be better equiped for ultimate success than are the students who complete the present four-year course at Virginia. A student who, having completed the first four years of the proposed course, continues his professional study at Harvard will take up this advanced work, under the stimulus of a new environment, at a time when he is best able to receive the utmost benefit from it. Such a student will receive, I believe, the best preparation for architecture which can be obtained in the United States.
