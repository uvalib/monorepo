President Darden presented to the Board the following resolution adopted on 4 May 1954 by the National Association of State Universities, meeting at Salt Lake City Utah:

John Lloyd Newcomb, second president of the University of Virginia, died in Charlottesville on February 22 after a brief illness. He was seventy-two years old at the time of his death.

"Newk", as he was known to his intimates, was a man of incisive mind and rare personal charm. His administration was marked by a steady growth in all departments of the University, even during the times of economic depression, and in the troubled war years his guidance was sure. More than fifty years of unbroken association with the University had given him a knowledge of its history wider than that of any other member of the academic community, and although he had retired from the Presidency in 1947 his counsel was sought regularly up to the time of his death.

He shunned the limelight and was not an orator in the usual sense; he had few superiors, however, in the ability to analyze a problem and present the arguments pro and con clearly, concisely and persuasively. His fund of anecdotes made him the center of attraction in social gatherings.

There can be no doubt that he was fiercely loyal to the University of Virginia, there can be no doubt that the University is grieved that he is gone.

The Board resolved that this tribute to the memory of John Lloyd Newcomb be spread upon the minutes of the Board, and that the Secretary be directed to convey a copy of the Resolution to Mr. Newcomb's sister, Mrs. Hunter Gates.

C. Venable Minor, Special Counsel of the University, appeared before the Board relative to the matter of the two trusts established by Paul Goodloe McIntire with United States Trust Company of New York, Trustee, dated December 5, 1923, under which, after the death of his daughter, Charlotte Virginia McIntire, the University is named as remainder beneficiary.

Mr. Minor briefly reviewed his letter to Mr. Darden of March 11, 1954, which was presented to the Board at its meeting held on March 12, 1954. Since that date, Mr. Minor pointed out, the resolution adopted by the Board at its March meeting, approving in part a proposed compromise agreement had been transmitted to Messrs. White and Case, New York counsel for the University, and had been submitted by them to counsel for Mrs. Hilda Hall McIntire, widow and Executrix of Mr. McIntire.

This resolution eliminated a proposal that Mrs. McIntire, should she survive Charlotte Virginia McIntire, receive payments from the trusts during the remainder of her life. Counsel for Mrs. McIntire was unwilling to accept the proposed compromise agreement in the form approved by the Board at its March meeting and after further negotiation and discussion, it was suggested that the compromise agreement contain the following provision:

In the event that said Charlotte Virginia McIntire shall die prior to December 31, 1964, and said Hilda Hall McIntire shall survive her, the University of Virginia shall pay to said Hilda Hall McIntire annually at the end of each calendar year thereafter, if then living, but in no event after December 31, 1964, an amount equal to the average of the annual payments made to said Hilda Hall McIntire under Paragraph Third hereof.

Mr. Minor stated that except for this provision the compromise agreement submitted to the Board on March 12, 1954, was not materially changed. He further pointed out that the quoted provision was approved by counsel for Mrs. McIntire and that the adoption of the compromise agreement with the change above quoted was recommended by Messrs. White and Case and by him as its adoption would settle all matters in controversy and put an end to the litigation. At most it represented a concession of not exceeding ten years.

After discussion and consideration of Mr. Minor's statement and the text of the proposed compromise agreement dated March --, 1954, as amended, upon motion, duly seconded and carried it was:

**RESOLVED** that the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia hereby ratifies and approves, in the form presented to this meeting, the compromise agreement dated March --, 1954, to be entered into by all of the parties in interest under the two trusts established by Paul Goodloe McIntire with United States Trust Company of New York, Trustee, dated December 5, 1923.

**BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED**, that the proper officers of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia be, and they hereby are, authorized and empowered to execute in the name and on behalf of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, an agreement when presented, substantially in the form and substance as presented to this meeting.

The Rector presented a letter from Mr. W. W. Archer conveying another copy of the letter he had read to the Board on May 26th and appealing for a reversal of the penalty imposed on his son for his misconduct on April 4th.

The Board resolved, after a brief discussion, that the Rector write to Mr. Archer and advise him that the Board adhered to the decision reached on May 27th, 1954.

The Rector read to the Board a message from Mr. and Mrs. Bocock and the Rev. Holt Souder asking the Board to reverse the action taken by President Darden complying with the Board's Resolution of 27 May 1954, in withholding the degree of Frederic Bocock. A message from Mr. Robert Hill Carter, pointing out that a delay in Bocock's commission would mean an inferior file number in the Navy, was also read to the Board.

President Darden stated that in obedience to the Board's Resolution of May 27th he had arranged with Colonel Wood that Messrs, Martin and Talman would get their Army reserve commissions in June, the academic suspensions, however, will defer their degrees until June 1955. Mr. Bocock, on the other hand, will get both his commission and his degree at the close of the Summer Session in August 1954. President Darden said he had gone to Washington and conferred personally with Admiral Holloway, the Chief of Naval Personnel, who had caused Captain Livdahl to inquire into the case of Mr. Bocock, the result being a recommendation to confer the commission at the same time as the degree.

The Board resolved, following a discussion of the matter, that the President should reply to these messages, and inform Mr. and Mrs. Bocock, the Rev. Mr. Souder, and Mr. Carter that the Board has considered their messages, and has decided to adhere to its decision of May 27th sustaining the President's academic suspension of Mr. Bocock, but authorizing the President to impose this penalty in such a manner as to prevent loss of the military commission.

The Rector reminded the Board that Mr. Alexander W. Parker had asked for abstracts of the voting at the special meeting of May 26th-27th, the minutes of which have not yet been read and approved by the Board. The abstracts were thereupon approved as presented by the Secretary, and the Rector was authorized to deliver these abstracts to Mr. Parker.

Dr. Emmett said that in view of some criticism in medical circles of the University's delay in appointing a new Professor of Surgery, he wished to make it a matter of record that the Committee now engaged in finding a suitable man for this post has his full confidence. The Chair of Surgery being a key position, he approved the Committee's action in taking the necessary time to make an exhaustive search for the best possible man.

The Board resolved (1) to hold no meeting in July or August except upon special call by the Rector, and (2) to give the President interim authority to make temporary appointments during the summer, subject to confirmation by the Board at the next regular meeting in September.

Mr. Vincent Shea, University Comptroller, appeared before the Board at the request of Mr. Mears, Chairman of the Finance Committee, for a discussion of the University Budget for the fiscal year 1954-55, copies of which were laid before the Board.

Following a discussion that included special reference to salary increases, the proportions and manner of exhibiting State and local funds, the Institute of Public Affairs, the Law Library, and the status of Seward Forest, the Board resolved to approve and adopt the Budget. Total revenues are estimated at $6,271,659, and expenditures at $6,170,332, leaving a surplus of $101,327.

Mr. Mears, in discussing matters related to the budget, said that in view of the excellent summary presented by Mr. Black as acting chairman at the March meeting, he would make no further report for the Finance Committee.

The Rector stated, in connection with the discussion of Seward Forest, that it would be helpful if the Board could have for consideration at its September meeting a list of vacant lots and lands owned by the University, some of which he thought it might be advantageous to sell. The Comptroller was accordingly requested to prepare such a list.

Mr. Shea then withdrew from the meeting.

The Rector, advising the Board that Mr. Bernard Mahon had withdrawn his request to appear at today's meeting, asked President Darden to comment on the administrative situation at Mary Washington College.

Mr. Darden reported on the discussion he had held with a group of seven persons at Fredericksburg relative to the College and its future. He had told this group that he favored the appointment of an executive vice-president for the College who would ultimately succeed to the presidency. President Darden felt that the Board had followed a wise course in handling the administrative problem at Mary Washington College, and that this course should be followed at least until next year, and administered with firmness, because it provided the best hope for avoiding injurious dissension and obtaining of effective operation of the College. He also recommended the retention of Mrs. Harris as Dean for at least one more year for the sake of continuity.

The Rector introduced to the Board seven students, Messrs. William L. Tazewell, Blaine T. Phillips, Stuart Harris, H. Mebane Turner, Stuart Valentine, R. Wheat Wallenborn, and Twyman Bowman, who had requested permission to confer with the Board at today's meeting.

Mr. Tazewell read to the Board a gloomy but generalized statement bearing the signatures of himself and his six associates. This statement, which was filed with the Secretary, referred to alleged low student morale and a lack of student understanding and sympathy with the administration as reflected in a meeting of a group of several hundred students who met at Cabell Hall on the evening of May 27th.

In the extended discussion that followed, a division of opinion appeared between those of the students who favored more authority for the Student Council and those who felt that the Student Council and the Director of Student Affairs had usurped disciplinary powers that the President ought to delegate and leave to the Inter-Fraternity Council.

Judge Barksdale expressed regret that the student committee had failed to meet with his special committee of the Board at the time he had agreed to meet with them in May, and he requested that Mr. Tazewell or Mr. Harris notify him as promptly as possible of a future date convenient to the students for such a conference. Judge Barksdale requested also that each of the seven students, regardless of whether he could come to the conference, should submit in advance a detailed statement which should be specific as to both criticisms and suggestions.

The following resolution was adopted by the Board:

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that Dr. Laura B. Voelkel, Assistant Professor of Greek and Latin at Mary Washington College, be and she is hereby granted leave of absence without pay to serve as visiting professor of the history and criticism of art at the University of Wisconsin for the first semester of the session of 1954-55.

The following resolution was adopted by the Board:

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the following persons be and they are hereby elected to the faculty:

* Mr. Sidney H. Mitchell, as Instructor in English at Mary Washington College, at a session salary of $3,240.00, to begin September 13, 1954.
* Miss Mary Jo Parrish, as Instructor in Biology at Mary Washington College, as of September 13, 1954, at a salary of $3,240.00.

On motion the meeting was then adjourned.
