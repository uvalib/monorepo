The contract was presented, read, approved, and ordered spread upon the minutes, as follows:

By deed dated June 22nd, 1932, which is to be recorded in the Clerk's Office of the Corporation Court of Charlottesville, W. A. Lambeth and Mrs. Frank Irene Lambeth, his wife, conveyed to The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, a certain lot of land near the University, with all improvements thereon, accurately described in said deed.

While said deed operates to vest in said The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia the fee simple title in and to the property thereby conveyed, without restrictions, reservations or conditions of any kind, it is understood and agreed by said W. A. Lambeth and Mrs. Frank Irene Lambeth, his wife, and The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, that said conveyance is actually made upon certain conditions and subject to certain reservations and agreements which are hereinafter in this contract fully set forth.

NOW, THEREFORE, THIS CONTRACT made this 22nd day of June 1932, by and between said The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, hereinafter called Grantee, of the first part, and said W. A. Lambeth and Mrs. Frank Irene Lambeth, his wife, hereinafter called Grantors, of the second part,

WITNESSETH:

That in consideration of the conveyance aforesaid said party of the first part agrees:

1. That said property shall hereafter be known as "Villino Lambeth".

2. That said Grantee will proceed at once to connect said property with its electric, sewer and water systems, and will hereafter furnish said property with electric, sewer and water service upon the same terms given residents in other University property.

3. That so long as said W. A. Lambeth desires he may occupy said premises as a home, or rent said property in his own name, at such figure as he may desire, collecting all rentals therefrom, and treating said property as his own, and during said period of occupancy or rental by said Lambeth he shall maintain said property in as good physical condition as it is now, and shall pay all insurance premiums and other charges. Fire insurance shall be taken out and maintained by said Grantee in its own name from the date of delivery of said deed, all premiums to be charged to said Lambeth personally to the date of his retirement as a member of the University Faculty, and after that date such charge for premiums shall be made against the $200.00 payment referred to in the next paragraph of this contract.

4. Beginning as of the date of said Dr. Lambeth's retirement, however, said Grantee agrees that it will contribute the sum of $200.00 each year toward maintenance of said premises, insurance, heat and light. And if, at any time, it becomes practicable to connect said premises with one of the heating mains of the University such connection will be made.

5. Said Lambeth may continue to occupy said premises as a home as long as he lives, and should his said wife survive him she may also continue to occupy said premises under the terms outlined above as long as she lives.

6. After the death of both of said Grantors said property shall be held by said Grantee in absolute fee simple, it being understood, however, that it is the desire of said Lambeth that said premises be occupied by the Professor of Italian Language whenever this may be practicable.

IN TESTIMONY WHEREOF said The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia has caused its name to be signed hereto by Frederic W. Scott, its Rector, and its corporate seal to be hereunto affixed and attested by E. I. Carruthers, its Secretary, and said W. A. Lambeth and Mrs. Frank Irene Lambeth have hereunto affixed their respective signatures and seals, all of which is done this 22nd day of June 1932.

The Acting President reported a transfer of $1,500 from the capital outlay appropriation by the State to the Fire Protection System appropriation to cover deficit in said fund, whereupon the following was adopted:

RESOLVED, by the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, that the action of the Acting President of the University in requesting the transfer of $1,500 from the Capital Outlay appropriation to the Fire Protection System be, and the same is, hereby approved.

The question as to whether or not the sprinkler system of fire prevention could be used to advantage in any of the University buildings was discussed and the matter was referred to Mr. Stuart for study and report.

The Acting President reported to the Board the death of Mr. John S. Patton, former Librarian of the University, whereupon the following resolution was adopted:

RESOLVED, by the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, That they have heard with profound regret of the death, on October 1, 1932, of Mr. John Shelton Patton, who, for twenty-four years faithfully served as Librarian of the University of Virginia. The very genuine sympathy of the Rector and Visitors goes out to his family in their bereavement.

RESOLVED, FURTHER, That a copy of this resolution be sent to the family.

Mr. Walker, chairman of a special committee to prepare resolutions with respect to the late Benjamin Franklin Buchanan, presented the following which was adopted:

The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia desire to preserve in their records some memorial of Hon. Benjamin Franklin Buchanan, of Marion, Virginia, and to record some expression of their sense of the loss which has been sustained by the Board of Visitors and the University in his death which occurred in the City of Richmond on the 21st of February 1932 during the session of the Senate of Virginia, of which he was a distinguished and influential member.

He was first appointed a member of the Board of Visitors in 1904; his service under this appointment terminating in 1908. It was during this period that Dr. Edwin A. Alderman was elected the first President of the University. He was again appointed a Visitor in 1926, and re-appointed in 1930, serving on the Board from 1926 until his death as one of the representatives of the Alumni Association of the University.

For many years one of the best known and most prominent men in public life in the State, much could be said in recognition of the valuable service which he rendered his State and his country in the several positions of honor and trust which he held, in all of which his service was marked by conspicuous ability, fidelity and devotion to duty.

As one of the half dozen leaders in the Virginia Senate, as the trusted counsellor and friend of Governors, as Lieutenant Governor for a period of four years, and as General counsel for the Comptroller of the Currency for several years during the administration of President Wilson, he enjoyed unusual opportunities for useful and patriotic service, and he performed his duties and discharged his responsibilities with characteristic efficiency and modesty.

It is however, in his relation to the University, and especially as a member of this Board, that it is appropriate to speak of him here.

His intimate knowledge of public affairs, especially in regard to the financial condition of the State and his familiarity with the needs and interests of the University with which he kept in touch when not a member of the Board of Visitors through his connection with the Alumni Association and its Board of Trustees, coupled with the esteem and confidence in which he was held by his associates in the General Assembly, contributed in a large degree to his usefulness as a member of the Board of Visitors and as the representative and guardian of the interests of the University in the legislature.

While entirely affable and free from all affectation, his manners and bearing were characterized by a gentle dignity entirely in keeping with his physical presence upon which nature had stamped unmistakably its hallmark of "gentleman".

The Board of Visitors has lost the benefit of his wise counsel, his ripened judgment, and his loyalty and zeal for the interests of the University, and there is no one of his associates who has not suffered the loss of a warm personal friend.

The Rector presented the following letter from Mrs. Alderman expressing her appreciation of the use of the President's House since President Alderman's death:

I have the impulse to send to you and through you to each member of the Board of Visitors my message and appreciation and gratitude for your kindness in permitting me to live through these months in the President's House.

I am building a small house here which should be finished by December first but I beg that you will let me know at any time before that date if it is necessary or advisable for the University to have this house.

With my cordial good wishes,

The Treasurer of the General Athletic Association submitted his report of the financial condition of the association for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1932 which was read, discussed, and ordered filed.

The meeting then adjourned.
