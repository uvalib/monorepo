APPROVAL OF THE MINUTES OF THE MEETING OF FEBRUARY 7-8, 2008

On motion, the Board approved the Minutes of the last meeting of the full Board, held February 7-8, 2008.

RESOLUTION FOR ADDENDA TO THE AGENDA

After reminding the Board that the _Manual_ specifies that consideration of addenda to the published Agenda of a Board meeting must be approved by the Board, the Rector called for a motion to approve the necessary resolution. The motion was moved, seconded, and passed, and the Board adopted the following resolution:

RESOLVED, the Board of Visitors approves the consideration of addenda to the published Agenda.

INTRODUCTION OF THE NEW STUDENT BOARD MEMBER

The Rector introduced Ms. Adom Getachew, the Student Board Member-elect, who was chosen in the last session of the February Board meeting. Ms. Getachew is a third year student in the College from Arlington. She is a Jefferson Scholar, an Echols Scholar, and an honorary Holland Scholar, among a great many other achievements and activities. She will succeed Mr. Mignerey as the Student Member at the conclusion of this Board meeting.

RESOLUTION COMMENDING CAREY JOSEPH MIGNEREY

The Rector then thanked Mr. Mignerey for his outstanding service on the Board and proposed a resolution of commendation. On motion, the following resolution was approved:

WHEREAS, Carey Joseph Mignerey matriculated in the College in 2000 as a Jefferson Scholar and again in the School of Law in 2006; and

WHEREAS, Mr. Mignerey, as an undergraduate, was elected an Echols Scholar, a member of the Raven Society, a member of Phi Beta Kappa, Sigma Chi and belonged to other organizations too numerous to mention; and

WHEREAS, Mr. Mignerey was Chair of the Honor Committee in 2003-2004; and

WHEREAS, Mr. Mignerey took a B.A. in Government and Foreign Affairs, in the Distinguished Majors Program, in 2004; and

WHEREAS, Mr. Mignerey, after working for McKinsey & Company in Atlanta and in the Middle East, entered the Law School in 2006; and

WHEREAS, Mr. Mignerey was elected the Student Member of the Board in February, 2007; and

WHEREAS, Mr. Mignerey’s term on the Board of Visitors expires on April 12, 2008; and

WHEREAS, Mr. Mignerey’s service on the Board has been exemplary as a Board Member, as an articulate and effective voice of student opinion, and in all ways as an expression of his devotion to the University;

RESOLVED, the Board of Visitors thanks Carey Joseph Mignerey for his service, and for his contributions to the Board and to the University as a whole, as well as for his friendship, and wishes him every success as he continues his study of the law.

\- - - - - - - - - -

At the Rector’s request, Mr. Sandridge, Executive

Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, proposed a resolution approving the adoption of the Emergency Operations Plan, devised by the City of Charlottesville, Albemarle County, and the University. Mr. Sandridge explained that the Commonwealth of Virginia Emergency Services Law of 1973 requires that each city and county develop and maintain a plan of this sort.

On motion, the Board adopted the following resolution:

ADOPTION OF INTEGRATED EMERGENCY OPERATIONS PLAN

WHEREAS, the Board of Visitors and the University of Virginia are concerned with the health, safety, and well-being of members of the University community and desire that the best possible emergency service be available to them; and

WHEREAS, the Commonwealth of Virginia Emergency Services Law of 1973 requires that each city and county develop and maintain an Emergency Operations Plan which addresses its planned response to emergency situations; and

WHEREAS, such a plan has been developed by University staff in coordination with the Virginia Department of Emergency Management with input from local agencies;

RESOLVED, the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia does hereby adopt the City of Charlottesville, County of Albemarle, and University of Virginia Integrated Emergency Operations Plan, to include plans and procedures for both peace time and war-caused disasters.

DISCUSSION OF BOARD MEETING DATES FOR 2009-2010

At the Rector’s request, the Vice Rector, Mr. Wynne, who will become Rector on July 1, 2009, led a discussion of proposed changes in the schedule of Board meetings.

Mr. Wynne proposed first off a schedule of meetings on essentially a quarterly basis – one in September, one in mid-November, one in mid to late February, and one in early June. The Board Retreat, according to this plan, would be attached to a Board meeting – beginning, say, on a Friday afternoon and continuing through Saturday morning, or beginning Saturday morning and running all day.

The 2009 Retreat certainly would be held in conjunction with one of the fall meetings of the Board; the rest of the schedule changes could take effect that fall, depending on Members’ schedules.

Mr. Wynne proposed, too, returning to the schedule of a 1-1/2 – 2 hour session at each Board meeting devoted to discussion of a strategic topic. Also, he advocated going back to the custom of annual reports for committees. He suggested, too, that the Board do a periodic self-evaluation to make sure that it is working on the right things and in the right way; he said 2009-2010 would be the year to do this.

Some adjustments would have to be made to the present schedule of setting tuitions in order that this conform to the proposed meeting schedule, but it would not be an insurmountable problem. The Board Office will check the President’s long-term schedule and poll Members about changing the previously established meeting schedule for 2009.

SUMMER ORIENTATION

At the Rector’s request, the Secretary spoke briefly about Members’ roles in the summer orientation of incoming undergraduate students. Members for the last several years have participated in the opening of each of the orientation sessions; the participation has consisted of brief remarks to the assembled matriculants and their parents on the importance of the Honor System to the life of the University. It has been a very successful part of orientation.

The Secretary urged Members to volunteer for this summer’s sessions, and he handed around a sign-up roster.

PRESIDENT’S REPORT

The Rector asked the President to give his customary report.

The President spoke briefly about the General Assembly session which concluded when the Legislature rose on March 13th. April 12th, he said, is the last day for the Governor to take action on legislation sent to him by the General Assembly; the Legislature then will reconvene on April 23rd to consider the Governor’s vetoes and amendments. The General Assembly, also on April 23rd, will consider the capital improvement bond bills.

The President pointed out that because the state budget is not yet final, the undergraduate tuition rates which normally are brought to the Board for approval at the April meeting, will not be set until the budget bill is approved.

He then announced the appointment of Ms. Stewart Gamage as Director of the Morven Institute. Ms. Gamage, a Petersburger who is currently Vice President for Public Affairs at the College of William and Mary, will take up her duties in August. She was Director of the Virginia Liaison Office and Senior Assistant to Governors Robb and Baliles; Policy Director for the former U.S. House Majority Leader, Congressman Gephardt; and Chief Operating Officer of APCO Associates, one of the largest public affairs firms in Washington.

Ms. Gamage will be responsible for the development of programming at Morven.

The Hospital Auxiliary is celebrating its one hundredth anniversary this year – note was taken of this at the recent meeting of the Medical Center Operating Board, and a commemorative resolution was adopted by the General Assembly. The President said a reception honoring the Auxiliary will be held at Carr’s Hill this fall.

GIFTS AND GRANTS REPORT

The President reported that philanthropic giving to the University and its related foundations this fiscal year (which began on July 1st, 2007) was $204.7million through February 29th. This is $13.9million, or 6.4%, less than giving during the same period last year.

Nonetheless, the Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy, Athletics, the Miller Center, the University Library, and the UVa Fund all report significant increases in giving.

Among significant gifts received since the last meeting of the Board, the President reported a bequest of $1,800,000 from David Allen Mayhugh for research in the School of Medicine; a deferred gift of $1,043,570 from Mrs. A. Stuart Robertson, Jr., for the endowed scholarships in the School of Law; a pledge payment of $1,000,000 from the Smithfield-Luter Foundation for an endowment for the Medical School; a pledge of $5,000,000 from the Claude Moore Charitable Foundation for the Claude Moore Medical Education Building; $2,000,000 from John G. Macfarlane, III to the Darden School Foundation for the Center for Asset Management; $1,000,000 pledged by Richard B. Gilliam, Sr. and Mrs. Leslie F. Gilliam for the Emily Couric Clinical Cancer Center; and a $1,000,000 pledge from Gregory S. Ledford to the McIntire School of Commerce Foundation, to be split between the Davis B. Ledford Faculty Fellowship and the Demong-Pettit Faculty Fellowship.

The Rector called for a resolution accepting the Gifts and Grants Report. The following resolution was proposed and approved:

RESOLVED, the Gifts and Grants Report for the period January 1, 2008, through February 29, 2008, is accepted.

SESSION ON APRIL 11TH

The Board adopted the following motions allowing it to go into Executive Session, at 3:40 p.m.:

That the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia convene in Closed Session for the purpose of discussing and/or approving personnel actions involving the appointment, reappointment, nomination, evaluation, performance, compensation, and resignation of specific University officers and employees, as provided for in Section 2.2-3711 (A) (1) of the Code of Virginia.

  
     That the Board of Visitors convene in Closed Session to consult with General Counsel regarding his privileged legal report to the Board on pending and anticipated litigation affecting the University, and on legal review of policy governing University-related foundations; and to consult further with legal counsel with respect to Code requirements governing conflicts of interests, as provided for in Section 2.2-3711 (A) (7) of the Code of Virginia.

 That the Educational Policy Committee of the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia convene in Closed Session to discuss the scholastic performance of specific students and the competency of academic advising provided by specific personnel of the University, as permitted by Section 2.2-3711 (A) (1) and (2) of the Code of Virginia.

\- - - - - - - - -

The Board resumed its meeting in Open Session at 5:20 p.m., and adopted the following resolution certifying that its discussions in Executive Session had been conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Virginia Freedom of Information Act:

That we vote on and record our certification that, to the best of each Board member’s knowledge, only public business matters lawfully exempted from open meeting requirements and which were identified in the motion(s) authorizing the closed session, were heard, discussed or considered in closed session.

\- - - - - - - - - - -

APPOINTMENT OF SPECIAL COMMITTEES

The Rector announced the appointment of two ad-hoc Committees, one to establish criteria to be used in preparation for choosing successors to retiring senior members of the Administration, and the other to study both the process of the election of the Rector and Vice Rector and their terms of office. The Members of the first Committee are to be Messrs. Wynne, Farrell, and Ligon, the President, and Ms. Gertrude Fraser, Vice Provost for Faculty Advancement. Ms. Dorsey and Messrs. Diamonstein and Mastracco are to be the Members of the second Committee.

CHANGE IN THE DINNER AT THE JUNE BOARD MEETING

The Rector told the Board that changes in the structure of the dinner at the June Board meeting are advisable. The dinner has for some time been designated as an occasion to which former Members of the Board are invited, but in the last few years, very few former Members have attended. The dinner also is the occasion on which retiring Members are honored for their service on the Board. The Rector observed that the latter aspect of the evening has become the more important and he proposed a resolution approving his decision to change this to the stated purpose of the dinner.

He also charged the ad-hoc Committee which will consider the election and terms of the Rector and the Vice Rector, with considering other events at which former Members can be invited to return.

The following resolution was moved, seconded, and approved:

RESOLVED, the Board approves the change in format of the June dinner honoring retiring Members.

APPROVAL OF NEW POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO NOTIFY PARENTS OF TAX-DEPENDENT STUDENTS IN INSTANCES OF PSYCHOLOGICAL EMERGENCY

WHEREAS, House Bill 1005, passed during the 2008 General Assembly Session, provides notice under certain circumstances to the parents of a dependent student receiving mental health treatment at a state college or university student health or counseling center; and

WHEREAS, the bill specifically requires a parent of a dependent student to be notified when there exists a substantial likelihood that, as a result of mental illness the student will, in the near future, (i) cause serious physical harm to himself or others as evidenced by recent behavior or any other relevant information or (ii) suffer serious harm due to his lack of capacity to protect himself from harm or to provide for his basic human needs; and

WHEREAS, the bill allows such notification to be withheld if the student’s treating physician or treating clinical psychologist has made a part of the student’s record a written statement that, in the exercise of his professional judgment, the notification would be reasonably likely to cause substantial harm to the student or another person; and

WHEREAS, the bill requires that the governing boards of each institution shall establish the policies and procedures necessary to comply with the legislation;

RESOLVED, in accordance with HB 1005 and commencing the effective date thereof on July 1, 2008, the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia hereby affirms as University policy the aforesaid parental notification requirement which shall be implemented as follows:

1\. The University’s Department of Student Health shall notify promptly the Dean of Students or his/her designee whenever the Department treats a student who meets the criteria for parental notification under this legislation; and

2\. The Dean of Students or his/her designee shall be primarily responsible for contacting the parent of any such dependent student as required by state law, and documenting such notification as appropriate under the circumstances.

The foregoing general procedure is subject at all times to the authority and direction of the University’s Vice President and Chief Student Affairs Officer to approve notification by such other University office or personnel as may be necessary or appropriate under the circumstances.

IMPLEMENTATION OF POLICIES ADDRESSING THE

NEEDS OF POTENTIALLY SUICIDAL STUDENTS

WHEREAS, Virginia Code § 23-9.2:8 requires the governing boards of each public institution of higher education to develop and implement policies that advise students, faculty, and staff, including residence hall staff, of the proper procedures for identifying and addressing the needs of students exhibiting suicidal tendencies or behavior; and

WHEREAS, Virginia Code § 23-9.2:8 prohibits each institution from establishing policies that penalize or expel any student solely for attempting to commit suicide or seeking mental health treatment for suicidal thoughts or behaviors; and

WHEREAS, Virginia Code § 23-9.2:8 permits each institution to establish policies and procedures for appropriately dealing with students who are a danger to themselves, or to others, and whose behavior is disruptive to the academic community;

RESOLVED, the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia approves the continuation of the University’s Suicide Prevention Program, established in 1996, and outlined in the Attachment, to comply with Virginia Code § 23-9.2:8; specifically:

Nothing herein shall be construed as prohibiting the University from issuing any maturity of the Series 2008 Bonds as one fully registered bond for the purpose of qualifying such Bonds for book entry registration by a Securities Depository or any similar arrangement whereby investors may hold a participation interest in such maturity of the Series 2008 Bonds.

In case any of the officers who shall have signed or attested any of the Series 2008 Bonds shall cease to be such officer or officers of the University before the Series 2008 Bonds so signed or attested shall have been issued by the University, such Series 2008 Bonds may nevertheless be delivered and issued and, upon such delivery and issue, shall be as binding upon the University as though those who signed and attested the same had continued to be such officers of the University.

The Registrar shall not be required to transfer or exchange any Series 2008 Bond selected or called for redemption pursuant to the provisions therein or from a Record Date through the next succeeding Interest Payment Date.

Whenever any Series 2008 Bonds shall be surrendered for registration of transfer, the University shall execute and the Registrar shall authenticate and deliver a new Series 2008 Bonds, of authorized denominations of the same maturity and interest rate and for a like aggregate principal amount. Such transfer shall be without charge to the Bondholder, except that the Registrar shall require the Bondholder requesting such transfer to pay any tax or other governmental charge required to be paid with respect to such transfer.

*   1.  **Exchange of the Series 2008 Bonds**. The Series 2008 Bonds may be exchanged at the office of the Registrar for a like aggregate principal amount of the Series 2008 Bonds of other authorized denominations of the same maturity and interest rate.

The Registrar will keep or cause to be kept, at its office in \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, sufficient books for the registration and transfer of the Series 2008 Bonds, which shall at all times during regular business hours upon reasonable notice be open to inspection by the University; and, upon presentation for such purpose, the Registrar shall, under such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, register or cause to be registered, on such books, the transfer or exchange of the Series 2008 Bonds as hereinbefore provided. Notices sent to Bondholders pursuant to this Resolution shall be sent to the addresses shown on the registration books maintained by the Registrar or such other address as may be filed with the Registrar for such purpose. All notices required to be given by mail shall be given by first class mail, postage prepaid.

            2.  to the Holders of 25% or more in aggregate principal amount of the Series 2008 Bonds then outstanding, at any time.

Any temporary Bond may be printed, lithographed or typewritten, shall be of such denomination as may be determined by the University and may contain such reference to any of the provisions of this Resolution as may be appropriate. A temporary Bond may be in the form of a single Bond payable in installments, each on the date, in the amount and at the rate of interest established for the Series 2008 Bonds maturing on such date. Every temporary Bond shall be executed by the University and be authenticated by the Registrar upon the same conditions and in substantially the same manner as the definitive Series 2008 Bonds. If the University issues temporary Series 2008 Bonds it will execute and deliver definitive Series 2008 Bonds as promptly thereafter as practicable, and thereupon the temporary Series 2008 Bonds may be surrendered, for cancellation, in exchange therefor at the office of the Registrar and the Registrar shall authenticate and deliver in exchange for such temporary Series 2008 Bonds an equal aggregate principal amount of definitive Series 2008 Bonds of authorized denominations of the same maturity or maturities and interest rate. Until so exchanged, the temporary Series 2008 Bonds shall be entitled to the same benefits under this Resolution as definitive Series 2008 Bonds authenticated and delivered hereunder.
    2.  **Series 2008 Bonds Mutilated, Lost, Destroyed or Stolen**. If any Series 2008 Bond shall become mutilated, the University, at the expense of the Bondholder of such Series 2008 Bond, shall execute, and the Registrar shall thereupon authenticate and deliver, a new Series 2008 Bond of like tenor bearing a different number in exchange and substitution for the Series 2008 Bond so mutilated, but only upon surrender to the Registrar of the Series 2008 Bond so mutilated. Every mutilated Series 2008 Bond so surrendered to the Registrar shall be canceled by it and shall be delivered to, or upon the order of, the University. If any Series 2008 Bond shall be lost, destroyed or stolen, evidence of the ownership thereof and of such loss, destruction or theft may be submitted to the University, and the Registrar and, if such evidence be satisfactory to both of them and indemnity satisfactory to them shall be given, the University, at the expense of the Bondholder, shall execute, and the Registrar shall thereupon authenticate and deliver, a new Series 2008 Bond of like tenor bearing a different number in lieu of and in substitution for the Series 2008 Bond so lost, destroyed or stolen (or if any such Series 2008 Bond shall have matured or shall be about to mature, instead of issuing a substitute Series 2008 Bond, the Paying Agent may pay the same without surrender thereof). The University may require payment of a sum not exceeding the actual cost of preparing each new Series 2008 Bond issued under this Section and of the related expenses which may be incurred by the University, the Registrar, and the Paying Agent. Any Series 2008 Bond issued under the provisions of this Section in lieu of any Series 2008 Bond alleged to be lost, destroyed or stolen shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation on the part of the University whether or not the Bond so alleged to be lost, destroyed or stolen be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to the benefits of this Resolution with all other Series 2008 Bonds secured by this Resolution.
    3.  **Terms and Conditions for Issuance and Delivery of the Series 2008 Bonds**. The Series 2008 Bonds authorized by this Resolution shall be executed in the form and manner hereinabove set forth and shall be deposited with the Registrar for delivery to the Underwriters pursuant to the Bond Purchase Agreement, but before the Series 2008 Bonds shall be delivered by the Registrar, there shall be filed with the Registrar the following:
        1.  a copy, certified by the Secretary of the Board, of this Resolution;
        2.  an opinion of Bond Counsel stating that the issuance of the Series 2008 Bonds has been duly authorized and that all conditions precedent to the delivery of such Bonds have been fulfilled.

When the documents mentioned above in this Section shall have been filed with the Registrar and when the Series 2008 Bonds shall have been executed as required by this Resolution, the Registrar shall deliver such Bonds to or upon the order of the Underwriters pursuant to the Bond Purchase Agreement, but only upon payment to the Custodian of the purchase price of such Bonds. The Registrar shall be entitled to rely upon such Bond Purchase Agreement as to the names of the purchasers and the amount of such purchase price.

The proceeds of such Bonds shall be deposited as described by the Custodian in Section 4.1.

*   1.  **Book Entry Provisions**. The provisions of this Section 2.11 shall apply to the Series 2008 Bonds so long as all of the Series 2008 Bonds shall be maintained in book-entry form with a Securities Depository, any other provisions of this Resolution to the contrary notwithstanding.
        1.  The principal or redemption price of and interest on the Series 2008 Bonds shall be payable to the Securities Depository, or registered assigns, as the registered owner of the Series 2008 Bonds, in next day funds on each date on which the principal of, and premium, if any, or interest on the Series 2008 Bonds is due as set forth in this Resolution and in the Series 2008 Bonds. Such payments shall be made to the offices of the Securities Depository specified by the Securities Depository to the University and Paying Agent in writing. Without notice to or the consent of the beneficial owners of the Series 2008 Bonds, the University and the Securities Depository may agree in writing to make payments of principal and interest in a manner different from that set out herein. If such different manner of payment is agreed upon, the University shall give the Paying Agent notice thereof, and the Paying Agent shall make payments as if set forth herein. Neither the University nor the Paying Agent shall have any obligation with respect to the transfer or crediting of the appropriate principal, premium, if any, and interest payments to participants of the Securities Depository or the beneficial owners of the Series 2008 Bonds or their nominees.
        2.  The Paying Agent at the direction of the University may replace any Securities Depository as the depository for the Series 2008 Bonds with another qualified securities depository or discontinue the maintenance of the Series 2008 Bonds in book-entry form at any time if the University determines to do so. Notice of any determination above shall be given to such Securities Depository at least 30 days prior to any such discontinuation (or such fewer number of days as shall be acceptable to such Securities Depository). The University may undertake to locate a qualified replacement Securities Depository and/or may discontinue the book-entry system of evidencing ownership of the Series 2008 Bonds.
        3.  If the Paying Agent discontinues the maintenance of the Series 2008 Bonds in book-entry form, the University will issue replacement Series 2008 Bonds directly to the participants in the former Securities Depository or, to the extent requested by any such participant, to the beneficial owners of the Series 2008 Bonds as further described in this Section. The Paying Agent shall notify participants and the beneficial owners of the Series 2008 Bonds, by mailing an appropriate notice to the Securities Depository, or by other means deemed appropriate by either the Securities Depository or the Paying Agent, that the University will issue replacement Series 2008 Bonds directly to the participants shown on the records of the Securities Depository or, to the extent requested by any participant, to beneficial owners of the Series 2008 Bonds shown on the records of such participant, as of a date set forth in such notice, which shall be a date at least 10 days after receipt of such notice by the Securities Depository (or such fewer number of days as shall be acceptable to the Securities Depository).

In the event that replacement Series 2008 Bonds are to be issued to participants in the Securities Depository or to beneficial owners of the Series 2008 Bonds, the University shall promptly have prepared replacement Series 2008 Bonds registered in the names of the participants as shown on the records of the former Securities Depository or, to the extent requested by any participant, in the names of the beneficial owners of Series 2008 Bonds shown on the records of such participant, as of the date set forth in the notice delivered in accordance with the immediately preceding paragraph. Replacement Series 2008 Bonds issued to participants in the Securities Depository or to beneficial owners shall be in fully registered form substantially in the form of Exhibit A. The form set forth in Exhibit A may be modified to include any variations, omissions or insertions that are necessary or desirable in the delivery of replacement certificates in printed form. In delivering replacement certificates, the Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely, without independent investigation, on the records of the former Securities Depository as to its participants and the records of the participants acting on behalf of the beneficial owners. The Series 2008 Bonds will thereafter be registrable and exchangeable as set forth in Sections 2.6 and 2.7.

*   *   1.  So long as there is a Securities Depository for the Series 2008 Bonds, (1) such Securities Depository shall be the registered owner of the Series 2008 Bonds, (2) transfers of ownership and exchanges shall be effected on the records of the Securities Depository and its participants pursuant to rules and procedures established by such Securities Depository and its participants, and (3) references in this Resolution to Bondholders, Holders or registered owners of the Series 2008 Bonds shall mean the Securities Depository and shall not mean the beneficial owners of the Series 2008 Bonds.
        2.  If the Paying Agent replaces any Securities Depository as the depository for the Series 2008 Bonds with another qualified Securities Depository, replacement Series 2008 Bonds issued to such replacement Securities Depository shall have the same terms, form and content as the Series 2008 Bonds initially registered in the name of the predecessor Securities Depository or its nominee except for the name of the registered owner.
        3.  Each Securities Depository and the participants thereof and the beneficial owners of the Series 2008 Bonds, by their acceptance of the Series 2008 Bonds, agree that the University and the Paying Agent shall have no liability or responsibility with respect to (1) the accuracy of any records maintained by such Securities Depository or any Securities Depository participant; (2) the payment by such Securities Depository to any Securities Depository participant or by any Securities Depository participant to any beneficial owner of any amount due in respect of the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on the Series 2008 Bonds; (3) the delivery or timeliness of delivery by such Securities Depository to any Securities Depository participant or by any Securities Depository participant to any beneficial owner of any notice which is given to Bondholders; (4) the selection of the beneficial owners to receive payment in the event of any partial redemption of the Series 2008 Bonds; or (5) any consent given or other action taken by such Securities Depository or any nominee of such Securities Depository, as Bondholder.

        1.  The Series 2008 Bonds that are stated to mature on or after June 1, 2019 are subject to redemption, at the option of the University, in whole or in part on any date not earlier than June 1, 2018, upon payment of a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Series 2008 Bonds to be redeemed, plus interest accrued to the redemption date.
        2.  The Series 2008 Bonds that are stated to mature on June 1, 20\_\_\_ shall be subject to mandatory redemption by the University at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest, on June 1 in the following years and in the following amounts:

\* Final Maturity

On or before the 70th day next preceding any mandatory sinking fund redemption date, the University may apply as a credit against its mandatory sinking fund redemption obligation for any Series 2008 Bonds maturing on such date, any Series 2008 Bonds that previously have been optionally redeemed or purchased and canceled or surrendered for cancellation by the University and not previously applied as a credit against any mandatory sinking fund redemption obligation for such Series 2008 Bonds. Each such Series 2008 Bond so purchased, delivered or previously redeemed shall be credited at 100% of the principal amount thereof against the principal amount of the Series 2008 Bonds required to be redeemed on such mandatory sinking fund redemption date. Any principal amount of Series 2008 Bonds so purchased, delivered or previously redeemed in excess of the principal amount required to be redeemed on such mandatory sinking fund redemption date shall similarly reduce the principal amount of the Series 2008 Bonds to be redeemed on future mandatory sinking fund redemption dates, as selected by the Chief Operating Officer of the University.

*   *   1.  The Series 2008 Bonds shall also be subject to redemption in whole or in part on any date, at the option of the University, from the proceeds of casualty insurance or condemnation awards, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed, without premium, plus accrued interest to the redemption date, if all or any part of the Project financed with the Series 2008 Bonds is damaged or destroyed or taken through the exercise of the power of eminent domain and the Chief Operating Officer has delivered a certificate to the Custodian to the effect that the University has determined not to use such proceeds to replace or rebuild the damaged, destroyed or taken property. In the event of a redemption in part pursuant to this paragraph, the University shall redeem the Series 2008 Bonds from each maturity then outstanding, to the extent practicable, in the proportion that the principal amount of the Series 2008 Bonds of such maturity bears to the total principal amount of the Series 2008 Bonds then outstanding.
        2.  Subject to applicable procedures of the Securities Depository while the Series 2008 Bonds are held in book-entry only form by the Securities Depository, if less than all of the Series 2008 Bonds are to be called for redemption, the Series 2008 Bonds to be redeemed shall be selected by the University in such manner as the University in its discretion may determine.
    
    1.  **Notice of Redemption**. Whenever the Series 2008 Bonds are to be redeemed under the provisions of this Resolution, the Paying Agent shall, not less than thirty (30) nor more than sixty (60) days prior to the redemption date, mail notice of redemption to all registered owners of all Series 2008 Bonds to be redeemed at their registered addresses. The Paying Agent shall also mail a copy of any such notice of redemption to any Rating Agency. Any such notice of redemption shall identify the Series 2008 Bonds to be redeemed, shall specify the redemption date and the redemption price, and shall state that on the redemption date the Series 2008 Bonds called for redemption will be payable at the office of the Paying Agent and that from that date interest will cease to accrue. The Paying Agent may use "CUSIP" numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Bondholders, provided that any such notice shall state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Series 2008 Bonds or as contained in any such notice.
        1.  If at the time of mailing of notice of any optional redemption the University shall not have caused to be deposited with the Paying Agent money sufficient to redeem all the Series 2008 Bonds called for redemption, such notice may state that it is conditional in that it is subject to the deposit of such moneys with the Paying Agent not later than the redemption date, and such notice shall be of no effect unless such moneys are so deposited. Failure by the Paying Agent to give any notice of redemption or any defect in such notice as to any particular Bonds shall not affect the validity of the call for redemption of any Bonds in respect of which no such failure or defect has occurred. Any notice mailed as provided in this Bond Resolution shall be conclusively presumed to have been given whether or not actually received by any Holder.
    2.  **Effect of Calling for Redemption**. On the date designated for redemption, notice having been mailed in the manner and under the conditions hereinabove provided and moneys for payment of the redemption price being held in separate accounts by the Paying Agent in trust for the Holders of the Series 2008 Bonds to be redeemed, all as provided in this Resolution, the Series 2008 Bonds so called for redemption shall become and be due and payable at the redemption price provided for redemption of such Bonds on such date, interest on the Series 2008 Bonds so called for redemption shall cease to accrue, such Bonds shall cease to be entitled to any benefit or security under this Resolution and the Holders or registered owners of such Bonds shall have no rights with respect thereto except to receive payment of the redemption price.
    3.  **The Series 2008 Bonds Redeemed Not Deemed Outstanding**. The Series 2008 Bonds which have been duly called for redemption under the provisions of this Article, or with respect to which irrevocable instructions to call for redemption have been given by the Board to the Paying Agent in form satisfactory to him or her, and for the payment of the redemption price of which moneys shall be held in separate accounts by the Paying Agent in trust for the Holders of the Series 2008 Bonds to be redeemed, all as provided in this Resolution, shall not thereafter be deemed to be outstanding under the provisions of this Resolution.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, however, the University may issue bonds to refund any Qualifying Senior Obligation and to secure such refunding bonds with the same source of revenues securing the Qualifying Senior Obligation being refunded. Upon the defeasance of the refunded Qualifying Senior Obligation pursuant to any such refunding, the refunding bonds will be considered Qualifying Senior Obligations for all purposes.
    3.  **Disposition of Assets**. The University may convey, sell or otherwise dispose of any property of the University as long as (1) such conveyance, sale or encumbrance is in the ordinary course of business, or (2) an Authorized Officer certifies in writing that, taking into account the conveyance, sale or other disposition of such property (i) the University will have sufficient funds to meet all of its financial obligations, including its obligations to pay principal of and interest on all Credit Obligations for all Fiscal Years to and including the second full Fiscal Year after such conveyance, sale or other disposition and (ii) such Authorized Officer has no reason to believe that the University will not have sufficient funds to pay all amounts due under all indebtedness of the University then outstanding.

        1.  The University shall not use or permit the use of any proceeds of Series 2008 Bonds or any other funds of the University, directly or indirectly, in any manner, and shall not take or permit to be taken any other action or actions, which would result in any of the Series 2008 Bonds being treated as an obligation not described in Section 103(a) of the Code by reason of classification of such Bond as a "private activity bond" (except for those Series 2008 Bonds which the University has designated or allocated as "private activity bonds" benefiting a 501(c)(3) organization) or an "arbitrage bond" or "bond not in registered form" within the meaning of Section 103(b) of the Code.
        2.  The University shall at all times do and perform all acts and things permitted by law and this Resolution which are necessary or desirable in order to assure that interest paid on the Series 2008 Bonds or any of them will be excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes and shall take no action that would result in such interest not being excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes.

    EVENTS OF DEFAULT AND REMEDIES
    1.  **Events of Default**. Each of the following events is hereby declared to be an "Event of Default" under this Resolution:
        1.  due and punctual payment of the principal, purchase price or redemption premium, if any, of any of the Series 2008 Bonds is not made when the same become due and payable, either at maturity or by proceedings for redemption or otherwise;
        2.  due and punctual payment of any interest on any of the Series 2008 Bonds is not made when the same becomes due and payable;
        3.  the University, for any reason, is rendered incapable of fulfilling its obligations hereunder;
        4.  an order or decree is entered, with the consent or acquiescence of the University, appointing a receiver or receivers of the University or any part thereof or of the revenues thereof, or if such order or decree, having been entered without the consent or acquiescence of the University, is not vacated or discharged or stayed on appeal within sixty (60) days after the entry thereof;
        5.  any proceeding is instituted, with the consent or acquiescence of the University, for the purpose of effecting a composition between the University and its creditors or for the purpose of adjusting the claims of such creditors pursuant to any federal or state statute now or hereafter enacted; or
        6.  the University defaults in the due and punctual performance of any other of the covenants, conditions, agreements and provisions contained in the Series 2008 Bonds or in this Resolution on the part of the University to be performed, and such default continues for thirty (30) days after written notice specifying such default and requiring same to be remedied is given to the Board by any Bondholder, provided that if such default is such that it can be corrected but cannot be corrected within such thirty (30) day period, it shall not constitute an Event of Default if corrective action is instituted by the University within such period and is diligently pursued until the default is corrected.
    2.  **Remedies**. Upon the happening and continuance of an Event of Default, hereunder, the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Series 2008 Bonds, by instrument or instruments filed with the University and proved or acknowledged in the same manner as a deed to be recorded, may appoint a trustee to represent the Holders of the Series 2008 Bonds for the purposes herein, which trustee may be the State Treasurer and shall be the same trustee so appointed with respect to all other outstanding Parity Credit Obligations. Such trustee may, and upon written request of the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Series 2008 Bonds then outstanding shall, in its own name:

By mandamus or other suit, action or proceeding at law or in equity enforce all rights of the Holders of the Series 2008 Bonds, including the right to require the University and its Board to collect fees, rents, charges or other revenues adequate to carry out an agreement as to, or pledge of, such revenues, and to require the University and Board to carry out any other agreements with the Holders of the Series 2008 Bonds and to perform it and their duties under the Act;

Bring suit upon the Series 2008 Bonds;

By action or suit in equity, require the University to account as if it were the trustee of an express trust for the Holders of the Series 2008 Bonds; or

By action or suit in equity, enjoin any acts or things which may be unlawful or in violation of the rights of the Holders of the Series 2008 Bonds.

*   *   1.  Any such trustee, whether or not all such Series 2008 Bonds have been declared due and payable, shall be entitled as of right to the appointment of a receiver who may enter and take possession of any property of the University any of the revenues from which are pledged for the security of the Series 2008 Bonds and operate and maintain the same and collect and receive all fees, rents, charges and other revenues thereafter arising therefrom in the same manner as the University itself might do and shall deposit all such moneys in a separate account and apply the same in such manner as the court appointing such receiver shall direct. In any suit, action or proceeding by the trustee the fees, counsel fees and expenses of the trustee and of the receiver, if any, shall constitute taxable costs and disbursements and all costs and disbursements allowed by the court shall be a first charge on any fees, rents, charges and other revenues of the University pledged for the security of the Series 2008 Bonds.

Such trustee shall, in addition to the foregoing, have and possess all of the powers necessary or appropriate for the exercise of any functions specifically set forth herein or incident to the general representation of the Holders of the Series 2008 Bonds in the enforcement and protection of their rights.

*   *   1.  To the extent permitted by law, upon the happening and continuance of any Event of Default, then and in every such case any Bondholder may proceed, subject to the provisions of Section 7.5, to protect and enforce the rights of the Bondholders by a suit, action or special proceeding in equity or at law, either for the specific performance of any covenant or agreement contained herein or in aid or execution of any power herein granted or for the enforcement of any proper legal or equitable remedy as such Bondholder shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce such rights.
    
    1.  **Pro Rata Application of Funds**. Anything in this Resolution to the contrary notwithstanding, if at any time the moneys available in the Debt Service Fund shall not be sufficient to pay the interest on or the principal of the Series 2008 Bonds as the same shall become due and payable, such moneys, together with any moneys then available or thereafter becoming available for such purpose, whether through the exercise of the remedies provided for in this Article or otherwise, shall be applied as follows:
        1.  If the principal of all the Series 2008 Bonds shall not have become due and payable, all such moneys shall be applied:

first: to the payment to the persons thereto of all installments of interest then due and payable in the order in which such installments became due and payable and, if the amount available shall not be sufficient to pay in full any particular installment, then to the payment, ratably, according to the amounts due on such installment, to the persons entitled thereto, without any discrimination or preference except as to any difference in the respective rates of interest specified in the Series 2008 Bonds; and

second: to the payment to the persons entitled thereto of the unpaid principal of any of the Series 2008 Bonds which shall have become due and payable (other than Series 2008 Bonds called for redemption for the payment of which moneys are held pursuant to the provisions of this Resolution), in the order of their due dates, with interest on the principal amount of such Series 2008 Bonds at the respective rates specified therein from the respective dates upon which such Series 2008 Bonds became due and payable, and, if the amount available shall not be sufficient to pay in full the principal of the Series 2008 Bonds due and payable on any particular date, together with such interest, then to the payment first of such interest, ratably, according to the amount of such interest due on such date, and then to the payment of such principal, ratably, according to the amount of such principal due on such date, to the persons entitled thereto without any discrimination or preference.

*   *   1.  If the principal of all the Series 2008 Bonds shall have become due and payable, all such moneys shall be applied to the payment of the principal and interest then due and unpaid on the Series 2008 Bonds, without preference or priority of principal over interest or interest over principal, or of any installment of interest over any other installment of interest, or of any Bond over any other Bond, ratably, according to the amounts due, respectively, for principal and interest, to the persons entitled thereto, without any discrimination or preference.

Whenever moneys are to be applied by the trustee pursuant to the provisions of this Section, such moneys shall be applied by the trustee at such times, and from time to time, as the trustee in his or her sole discretion shall determine, having due regard to the amount of such moneys available for application and the likelihood of additional moneys becoming available for such application in the future; the deposit of such moneys with any Paying Agent, or otherwise setting aside such moneys, in trust for the proper purpose shall constitute proper application by the trustee; and the trustee shall incur no liability whatsoever to the Board, to any Bondholder or to any other person for any delay in applying any such moneys, so long as the trustee acts with reasonable diligence, having due regard to the circumstances, and ultimately applies the same in accordance with such provisions of this Resolution as may be applicable at the time of application by the trustee. Whenever the trustee shall exercise such discretion in applying such moneys, he or she shall fix the date (which shall be an Interest Payment Date unless the trustee shall deem another date more suitable) upon which such application is to be made and upon such date interest on the amounts of principal to be paid on such date shall cease to accrue. The trustee shall give such notice (or shall cause the Paying Agent to give such notice) as he or she may deem appropriate of the fixing of any such date and shall not be required to make payment to the Holder of any Bond until such Bond shall be surrendered to the trustee or any Paying Agent for appropriate endorsement, or for cancellation if fully paid.

Notwithstanding anything in this Resolution to the contrary, this Section 7.3 shall be interpreted so that term "Series 2008 Bonds" or "Bonds" shall include the Series 2008 Bonds and any Parity Credit Obligations. In each resolution authorizing the issuance of any Parity Credit Obligation, the University agrees to provide for the trustee thereunder to be the same as the trustee under this Resolution, and further agrees to include provisions substantially identical to those contained in this Section 7.3.

*   1.  **Effect of Discontinuance of Proceedings**. In case any proceeding taken by any Bondholder on account of any Event of Default shall have been discontinued or abandoned for any reason, then and in every such case the University and the Bondholders shall be restored to their former positions and rights hereunder, respectively, and all rights and remedies of the Bondholders shall continue as though no such proceeding had been taken.
    2.  **Proceedings for Equal Benefit of All Bondholders**. No Bondholder shall have any right in any manner whatever to affect, disturb or prejudice the security of this Resolution or to enforce any right hereunder, except in the manner herein provided, and all proceedings at law or in equity shall be instituted, had and maintained for the equal benefit of all Bondholders.
    3.  **No Remedy Exclusive**. No remedy herein conferred on the Bondholders is intended to be exclusive of any other remedy or remedies, and each and every remedy conferred shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to every other remedy given hereunder and under the Act or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute.
    4.  **No Delay or Omission Construed to Be a Waiver**. No delay or omission of any Bondholder to exercise any right or power accruing upon any Event of Default occurring and continuing as aforesaid shall impair any such right or power or shall be construed to be a waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence therein; and every power and remedy given by this Article to the Bondholders may be exercised from time to time and as often as may be deemed expedient.

1.    
      
    EXECUTION OF INSTRUMENTS BY BONDHOLDERS AND  
    PROOF OF OWNERSHIP OF THE SERIES 2008 BONDS
    1.  **Execution of Instruments; Proof of Ownership**. Any request, direction, consent or other instrument in writing required or permitted by this Resolution to be signed or executed by Bondholders may be in any number of concurrent instruments of similar tenor and may be signed or executed by such Bondholders or their attorneys or legal representatives. Proof of the execution of any such instrument and of the ownership of the Series 2008 Bonds shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Resolution and shall be conclusive in favor of the University and the Paying Agent with regard to any action taken by them under such instrument if made in the following manner:
        1.  The fact and date of the execution by any person of any such instrument may be proved by the verification of any officer in any jurisdiction who, by the laws thereof, has power to take affidavits within such jurisdiction, to the effect that such instrument was subscribed and sworn to before him or her, or by an affidavit of a witness to such execution. Where such execution is by an officer of a corporation or association or a member of a partnership on behalf of such corporation, association or partnership such verification or affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of his or her authority.
        2.  The fact of the holding of the Series 2008 Bonds hereunder by any Bondholder and the amount and the numbers of such Series 2008 Bonds and the date of its holding the same shall be proved by the registration books kept under the provisions of Section 2.7.

This Series 2008 Bond is also subject to redemption in whole or in part on any date, at the option of the University, from the proceeds of casualty insurance or condemnation awards, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed, without premium, plus accrued interest to the redemption date, if all or any part of the Project is damaged, destroyed or taken through the exercise of the power of eminent domain and the University has determined not to use such proceeds to replace or rebuild the damaged, destroyed or taken property.

Subject to applicable procedures of the Securities Depository while the Series 2008 Bonds are held in book-entry only form by the Securities Depository, if less than all of the Series 2008 Bonds are to be called for redemption, the Series 2008 Bonds to be redeemed shall be selected by the University in such manner as the University in its discretion may determine.

This Series 2008 Bond may also be exchanged at the office of the Registrar for a new Series 2008 Bond or Bonds of the same aggregate principal amount, maturity date and interest rate without transfer to a new registered owner. Exchanges and transfers will be without expense to the holder except for applicable taxes or other governmental charges, if any. The Registrar shall not be required to transfer or exchange any Series 2008 Bond selected or called for redemption pursuant to the provisions hereof or from a Record Date through the next succeeding Interest Payment Date. All Bonds delivered in exchange or transfer shall be dated so that neither gain nor loss results from the transfer or exchange.

The University, the Paying Agent and the Registrar may treat the registered owner as the absolute owner of this Series 2008 Bond for all purposes, notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.

Neither the members of the Board nor any person executing this Series 2008 Bond are liable personally hereon or subject to any personal liability or accountability by reason of the issuance hereof.

This Series 2008 Bond will not be valid until the Certificate of Authentication has been signed by the Registrar.
