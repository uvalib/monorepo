## STATEMENT BY THE RECTOR

"The news of Frank Hereford's plans to relinquish the duties of President is received with profound regret. I can think of no other person who could have accelerated the University to the high level of national prominence that we enjoy today.

Frank Hereford was the right man at the right time. He built on the firm foundation laid by Colgate W. Darden, Jr., and strengthened by Edgar F. Shannon, Jr., and with his own adherence to excellence fostered achievements that seemed out of reach a decade ago. We have a strong national faculty and students whom Mr. Hereford himself characterizes as "the best in the world." We have a greatly enhanced endowment, stronger ties with our State government, a vastly improved physical plant and a nationally recognized athletic program that has required no sacrifice of our high standards.

Mr. Hereford has excelled in every field of endeavor and his contributions to the leadership of this great University will be felt by those who follow us. Even before he became President, Mr. Hereford was at the center of the efforts to improve the overall educational enterprise as a teacher, a graduate dean, and as vice president and provost.

On a personal note, we owe a special debt to his gracious wife, Ann, who has done so much to bring together the University family of alumni, students, and faculty."

## RESOLUTION OF GRATITUDE TO PRESIDENT FRANK L. HEREFORD, JR.

The following resolution was adopted by unanimous vote of the Board:

RESOLVED that the Rector and Visitors accedes to President Hereford's request to be relieved of administrative duties no later than August 31, 1985, and that in granting his request this Board expresses its deep gratitude to Mr. Hereford and to his wife, Ann, for their untiring efforts on behalf of the University and extends its good wishes for their future happiness.

## RESPONSE BY PRESIDENT FRANK L. HEREFORD, JR.
