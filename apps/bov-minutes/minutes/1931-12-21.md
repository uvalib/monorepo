A special meeting of the Rector and Visitors was held on this date at the residence of the Rector, Mr. Frederic W. Scott, in Richmond. There were present the Rector, Mr. F. W. Scott, and Visitors Buchanan, McIntire, Hall, Rinehart, Walker, Williams, Shackelford, Munford and Carson, and Acting President Newcomb.

Upon the recommendation of the Acting President, Robert D. Meade was elected Acting Assistant Professor of History, for the session of 1932-33 at a salary of $2,500, as a substitute for Professor Thomas Cary Johnson during his leave of absence granted by the Board.

Upon the recommendation of the Acting President, the following motion increasing tuition fees in certain departments was adopted.

RESOLVED, by the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, That the tuition fees be increased as follows, beginning with the session of 1932-33.

The following motion with respect to renewing leases for renting of University property was adopted:

RESOLVED, by the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia,

That the Acting President be, and he is hereby authorized to negotiate renewal of leases for the rental of the following rooms in the Entrance Building, and that the Rector be authorized to execute same when in proper shape, on behalf of this Board.

That the lease to Anderson Brothers Book Store, Inc., successor to Geo. W. Olivier, expiring January 1, 1932, be renewed for a term of two years from said date at an annual rental of $1,200, with the privilege of renewing same for the further term of three years thence next ensuing at a rental of $1,500 per annum.

That a new lease be negotiated with Mrs. W. V. Nance for the rental of the Tea Room, for a term of four or five years from January 1, 1932, at an annual rental of $1,680.

The Rector discussed with the Board a proposition he had received from Harold F. Jobe, of Crook, Colorado, to whom was sold the half-section of land bequeathed to the University by Miss Este Coffinberry, stating that due to decline in prices of agricultural products, and for other affiliated reasons, he had been unable to meet the installments and interest payments on the said land and, unless the University was willing to make a reduction on the original purchase price, he would be forced to abandon the property. The matter was referred to the Rector with power to act.

The question of charges now ruling at the University for rooms and table board for the students was discussed, and, on motion, the following offered by Mr. Williams, was adopted.

RESOLVED, That the Rector appoint a committee from this Board with the Acting President to investigate and report to this Board the charges for board and lodging to the students at the University, both in the University and in private boarding houses, in relation to such charges at other institutions, with recommendations.

The Rector appointed Messrs. Williams, Shackelford and McIntire to serve on said committee.

The report of the Commission on a Liberal Arts College for Women, the consideration of which was the special order of business for this meeting, was brought up.

The report of the Commission was read at length, and a general discussion had thereon. Senator Buchanan offered the following, being duly seconded, which was adopted by a vote of eight to two (Mrs. Munford and Judge Carson voting in the negative), after a substitute motion by Judge Carson, seconded by Mrs. Munford, had been defeated by a vote of eight to two;

(At the request of Judge Carson, permission was given to have his motion entered at length on the minutes, and it will be found spread following the resolution adopted.)

A copy of the report of the Commission on a Liberal Arts College for Women, appointed under Acts of the General Assembly of Virginia approved respectively on February 28, 1928, and March 6, 1930, having been submitted to the Rector and Board of Visitors recommending that the State Teachers College at Fredericksburg be converted into a Liberal Arts College for Women under the control of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia in accordance with the plan of conversion and of government set out in said report, subject to the provision by the General Assembly of Virginia of the capital outlay and current support fixed as a minimum required for the biennium of 1932-34;

BE IT RESOLVED that the Rector and Board of Visitors, after due consideration of said report, endorses and approves the provisions thereof and expresses its readiness to comply with its terms and recommendations so far as imposed on this Board, provided, however, and subject to the express condition that the General Assembly of Virginia at its next session shall provide by appropriation at least the minimum amount of money fixed by the Commission for the necessary additional capital outlay and current support of the Institution for the next biennium;

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that in the event that the General Assembly shall not deem it proper to make the provision of money aforesaid, it is the hope of the Board of Visitors that the Commission may be continued, with the powers conferred by, and under the terms and conditions of, the Acts aforesaid, so far as applicable, in order that the Commission may, on behalf of the State, inform itself of all developments as to this subject, which is of vital interest to the State and peculiar interest to the University, and make its further report to the General Assembly in 1934.

The following motion by Judge Carson and Mrs. Munford, referred to in the introduction to this matter, which was defeated:

Statement of Judge Carson and Mrs. Munford, members of the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia, made with the consent of the Board for the record, and in explanation of their dissenting vote on the resolution adopted by the Board with reference to the Legislative Commission's report on the proposals for the establishment by the State of a College of Liberal Arts for Women.

We regret that we cannot join in the recommendations of the majority of the Board.

We agree with the recommendations of the Chairman of the Legislative Commission that no action should be taken, at this time, which might tend to commit the State to a definite or final policy as to the foundation of a College of Liberal Arts for Women, for the reasons set out in his statement, filed with the report of the Commission.

Giving due weight and consideration to the report of the Legislative Commission, and with due deference to the high standing, reputation and ability of its membership, we might well hesitate before recording ourselves as dissenting from the conclusions set out in its report.- had the Commission been at liberty to examine the real question at issue, that is to say, whether the College for Women should or should not be established at or near the University.

For like reason of deference to the action taken by the General Assembly at its last session, we might well hesitate to hold open, for further discussion, the wisdom or the propriety of the establishment of a college within a radius of thirty miles from the University:- Had the action of the Legislature in this regard been based wholly upon a legislative inquiry as to whether the college should or should not be established within thirty miles of the University, unaffected by the sectional clamor of more than a dozen towns and cities throughout the State, the vote of whose representatives in the Legislature might well have been far different had the issue been simply, whether the college should be established in Fredericksburg or at, or near, the University.

But we do not believe that the real question has been fully and fairly submitted to either the people or the Legislature of the State. and we do not think that it comports with the dignity of the University, or with the standing of the alumni and the men and women of the State who are aligned on both sides of this highly controversial subject, or with the vital importance of the issues involved, to permit the final decision to turn on the outcome of skillful maneuvers for strategic position before the Legislature, or upon any other basis than a full, free and fair adjudication by the General Assembly of the real question involved, unhampered and unaffected by sectional issues or by the strains and stresses of the prevailing economic depression.

Nothing has come to our attention which seems to justify or require a change of the views expressed in the statement filed by us with the Board when this question was up for consideration on a former occasion, and we, therefore, set that statement forth again at length, because it sufficiently discloses the ground upon which we again dissent from the opinion of the majority of the Board.

"Statement of A. C. Carson, Member of the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia, made with the consent of the Board for the record and in explanation of his dissenting vote on the resolution adopted by the Board with reference to the proposals for the establishment by the State of a College of Liberal Arts for Women.

"Since I do not concur with the majority of my fellow members on the Board in the adoption of the pending resolution, dealing with proposals looking to the establishment of a College of Liberal Arts for Women, it appears to be incumbent upon me to set out, as briefly as may be, my own views on the matter of such vital import to the welfare of both the University and the State.

"I am convinced that a College of Liberal Arts for Women should be established by the State as an integral part of the State University under the direction and control of the Rector and Visitors, and the President and Faculty of the University, to a like extent and under like conditions to the direction and control now exercised by these officers of the University over the Undergraduate College for Men.

"But whatever may be the merits of the arguments for or against the introduction of the co-eduational system elsewhere, I am also convinced that there are strong and compelling reasons peculiar to the University of Virginia, based upon her traditions and history, and upon the intense and well-nigh universal opposition of the great body of her alumni, to the introduction of the system at their alma mater, at least between young men and young women of undergraduate rank, which demand the establishment of the proposed College of Liberal Arts for Women as a co-ordinate institution, separate and apart from the College for Men.

"The College of Liberal Arts for Women in Virginia should therefore, have a separate physical equipment, a separate Dean and, in part, at least a separate Faculty (all of whom, however, should be members of the Faculty of the University), by whom it should be managed and disciplined as a separate entity. And to insure a proper degree of independence, both for the College for Women and the University, it should not be located on or in immediate vicinity of the present University grounds, though it should not be so far distant as to deprive the College for Women of the cultural advantages of an intimate and close association with the University, or to prevent the convenient interchange of faculties, and the use, under suitable regulations, of the library, the hoepital, and other resources and equipment in the University.

"The requirements as to entrance, class work, courses of study, examinations, and academic degrees should be maintained on a par with those established in the College for Men, and the scholastic and intellectual standard set in the College for Women should be such that its graduates will be entitled to recognition on equal terms with the graduates from the College for Men in the Postgraduate and professional courses at the University.

"The arguments which have been advanced in favor of the establishment of the proposed College of Liberal Arts for Women at one of the State Normal Schools, or at one of the Woman's Colleges now operating in the State, do not appeal to me. They seem to rest largely, if not altogether, upon grounds of supposed economics in the original outlay for grounds, buildings, and economics in the original outlay for grounds, buildings, and physical equipment.

"But if it is proposed to give the young women of the State anything like equal opportunities to those the State now furnishes to the young men in the undergraduate department of the University of Virginia, the saving in first cost by the establishment of a Women's College at any of these institutions would be far more than counterbalanced, in the long run, by the increased appropriations necessary to build up and maintain the college as a separate institution, deprived of the many and manifest advantages and benefits and continuing economies in operation, which would be secured by its original establishment and maintenance as a co-ordinate college of the University.

"If the State is unwilling, at this time, to appropriate the amount necessary to erect the buildings and to furnish suitable physical equipment for a co-ordinate college such as that outlined above, I should be inclined to urge postponement of the whole undertaking until such time as the increasing resources of the State will be sufficient to justify the expenditure.

"I understand there are two or more Women's Colleges now in the State doing excellent work in the field of higher education within the limits of their restricted endowments and resources. The competition of a cheap State-supported college for women, conducted on grounds and buildings not originally designed for the purpose, under the direction of a cheap or underpaid administrative staff and faculty, could hardly fail to prove detrimental to the welfare of these institutions. And, until and unless the State is prepared to establish a State College of Liberal Arts for Women, worthy of the name, the field may well be left clear for the institutions now operating without State aid.

"I do not believe that the aspirations of the women of Virginia will ever be satisfied with anything less than a State-supported College for Women of the first rank, comparable in standing and dignity with the State-supported Undergraduate College for Men at the University. Soon or late, any makeshift or compromise substitute will be cast aside and such makeshift or compromise experiment with a separate State College for Women prove a failure. There are sound reasons for anticipating the possibility and the probability that the University will then be confronted with an irresistible demand for undergraduate co-education within its own walls.

"Insofar, therefore, as the opposition to the establishment of a coordinate college as an integral part of the University of Virginia at or near the University, is based on fears that it may prove to be the opening wedge for the introduction of the undergraduate co-educational system at the University, it seems to me that in thus taking counsel of their fears, the proponents of what I have ventured to call makeshift or compromise measures are courting the very danger they dread.

"Oxford, England (and the Women's Colleges within ten minutes walk of the University), Harvard (Radcliffe); Columbia (Barnard) and other great Universities have blazed the way and have shown us how, mutatis mutadis, the State and the University of Virginia, can together respond to the just demands of the women of the State for equal opportunities under the educational system maintained by the State."

The meeting then adjourned.
