The President reported that gifts to the Rector and Visitors and gifts through University-Related Foundations came to $3,077,800 for the period September 1, 1985 to October 31, 1985 and $2,490,100 for the period November 1, 1985 and December 31, 1985.

STATUS REPORT ON THE POST CAPITAL CAMPAIGN DEVELOPMENT PLAN
-----------------------------------------------------------

The President reported that a Post-Capital Campaign Plan is being developed, and that it is now in draft form. Vice President Marion Peavey said that last year brought a large number of modest gifts, and a small number of substantial gifts including a $1.1 million gift for financing the new Student Health Building.

He said that the 1985-86 "cash flow" is $1.5 million greater than it was last year. He said that while private gifts are continuing we must develop priorities for a five year plan, with goals of $250 to $280 million. He said that details of this planning will be available in March.

He cautioned that though fund raising looks good, the University needs $1.3 million to complete the Gilmer Hall addition which is now under construction.

AUTHORIZATION FOR ALUMNI PATENTS FOUNDATION TO CREATE REAL ESTATE FOUNDATION AND FOR CAPITAL ADVANCE TO THE NEW FOUNDATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Following the Urban Land Institute's visit to Charlottesville, the President received the Institute's report which summarized its findings and recommendations. The report recommended that a real estate foundation be established which would be responsible for managing certain real estate assets and meeting the overall mission and educational goals of the University as they may be reflected in the acquisition and development of real estate. The Alumni Patents Foundation, with the encouragement and direction of the University administration, developed proposed articles of incorporation and by-laws for the University of Virginia Real Estate Foundation, which will be organized and operated exclusively for exempt purposes under Section 501 (c) (3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 and which will at all times be operated solely in connection with, and exclusively for the benefit of the University.

REPORT ON LEGISLATIVE MATTERS
-----------------------------

The President advised that former Governor Charles Robb's budget called for appropriations to the University's three divisions totaling $275 million in general funds for the 1986-88 biennium. He noted that Governor Gerald Baliles amended the budget proposal to allocate $302,000 for building repairs in the University historic district.

He pointed out that the University submitted budget amendments to the General Assembly including $4 million toward the cost of a heater/chiller plant, a request for funding to support several research institutes graduate medical education programs and indigent care services. $325,000 in budget amendments would fund televising five University courses for Clinch Valley College students.

Floors shall be buffed with a floor polishing machine when completely dry. All floors shall be left free from streaks, stains, and film. There shall be no splashes on walls, baseboards, furniture, surfaces, and furnishings. There shall be no mop strings left on the floor and surfaces shall be left dry.

5.7.3 Scrubbing and Wet Mopping: The least amount of water, soap solution, or water cleaner solution required to remove dirt and rinse floors shall be used. Flooding of floors shall be avoided at all times. Rinse water shall be changed frequently. Floors shall be mopped, rinsed, and dried in small areas at a time to reduce possible water damage. Extreme care shall be exercised to prevent the splashing of baseboards, furniture, books or other equipment with mop water, and to prevent water from seeping under furniture, baseboards, or equipment. Hard to reach places, such as corners which are inaccessible with the mop shall be carefully cleaned and dried by hand or other approved method. All mopped floors shall present a clean appearance free from streaks, smears, or dirt residue. All scuff marks and stains shall be removed. When floors cannot be satisfactorily cleaned otherwise, they shall be scrubbed by hand or machine. There shall be no mop strings left on the floor and surfaces shall be left dry. In cleaning unwaxed floors, use clean water in mopping areas where traffic and dirt accumulation is light. In areas where accumulation is heavier, use a detergent solution.

5.7.4 Stripping: The contractor will be required to perform one entire floor finish stripping and refinishing operation of areas specified in the schedules, within 90 days after the award of the Contract. This work shall be reflected in the work schedule specified to be submitted by the contractor prior to commencement of contract. All books and papers on low shelves will be covered with "drop" cloths to prevent damage.

5.7.5 Refinishing: The surface for refinishing shall be cleaned, stripped, and free of scuff marks or dirt smears. A minimum of two coats of floor finish conforming to Johnson's Complete or equivalent shall be applied, allowed to dry, and buffed with a electric disk polishing machine, using floor pads of a type suitable for the surface and as approved by the Building Services Superintendent. In applying floor finish the contractor shall ensure floor finish is not splashed on walls, baseboards, furniture, or other surfaces. If such material is splashed upon these surfaces, the contractor shall immediately remove same. In the event splashed floor finish or stripping or mopping solution leaves a permanent stain, the contractor shall be responsible for returning the area in question to a condition equal to that which existed prior to the operation. If necessary, this shall include repainting a section of wall to the satisfaction of the Building Services Superintendent. Any build-up of floor finish on floors next to walls or furnishings or on cove molding shall be removed by the contractor. Any damaged caused by contractor's work force shall be paid for by the contractor.

5.7.7 Carpet and Rug Cleaning: All carpeted areas shall be cleaned (shampooed) within 90 days after award of the contract. Cleaned carpet shall be free of streaks, stains and spots and shall have a bright uniform color. Carpets shall be brushed against pile-lay with a stiff deck brush or other approved method to loosen soil nd open pile tufts in preparation for shampooing, followed by thorough vacuuming to remove soil prior to shampooing. Spots of ink, oil and other stains shall be removed without wetting the rug backing. Corners, stairs and areas under fixed equipment may be shampooed with hand brush. Cotton pile rugs, because of their tendency to flatten shall be deck brushed to erect the matted pile after initial shampooing and re-shampooed to effectively clean all sides of pile tufts. After the entire carpet is cleaned and vacuumed, erect the pile tufts by brushing against the pile-lay, with a suitable brush. Shampooing may be performed by either the dry or wet (including steam) methods as designated in the contractor's service plan (Section 5 para. 5.3.1).

5.7.7.1 Dry Method: Shampooing by this method is accomplished by use of powder-type cleaners (solvent saturated or detergent saturated sawdust). Sprinkle the dry powder liberally over the area to be cleaned and brush it into the rug or carpet, then vacuum thoroughly.

5.7.7.2 Wet Method: Shampooing by this method is best suited for carpets and rugs of man-made fibers. Avoid the use of soap, ammonia, washing soda or strong household cleaners. Aluminum disks or stiff heavy paperboard shall be placed under all legs of furniture and other equipment until the rug is dry to avoid staining from rust or dye. Wet shampooing shall be scheduled so that rugs are thoroughly dry prior to regularly scheduled working hours.

5.8 STAIRWAYS AND ELEVATORS:

5.8.1 Stairways: Hand railings, ledges, grills, fire apparatus, doors and radiators shall be dusted. Steps and landings shall be swept or vacuumed and damp mopped twice weekly. Flights include the landings and stairs or steps between landings.

Resilient floors shall be cleaned and spray buffed. Carpeted floors shall be cleaned and shampooed as specified in Para. 5.7.6., 5.7.7, 5.7.7.1, 5.7.7.2 as appropriate. Door tracks shall be cleaned and polished.

5.9 WASTE COLLECTION AND REMOVAL: Trash shall be placed in trash receptacles (dumpsters) as directed, as soon as possible after collection. Bags of trash shall not be left in passageways, or inside or outside of the buildings to create a nuisance or an eyesore. Trash shall not be allowed to blow around the grounds. Any trash dropped shall be immediately retrieved by the contractor and properly placed in the trash receptacle. Any liquids spilled in the process of trash removal shall be cleaned up immediately. Trash receptacles shall be kept closed and the areas around them shall be kept neat and clean by the contractor. The University shall provide receptacles (dumpsters) at each building site.

5.9.1 Waste Baskets: All waste baskets shall be emptied and boxes, cans, paper, etc., placed near the trash can for disposal shall be removed in a manner that will not cause dispersion of dust.

5.11 Inspections: Each phase of the services specified is subject to inspection during the contractor's operations and/or after completion of that phase. Should any defective or unaccomplished work be brought to the attention of the contractor by the Building Services Superintendent or an inspector, the contractor shall meet with the Building Services Superintendent, or his representatives, Mr. Ronald Porter or Mr. Lawrence Keys, to discuss the work in question within three (3) hours after notification of faulty performance. Work determined unsatisfactory by the Building Services Superintendent or his representative after the discussion, or the contactor's failure to discuss the work in question, will constitute a breach of contract by the contractor, and shall entitle the University to any one of the remedies mentioned in Section 3.12.

The principal office of the University of Virginia Real Estate Foundation (the "Foundation") shall be at the University of Virginia (the "University"), Charlottesville, Virginia, or at such other place as the Board of Directors may designate.

The Registered Office of the Foundation in Virginia (as required by law) shall be at such place as the Board of Directors shall from time to time by resolution determine, and may, but need not, be at the principal office of the Foundation.

The Foundation may, in addition to its principal office, have offices at such other places within the Commonwealth of Virginia as the Board of Directors may from time to time appoint or as the business of the Foundation may require.

The business and affairs of the Foundation shall be managed by the Board of Directors (herein sometimes the "Board"). Corporate powers shall be exercised by the Board, except as otherwise provided by these Bylaws, by the Articles of Incorporation, or by law.

As provided in the Articles of Incorporation (herein the "Articles"), there shall be the following classification and number of directors:

Whenever a vacancy occurs on the Board of Directors as a result of the death, resignation, removal, refusal, ineligibility, or inability to serve, the vacancy shall be filled as set forth above in Section 2.2 at or before the next regular meeting of the Board of Directors as provided in Section 2.7.

During the time that any vacancy remains unfilled, the remaining members of the Board of Directors shall be deemed to constitute the full board and shall be empowered to act as such.

At each meeting of the Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Foundation, or, in the Chairman's absence, the President if he is a director of the Foundation, or, in the President's absence, a Vice President if he is a director of the Corporation or a director chosen by a majority of the directors present, shall preside as chairman of the meeting. The Secretary of the Foundation, or an Assistant Secretary, or, in the discretion of the meeting chairman, any person appointed by him, shall act as secretary of the meeting.

The Board of Directors may hold its meetings at such place or places as the Board of Directors may from time to time by resolution determine or (unless contrary to resolution of the Board of Directors) at such place as shall be specified in the respective notices or waivers of notice thereof.

Regular meetings of the Board for the purpose of electing officers and directors and transacting other business may be held at such times as may be fixed from time to time by action of the Board, provided that unless otherwise changed by action of the Board of Directors, regular meetings of the Board shall be held on the day immediately preceding regular meetings of the Board of Visitors of the University.

Special meetings of the Board of Directors shall be held whenever called by the Chairman or President or by any two or more directors, or, at the direction of any of the foregoing, by the Secretary.

Unless required by resolution of the Board of Directors, notice of any regular meeting of the Board need not be given. Notice of each special meeting shall be mailed to each director, addressed to him at his residence or usual place of business, at least five (5) days before the date on which the meeting is to be held; or such notice shall be sent to each director at such place by telegraph, cable, telecopier, mailgram, or wireless, or be delivered to him personally or read to the director by telephone no later than twenty-four (24) hours before the time at which the meeting is to be held. Every such notice shall state the time and place of the meeting, but need not state the purposes of the meeting. No notice of the reconvening of any adjourned or recessed meeting need be given except as contained in the resolution or ruling directing the adjournment or recess.

Anything in these Bylaws or in any resolution adopted by the Board of Directors to the contrary notwithstanding, proper notice of any meeting of the Board of Directors shall be deemed to have been given to any director if such notice shall be waived by him in writing (including telegraph, cable, telecopier, mailgram or wireless) before or after the meeting. A director who attends a meeting shall be deemed to have had timely and proper notice thereof, unless he attends for the express purpose of objecting to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.

A majority of the number of directors who are serving shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business.

The act of a majority of the directors present at any meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the Board of Directors. In the absence of a quorum, a majority of the directors present may adjourn the meeting from time to time until a quorum is had. The directors shall act only as a Board and the individual directors shall have no power as such.

Any public director of the Foundation may resign at any time, orally or in writing, by notifying the Chairman, President or Secretary of the Foundation. Such resignation shall take effect at the time therein specified; and, unless otherwise specified, the acceptance of such resignation shall not be necessary to make it effective.

Directors shall not be entitled to receive compensation for their duties as directors, but shall be entitled to reimbursement for reasonable expenses incurred in connection with the performance of such duties.

Any action required to be taken at a meeting of the Board or which may be taken at a meeting of the Board or of a committee established in accordance with these Bylaws, may be taken without a meeting if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed before or after such action by all of the directors or all of the members of the committee, as the case may be. Such consent shall have the same force and effect as a unanimous vote.

Meetings of the Board or any committee by conference telephone or similar communications equipment shall be permitted and participation by such means shall constitute presence in person at any such meeting.

The Executive Committee or Board may establish such other committees as deemed appropriate and shall prescribe the authority of any such committee and the period of its existence.

The officers of the Foundation shall be a Chairman, a President, a Secretary, a Treasurer, an Executive Director and where elected, one or more Vice Presidents, Assistant Secretaries and Assistant Treasurers, and other officers as may be established in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.3 of this Article. Except for the offices of Chairman, President and Secretary, any two or more offices may be held by the same person.

The officers, other than the Chairman, shall be elected annually by the Board of Directors. Each officer shall hold office until his successor shall have been duly chosen and qualify, or until his death, resignation or removal in the manner hereinafter provided.

The Board of Directors from time to time may establish officers in addition to those designated in Section 4.1, including one or more operating officers, with such duties as are provided in these Bylaws, or as the Board may determine from time to time.

Any officer other than the Chairman may be removed, either with or without cause, by resolution adopted at any regular or special meeting of the Board of Directors by a majority of the directors then in office.

Any officer may resign at any time by giving oral or written notice to the Board of Directors or the Chairman, President or Secretary of the Foundation. Any such resignation shall take effect at the time of receipt of such notice or at any later time therein specified; and, unless otherwise specified, the acceptance of such resignation shall not be necessary to make it effective.

A vacancy in any office caused by death, resignation, removal, disqualification or any other reason shall be filled for the unexpired portion of the term by vote of the Board.

The Chairman shall be the Rector of the University Board of Visitors and shall have general supervision over the policies of the Foundation, subject to the approval and control of the Board of Directors.
