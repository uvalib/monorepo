**Remarks by the President**

**President Sullivan said that during the course of each Board meeting, a range of topics are discussed. She gave examples such as the Brain Institute, long-term bond financing, a strategic approach to enrollment, and the Quality Enhancement Plan, or QEP, that is part of the SACS accreditation process. She set the stage for a later discussion of the Strategic Investment Fund, pointing out that these investments will help UVA achieve its dual commitment to excellence and affordability.**

**She said on the surface, these various initiatives may seem to be the disparate undertakings of a complex, decentralized organization, but there’s a recurring theme in all of these projects, and the theme is perpetual innovation: innovation in research; in financial planning; in student enrollment; in risk management; and in all the ways that UVA’s future is financed.**

**The spirit of innovation is the unifying element; that spirit infuses the Cornerstone Plan as well. She shared a few examples of innovative programs and initiatives that have taken shape since the last Board meeting including the following:**

1.  **The Career Center has developed new pre-health and pre-law advising services to meet the needs of students interested in those fields. A new Minor in Health and Well-Being, through the partnership of six schools, has been introduced. The enhanced approach to advising is meeting the needs of students in new and better ways: 94% of students who engaged with the enhanced Career Center report that they were inspired to take next steps in career development as a result.**
2.  **The Meriwether Lewis Fellows program is fully implemented, with three cohorts enrolled. Curricular changes to the program were made based on student feedback. Fellows now enroll in a design thinking course as the first part of the program to better equip them to develop their leadership skills.**
3.  **Following the launch of the Brain Institute, the selection process to identify the next pan-University institute is underway.**
4.  **The successful recruitment of the next director of the Data Science Institute has been completed, who will succeed Don Brown.**

1.  **A new dual-career support infrastructure has been developed to support the faculty hiring process, and infrastructure was strengthened to support cluster hires and TOPS searches.**
2.  **On the global stage, UVA has entered into a five-year Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the New Delhi Water Authority to rehabilitate the Yamuna River — one of the most polluted rivers in the world. This river improvement project, called “Re-Centering Delhi,” originated in UVA’s School of Architecture, and has expanded to include students and faculty working in public health, business, history, environmental sciences, and politics. President Sullivan and several deans will travel to India in March to see this project and to visit with alumni and parents.**
3.  **This past week, UVA announced the creation of a new, innovative approach to study abroad. The College and Graduate School of Arts & Sciences will pilot a program in which 20 entering first-year UVA students will spend their first semester in London. Students will participate in traditional classroom instruction and engage in events and activities that expose them to London’s multi-cultural heritage.**

**Ms. Sullivan said a highly innovative university like UVA tends to produce highly successful students, and two of the fourth-year students were recently named Rhodes Scholars: Aryn Frazier, a Politics and African-American Studies major, and Lauren Jackson, a Social and Political Thought major. Aryn and Lauren are UVA’s 52nd and 53rd Rhodes Scholars.**

**Three students were named Marshall Scholars: William Henagan, who earned his undergraduate degree at UVA and is now enrolled as a graduate student in the McIntire School; Abe Axler, a fourth-year Politics major; and Sarah Koch, a fourth-year Middle Eastern Language and Literature major.**

**She said in today’s higher education environment, change is the only constant, and innovation is the engine that drives change. The bicentennial will be a period of reflection and celebration, but primarily it should serve as a stimulus for even greater innovation at UVA, as we envision what UVA will become in its third century — and create that future.**

**Ms. Sullivan mentioned a bequest from the estate of Randolph Preston Pillow of almost $13 million, to many areas of the University; and a bequest from the estate of Robert E. Tanner totaling more than $5 million. Both bequests have been fully realized. She asked for approval of the Gifts and Grants Report, which on motion made and seconded, was approved unanimously.**

**Comments by the Student Representative to the Board**

**Phoebe Willis said it was an honor and privilege to not only work with members of the Board and the administration and faculty, but also the impressive students who are the heart and soul of the University. She then provided a report on activities since the September meeting, beginning with the work of the Presidential Senate (PS). The PS is a group comprised of 125 student leaders who meet once a month to discuss and vote on student issues.**

**In October, there were two initiatives before the PS: A proposal sponsored by the Queer Student Union to facilitate gender-neutral housing options in upperclass dorms, which received the presidential seal as a student issue. Conversely, DivestUVA was unsuccessful in its proposal and did not receive the presidential seal in large part because of a graduate student’s perspective that divesting from fossil fuels may hurt his funding in renewable energy research at the University which is sponsored in large part by Chevron. (The presidential seal is given when a majority of the members vote in favor of a proposal.)**

**In November, the University Judiciary Committee received the presidential seal for its proposal to step outside of the adjudication role of upholding the university’s 12 standards of conduct and beginning a proactive collaboration with stakeholders both inside and outside of the university, including local law enforcement.**

**Ms. Willis reviewed the communication channels she is using including the student member monthly newsletter and two main sources of student feedback and information, Student Council and the Cavalier Daily newspaper. She will be attending the first Student Council meeting of every month starting next semester to answer questions and collect student feedback. Additionally, she is working to partner with the Cavalier Daily on either a monthly Q&A column or an update on the Board for their publication.**

**In addition, the website Ms. Willis created in the summer has evolved into a student member Facebook page. On this page she posts news, updates, events & the monthly student newsletter. One post was a student enrollment survey to gather student feedback on the possible enrollment increases at UVA. Overall, 505 students responded, of which 77% said UVA should not increase undergraduate enrollment. She asked students to identify what they thought the benefits/issues were with increasing enrollment, and the most common response in favor was increased money for the University. She said this response may be based on misinformation in the community that increasing in-state enrollment would be a revenue generator for the University.**

**Ms. Willis said there was space on the survey for students to leave comments; her favorite is the following:**

**“If it is done in a way that does not allow for the university to adjust, the value of the education can sharply decline. We don't want to be a UNC, forced to do unrealistic things by our legislature that will cause us to drop in rankings and devalue past, current, and future degrees.”**

**She said the state governmental relations officials and other UVA administrators will be meeting with various representatives in Richmond in the coming weeks and months, and she would be happy to have more in-depth conversation with them about the results of the survey. The student voice takes the enrollment question outside of the facts and figures and puts a personal experience on the impact of increasing enrollment.**

**Comments by the Faculty Senate Chair**

**Ms. Riley gave remarks, which are reproduced here _verbatim:_**

**This afternoon I would like to talk about the social climate at the University.**

**I have been at UVA for more than 20 years and there is more tension on Grounds now than at any time that I can remember. Of course, this is not only here at UVA, but is being experienced at universities throughout the country. Recently, many of us have described this as relating to the “Run up and aftermath of the election.” I am coming to believe that description misplaces cause and effect. There were already climate issues at many universities before the election heated up. That may have been a harbinger of what has come since then. All of these issues, including the discourse of the election, reflect deep fissures in our society. I therefore don’t believe that this is going to go away soon and we are going to have to work our way through it.**

**As much as there is increased tension, there is also a welcome increase in community engagement here at UVA. Students, faculty, administrators, staff—and some of you here on the BOV--have all come together in sustained dialog. I am proud to say, that at least so far, new challenges have been bringing us together, not pulling us apart. We have had teach-ins. As he described this morning, the Provost sponsored a charrette on community values. Last Friday, the students held a five-hour town hall focused on diversity and inclusion. On Wednesday, the faculty senate held a town hall on free speech and helping faculty engage in difficult conversations.**

**Most important, the hallmark of all of these events has been respect.**

**I believe that the role of higher education has never been more important. We need places where we can have authentic and profound discussion among people who may disagree. And this institution, which was founded on notions of public education, free speech, and producing educated citizen leaders, has a special role to play in that debate. We need to lead the national discourse on what public education means for this generation. We need to think about who gets to be a citizen leader in this country and it should include all religions, ethnicities and genders-- to aspire to that role.**

**Faculty have a crucial role in this and it is one that is at times fraught. It is our role to foster free speech, but at the same time recognize, as Geoff Stone, a noted first amendment scholar, has recently reminded us: the benefits of free speech are shared by all of us, but the burdens are more often disproportionately borne by minorities and marginalized populations. It is our job as faculty to be provocative, but we also need to create a safe place to learn. At the same time, we need to teach our students that safe does not necessarily mean comfortable. At times we need to be advocates, but we also need to allow people who disagree with us to be heard and to teach our students to do the same. And we also need to recognize that our role extends beyond our research and the classroom. The inspiration for the American experiment in residential higher education is the idea that as much learning takes place out of the classroom as in it.**

**Last June, I suggested that UVA’s success in this era of turmoil will be dependent on trust, communication and some luck. I still think that — just more so.**

**I am now cautiously optimistic. My optimism is based on the lines of communication that we have built. It is hard to demonize people that you know. Dinners like the one we had last night that bring the Board, faculty and administrators together and provide opportunities to get to know one another are important. Phoebe Willis’ work with the newsletters — which not only give information but provide students a view of Board members as people — is also crucial. (I am text buddies with 20 undergraduates who I met through the town halls.) I have confidence that we can all work together to bring many more such opportunities to UVA.**

**In answer to a question, Ms. Riley said listening is undervalued. With students, you can get remarkable mileage just by showing that you care. Ms. Riley said she would love to help sponsor a town hall. Mr. Goodwin asked her to come up with a couple of things for the spring semester.**

**Strategic Investment Fund (SIF)**

**Mr. Goodwin asked Mr. Conner to lead the discussion. Mr. Conner started with an overview of the access and affordability proposal offered for consideration. He reviewed the discussion of November 11 about nine alternative proposals. No action was taken on these alternatives partly because of discussion with members of the General Assembly about tuition, and so the decision was to wait and see what happens with the budget in January and February. The ninth proposal was to build permanent funding for AccessUVA as well as to create a merit scholarship program. The resolution authorizes SIF money of up to $100 million over a five-year period to match up to $200 million of donations.**

**Dr. Britt expressed his opinion that access and affordability are not strategic initiatives; the fund was intended to be used to improve research and other initiatives to take the University to the next level. Mr. Goodwin said this an outgrowth of discussion and the process; there is a great deal of general feeling within the community that an endowment for scholarships is important.**

**There was an extended discussion about student debt, tuition levels, and concerns expressed by members of the General Assembly. Mr. Clement said he supported the proposal to reduce student debt for in-state middle income students from $18,000 to $14,000. It would show policy makers that the Board is in touch with the views of people in the state. Mr. Griffin said the University needs an endowment for need-based scholarships, and this will be a legacy the Board will be proud of. Mr. Goodwin reviewed the General Assembly requests, which he said did not include a loan cap. Mr. Murray pointed out the legislative requests were made prior to notification that the University was going to be taking a $7 million budget cut. He said the issues need to be addressed in the context of an entire budget, so this should be considered in March. Mr. Genovese said debt is low now, and tuition is low. Mr. Macfarlane said more data is needed; to pull one proposal off the list to throw it to Richmond is a mistake.**

**Following further discussion, Mr. Griffin and Mr. Walker proposed as an amendment a one-to-one match for gifts of cash of $1 million or more, for the purpose of raising the money faster, which was made as a motion and duly seconded. L.D. Britt said the Board is setting a bad precedent; we’re on a slippery slope. The SIF should be to keep the academic edge. Mr. Genovese agreed. Mr. Hogan said the proposal is to attract philanthropy that will free up other resources. After further discussion, the amendment was approved with L.D. Britt and Frank Genovese voting no. The Board then voted on the following original resolution with the amendment, and this was approved with all members present voting in the affirmative except Mr. Genovese and Mr. Britt who voted in the negative. Mr. Fay was absent.**

**ESTABLISHMENT OF THE BICENTENNIAL SCHOLARS FUND**

**WHEREAS, the Board of Visitors established the Strategic Investment Fund (SIF) to fund programs within the University that have the potential to transform research, research infrastructure, the academic experience, and access and affordability for Virginians; and**

**WHEREAS, with respect to access and affordability, the Board of Visitors has been assessing the various scholarship programs available at the University and in particular AccessUVA as well as various proposals to improve access and affordability for Virginians as developed and presented in detail at the Board’s special meeting in November 2016; and**

**WHEREAS, although all of such proposals remain under active consideration, the Board has reached a consensus that a permanent endowment, to assist in funding AccessUVA and to provide greater merit scholarship opportunities, should be established to reduce the reliance on tuition revenue, thereby reducing future tuition increases and providing families in need of financial assistance who do not qualify for or seek financial aid greater opportunity to attend the University;**

**RESOLVED, the Board of Visitors establishes a permanent endowment for** scholarships for University (including UVA’s College at Wise) students, initially in the amount of $300 million, **funded by** (i) **up to $100 million from the investment earnings of the SIF over a five-year period,** and (ii) $200 million of **philanthropic gifts, which endowment shall be named the Bicentennial Scholars Fund and shall follow the criteria suggested as part of the SIF request; and**

**RESOLVED FURTHER, to be qualifying gifts receiving a match from the SIF, such philanthropic gifts must provide two dollars of funding for each dollar funded by the SIF, except that any single cash gift of $1 million or more shall be matched one dollar funded by the SIF for each dollar provided by the donor; and**

RESOLVED FURTHER, matching funds from the SIF will be paid into the endowment as philanthropic funds are received; and

**RESOLVED FURTHER, the Board of Visitors reserves the right to amend the terms of this endowment as appropriate in light of fund raising and grant experience; and**

**RESOLVED FURTHER, the other proposals developed for improving access and affordability remain under consideration by the Board of Visitors.**

**\- - - - - - - - -**

**The Board moved on to the second resolution for SIF funding to fund five projects. Dr. Shannon pointed out that any royalties the School of Medicine receives for the artificial pancreas will be returned to the SIF fund to offset any investments. Mr. Jeffries, chair of the SIF faculty evaluation committee, said only one of the five is presented as originally proposed; all others were reduced in terms of the components of the projects. The following resolution was approved by all members present upon motion duly made and seconded.**

**RECOMMENDED STRATEGIC INVESTMENT FUND PROJECTS**

RECITALS

By Chapter 9, Title 23 of the Code of Virginia of 1950, as amended, there is created a corporation under the name and style of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia (the "University"); which is governed by a Board of Visitors (the "Board" or the "Board of Visitors"), which is vested with the supervision, management and control of the University.

Pursuant to Title 23 of the Code of Virginia of 1950, as amended, the University is classified as an educational institution of the Commonwealth.

By Chapter 4.10, Title 23 of the Code of Virginia of 1950, as amended (the "Act"), the University entered into a management agreement with the Commonwealth which was enacted as Chapter 3 of Chapter 933 of the 2006 Virginia Acts of Assembly, as amended, pursuant to which the University is classified as a public institution of higher education and the University is empowered with the authority to undertake and implement the acquisition of any interest in land, including improvements on the acquired land at the time of acquisition, new construction, improvements or renovations and to borrow money and make, issue and sell bonds of the University for such purposes, including the refinancing of any such facilities. 

Pursuant to a resolution adopted on December 8, 2016 (the "Authorizing Resolution"), the Board determined to refinance the costs of capital improvements to the University's educational facilities located in the City of Charlottesville and Albemarle County, Virginia (the "Project"), including refunding all or a portion of (1) the outstanding principal amount of the University's General Revenue Pledge Bonds, Series 2008 (the "Refunded Bonds") and (2) \[the outstanding principal amount of the University's Commercial Paper General Revenue Pledge Notes, Series A (Tax-Exempt) and Commercial General Revenue Pledge Notes Series B (Taxable) (collectively, the "Refunded CP"),\] as more fully described herein, and delegated to certain officers of the University pursuant to the University's Board-approved debt and interest rate risk management policies the power to approve the final terms of such financing, within certain stated parameters.

For the purposes of financing or refinancing capital improvements and other projects of the University, the University previously issued the Refunded CP pursuant to resolutions adopted by the Board on February 9, 2007 and August 11, 2008.

For the purpose of providing funds, together with other available funds, to refund the Refunded CP, the Board, pursuant to the powers granted it under Section 23-75 of the Code of Virginia of 1950, as amended, has determined to adopt this resolution authorizing the issue of one series of general revenue pledge refunding bonds of the University as Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds (the "Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds").

**Temporary Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds**. The Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds may be issued in temporary form exchangeable for definitive Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds when ready for delivery.

A temporary Bond may be in the form of a single Bond payable in installments, each on the date, in the amount and at the rate of interest established for the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds maturing on such date. Every temporary Bond shall be executed by the University and be authenticated by the Registrar upon the same conditions and in substantially the same manner as the definitive Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds.

**Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds Mutilated, Lost, Destroyed or Stolen**. If any Series 2017\_\_\_ Bond shall become mutilated, the University, at the expense of the Bondholder of such Series 2017\_\_\_ Bond, shall execute, and the Registrar shall thereupon authenticate and deliver, a new Series 2017\_\_\_ Bond of like tenor bearing a different number in exchange and substitution for the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bond so mutilated, but only upon surrender to the Registrar of the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bond so mutilated. Every mutilated Series 2017\_\_\_ Bond so surrendered to the Registrar shall be canceled by it and shall be delivered to, or upon the order of, the University. If any Series 2017\_\_\_ Bond shall be lost, destroyed or stolen, evidence of the ownership thereof and of such loss, destruction or theft may be submitted to the University and the Registrar, and, if such evidence be satisfactory to both of them and indemnity satisfactory to them shall be given, the University, at the expense of the Bondholder, shall execute, and the Registrar shall thereupon authenticate and deliver, a new Series 2017\_\_\_ Bond of like tenor bearing a different number in lieu of and in substitution for the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bond so lost, destroyed or stolen (or if any such Series 2017\_\_\_ Bond shall have matured or shall be about to mature, instead of issuing a substitute Series 2017\_\_\_ Bond, the Paying Agent may pay the same without surrender thereof). The University may require payment of a sum not exceeding the actual cost of preparing each new Series 2017\_\_\_ Bond issued under this Section and of the related expenses which may be incurred by the University, the Registrar, and the Paying Agent. Any Series 2017\_\_\_ Bond issued under the provisions of this Section in lieu of any Series 2017\_\_\_ Bond alleged to be lost, destroyed or stolen shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation on the part of the University whether or not the Bond so alleged to be lost, destroyed or stolen be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to the benefits of this Bond Resolution with all other Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds secured by this Bond Resolution.

**Terms and Conditions for Issuance and Delivery of the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds**. The Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds authorized by this Bond Resolution shall be executed in the form and manner hereinabove set forth and shall be deposited with the Registrar for delivery to the Underwriters pursuant to the Bond Purchase Agreement, but before the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds shall be delivered by the Registrar, there shall be filed with the Registrar the following:

a copy, certified by the Secretary of the Board, of this Bond Resolution;

an opinion of Bond Counsel stating that the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds have been duly authorized, executed and delivered in accordance with the Act and this Resolution and constitute valid and binding limited obligations of the University, payable solely from the Pledged Revenues and other property pledged therefor under this Resolution.

When the documents mentioned above in this Section shall have been filed with the Registrar and when the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds shall have been executed as required by this Bond Resolution, the Registrar shall deliver such Bonds to or upon the order of the Underwriters pursuant to the Bond Purchase Agreement, but only upon payment to the Custodian of the purchase price of such Bonds. The Registrar shall be entitled to rely upon such Bond Purchase Agreement as to the names of the purchasers and the amount of such purchase price.

The proceeds of such Bonds shall be deposited as described by the Custodian in Section 4.1.

**Book Entry Provisions**. The provisions of this Section 2.11 shall apply to the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds so long as all of the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds shall be maintained in book-entry form with a Securities Depository, any other provisions of this Bond Resolution to the contrary notwithstanding.

The principal or redemption price of and interest on the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds shall be payable to the Securities Depository, or registered assigns, as the registered owner of the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds, in same day funds on each date on which the principal of, and premium, if any, or interest on the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds is due as set forth in this Bond Resolution and in the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds.

Without notice to or the consent of the beneficial owners of the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds, the University and the Securities Depository may agree in writing to make payments of principal and interest in a manner different from that set out herein. If such different manner of payment is agreed upon, the University shall give the Paying Agent written notice thereof, and the Paying Agent shall make payments as if set forth herein. Neither the University nor the Paying Agent shall have any obligation with respect to the transfer or crediting of the appropriate principal, premium, if any, and interest payments to participants of the Securities Depository or the beneficial owners of the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds or their nominees.

The Paying Agent at the written direction of the University may replace any Securities Depository as the depository for the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds with another qualified securities depository or discontinue the maintenance of the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds in book-entry form at any time if the University determines to do so. Notice of any determination above shall be given to such Securities Depository at least 30 days prior to any such discontinuation (or such fewer number of days as shall be acceptable to such Securities Depository). The University may undertake to locate a qualified replacement Securities Depository and/or may discontinue the book-entry system of evidencing ownership of the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds.

If the University discontinues the maintenance of the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds in book-entry form, the University will issue replacement Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds directly to the participants in the former Securities Depository or, to the extent requested by any such participant, to the beneficial owners of the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds as further described in this Section. At the written direction of the University, the Paying Agent shall notify participants and the beneficial owners of the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds, by mailing an appropriate notice to the Securities Depository, or by other means deemed appropriate by either the Securities Depository or the Paying Agent, that the University will issue replacement Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds directly to the participants shown on the records of the Securities Depository or, to the extent requested by any participant, to beneficial owners of the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds shown on the records of such participant, as of a date set forth in such notice, which shall be a date at least 10 days after receipt of such notice by the Securities Depository (or such fewer number of days as shall be acceptable to the Securities Depository).

In the event that replacement Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds are to be issued to participants in the Securities Depository or to beneficial owners of the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds, the University shall promptly have prepared replacement Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds registered in the names of the participants as shown on the records of the former Securities Depository or, to the extent requested by any participant, in the names of the beneficial owners of Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds shown on the records of such participant, as of the date set forth in the notice delivered in accordance with the immediately preceding paragraph. Replacement Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds issued to participants in the Securities Depository or to beneficial owners shall be in fully registered form substantially in the form of Exhibit A. The form set forth in Exhibit A may be modified to include any variations, omissions or insertions that are necessary or desirable in the delivery of replacement certificates in printed form. In delivering replacement certificates, the Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely, without independent investigation, on the records of the former Securities Depository as to its participants and the records of the participants acting on behalf of the beneficial owners. The Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds will thereafter be registrable and exchangeable as set forth in Sections 2.6 and 2.7.

So long as there is a Securities Depository for the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds, (1) such Securities Depository shall be the registered owner of the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds, (2) transfers of ownership and exchanges shall be effected on the records of the Securities Depository and its participants pursuant to rules and procedures established by such Securities Depository and its participants, and (3) references in this Bond Resolution to Bondholders, Holders or registered owners of the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds shall mean the Securities Depository and shall not mean the beneficial owners of the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds.

If the University replaces any Securities Depository as the depository for the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds with another qualified Securities Depository, replacement Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds issued to such replacement Securities Depository shall have the same terms, form and content as the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds initially registered in the name of the predecessor Securities Depository or its nominee except for the name of the registered owner.

Each Securities Depository and the participants thereof and the beneficial owners of the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds, by their acceptance of the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds, agree that the University and the Paying Agent shall have no liability or responsibility with respect to (1) the accuracy of any records maintained by such Securities Depository or any Securities Depository participant; (2) the payment by such Securities Depository to any Securities Depository participant or by any Securities Depository participant to any beneficial owner of any amount due in respect of the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds; (3) the delivery or timeliness of delivery by such Securities Depository to any Securities Depository participant or by any Securities Depository participant to any beneficial owner of any notice which is given to Bondholders; (4) the selection of the beneficial owners to receive payment in the event of any partial redemption of the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds; or (5) any consent given or other action taken by such Securities Depository or any nominee of such Securities Depository, as Bondholder.

REDEMPTION OF THE SERIES 2017\_\_\_ BONDS**

**Redemption of the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds**. The Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds shall not be subject to prior redemption except as provided in this Article III.

The Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds are subject to redemption, at the option of the University, in whole or in part on any date not earlier than \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, 20\_\_, upon payment of a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds to be redeemed, plus interest accrued to the redemption date.

_Mandatory Redemption \[if needed\]._

The Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds shall also be subject to redemption in whole or in part on any date, at the option of the University, from the proceeds of casualty insurance or condemnation awards, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed, without premium, plus accrued interest to the redemption date, if all or any part of the Project refinanced with the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds is damaged or destroyed or taken through the exercise of the power of eminent domain and the President, Chief Operating Officer or Chief Financial Officer has delivered a certificate to the Custodian to the effect that the University has determined not to use such proceeds to replace or rebuild the damaged, destroyed or taken property. In the event of a redemption in part pursuant to this paragraph, the University shall redeem the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds from each maturity then outstanding, to the extent practicable, in the proportion that the principal amount of the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds of such maturity bears to the total principal amount of the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds then outstanding.

Subject to applicable procedures of the Securities Depository while the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds are held in book-entry only form by the Securities Depository, if less than all of the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds are to be called for redemption, the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds to be redeemed shall be selected by the University in such manner as the University in its discretion may determine.

**Notice of Redemption**. Whenever the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds are to be redeemed under the provisions of this Bond Resolution, the Paying Agent shall, not less than thirty (30) nor more than sixty (60) days prior to the redemption date, mail notice of redemption to all registered owners of all Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds to be redeemed at their registered addresses. The Paying Agent shall also mail a copy of any such notice of redemption to any Rating Agency. Any such notice of redemption shall identify the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds to be redeemed, shall specify the redemption date and the redemption price, and shall state that on the redemption date the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds called for redemption will be payable at the designated office of the Paying Agent and that from that date interest will cease to accrue. The Paying Agent may use "CUSIP" numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Bondholders, provided that any such notice shall state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds or as contained in any such notice.

If at the time of mailing of notice of any optional redemption the University shall not have caused to be deposited with the Paying Agent money sufficient to redeem all the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds called for redemption, such notice may state that it is conditional in that it is subject to the deposit of such moneys with the Paying Agent not later than the redemption date, and such notice shall be of no effect unless such moneys are so deposited. Failure by the Paying Agent to give any notice of redemption or any defect in such notice as to any particular Bonds shall not affect the validity of the call for redemption of any Bonds in respect of which no such failure or defect has occurred. Any notice mailed as provided in this Bond Resolution shall be conclusively presumed to have been given whether or not actually received by any Holder.

**Effect of Calling for Redemption**. On the date designated for redemption, notice having been mailed in the manner and under the conditions hereinabove provided and moneys for payment of the redemption price being held in separate accounts by the Paying Agent in trust for the Holders of the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds to be redeemed, all as provided in this Bond Resolution, the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds so called for redemption shall become and be due and payable at the redemption price provided for redemption of such Bonds on such date, interest on the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds so called for redemption shall cease to accrue, such Bonds shall cease to be entitled to any benefit or security under this Bond Resolution and the Holders or registered owners of such Bonds shall have no rights with respect thereto except to receive payment of the redemption price.

**The Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds Redeemed Not Deemed Outstanding**. The Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds which have been duly called for redemption under the provisions of this Article, or with respect to which irrevocable instructions to call for redemption have been given by the Board to the Paying Agent in form satisfactory to him or her, and for the payment of the redemption price of which moneys shall be held in separate accounts by the Paying Agent in trust for the Holders of the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds to be redeemed, all as provided in this Bond Resolution, shall not thereafter be deemed to be outstanding under the provisions of this Bond Resolution.

**  
  
CUSTODY AND APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS  
OF THE SERIES 2017\_\_\_ BONDS**

**Custody and Application of Proceeds of the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds**. The proceeds of the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds (par amount plus an original issued premium of $\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, less the underwriter's discount of $\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_) shall be deposited as follows:

$\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ shall be transferred to The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. as paying agent for the Refunded CP to provide for refunding the Refunded CP per instructions provided by the University;

$\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ shall be transferred to The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. as paying agent and escrow agent for the Refunded Bonds to provide for the refunding of the Refunded Bonds pursuant to separate instructions provided by the University; and

Any amounts remaining in the special account on August 1, 2015 shall be deposited in the Debt Service Fund and applied to pay interest on such Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds on the next Interest Payment Date.

**  
  
REVENUES AND FUNDS**

**Debt Service Fund**. A fund shall be created by the Paying Agent designated "The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia General Revenue Pledge Refunding Bonds, Series 2017\_\_\_, Debt Service Fund" (the "Debt Service Fund"). All accrued interest, if any, received from the purchasers of the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds, as provided in Section 4.1, shall be transferred to the Paying Agent to the credit of the Debt Service Fund. On or before the day preceding each date on which payments of interest, premium or principal shall be due and payable on the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds (a "Payment Date"), the University shall transfer or cause to be transferred to the Paying Agent for deposit an amount of money sufficient to cause the amount held in the Debt Service Fund to be equal to the interest, premium and principal due on the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds on such Payment Date. The Paying Agent shall cause payment of the amounts due on the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds on each such Payment Date.

**Payments to Bondholders**. The Paying Agent shall, at appropriate times on or before each Payment Date, withdraw from the Debt Service Fund the amounts needed on such date to pay the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds and shall pay or cause the same to be paid to the Bondholders as such principal, premium and interest become due and payable.

**Pledge of Funds and Accounts**. The moneys in the Debt Service Fund shall be held in trust and applied as herein provided and, pending such application, shall be pledged to, and subject to a lien and charge in favor, of the Holders of the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds issued and outstanding under this Bond Resolution and for the further security of such Holders until paid out or transferred as herein provided.

**Moneys Held in Trust**. All moneys from the funds of the University or that the University shall have received from any other source and set aside or deposited with any Paying Agent for the purpose of paying any of the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds hereby secured, either at the maturity thereof or upon call for redemption, shall be held in trust for the respective Holders of such Bonds. Any moneys which shall be so set aside or deposited and which shall remain unclaimed by the Holders of such Bonds for the period of five (5) years after the date on which such Bonds shall have become due and payable shall be disposed of by the University and the Paying Agent in accordance with The Uniform Disposition of Unclaimed Property Act, Chapter 11.1, Title 55, Code of Virginia of 1950, as amended (the "Unclaimed Property Act"). The Paying Agent shall be entitled to act in good faith in reliance on written direction from the University or its counsel in complying with the Unclaimed Property Act, absent the Paying Agent's negligence or willful misconduct.

**Cancellation of the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds Upon Payment**. All Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds paid, redeemed or purchased by the University, either at or before maturity, shall be canceled upon the payment, redemption or purchase of such Bonds and shall be delivered to the University when such payment, redemption or purchase is made. All Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds canceled under any of the provisions of this Bond Resolution may be cremated or otherwise destroyed by the University or its designee.

**No Risk to Paying Agent Funds**. No provision herein shall require the Paying Agent to expend its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers unless the Paying Agent shall have reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is reasonably assured to it.

**  
  
PARTICULAR COVENANTS**

**Payment of Principal and Interest; Pledge of Pledged Revenues**. The University covenants that it will promptly pay or cause to be paid from the sources described herein the principal of and the interest on every Bond issued under the provisions of this Bond Resolution at the place or places, on the dates and in the manner provided herein and in such Bonds, and any premium required for the retirement of such Bonds by purchase or redemption, according to the true intent and meaning thereof. Except as otherwise provided in this Bond Resolution, such principal, interest and premium are payable solely from Pledged Revenues, which Pledged Revenues are hereby pledged to the payment thereof and to the payment of any Parity Credit Obligations issued by the University which may include any interest rate swaps or other hedge mechanisms and any dedicated line of credit, standby bond purchase agreement or other liquidity facility related to the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds.

THE UNIVERSITY SHALL NOT BE OBLIGATED TO PAY THE PRINCIPAL OF OR INTEREST ON THE SERIES 2017\_\_\_ BONDS EXCEPT FROM THE SOURCES NOTED HEREIN AS PLEDGED THEREFOR. THE SERIES 2017\_\_\_ BONDS AND THE INTEREST THEREON SHALL NOT BE DEEMED TO CONSTITUTE A DEBT OR LIABILITY OF THE COMMONWEALTH, LEGAL, MORAL OR OTHERWISE. NEITHER THE COMMONWEALTH NOR THE UNIVERSITY SHALL BE OBLIGATED TO PAY THE PRINCIPAL OF OR INTEREST ON THE SERIES 2017\_\_\_ BONDS OR OTHER COSTS INCIDENT THERETO EXCEPT FROM THE SOURCES NOTED HEREIN AS PLEDGED THEREFOR, AND NEITHER THE FAITH AND CREDIT NOR THE TAXING POWER OF THE COMMONWEALTH ARE PLEDGED TO THE PAYMENT OF THE PRINCIPAL OF OR INTEREST ON THE SERIES 2017\_\_\_ BONDS OR OTHER COSTS INCIDENT THERETO.

**Intentionally Omitted**.

**Additional Indebtedness and Encumbrances.** Except as otherwise provided in this Section, nothing in this Bond Resolution shall be construed as prohibiting or limiting in any way the right of the University to incur other Credit Obligations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, the University may only incur the following types of Credit Obligations in the event the conditions set forth below are met in each instance:

Limitation on Parity Credit Obligations. The University may incur, assume, guarantee or otherwise become liable on any Parity Credit Obligation, but only if, prior to the incurrence of each such Parity Credit Obligation, an Authorized Officer of the University certifies in writing that (1) taking into account the incurrence of such proposed Parity Credit Obligation (i) the University will have sufficient funds to meet all of its financial obligations, including its obligations to pay principal of and interest on all Credit Obligations, for all Fiscal Years to and including the second full Fiscal Year after the later of (A) the issuance of such Parity Credit Obligation and (B) the completion of any facility financed with the proceeds of such Parity Credit Obligation, and (ii) such Authorized Officer has no reason to believe that the University will not have sufficient funds to pay all amounts due under all indebtedness of the University during the term of such proposed Parity Credit Obligation, and (2) to the best of his or her knowledge, the University is not in default in the performance and observance of any of the provisions of this Bond Resolution. Any such Parity Credit Obligation shall be secured by a pledge of Pledged Revenues on a parity with the pledge of Pledged Revenues herein, unless expressly subordinated to the pledge hereof.

Limitation on Section 9(c) Credit Obligations. The University may incur, assume, guarantee or otherwise become liable on any Credit Obligation pursuant to the provisions of Article X, Section 9(c) of the Constitution of Virginia, as such section may be amended from time to time, and may pledge and apply such portion of the Pledged Revenues as may be necessary to provide for the payment of any such Credit Obligation, the funding of reasonable reserves therefor, or the payment of operating and other reasonable expenses of the facilities financed in whole or in part with the proceeds of such Credit Obligation or facilities reasonably related to such facilities, and such pledge shall be senior and superior in all respects to the pledge of Pledged Revenues securing the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds and any other Parity Credit Obligations, but only if, prior to the incurrence of each such Credit Obligation, an Authorized Officer of the University certifies in writing that (1) taking into account the incurrence of such proposed Credit Obligation (i) the University will have sufficient funds to meet all of its financial obligations, including its obligations to pay principal of and interest on all Credit Obligations, for all Fiscal Years to and including the second full Fiscal Year after the later of (A) the issuance of such proposed Credit Obligation and (B) the completion of any facility financed with the proceeds of such proposed Credit Obligation, and (ii) such Authorized Officer has no reason to believe that the University will not have sufficient funds to pay all amounts due under all indebtedness of the University during the term of such proposed Credit Obligation, (2) to the best of his or her knowledge, the University is not in default in the performance and observance of any of the provisions of this Bond Resolution, and (3) in connection with the issuance of such proposed Credit Obligation, the University has received an opinion of Bond Counsel to the effect that such proposed Credit Obligation has been validly issued under Article X, Section 9(c) of the Constitution of Virginia.

Limitation on Other Credit Obligations, Including Section 9(d) Credit Obligations. The University may incur, assume, guarantee or otherwise become liable on any Credit Obligation not described elsewhere in this Section 6.3, including any Credit Obligation incurred pursuant to the provisions of Article X, Section 9(d) of the Constitution of Virginia, as such section may be amended from time to time, and may pledge and apply such portion of the Pledged Revenues as may be necessary for the payment of any such Credit Obligation, the funding of reasonable reserves therefor, or the payment of operating and other reasonable expenses of the facilities financed in whole or in part with the proceeds of such Credit Obligation or facilities reasonably related to such facilities and such pledge shall be senior and superior in all respects to the pledge of Pledged Revenues securing the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds and any other Parity Credit Obligations, but only if, prior to the incurrence of each such Credit Obligation, an Authorized Officer of the University certifies in writing that (1) taking into account the incurrence of such proposed Credit Obligation (i) the University will have sufficient funds to meet all of its financial obligations, including its obligations to pay principal of and interest on all Credit Obligations, for all Fiscal Years to and including the second full Fiscal Year after the later of (A) the issuance of such proposed Credit Obligation and (B) the completion of any facility financed with the proceeds of such proposed Credit Obligation, and (ii) such Authorized Officer has no reason to believe that the University will not have sufficient funds to pay all amounts due under all indebtedness of the University during the term of such proposed Credit Obligation, (2) to the best of his or her knowledge, the University is not in default in the performance and observance of any of the provisions of this Bond Resolution, and (3) the University has received an opinion of Bond Counsel to the effect that such proposed Credit Obligation has been validly issued under the relevant provisions of the Constitution of Virginia.

Limitation on Issuance of Indebtedness on a Parity with Qualifying Senior Obligations. Except for Credit Obligations issued pursuant to subsections (b) or (c) above or to refund any Qualifying Senior Obligation as described in subsection (e) below, no additional bonds or other obligations may be issued or incurred by the University on a parity with any Qualifying Senior Obligation.

Limitation on Additional Encumbrances. The University shall not encumber the Pledged Revenues in any manner (except as permitted in connection with Credit Obligations issued pursuant to subsections (a), (b) or (c) above or to refund any Qualifying Senior Obligation as described below), unless any such encumbrance is made junior and subordinate in all respects to the liens, pledges, covenants and agreements of this Bond Resolution. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, however, the University may issue bonds to refund any Qualifying Senior Obligation and to secure such refunding bonds with the same source of revenues securing the Qualifying Senior Obligation being refunded. Upon the defeasance of the refunded Qualifying Senior Obligation pursuant to any such refunding, the refunding bonds will be considered Qualifying Senior Obligations for all purposes.

**Disposition of Assets**. The University may convey, sell or otherwise dispose of any property of the University as long as (1) such conveyance, sale or encumbrance is in the ordinary course of business, or (2) an Authorized Officer certifies in writing that, taking into account the conveyance, sale or other disposition of such property (i) the University will have sufficient funds to meet all of its financial obligations, including its obligations to pay principal of and interest on all Credit Obligations for all Fiscal Years to and including the second full Fiscal Year after such conveyance, sale or other disposition and (ii) such Authorized Officer has no reason to believe that the University will not have sufficient funds to pay all amounts due under all indebtedness of the University then outstanding.

**Insurance**. The University covenants that it will at all times carry or cause to be carried insurance policies with a responsible insurance company or companies, qualified to assume the risks thereof, or that it will maintain an adequate program of self-insurance, in either case sufficient to provide the University with insurance in such amount and covering such risks as the University shall deem to be reasonable and desirable.

**Rights of Bondholders Not to Be Impaired**. Except as otherwise set forth herein, the University covenants that no contract or contracts will be entered into or any action taken which might impair or diminish the rights of the Bondholders.

**Further Instruments and Actions**. The University covenants that it will, from time to time, execute and deliver such further instruments and take such further action as may be required to carry out the purposes of this Bond Resolution.

**Accurate Records and Accounts**. The University covenants that it will keep accurate records and accounts of all items of cost and of all expenditures relating to Pledged Revenues collected and the application of such Pledged Revenues.

**Recognized Accounting Principles**. The University covenants that all of the accounts and records of the University will be kept according to generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied.

**Tax Covenants**. The University shall not use or permit the use of any proceeds of Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds or any other funds of the University, directly or indirectly, to acquire any securities or obligation, and shall not use or permit the use of any amounts received by the University or the Custodian with respect to the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds in any manner, and shall not take or permit to be taken any other action or actions, which would cause any Bond to be an "arbitrage bond" within the meaning of Section 148 of the Code. If at any time the University is of the opinion that for purposes of this subsection it is necessary to restrict or limit the yield on the investment of any moneys held under this Bond Resolution the University shall so instruct the Custodian, any trustee or the Paying Agent in writing, and such Custodian, trustee or Paying Agent shall take such action as may be reasonably necessary in accordance with such issuance.

The University shall not use or permit the use of any proceeds of Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds or any other funds of the University, directly or indirectly, in any manner, and shall not take or permit to be taken any other action or actions, which would result in any of the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds being treated as an obligation not described in Section 103(a) of the Code by reason of classification of such Bond as a "private activity bond" or an "arbitrage bond" or "bond not in registered form" within the meaning of Section 103(b) of the Code.

The University shall at all times do and perform all acts and things permitted by law and this Bond Resolution which are necessary or desirable in order to ensure that interest paid on the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds or any of them will be excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes and shall take no action that would result in such interest not being excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes.

The University covenants that it shall file the information report with respect to the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds required by Section 149(e) of the Code (currently Form 8038-G) within the time period provided in such Section.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the University may amend this section or alter or eliminate any actions or restrictions allowed or required by this section, if it receives an opinion of Bond Counsel that such amendments, alterations or eliminations would not alter the Bondholders' U.S. federal income tax treatment of principal and interest payments on the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds.

**  
  
EVENTS OF DEFAULT AND REMEDIES**

**Events of Default**. Each of the following events is hereby declared to be an "Event of Default" under this Bond Resolution:

due and punctual payment of the principal, purchase price or redemption premium, if any, of any of the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds is not made when the same become due and payable, either at maturity or by proceedings for redemption or otherwise;

due and punctual payment of any interest on any of the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds is not made when the same becomes due and payable;

the University, for any reason, is rendered incapable of fulfilling its obligations hereunder;

an order or decree is entered, with the consent or acquiescence of the University, appointing a receiver or receivers of the University or any part thereof or of the revenues thereof, or if such order or decree, having been entered without the consent or acquiescence of the University, is not vacated or discharged or stayed on appeal within sixty (60) days after the entry thereof;

any proceeding is instituted, with the consent or acquiescence of the University, for the purpose of effecting a composition between the University and its creditors or for the purpose of adjusting the claims of such creditors pursuant to any federal or state statute now or hereafter enacted; or

the University defaults in the due and punctual performance of any other of the covenants, conditions, agreements and provisions contained in the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds or in this Bond Resolution on the part of the University to be performed, and such default continues for thirty (30) days after written notice specifying such default and requiring same to be remedied is given to the Board by any Bondholder, provided that if such default is such that it can be corrected but cannot be corrected within such thirty (30) day period, it shall not constitute an Event of Default if corrective action is instituted by the University within such period and is diligently pursued until the default is corrected.

**Remedies**. Upon the happening and continuance of an Event of Default, hereunder, the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds, by instrument or instruments filed with the University and proved or acknowledged in the same manner as a deed to be recorded, may appoint a trustee to represent the Holders of the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds for the purposes herein, which trustee may be the State Treasurer and shall be the same trustee so appointed with respect to all other outstanding Parity Credit Obligations. Such trustee may, and upon written request of the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds then outstanding shall, in its own name:

by mandamus or other suit, action or proceeding at law or in equity enforce all rights of the Holders of the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds, including the right to require the University and its Board to collect fees, rents, charges or other revenues adequate to carry out an agreement as to, or pledge of, such revenues, and to require the University and Board to carry out any other agreements with the Holders of the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds and to perform it and their duties under the Act;

bring suit upon the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds;

by action or suit in equity, require the University to account as if it were the trustee of an express trust for the Holders of the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds; or

by action or suit in equity, enjoin any acts or things which may be unlawful or in violation of the rights of the Holders of the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds.

Any such trustee, whether or not all such Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds have been declared due and payable, shall be entitled as of right to the appointment of a receiver who may enter and take possession of any property of the University any of the revenues from which are pledged for the security of the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds and operate and maintain the same and collect and receive all fees, rents, charges and other revenues thereafter arising therefrom in the same manner as the University itself might do and shall deposit all such moneys in a separate account and apply the same in such manner as the court appointing such receiver shall direct. In any suit, action or proceeding by the trustee the fees, counsel fees and expenses of the trustee and of the receiver, if any, shall constitute taxable costs and disbursements and all costs and disbursements allowed by the court shall be a first charge on any fees, rents, charges and other revenues of the University pledged for the security of the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds.

Such trustee shall, in addition to the foregoing, have and possess all of the powers necessary or appropriate for the exercise of any functions specifically set forth herein or incident to the general representation of the Holders of the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds in the enforcement and protection of their rights.

To the extent permitted by law, upon the happening and continuance of any Event of Default, then and in every such case any Bondholder may proceed, subject to the provisions of Section 7.5, to protect and enforce the rights of the Bondholders by a suit, action or special proceeding in equity or at law, either for the specific performance of any covenant or agreement contained herein or in aid or execution of any power herein granted or for the enforcement of any proper legal or equitable remedy as such Bondholder shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce such rights.

**Pro Rata Application of Funds**. Anything in this Bond Resolution to the contrary notwithstanding, if at any time the moneys available in the Debt Service Fund shall not be sufficient to pay the interest on or the principal of the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds as the same shall become due and payable, such moneys, together with any moneys then available or thereafter becoming available for such purpose, whether through the exercise of the remedies provided for in this Article or otherwise, shall be applied as follows:

If the principal of all the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds shall not have become due and payable, all such moneys shall be applied first to the payment of any fees and expenses of the Custodian, Paying Agent and Registrar and thereafter shall be applied:

first: to the payment to the persons entitled thereto of all installments of interest then due and payable in the order in which such installments became due and payable and, if the amount available shall not be sufficient to pay in full any particular installment, then to the payment, ratably, according to the amounts due on such installment, to the persons entitled thereto, without any discrimination or preference except as to any difference in the respective rates of interest specified in the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds; and

second: to the payment to the persons entitled thereto of the unpaid principal of any of the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds which shall have become due and payable (other than Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds called for redemption for the payment of which moneys are held pursuant to the provisions of this Bond Resolution), in the order of their due dates, with interest on the principal amount of such Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds at the respective rates specified therein from the respective dates upon which such Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds became due and payable, and, if the amount available shall not be sufficient to pay in full the principal of the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds due and payable on any particular date, together with such interest, then to the payment first of such interest, ratably, according to the amount of such interest due on such date, and then to the payment of such principal, ratably, according to the amount of such principal due on such date, to the persons entitled thereto without any discrimination or preference.

If the principal of all the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds shall have become due and payable, all such moneys shall be applied to the payment of the principal and interest then due and unpaid on the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds, without preference or priority of principal over interest or interest over principal, or of any installment of interest over any other installment of interest, or of any Bond over any other Bond, ratably, according to the amounts due, respectively, for principal and interest, to the persons entitled thereto, without any discrimination or preference.

Whenever moneys are to be applied by the trustee pursuant to the provisions of this Section, such moneys shall be applied by the trustee at such times, and from time to time, as the trustee in his or her sole discretion shall determine, having due regard to the amount of such moneys available for application and the likelihood of additional moneys becoming available for such application in the future; the deposit of such moneys with any Paying Agent, or otherwise setting aside such moneys, in trust for the proper purpose shall constitute proper application by the trustee; and the trustee shall incur no liability whatsoever to the Board, to any Bondholder or to any other person for any delay in applying any such moneys, so long as the trustee acts with reasonable diligence, having due regard to the circumstances, and ultimately applies the same in accordance with such provisions of this Bond Resolution as may be applicable at the time of application by the trustee. Whenever the trustee shall exercise such discretion in applying such moneys, he or she shall fix the date (which shall be an Interest Payment Date unless the trustee shall deem another date more suitable) upon which such application is to be made and upon such date interest on the amounts of principal to be paid on such date shall cease to accrue. The trustee shall give such notice (or shall cause the Paying Agent to give such notice) as he or she may deem appropriate of the fixing of any such date and shall not be required to make payment to the Holder of any Bond until such Bond shall be surrendered to the trustee or any Paying Agent for appropriate endorsement, or for cancellation if fully paid.

Notwithstanding anything in this Bond Resolution to the contrary, this Section 7.3 shall be interpreted so that the term "Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds" or "Bonds" shall include the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds and any Parity Credit Obligations. In each resolution authorizing the issuance of any Parity Credit Obligation, the University agrees to provide for the trustee or paying agent thereunder to be the same entity as under this Bond Resolution, and further agrees to include provisions substantially identical to those contained in this Section 7.3.

**Effect of Discontinuance of Proceedings**. In case any proceeding taken by any Bondholder on account of any Event of Default shall have been discontinued or abandoned for any reason, then and in every such case the University and the Bondholders shall be restored to their former positions and rights hereunder, respectively, and all rights and remedies of the Bondholders shall continue as though no such proceeding had been taken.

**Proceedings for Equal Benefit of All Bondholders**. No Bondholder shall have any right in any manner whatever to affect, disturb or prejudice the security of this Bond Resolution or to enforce any right hereunder, except in the manner herein provided, and all proceedings at law or in equity shall be instituted, had and maintained for the equal benefit of all Bondholders.

**No Remedy Exclusive**. No remedy herein conferred on the Bondholders is intended to be exclusive of any other remedy or remedies, and each and every remedy conferred shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to every other remedy given hereunder and under the Act or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute.

**No Delay or Omission Construed to Be a Waiver**. No delay or omission of any Bondholder to exercise any right or power accruing upon any Event of Default occurring and continuing as aforesaid shall impair any such right or power or shall be construed to be a waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence therein; and every power and remedy given by this Article to the Bondholders may be exercised from time to time and as often as may be deemed expedient.

This Series 2017\_\_\_ Bond is issued and the Series 2017\_\_\_ Resolutions were adopted under and pursuant to the Constitution and laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, particularly Chapter 4.10, Title 23, Code of Virginia of 1950, as amended (the "Act") to refinance the costs of certain capital improvements at the University and to refund certain outstanding indebtedness of the University. Reference is hereby made to the Series 2017\_\_\_ Resolutions for the provisions, among others, with respect to the custody and application of the proceeds of bonds issued under the Series 2017\_\_\_ Resolutions, the funds charged with and pledged to the payment of the interest on and the principal of the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds, the nature and extent of the security, the terms and conditions on which the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds are or may be issued, the rights, duties and obligations of the University and the rights of the holders of the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds. Capitalized terms not defined herein shall be as defined in the Series 2017\_\_\_ Resolutions.

This Series 2017\_\_\_ Bond is also subject to redemption in whole or in part on any date, at the option of the University, from the proceeds of casualty insurance or condemnation awards, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed, without premium, plus accrued interest to the redemption date, if all or any part of the Project is damaged, destroyed or taken through the exercise of the power of eminent domain and the University has determined not to use such proceeds to replace or rebuild the damaged, destroyed or taken property.

Subject to applicable procedures of the Securities Depository while the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds are held in book-entry only form by the Securities Depository, if less than all of the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds are to be called for redemption, the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds to be redeemed shall be selected by the University in such manner as the University in its discretion may determine.

If any of the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds or portions thereof are called for redemption, the Paying Agent shall mail a notice of the call for redemption, identifying the Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds or portions thereof to be redeemed, not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date, to the registered owner of each Series 2017\_\_\_ Bond to be redeemed, at its address as it appears on the registration books kept by the Registrar. Provided funds for their redemption are on deposit at the place of payment on the redemption date, all Series 2017\_\_\_ Bonds so called for redemption shall cease to bear interest on such date, shall no longer be secured by the Pledged Revenues and shall not be deemed to be outstanding under the terms of the Series 2017\_\_\_ Resolutions. If a portion of this Series 2017\_\_\_ Bond is called for redemption, a new Series 2017\_\_\_ Bond in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion hereof will be issued to the registered owner upon the surrender hereof.

This Series 2017\_\_\_ Bond is transferable by the registered owner, in person or by its attorney duly authorized in writing, at the designated office of the Registrar, upon presentation of a written instrument of transfer and surrender of this Series 2017\_\_\_ Bond to the Registrar for cancellation. Upon the transfer, a new Series 2017\_\_\_ Bond or Bonds of the same aggregate principal amount, maturity date and interest rate will be issued to the transferee. No transfer will be effective unless represented by such surrender and reissue. This Series 2017\_\_\_ Bond may also be exchanged at the designated office of the Registrar for a new Series 2017\_\_\_ Bond or Bonds of the same aggregate principal amount, maturity date and interest rate without transfer to a new registered owner. Exchanges and transfers will be without expense to the holder except for applicable taxes or other governmental charges, if any. The Registrar shall not be required to transfer or exchange any Series 2017\_\_\_ Bond selected or called for redemption pursuant to the provisions hereof or from a Record Date through the next succeeding Interest Payment Date. All Bonds delivered in exchange or transfer shall be dated so that neither gain nor loss results from the transfer or exchange.

The University, the Paying Agent and the Registrar may treat the registered owner as the absolute owner of this Series 2017\_\_\_ Bond for all purposes, notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.

Neither the members of the Board nor any person executing this Series 2017\_\_\_ Bond are liable personally hereon or subject to any personal liability or accountability by reason of the issuance hereof.

This Series 2017\_\_\_ Bond will not be valid until the Certificate of Authentication has been signed by the Registrar.

The holder of this Series 2017\_\_\_ Bond shall have no right to enforce the provisions of the Series 2017\_\_\_ Resolutions or to institute action to enforce the covenants therein, or to take any action with respect to any Event of Default under the Series 2017\_\_\_ Resolutions, or to institute, appear in or defend any suit or other proceeding with respect thereto, except as provided in the Series 2017\_\_\_ Resolutions.

All acts, conditions and things required by the Constitution and laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia and by the rules and regulations of the Board to happen, exist and be performed precedent to and in the issuance of this Series 2017\_\_\_ Bond have happened, exist and have been performed as so required.
