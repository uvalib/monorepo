Col. Baldwin presented the following resolution, which was adopted by the Board - to wit -

The Visitors being satisfied that it is proper & expedient to continue the operations of the University for the next session, feel it at the same time to be their duty to reduce its expenditures within its income, & upon the best consideration they have been able to give the subject, have agreed upon the following plan, as being in their opinion the best approximation in their power to what is just to the University & to its Professors & officers. It is therefore resolved that the said plan be adopted & that it be communicated with this resolution to the Chairman of the Faculty.

**Plan for paying the Professors for the year beginning on the first day of July 1863, & ending on the first day of July 1864.**

Any balance remaining from the income so derived, after paying the expenses above stated & any other expenses attending the conduct of the schools for the next session, shall be divided equally among the Professors in full payment of their salaries from the University.

On motion of Mr. Tucker

**Resolved** That Prof. T. Maupin be & is hereby appointed chairman of the Faculty for the ensuing year.

On motion of Col. Baldwin

1. **Resolved** That Wm. A. Pratt be appointed Superintendent of Buildings & Grounds for the year beginning July 1st 1863 & ending June 30th 1864; upon such terms as the Executive Committee shall deem just, the salary to be paid out of the three thousand dollars appropriated to repairs & improvements.

2. **Resolved** That the Executive Committee be authorized & instructed to apply to the Secretary of War to send to labor on the grounds of the University such number of soldiers sentenced to hard labor as may be conveniently & advantageously employed in the improvement of the grounds; & that the committee be authorized to offer in consideration of such labor a release of all claim of the University to damages for injury to the buildings & grounds while occupied as a military hospital.

3. **Resolved** That if in the examination of the buildings & grounds of the University, the Executive Committee shall ascertain that the sum of $3000, appropriated to repairs & improvements is insufficient to place the buildings & grounds in such a condition as to avoid serious injury from delay, the said Committee shall have authority to expend in addition to the said sum of $3000 the proceeds of all wood sold for the year from July 1863 to July 1st 1864, & to borrow from the Infirmary Fund the money standing to the credit of that fund in the treasury of the University, & expend it for the same purposes.

4. **Resolved** That the Proctor be authorized to accept the office of Collector of Confederate taxes for Albemarle County, with the understanding that he will not allow his office of Collector to interfere with the discharge of his duties to the University.

5. **Resolved** That the arrangement adopted at the last meeting of the Board for selling wood from the University forests be continued for the next session.

The Rector laid before the Board a letter from Jno. R. Edmunds, expressing his deep regret at being prevented from attending this meeting by the sickness in his family.

The Committee on finance submitted the following report, which was received & ordered to be recorded - to wit -

"The Committee on finance begs leave respectfully to report, that no report from the Commissioner of accounts has been received, in consequence, as is supposed, of family affliction - It is therefore suggested that the Executive Committee be instructed to make a special examination of the finances without delay. From such examination as we have been able to make we think the books, accounts & moneys of University are properly kept according to the enactments."
