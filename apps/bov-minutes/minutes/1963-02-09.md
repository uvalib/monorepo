Messrs. L. B. Gunn, Douglas G. Chapman, Jr., and R. B. Cardozo of the State-Planters Bank of Commerce and Trusts of Richmond appeared before the Board and presented a detailed report on the University of Virginia Consolidated Endowment Fund for the year ending 25 January 1963. At the conclusion of the presentation and discussion, Messrs. Gunn, Chapman, and Cardozo left the room.

The President reported on a proposal by the Virginia Real Estate Association to make an annual grant to the McIntire School of Commerce to support the costs of instruction in real estate theory and principles, land utilization, and location theory. The funds for the grant are to be derived by the Association from assessments now levied on each licensed member of the real estate profession in Virginia and the Association has indicated that the funds, though granted annually, would be made available on an assured and continuing basis.

The President further reported that the Dean and Faculty of the McIntire School of Commerce had reviewed the proposal and had concluded and so recommended to him that the courses desired were of an academic nature and could be readily fitted into the curriculum of the School of Commerce.

The President therefore proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution:

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the President be and he is hereby authorized to accept a grant from the Virginia Real Estate Association to the McIntire School of Commerce to support instruction in real estate theory and principles, land utilization, and location theory.

The President reported on a proposal by Mr. Kent D. Currie of Haymarket, Virginia, to bequeath to the University of Virginia approximately 220 to 225 acres of land located in Prince William County on U. S. Route 15. The land is approximately 11 miles from Warrenton and 37 miles from Washington, D. C. Mr. Currie's proposal is that the proposed bequest be subject to (1) a life interest for himself and his wife, (2) the preservation of the main house, which was built before the American Revolution, and (3) the retention of a few acres and a house for his son during the son's lifetime, after which the house and the acreage would revert to the University.

The President reported that, while it would not be possible for the present Board to bind a future Board, in his opinion the proposal should be accepted with assurances to Mr. Currie that every effort will be made to see that his wishes concerning the main house are carried out.

To this end, the President proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution:

WHEREAS Mr. Kent D. Currie of Haymarket, Virginia, has proposed to bequeath to the University of Virginia property in Prince William County, consisting of approximately 220 to 225 acres, subject to a life interest for himself and his wife, and the retention of a few acres and a house for his son during his son's lifetime, after which the house and the acreage would revert to the University,

AND WHEREAS Mr. Currie has expressed the wish that the main house located on the property, which was built before the American Revolution, be preserved,

NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the proposed bequest by Mr. Currie, subject to the stipulations set forth above, be and it is hereby accepted with the understanding that, while this Board cannot bind its successors as to the preservation of the main house, we do urge our successors to carry out the wishes of Mr. Currie in this respect,

AND BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that we hereby express our grateful thanks to Mr. Currie for this proposed bequest which will be of great value to the University for future uses in the University's educational program.

The President presented a detailed report on the current financial status of the Department of Athletics. The present outlook, he stated, was that there would be a deficit in the estimated amount of $42,500 at the close of the fiscal year ending on 30 June 1963. While every effort was being made to reduce the budget deficit, the President reported that it would be necessary to seek authority from the Board for a loan from local funds of approximately $42,500 in order to cover the deficit anticipated. He further reported that the deficit would be retired over a period of time from the increase in the student athletic fee which the Board had previously approved effective on 1 September 1962 (Minutes, Board of Visitors, University of Virginia, No. 12, 1 June 1962, p. 336).

Accordingly, the President proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution:

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the President be and he is hereby authorized to obtain a loan of approximately $42,500 from local funds in order to finance the estimated deficit of the Department of Athletics for the fiscal year ending 30 June 1963, and that this is to be repaid from the revenue derived from the increase in the student athletic fee which became effective on 1 September 1962.

The following resolution was adopted:

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the Hospital Accounts Committee be and it is hereby authorized to charge off as uncollectible accounts Schedules 1128, 1129, 1132, 1133, 1135, 1136, 1139, and 1140, aggregating $182,669.88, as recommended by it, consisting of the following.

The President proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution:

WHEREAS the College Bowl team of the University of Virginia, consisting of Mr. Michael S. Bennett of Evanston, Illinois, Mr. Richard A. Greer of Marion, Virginia, Mr. John E. Mortensen of Virginia Beach, Virginia, and Mr. Talmadge Wyatt, Jr., of Woodbridge, Virginia, and coached by Mr. T. Graham Hereford, have competed most successfully on the General Electric College Bowl television program and have retired as undefeated champions,

AND WHEREAS their successful endeavors have brought honor and recognition to the University of Virginia and aroused enthusiasm among students, faculty, alumni, and friends of the University,

NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that we hereby congratulate the members of the team and their coach and direct the Secretary to send a copy of this resolution to the coach, the members of the team, and their parents,

AND BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that we hereby extend an invitation to the team and its coach to be in attendance at the next meeting of the Board in Charlottesville on 20 April 1963, so that we may meet them and extend our personal congratulations.

The President reported that the Acting Dean of the School of Medicine had recommended to him that the University follow the practice being adopted in a substantial number of schools of medicine in the country of buying fairly expensive microscopes and charging a flat fee annually to each medical student for the rental of these microscopes over his normal four-year program of instruction. The proposal is based on the need for the use by students of microscopes of the first quality rather than the individual purchase by the students of the cheapest ones available.

The President proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution:

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the Comptroller be and he is hereby authorized to make available to the School of Medicine $87,500 to be used for the purchase of microscopes, that this amount be repaid with interest at 4 1/2 per cent, that an appropriate amount for insurance and maintenance be provided, that all of the costs be recovered by a fee of $40.00 per medical student during each of his four years, and that the plan is to become effective with the entering class in September 1963 and is to be extended to each entering class thereafter.

The President reported that an anonymous donor had presented a gift to the Graduate School of Business Administration in honor of the late W. Tayloe Murphy. This gift, which is carried in the list of gifts and grants previously submitted to the Board, must be matched before the income can be used by the Graduate School of Business Administration. In accordance with the desires of the donor, it is necessary, the President stated, to enter into a trust agreement with the National Bank of Commerce of Norfolk which will have the responsibility for serving as the agent of the University in the investment of the securities of the endowment.

The President therefore proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution:

RESOLVED that the agreement dated 9 February 1963 between The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia and the National Bank of Commerce of Norfolk whereby National Bank of Commerce of Norfolk is designated as the Agent of the University for the investment of securities belonging to the University be, and the same hereby is, approved,

RESOLVED FURTHER that the Comptroller be, and he hereby is, authorized and directed to execute said agreement in the name of the University and that the Secretary be, and he hereby is, authorized to affix thereto the seal and to attest the same, and to deliver said agreement to National Bank of Commerce of Norfolk for execution by it, and

RESOLVED FURTHER that the Comptroller be, and he hereby is, authorized and directed to take such action as may be necessary to cause the securities and cash listed on the schedule attached to said agreement to be delivered to National Bank of Commerce of Norfolk as Agent thereunder, and to cause additional securities and cash to be so delivered to the Agent from time to time when so directed.

The President reported in detail on the events leading up to the scheduling by the John Randolph Society, a recognized student organization, of Gus Hall and George Lincoln Rockwell to address members of the Society, students, and faculty at meetings of the Society on the Grounds of the University. He outlined the procedure, under the Constitution and By-laws of the Student Council, by which the Student Council reviews the constitution of each student organization and must formally grant approval of an organization before it can become a recognized student organization. He reviewed also the regulations under the Calendar and Scheduling Committee and the Registrar (contained in the Administrative Procedures Manual of the University) regarding speakers and the use of University facilities. He included in his presentation the necessity he felt for maintaining the policy and principles of the University as it had been entrusted to him and for supporting the established form of student government. He also dilated upon the reasons obviating an arbitrary prohibition of these speakers by the President, however much he detested their views.

The President stated that the Executive Committee had met in lengthy session with the President on the preceding day and before the Board meeting on this day and that the Committee's deliberations had resulted in a draft of a resolution on the matter, which the President, with the unanimous approval of the Executive Committee, presented to the Board with his recommendation that it be adopted.

Following the presentation of the draft of the resolution, a lengthy discussion ensued. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Board unanimously adopted the following resolution:

WHEREAS it is the established policy of the University of Virginia to afford to recognized student organizations operating under the approval of the Student Council use of University facilities for speakers invited by such an organization, and

WHEREAS approval of a student organization by the Student Council under the Constitution and By-laws of the Student Council is predicated upon the assurance that such an organization will act with a full sense of responsibility for the good name and welfare of the University,

NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia

(1) That this Board, while recognizing the aim of the John Randolph Society to expose and combat the dangers of the political philosophies contrary to freedom that are held by Gus Hall and George Lincoln Rockwell, censures the judgment of the Society in affording to these men the dignity of the University and admonishes the John Randolph Society and all recognized organizations of the student body in the future to exercise an increased sense of responsibility toward the impact of their actions upon the welfare of the University,

(2) That this Board reiterates the fact that appearance on the Grounds of the University of a speaker under the auspices of a recognized student organization does not constitute or imply endorsement by the University or concurrence by the University in the views or programs expressed or advocated by the speaker,

(3) That this Board declares its implacable opposition to the doctrines of Communism and Fascism, represented by the speakers scheduled to address the John Randolph Society during the current month, and to all other doctrines that advocate the destruction of the freedoms upon which the United States is founded, and

(4) That this Board reasserts the founding principle of the University, stated by Mr. Jefferson: "This institution will be based on the illimitable freedom of the human mind. For here we are not afraid to follow truth wherever it may lead, nor to tolerate any error so long as reason is left free to combat it."

The Secretary was instructed to send a copy of this resolution to the Student Council, the John Randolph Society, and all other recognized student organizations.

Visitor Montague reminded the Board that the three out-of-state members, Visitors Berkeley, Hartfield, and Pollock, would be retiring from the Board at the expiration of their terms on 28 February 1963. On behalf of the Board, Visitor Montague expressed the Board's appreciation for their distinguished services to the University.

The three retiring members will be the guests of the Board at the luncheon following the next regular meeting of the Board on 20 April 1963.

The President announced the following gifts and grants:

The Chancellor proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution:

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the following person be and he is hereby elected to the faculty of Mary Washington College:

Mr. William R. Hullfish as Instructor in Music, for one semester, effective 1 February 1963, at a salary to be determined by the number of students taught and the amount of special fees paid by these students for applied music.

The Chancellor explained that the budget for the 1962-1964 biennium had been prepared in the spring of 1961. The estimates of enrollment used in preparing that budget were based on the maintenance of the same enrollment and the same ratio of Virginians to out-of-state students as prevailed in the College during the academic year of 1960-1961. In the 1962-1963 academic year, however, there was a marked shift in the ratio of Virginia students to out-of-state students. Because of the increase in the number of applications from qualified Virginia students, there was a decrease of 230 in the number of out-of-state students and a similar increase in the number of Virginia students. This increase in the percentage of Virginia students was the result of carrying out the College's policy of admitting all qualified Virginia applicants.

The replacement of out-of-state students by Virginia students would result, the Chancellor reported, in a reduction in revenue of $83,950 for the fiscal year 1962-1963. This reduction would occur because of the loss in revenue of $365, the non-resident tuition, for each of the 230 out-of-state students. It will be necessary, the Chancellor concluded, to request the Governor to authorize a deficit for the fiscal year 1962-1963 in the amount of $83,950.

The Chancellor therefore proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution:

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that, subject to the approval of the Governor, Mary Washington College be and it is hereby authorized to incur an operating deficit not to exceed $83,950 for the fiscal year ending on 30 June 1963.

The Chancellor stated that it would be necessary to increase student tuition and fees in September 1963 in order to provide the necessary funds for the operation of the College. The Chancellor reported that the student fees for Virginia and out-of-state students for the current fiscal year of 1962-1963 are as follows:

The proposed increase had been reviewed by the Mary Washington College Committee and the Finance Committee and the recommendation to increase the fees bore the joint approval of both Committees. The Chancellor further stated that the increase in tuition and fees was not only to prevent a deficit in the fiscal year 1963-1964 but was also to provide for the long-range instructional and other needs of Mary Washington College.

The Chancellor proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution:

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the student tuition and fees at Mary Washington College, as listed below, be and they are hereby approved, effective 1 September 1963 for the regular session and 1 June 1964 for the summer session.

The Chancellor presented and discussed in detail a report on enrollment for 1962-1963 and the anticipated enrollment for 1963-1964. As a part of his statement, he presented a profile of the entering classes for the last four years and commented on the encouraging results that had been obtained from higher admission standards.

The Chancellor reported that the Buildings and Grounds Committee, earlier that morning, had approved the recommendation of the Mary Washington College Committee that the new dormitory to be constructed should be located between Brent Hall and Sunken Road.

The Chancellor, with the assistance of the Bursar, reported on the need to take advantage for the faculty and staff of a non-forfeitable annuity contract which has been made available under the U. S. tax laws. In order to make this annuity contract effective, it would be necessary for the Board to pass a resolution which would give each member of the faculty and staff an opportunity to enter into the agreement.

After discussion, the Board adopted the following resolution:

WHEREAS the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia has determined that it is in the best interests of Mary Washington College that a non-forfeitable annuity contract be made available to the faculty and staff, and

WHEREAS it is considered appropriate that the faculty and staff be given the election as to whether to receive said annuity contract, and by exercising said election agree to accept a reduction in salary equal to the contribution of Mary Washington College for the purchase of said annuity contract,

NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that each employee of Mary Washington College of the University of Virginia be and is hereby given the privilege of entering into an amendment to his or her existing salary contract reflecting a reduction in the salary of the member of the faculty or staff for the remainder of the salary contract term, that for those members of the faculty and staff who elect to accept such reduction in salary, Mary Washington College apply for a non-forfeitable annuity contract and purchase same for the benefit of said member of faculty or staff, and that the contribution of Mary Washington College for the purchase of said annuity contract from such company as may be agreed upon by the faculty and staff, be in an amount equal to the reduction in salary voluntarily agreed to by the member of the faculty or staff.

On motion the meeting was then adjourned at 1:55 p.m.
