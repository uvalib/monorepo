At the meeting of the Board of Visitors called for this date, there being present only the Rector, and Visitors Craddock and Harmon, an informal conference was held with the President, and adjournment made subject to call of the Rector.

University of Virginia, April 10th, 1908.

At a called meeting of the Board of Visitors, University of Virginia, in the President's Office, East Lawn,

Present. The Rector, and Visitors Harmon, Flood, Craddock and White and President Alderman,

The Rector having called the Board to order at 2:00 o'clock, P. M., the newly appointed members. Dr. W. F. Drewry, and Mr. Geo. S. Shackelford, appeared, and being duly qualified, were accordingly recognized as members of the Board.

The first business in order, being the election of a Rector, on motion of Visitor Flood, Hon. Armistead C. Gordon was nominated and unanimously elected.

The President then presented the resignation of Dr. John W. Mallet, Professor of Chemistry, in the following correspondence,-

As you know from my reports to you of earlier date, I have for some time felt the coming on of age, and the inevitable necessity for laying down the responsibility of my pleasant duties in the service of the University.

I am sorry to have now to put into your hands, my formal resignation, and to request that you transmit it to the Board of Visitors.

This step seems to make it unnecessary, and in some measure improper, that I should report in detail as to the needs of my Chair, as called for by your circular letter of the 9th inst.

I beg to acknowledge with sincere regret your communication of March 16th, putting into my hands, for transmission to the Visitors, your resignation of the Professorship of Chemistry in the University of Virginia. I shall present to the Visitors, at their approaching meeting, your formal letter of resignation, with the request that they take such action as they may deem fit and proper.

To have served an institution of learning for thirty-eight years with fidelity and devotion is a clear title to gratitude and honor. To have served it with such distinction as to give to your department fame and prestige throughout the country, is an added claim to respect and appreciation. To have won, through the unfailing exercise of unbending integrity, high thinking, and sincere acting, the affection and reverence of those who know the institution, is the largest achievement possible to a teacher of youth. You have rendered all of these high services to the University of Virginia, as thousands of men in and out of its walls will attest. Your retirement will bring to your colleagues, and to the friends of the University everywhere, profound regret, mingled with the hope that many years remain to you of notable, scientific service. I shall deem it a privilege to seek your counsel in the reorganization of the work in Chemistry, made necessary by your resignation.

I beg you will accept assurances of my respect and esteem.

It is with great regret that I feel compelled, by the pressure of age, and resulting loss of health and strength, to give up work in the service of the University of Virginia

This service has been one of happiness on my part for many years, but the time has come when it must end.

I therefore respectfully ask you to accept my resignation as Professor of Chemistry, to take effect at the close of the present session on the 17th of June.

I preserve a most grateful remembrance of the uniform kindness and consideration which I have always received from the governing body of the University.

The resignation of John W. Mallet, Ph.D., M.D., LL. D., F.R.S., as Professor of Chemistry in the University having been tendered and accepted to take effect at the close of this session, a Committee was appointed to draft a resolution expressive of the regret of the Visitors at Dr. Mallet's retirement from the Faculty, who reported the following minute, which was adopted:

The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia have learned with sincere regret that Dr. John W. Mallet, who for a long period of years has adorned with his accomplishments and talents the Chair of Chemistry in this University, will sever his connection with its teaching Faculty at the close of the current session.

The Rector and Visitors desire to record on their minutes, for a memorial to those who shall succeed them, their profound and lasting appreciation of the value and worth of such lofty character, notable and catholic scholarship, disinterested and unselfish devotion to duty, noble integrity of life, and beneficent and far-reaching achievement, as are exemplified and illustrated in the association of Dr. Mallet with the University.

They tender to him, with sentiments of personal admiration and esteem, and with the verdict of contemporary science "Well done, good and faithful servant," their heartfelt wishes for a long continued and happy life of yet uninterrupted work and still larger achievement in his honorable retirement from the arduous and wearing cares of a teacher of youth.

The resignation of Dr. Charles H. Bunting as Professor of Pathology in the University of Virginia, was presented to the Board through the following letter to President Alderman,-

May I ask you to tender to the Rector and Board of Visitors of the University, my resignation as Professor of Pathology, to take effect September 15th, 1908, and also convey to them my regret at being "compelled" by the insistence of the call to a similar chair in my alma mater, the University of Wisconsin, to leave the Medical school at this period in its development.

On motion it was resolved that the resignation of Dr. Bunting be accepted by the Board, and that the President be authorized to convey their regrets to Dr. Bunting.

The following correspondence, together with copyright and deed, was presented by the President, and on motion, it was accepted, and the Rector authorized to write to Mrs. Rogers.

I send herewith the copyright of the "Geology of Virginia" for the department of Geology of the University of Virginia, for its use without limitation as to time or other considerations.

I enclose also the letter from the Rector of the University to which I have replied this morning and have informed him of the document I have received releasing me from any claims of the Hotchkiss family.

I congratulate the University on the passage of the Bill for the Survey.

I beg to acknowledge the receipt of the copyright to the "Geology of Virginia" for the Department of Geology in the University of Virginia. I beg to renew our very sincere appreciation of your great kindness and generosity. I believe that the William Barton Rogers Chair of Geology here, since the establishment of the State Survey at the University, is destined to carry out in a noble way the original plans so splendidly laid out by your husband.

On motion, the Board adjourned to meet at the call of the Rector.

At the meeting of the Board of Visitors called for this date, there being present only the Rector, and Visitors Craddock and Harmon, an informal conference was held with the President, and adjournment made subject to call of the Rector.

As you know from my reports to you of earlier date, I have for some time felt the coming on of age, and the inevitable necessity for laying down the responsibility of my pleasant duties in the service of the University.

I am sorry to have now to put into your hands, my formal resignation, and to request that you transmit it to the Board of Visitors.

This step seems to make it unnecessary, and in some measure improper, that I should report in detail as to the needs of my Chair, as called for by your circular letter of the 9th inst.

I beg to acknowledge with sincere regret your communication of March 16th, putting into my hands, for transmission to the Visitors, your resignation of the Professorship of Chemistry in the University of Virginia. I shall present to the Visitors, at their approaching meeting, your formal letter of resignation, with the request that they take such action as they may deem fit and proper.

To have served an institution of learning for thirty-eight years with fidelity and devotion is a clear title to gratitude and honor. To have served it with such distinction as to give to your department fame and prestige throughout the country, is an added claim to respect and appreciation. To have won, through the unfailing exercise of unbending integrity, high thinking, and sincere acting, the affection and reverence of those who know the institution, is the largest achievement possible to a teacher of youth. You have rendered all of these high services to the University of Virginia, as thousands of men in and out of its walls will attest. Your retirement will bring to your colleagues, and to the friends of the University everywhere, profound regret, mingled with the hope that many years remain to you of notable, scientific service. I shall deem it a privilege to seek your counsel in the reorganization of the work in Chemistry, made necessary by your resignation.

I beg you will accept assurances of my respect and esteem.

It is with great regret that I feel compelled, by the pressure of age, and resulting loss of health and strength, to give up work in the service of the University of Virginia

This service has been one of happiness on my part for many years, but the time has come when it must end.

I therefore respectfully ask you to accept my resignation as Professor of Chemistry, to take effect at the close of the present session on the 17th of June.

I preserve a most grateful remembrance of the uniform kindness and consideration which I have always received from the governing body of the University.

May I ask you to tender to the Rector and Board of Visitors of the University, my resignation as Professor of Pathology, to take effect September 15th, 1908, and also convey to them my regret at being "compelled" by the insistence of the call to a similar chair in my alma mater, the University of Wisconsin, to leave the Medical school at this period in its development.

I send herewith the copyright of the "Geology of Virginia" for the department of Geology of the University of Virginia, for its use without limitation as to time or other considerations.

I enclose also the letter from the Rector of the University to which I have replied this morning and have informed him of the document I have received releasing me from any claims of the Hotchkiss family.

I congratulate the University on the passage of the Bill for the Survey.

I beg to acknowledge the receipt of the copyright to the "Geology of Virginia" for the Department of Geology in the University of Virginia. I beg to renew our very sincere appreciation of your great kindness and generosity. I believe that the William Barton Rogers Chair of Geology here, since the establishment of the State Survey at the University, is destined to carry out in a noble way the original plans so splendidly laid out by your husband.

I now make my third and final report, acting under decree in this cause of January 4th, 1908. This report embraces a full and detailed account of the Receipts, Disbursements, and Transactions of the Norfolk Bank for Savings and Trusts, Adm. c. t. a., of Edward W. James, deceased.

The Norfolk Bank for Savings and Trusts, Administrator, c. t. a.

In Account With

The Estate of Edward W. James, deceased.

All of which is respectfully submitted,

(signed) Edmund S. Ruffin, Commissioner in Chancery.

The President's Financial Budget for 1908-'09 was then presented, and after consideration,

The following proposed appropriations from the special "Building and Improvement Fund," were approved and referred to the "Building Committee" previously appointed:-

At the meeting of the Board of Visitors called for this date, there being present only the Rector, and Visitors Craddock and Harmon, an informal conference was held with the President, and adjournment made subject to call of the Rector.

As you know from my reports to you of earlier date, I have for some time felt the coming on of age, and the inevitable necessity for laying down the responsibility of my pleasant duties in the service of the University.

I am sorry to have now to put into your hands, my formal resignation, and to request that you transmit it to the Board of Visitors.

This step seems to make it unnecessary, and in some measure improper, that I should report in detail as to the needs of my Chair, as called for by your circular letter of the 9th inst.

I beg to acknowledge with sincere regret your communication of March 16th, putting into my hands, for transmission to the Visitors, your resignation of the Professorship of Chemistry in the University of Virginia. I shall present to the Visitors, at their approaching meeting, your formal letter of resignation, with the request that they take such action as they may deem fit and proper.

To have served an institution of learning for thirty-eight years with fidelity and devotion is a clear title to gratitude and honor. To have served it with such distinction as to give to your department fame and prestige throughout the country, is an added claim to respect and appreciation. To have won, through the unfailing exercise of unbending integrity, high thinking, and sincere acting, the affection and reverence of those who know the institution, is the largest achievement possible to a teacher of youth. You have rendered all of these high services to the University of Virginia, as thousands of men in and out of its walls will attest. Your retirement will bring to your colleagues, and to the friends of the University everywhere, profound regret, mingled with the hope that many years remain to you of notable, scientific service. I shall deem it a privilege to seek your counsel in the reorganization of the work in Chemistry, made necessary by your resignation.

I beg you will accept assurances of my respect and esteem.

It is with great regret that I feel compelled, by the pressure of age, and resulting loss of health and strength, to give up work in the service of the University of Virginia

This service has been one of happiness on my part for many years, but the time has come when it must end.

I therefore respectfully ask you to accept my resignation as Professor of Chemistry, to take effect at the close of the present session on the 17th of June.

I preserve a most grateful remembrance of the uniform kindness and consideration which I have always received from the governing body of the University.

May I ask you to tender to the Rector and Board of Visitors of the University, my resignation as Professor of Pathology, to take effect September 15th, 1908, and also convey to them my regret at being "compelled" by the insistence of the call to a similar chair in my alma mater, the University of Wisconsin, to leave the Medical school at this period in its development.

I send herewith the copyright of the "Geology of Virginia" for the department of Geology of the University of Virginia, for its use without limitation as to time or other considerations.

I enclose also the letter from the Rector of the University to which I have replied this morning and have informed him of the document I have received releasing me from any claims of the Hotchkiss family.

I congratulate the University on the passage of the Bill for the Survey.

I beg to acknowledge the receipt of the copyright to the "Geology of Virginia" for the Department of Geology in the University of Virginia. I beg to renew our very sincere appreciation of your great kindness and generosity. I believe that the William Barton Rogers Chair of Geology here, since the establishment of the State Survey at the University, is destined to carry out in a noble way the original plans so splendidly laid out by your husband.

I now make my third and final report, acting under decree in this cause of January 4th, 1908. This report embraces a full and detailed account of the Receipts, Disbursements, and Transactions of the Norfolk Bank for Savings and Trusts, Adm. c. t. a., of Edward W. James, deceased.

On motion, the Board adjourned to meet at the call of the Rector.
