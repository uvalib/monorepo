The following report from the Miller Board of Trustees, which was read, approved and adopted:
At a meeting of the Board of Miller trustees of the University of Va this day held, the following proceedings were had: On the recommendation of Profr Tuttle Dr A. D. Drew of Chase City Va was nominated by this Board to the Board of Visitors as assistant to Profr Tuttle at a salary of $800. per annum. After a conference of the committee of this Board with a Committee of the Board of Visitors the following appropriations were agreed on for the session of 1892-3.

On the recommendation of Capn Vawter of the Miller School, Mr J. M. Andrews was appointed to the Miller Scholarship for two years from Sep. 1892.

A copy, teste,

On motion Dr A. D. Drew, who is nominated in the foregoing report, for the position was duly elected assistant to Profr Tuttle at a salary of $800. per annum.

The Committee on Grounds & Buildings submitted its report which reads as follows:
To the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia. The Committee on Grounds & Buildings submit the following report:

1st We deem it inexpedient and not in the interest of the University to grant either to the Fry's Spring Rail Road Company or to the Charlottesville and University Rail Road Company the privilege of introducing their lines of Railway in the University grounds.

2d The application of Profr Jas M. Garnett for repairs to pavilion No. 3 was considered by the Board last year and rejected and the information we have leads us to recommend an adherance, for the present at least, to that conclusion.

3d The application of Mrs L. L. Gunther for one of the hotels in case of a vacancy commends itself to our favorable consideration and we recommend that in case a vacancy should occur during the recess of the Board, she be given the refusal of the vacated hotel.

4th It is with regret that we recommend the denial of the application of Profr James H. Gilmore to have assigned to him room No. 16 in addition to room 18 now occupied by. Room 16 is now occupied by Profr Perkinson but he is willing to give it up on the condition that room 14 be assigned to him in lieu thereof. This latter room is occupied by Mr Nettelroth[?] who rented who rented at the beginning of the session just closed and at his own expense had it papered and painted, and he wishes to retain it for the ensuing session, which under the regulations now in force he has the right to do.

5th We find that the recommendation of the Faculty that additional openings be provided for the Public Hall was brought to the attention of the Visitors at their meeting in July 1891 and it was then directed that the Proctor examine into it and report thereupon with the cost to the Executive Committee, which Committee was empowered to act in the matter as circumstances seemed to require. No action seems to have been taken by either the Proctor or the Executive Committee and we suggest that the order of the Board to be found on page 271 [237] of the record of proceedings is all that is necessary on the subject. The Proctor having been relieved of the duty we suggest that the Superintendent of Public Buildings be directed to inquire into the subject and report to the Executive Committee.

Thomas S. Martin.

On motion the foregoing report was received & approved, and together with its recommendations, adopted.

The Committee on the Infirmary, Health, Sewerage and Brainage submitted its report which was read and on motion was received, approved and together with its recommendations adopted & which report reads as follows:
To the Rector & Visitors of the University of Virginia. Your Committee on Infirmary, Health & Sewerage respectfully report that the health of the students of the University, for the session now closing, has been unusually good. The Medical Faculty reports only a few cases of severe sickness and not a single death.

This immunity from sickness is largely due to the abundant supply of pure water furnished by the present system of water works which has been in operation since 1886, but which have been recently greatly improved.

Your Committee respectfully recommend that the Executive Committee confer with the Corporation of Charlottesville and endeavor to purchase the property contiguous to & which drains into the Reservoir, in order to control the entire drainage area and prevent pollution often common to water supply.

It is also recommended that the Superintendent of Buildings & Grounds be directed to secure some other location for an ice-pond, in order to obviate the objections that now exist in regard to the source of the ice supply.

Marshall McCormick

R. W. Martin.

The Executive Committee, through its late Chairman Mason Gordon, Esq, submitted its report to the Board and the same was read before the Board and after consideration On motion the report was ordered to be received, approved and adopted and entered of record. Said report is as follows:

Report of the Executive Committee of the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia.

Your Committee respectfully submits the following report of their proceedings since the last regular meeting of the Board.

At a meeting of the Committee held on 23d of September 1891. The Medical Faculty of the University were authorized to place the study of Materia Medica in the new scheme of medical instruction in the second instead of the first year.

At a meeting held on the 15th of October 1891 Profr Perkinson was authorized to appoint an assistant in French & German at the rate Four hundred dollars per annum until the next meeting of the Board, the said appointment to be subject to the approval of the Board at its next meeting.

At a meeting held on the 3d of November 1891 the Proctor was instructed to pay out of the general funds of the University Five hundred and twenty six 33/100 dollars ($526.33) to Profr Wm M. Thornton to cover deficiency in the appropriation of last year for material and apparatus purchased for his school.

And also to pay to W. D. Dabney One hundred and forty six 25/100 dollars, balance due him for codifying the laws of the University of Virginia.

At a meeting held on the 21st of November 1891. The Proctor was authorized to provide an additional work bench and tools asked for by Profr Thornton and the sum of fifty dollars or so much thereof as might be necessary was appropriated out of the general funds of the University for the purpose.

At a meeting held on the 16th of February 1892

It was resolved that in the rearrangement of the work of the Medical Department, the teaching of Histology to form a part of the regular course, be transferred from the chair of Physiology (Dr Barringer) to that Biology (Profr Tuttle).

2d That the charge of $3. for material used in the teaching Bacteriology and Histology hereafter as provided for be not made against the student but be transferred on the Proctor's books to the material fund of the Chair of Biology out of the general department (of $100.) paid by each regular medical student.

Mason Gordon, Late Chairman

The Finance Committee submitted its report to which was appended nine resolutions, which report together with the said resolutions were read & on motion the said report together with the resolutions were approved and adopted and are in the words and figures following, to wit:

To the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia.

Gentlemen. The Committee on Finance respectfully reports that the annual report of the Proctor and the report of the Commissioner of Accounts, making settlement of the Proctor's accounts, show a balance of $5066.53 in the hands of the latter for the fiscal year ending June 30th 1892. The income of the University for the ensuing year from its various sources, including an estimated income of $1000.00 from the Fayerweather bequest and the income from students' fees estimated upon a basis of $450. students amounts to the sum of $105886.00. Adding to this sum the balance now in the Proctor's hands, the Board has at its disposal the sum of $110,952.00. Your Committee give the figures showing this aggregate, and recommend that this sum be appropriated for the ensuing year as follows, to wit.

Estimate of receipts and expenditures for the session of 1892-93.

The following are the fixed and constant sources of revenue of the University:

Your Committee would further report that the Proctor appears to have received, in sundry payments to date, the sum of $75000.00 from the Fayerweather bequest, of which $16,600.76 has been expended on the University water supply and the further sum of $50,586.90 has been invested in Virginia (Riddleberger) bonds.

After deducting several items of expense incident to the collection of said bequest there remains in the bonds of the Proctor from the amount received from the Fayerweather executors the sum of $3629.33, and it is believed that the residue of this bequest, being about $25000.00 will be received during the current year.

Your Committee recommend that the sum of $25000.00 be appropriated from said bequest to the erection of a Gymnasium on the University grounds which shall be styled "The Fayerweather Gymnasium".

Your Committee would further recommend that out of the surplus revenue for the current year, should surplus be found to exist, the sum of $3000.00 be appropriated to the construction or renewal of pavements on the University grounds.

Your Committee would further recommend that the instructor in Gymnastics be guaranteed a compensation of $700.00 for the ensuing year, it being probable that the gymnasium fees will amount to something less than said sum.

Your Committee would further recommend that out of the fund devoted to repairs & improvements a sum not exceeding $1200.00 be devoted to an addition to the pavilion occupied by Dr W. C. Dabney.

Your Committee further recommend that the notes of John C. Futrall for tuition fees now due or that may become hereafter from him be accepted, provided said Futrall shall give two good securities on his notes or bonds for said fees.

Your Committee further recommend that the request of Wm H. Laird, Jr, to have the privileges of a Virginia student accorded to him from the date of his majority in December 1892 be granted, and they further recommend that the request of Mr J. H. Gilkerson, Jr that $1775 of his room rent be refunded to him shall be refused.

In order to carry out the recommendations of this report Your Committee would further recommend the adoption of the several resolutions appended below:

All of which is respectfully submitted.

June 29th 1892.

The Board met pursuant to adjournment on yesterday.

Present, the Rector and Messrs Kean, Parrish, Patteson and R. W. Martin. Absent, Messrs McCabe, McCormick, Gordon & T. S. Martin.

The Rector called the meeting to order.

The Committee on Grounds and Buildings, through Mr Kean one of its members, submitted its report which was read and considered and on motion the same with its recommendations was approved and adopted. It reads as follows:
Conditions on which Societies or Fraternities may be permitted to erect Halls upon the grounds of the University:

Any of the Societies or Fraternities, having chapters or permanent organizations, among the Students of the University, which shall present evidence of their pecuniary ability to erect such a Hall for their own use, as shall present in durability, safety, and style, an appearance in keeping with the other buildings of the University, will be authorized to erect such buildings upon the grounds of the University for their own use subject to the following conditions; to wit:

1\. Such buildings shall be of brick, covered with metal or slate, and of such dimensions, style, and according to plans, and specifications, and on such site, as shall be approved by the Superintendent of Grounds & Buildings, and accepted by the Board, or the Executive Committee.

2\. No such erection shall be commenced, without an express waiver, on the part of the general contractor, or contractors, of the right to any mechanics or builders or other lien, and the ampler to guaranty against any such lien by any subcontractor, or furnisher of materials, it being the express purpose of the Board to exclude the possibility of such liens being asserted, against either the ground occupied or the building to be erected.

3\. All such erections shall become the property of the University, subject however, to such reasonable use, by the society erecting the same, or its individual members, as shall be approved by the Board of Visitors, or such subordinate authority as the Board shall designate.

4\. During the use and occupation of such buildings by such society, the same shall be cared for and kept in order, and in such repair, as the Superintendent of Grounds & Buildings shall require, at the expense of the Society which erected the same, and without charge to the University.

5\. If any such building shall cease to be used for the purposes of such society, and in a manner satisfactory to the Board, for the period of one session, the same shall be taken fully in charge by the Superintendent of Grounds and Buildings, as to all intents and purposes one of the buildings of the University, subject to be thenceforth applied to such use as the Board may from time to time prescribe.

6\. If after such building has been so taken in charge for the University, the Society by which it was originally erected, shall be recussitated and make application to the Board for its restoration to their uses, it shall be for the Board to determine, whether or no, in the interest of the University such restoration shall be made or not.

7\. All such buildings shall be at all times as fully subject to inspection and visitation by the authorities of the University, and for police purposes, and the ends of discipline as any of the public buildings of the University.

The Committee on the Conduct of Schools etc. submitted the following report, through Mr. Kean, one of its members, which was read and considered and on motion the same was approved and adopted together with its recommendations, which report reads as follows:
Report of Commee on Schools etc. on the application of Miss Davis etc.

1\. Your Committee have given attentive consideration to the communication of Miss Caroline Preston Davis, asking to be allowed, under suitable conditions, to stand the examinations, during the next session, in the B. A. Course in the School of Mathematics, with the endorsement of the Faculty.

Also the recommendations, passed on the 27th instant, by a majority of the Faculty, concerning the relations of women to the University.

Without undertaking at this time to go into any discussion of this interesting and important subject, Your Committee have reached the following conclusions, to wit=

1\. That, at the present time it is impracticable and inexpedient for the University to undertake the duties of instruction for young ladies.

2\. That it is both practicable and expedient to extend to young women who may furnish suitable evidence of the requisite attainments in any of the Courses in the Academic Departments of the University, facilities for testing their attainments, by the same examinations, required of the students in such causces [sic.], and upon their passing under the same conditions required of the students, granting a certificate in appropriate form, of that fact, to be conferred by the Faculty.

We therefore recommend to the Board the adoption of the Resolutions submitted by the Faculty, in reference to this subject which are as follows:

June 29th 92

The Faculty recommend to the Board of Visitors the following resolutions concerning the relations of men to the University.

1\. That women of the age of eighteen or more be permitted, on presenting satisfactory testimonials of good character and on giving evidence of adequate preparation acceptable to the Faculty (either by certificate or by examination), to register with the Chairman of the Faculty for the pursuit of studies in one or more courses in the Academic Department of the University, with the consent in each case of the professor in charge of each School for which registration is desired, and upon payment of a registration fee equal to the matriculation fee of the University.

2\. After such registration they shall in each case be entitled to receive from the professor in charge of each School for which they are registered information as to the subjects discussed in the lectures of the course or courses which they propose to pursue, the texts read, or other subject matter of study in the work of the course or courses in question: but they shall not be required or permitted to attend the regular lectures or other exercises of any School. They shall also be entitled, on deposit of the usual contingent fee, to the use of the Library and Collections of the University under such regulations as may be prescribed by the Faculty.

3\. They shall be required to stand examinations upon the same examination paper and at the same time as the class whose work they are pursuing, at such place other than that occupied at the time by the class and under such conditions of supervision and chaperonage as the Faculty may designate: and to pay for each class an examination fee of five dollars.

4\. Upon passing satisfactory examination (under the same conditions as regards standing etc. as the class) upon the work of any year or course they shall receive certificate to that effect of such form as the Faculty may prescribe.

5\. The Faculty shall have the authority to withdraw the privileges of the University from or to refuse to re-admit there to any one so registered who in the opinion of the Faculty is not fulfilling or is not likely to fulfill the purposes for which she registered at the University.

6\. In its present condition the University is not prepared to undertake for young ladies the duties of instruction.

Forwarded by order of the Faculty with statement of vote on the proposed plan.

June 27th, 1892.

2 Your Committee have been impressed with the importance to the welfare of the University of the local examinations which have been heretofore held, and concur fully in the views expressed in the Report of Profr Venable. A resolution is herewith submitted, making an appropriation of a sum not exceeding $100. to promote this object.

3\. Your Committee further concur in the recommendation of the Faculty, that the degrees of B. A. and M. A. may be awarded to the same person on the same Public day, provided such student shall in addition to the B. A. courses in the schools selected for that degree shall have taken and passed upon the advanced studies prescribed for the M. A. course in the four schools selected by him.

Your Committee respectfully call the attention of the Board to the catalogue for the present year. The imperfections and deficiencies of which, especially in regard to "Academical Degrees", on page 27 appear to be anything but creditable to the University. It seem to Your Committee that the catalogue ought to supply full, accurate, and detailed information, in regard to the requirements for these degrees.

Other important matters which have been before your Committee, owing to the interruptions, inevitably incident to the final exercises in the University they have not been able to deal with. They respectfully suggest that the time for their report upon the remaining subjects referred to them, be enlarged until a called meeting of the Board to be held at some day during the next fall or winter.
