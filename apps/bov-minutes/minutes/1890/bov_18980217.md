Resolved, that bill of extras, so far as not ordered to be paid, and the Equity account of R. F. Tucker, contractor, be referred to the Executive Committee.

Resolved, that the certificate of the Architect for the payment of $2000. to W. J. Whitehurst supported by an order on R. F. Tucker's account of his sub contract for bookcases and screens in the library, be paid, with the condition that this payment is not to be regarded as an acceptance of the work.

Resolved, that the Rector be directed to execute the bond required to be given to the Board for the distribution of dead bodies for the Medical department, the penalty of said bond being $1000.

The Rector vacated the chair and called Mr Harmon to occupy it and then offered the following resolution which was adopted & after which he resumed the chair:

Resolved, that the Proctor be authorized to have a copy of the minutes of the Building Committee made for Mr Armistead C. Gordon at his proper costs and charges.

Resolved, that the Proctor cause his clerk to record on the minute book of the Building Committee the contract of the Rector and Visitors with Ross F. Tucker for the completion of the buildings.

Resolved, that the two bills of J. E. Phillips for extra work amounting to $73.30 and $54. respectively, be paid.

Whereas, through a letter from Mr Robert L. Harrison this Board is informed that the friends of the late Alfred H. Byrd, a brilliant and distinguished young alumnus of the University of Virginia, who recently departed this life in New York City, have expressed a desire to present to the University for its Library an oil portrait of Mr Byrd by some artist of known reputation:

Resolved, that the Rector and Visitors will accept the contemplated gift with great satisfaction and will direct that the same be hung on our walls as a mark of respect for Mr Byrd's achievements as a student at this institution and an incentive to the students who shall come hereafter, to emulate his virtues.

Whereas, Miss Fanny M. Burke, a great-grand daughter of Mr Jefferson has expressed a desire to present to the University a copy made by her of Trumbull's sketch of Mr Jefferson's head which was executed by him in Paris for his picture of the signers of the Declaration of Independence in the Capitol at Washington.

Resolved, that the Rector and Visitors accept with thanks the gift of Miss Burke.

Resolved, that the Proctor be authorized to purchase necessary window shades for the new lecture rooms; also to have the outside of the Rotunda dome painted white and to have the inside of the dome painted or colored and the Library galleries painted white.

Resolved, that the P. K. Club be allowed the use of the Gymnasium for a ball on the night of June 11th 1898.

Resolved, that the fee bill of John B. Moon for legal services in connection with damage suits against the University, amounting to $490.50 be paid.

Resolved, that the name of the School of History and Political Economy be changed to the School of Historical and Economical Science.

Resolved, that the Health Committee be authorized to expend so much of the reservoir fund of $561. as may be necessary, in addition to the $1000. heretofore appropriated to avert a water famine.

Resolved, That action on the Report of the Committee on Retrenchment and Reform be deferred to a future meeting; and that the Senator and Representatives from Albemarle be requested to present to the General Assembly of Virginia if practicable the following memorial, on some day of the present session after the appropriation to the University shall have been fully disposed of:

**Memorial.**
Of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia.
In order to enable the Rector and Visitors of the University to properly and economically adjust the salaries and emoluments of the Professors in the University, they do memorialize the general assembly to so amend section 1551 of the Code of Virginia as to relieve the said Rector and Visitors of the legal necessity of providing residences for said Professors, or commutation therefor; so that said section as amended and re-enacted shall read as follows:
**Sec. 1551. Professor's salaries, fees, and houses.** Each professor shall receive a stated salary, and may also receive such additional compensation out of the fees for tuition and other revenues of the University as the Visitors may from time to time direct.

Mr Irvine read and moved the adoption of the following resolutions in regard to a communication from Prof. W. H. Echols in relation to the salary of the Prof. of Mathematics:

1 Resolved, that in the opinion of the Board, the finances of the University are not in a condition to justify the payment of a greater sum for said salary during the current session than $2600. and a residence, as paid during the preceding year; but in taking this action the Board desires to place on record that it does not mean to place the Chair of Mathematics on a lower plane than the other full professorships of the University, nor to reflect on the efficiency and ability of Prof. Echols whose work has been and is, entirely satisfactory in every respect, to this Board, but financial reasons alone controlling this action, it having been the intention of the Board at the time of the election of Prof. Echols and the present Adjunct professor of Mathematics that the total amount paid on account of this school should not exceed that formerly paid.

2 Resolved, further, that the question of equalizing the salary of the professor of Mathematics with that of the other chairs of the University, be left for the action of the incoming Board.

Mr Gordon offered the following as a substitute for Mr Irvine's resolution:

Resolved, that the salary of the Professor Mathematics, W. H. Echols be fixed at $3000. per annum, and a residence, or commutation of rent, beginning with July 1, 1897.

A vote was first taken on the adoption of the substitute and it was defeated.

The resolutions of Mr Irvine were then voted on and the same were adopted.

On motion it was
Resolved, that the Board adjourn to meet on March 17th 1898.

University of Virginia, March 17th 1898.

The Visitors met this, the 17th day of March 1898, pursuant to the adjourning order of the Board made on the 17th ult., of which all of the Visitors were duly notified by the Secretary in advance of this meeting.

Present, Daniel Harmon, R. J. Irvine, Joseph Bryan, of the late Board, and Charles P. Jones, Carter Glass, Algernon B. Chandler, George W. Miles and Henry H. Downing, the five Visitors recently commissioned as such by the Governor of Virginia to serve for the term of four years next ensuing the 28th day of February 1898, Vice, W. C. N. Randolph, Legh R. Watts, Armistead C. Gordon and Henry T. Wickham, the last named being the successor of Mr Camm Patteson, resigned Decr 10th 1897.

Absent W. B. McIlwaine.

Mr Harmon, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the late Board, called the meeting to order and stated the first order of business to be the election of a Rector and Secretary whereupon Mr Irvine nominated for Rector Mr C. P. Jones which was seconded by Mr Bryan, and there being no other nomination, the vote was taken and Mr Jones unanimously elected.

The Rector took the chair and announced that the election of a Secretary was next in order,- Mr Irvine thereupon nominated Mr James D. Jones, the late incumbent, which was seconded by Mr Harmon, there was no other nomination, and the vote was taken and Mr Jones unanimously elected Secretary.

On motion the Board then proceeded to elect members of the Executive Committee and the following Visitors were proposed, and elected, viz:
Messrs Harmon, Chairman, Jones, Rector, Glass, Bryan and Miles.

The Chairman of the Faculty submitted a report of the Faculty which is in the following words and figures, to wit:

As chairman of the University I take pleasure in reporting that so far this session the health and general conduct of the students have been extremely good, and I take still greater pleasure in reporting that they have met their financial obligations in a way that leads me to hope that the deficiency caused by the action of the Legislature can be largely made up in this office.

The following recommendations of the Faculty are respectfully submitted with the hope that they will be approved. Should the Board find anything herein not perfectly understood, the Chairman would be glad to have the opportunity to explain.

1. The Committee on advertising recommends that the Board of Visitors be requested to appoint Rev. J. Williams Jones agent for the University, for three months, at a salary of one hundred dollars a month and traveling expenses.

2. The following recommended by the Library Committee is adopted: "That the Visitors be requested to appropriate out of the restoration fund of $300.00, or so much thereof as may be necessary, to meet the expenses of moving the books, of purchasing such additional tables and chairs, of putting locks on the cases in the upper gallery, etc".

3. The following resolution was unanimously adopted:-

"In view of Col Charles S. Venable's self-sacrificing labor in behalf of the University of Virginia and of his personal devotion to his Alma Mater, and in view further of this distinguished services as Professor of Mathematics,

Be it resolved, that the Faculty herewith memorializes the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia to declare Col Venable Professor Emeritus of Mathematics, and to order his name restored to the official list of University professors in the former position of relative official seniority."

4. "Resolved, that it be recommended to the Visitors to extend the Christmas holiday from Decr 24th to Jan. 2nd, including both dates. Ayes 10 Nos 5."

5. "Resolved, that the Chairman is requested to ask the Visitors to make an early appropriation for chandeliers for all the buildings."

6. "Resolved, that it be recommended to the Visitors to appropriate $150.00 for the purpose of putting an electric system of time service in the University."

7. "Resolved, that the Faculty recommends to the Rector and Visitors the enactment of a regulation authorizing the chairman to permit, at his discretion, ministers of the Gospel and approved candidates for the ministry to matriculate in the Academic Department for a term of three months upon the payment of the proper proportion, namely one third, of the matriculation fees."

8. "Resolved, that the Board be requested to provide the lecture rooms with comfortable seats before the beginning of the next session, The Faculty deeming this of even more importance than the seating of the Public Hall."

9. "Resolved, that the Department of Agriculture is at present the only one in the University in connection with which there is no definite course of work looking to a degree. The Board of Visitors are therefore requested to authorize this Department of the University to offer the degree of Bachelor of Science to students who comply with the following requirements:-

"The completion of one B. S. Course in each of the following subjects with graduation in any two of the schools represented, viz:-

"Botany, General Chemistry Physics, Comparative Anatomy, Analytical Chemistry, and Geology; the completion of one B. S. course from the group of Mathematical Sciences; and of the course in scientific French and scientific German."

"The B. S. Course shall in each case be the same as, or the equivalent of, the B. A. course in the same subject."

10. "Resolved, that the Buildings of the University, be offered, in so far as they are needed, for the use of the School of Methods, which will meet this summer in Charlottesville."

Hoping that the above suggestions may all be approved, I remain very respectfully,

The Chairman of the Faculty also submitted a communication of which the following is a copy:

To the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, Gentlemen: In view of the contemplated dedication of the new buildings in June next it is absolutely imperative that the Board should decide now what sum of money it can appropriate for this celebration. This sum should be appropriated and made available at once, as the Joint Committee on celebrations can do nothing until they know exactly what sum is at hand. The celebration is but a part of the necessary advertising of the University and in view of all the circumstances should be as liberally provided for as possible.

On consideration of said communication the following was adopted:

Resolved: That the question of expense of the next final celebration be referred to the Committee consisting of the Rector and Executive Committee with power to act.

On the recommendation of the Chairman of the Faculty the following resolution was submitted for the consideration of the Board:
Resolved: That the Board be asked to empower the Faculty to require the students to submit the names of speakers selected by them for all public exercises, to the Faculty for approval before extending to such speakers any invitation to speak at the University.

After considering the foregoing recommendation, the Board on motion ordered the resolution to be laid on the table.

Mr Ross F. Tucker, contractor, submitted an account, which is in the following words and figures, to wit:

Statement of account To settle all claims at the Univ. of Va.

McKim, Mead & White.

Martin.

The Board, after examining the account of Mr Tucker and hearing the statements of himself and Mr Skinner in relation, after consideration, adopted the following resolutions numbered 1, 2, 3 respectively:

1. Resolved: That the items in the equity account this day presented by Ross F. Tucker mentioned as bills incurred by Profs Smith and Thornton and the item of $745.45 for certain concrete steps be referred to the Executive Committee of this Board with power to take such action as they may deem best.

2. Resolved: That $734.67 be paid to Ross F. Tucker in full satisfaction of so much of his equity account as has not been by former resolution at this meeting, referred to the Executive Committee; but this payment is to be made only on condition that Tucker shall agree to accept as final the action of the Executive Committee on the part of said account referred to it and to further accept the payment above provided for and such payment, if any, as the Executive Committee may authorize on the residue of the said account as a final and complete satisfaction of all his claims and demands against this corporation under said account. He having already stated to this Board that he has no legal claim to said equity account.

3. Resolved: That the balance due Ross F Tucker under his contract be paid upon presentation of all proper certificates from the Architects, and when the Superintendent of Grounds & Buildings shall be satisfied with the proper execution of the work, but said payment is to be made only when the Counsel for the Board shall advise that all claims and attempted liens under said contract are satisfied, and that the said payment can be properly made. But no payment is to be made until the said Counsel shall be satisfied that such indemnifying bond or bonds as the Executive Committee may lawfully require under said contract is in full force and effect and said Committee shall be authorized to substitute a new bond in such penalty and with such conditions as they think proper for the one which has heretofore been given by said Tucker.

Resolved: That Mr George E. Walker, attorney, who has in hand the collection of certain notes and bonds due the University be authorized to exercise his best judgment in the collection of said claims and with the assent of the Proctor to compromise any of them on such terms as he may think proper. The Proctor will take care of and preserve the receipt of Mr Walker for said claims.

Before entering upon their duties as Visitors, the new members took the oaths of office, Mr Miles having qualified before the Judge of the Hustings Court of the City of Radford, and Messrs Chandler, Jones, Downing and Glass before the Judge of the County Court of Albemarle County.

At 11 1/2 P. M.

On motion the Board adjourned to meet tomorrow at 9 1/2 A. M.

To a marked genius which grasped the whole situation and in a masterly way offered a striking solution of practical difficulties in a manner at once harmonious with but expansive of the original design and preserved the distinctly classic features of the University buildings, they added a personal interest and zeal in carrying out the work which have left their impress upon all they touched.

To Mr Stanford White the Board desires especially to express their grateful acknowledgment of his unceasing labors and the unreserved devotion of his signal abilities to the accomplishment of the best and noblest results for the University buildings the whole of which as now completed have greatly increased the efficiency and attractions of the University and have made it a more splendid monument to its great founder, Thomas Jefferson.

The Secretary is directed to send a copy of these resolutions to Messrs McKim, Mead & White and a copy to Mr Stanford White.

Resolved: That the offer of Mr Stanford White made to Mr D. Harmon, Chairman of the Executive Committee, dated March 11th, 1898, touching the construction of the colonnades connecting the Academic Building with the Physical and Mechanical Buildings, be and is hereby accepted with thanks, and the construction at the price proposed by the Manhattan Concrete Co. in their letter of March 10th 1898, to Messrs McKim, Mead & White is hereby authorized.

Resolved: That the expense of this construction be defrayed out of the balance of the Fayerweather bequest when the same shall be received.

The two letters referred to in the foregoing resolution are in the following words and figures, to wit:

I have just received a letter from my brother, stating that you have a meeting of the Committee and Board of Visitors on March 17th. The final certificate has been sent, and you also have our bill in full.

I enclose you herewith copy of Mr Tucker's estimate for the connecting arcades between the Academical building and the Physics and Mechanics. This is somewhat lower than his former estimate, for the reason that after carefully thinking over the matter when I was last there, I determined it would be better to lower the height of the arcade somewhat and stand the columns on the ground, in order to make them conform entirely with the character of the old work.

I send you also a tracing showing this.

In reply to your request for figures for the connecting arcades on the University of Virginia, will say that we will construct the two arcades connecting the Academical with the Mechanical and with the Physical buildings, for the sum of $1250.00 each.

This includes cutting down the piers of the Arcades as now built, cutting the stone capping to form a plinth, concrete columns with paneled square faces on rear, and with all woodwork painted white.

We assume that the portion over the cap of the columns will be built up hollow to form the architrave.

Hoping to receive your order for this work, we are:
