**At a regular annual meeting of the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia held at the University on the 13th of June 1898.**

Present, Charles P. Jones, Rector and Visitors Harmon, Bryan, Miles, Glass, Irvine, and Downing.

The Chairman of the Faculty submitted the following annual reports:

The Faculty's report, Proctor's report, Commr of Account's report, Librarian's report and the several school reports.

The Rector made the following appointments of Standing Committees:

**Finance:**

Messrs Harmon, Downing and Glass.

**Library & Apparatus:**

Messrs Bryan, McIlwaine & Miles.

**Conduct of Schools and examination students:**

Messrs Miles, Irvine & Chandler.

**Buildings & Grounds:**

Messrs Glass, Bryan & Downing.

**Health, Infirmary, Sewerage & Drainage:**

Messrs Irvine, McIlwaine & Chandler.

**Miller Board:**

Messrs McIlwaine, Harman & Glass.

The following was enacted:

The Executive Committee having reported that Ross F. Tucker, Esq. Contractor has failed to lay before them any evidence on which they could act on the three items of his account referred to them, and the Board having maturely considered said items; and the representation of Mr Tucker, he having stated that the settlement proposed at the last meeting of the Board is declined by him, on motion.

**Resolved:** That the three items aforesaid, to wit, $745.- 45 claimed for concrete steps, $125.34 claimed for work on Physical Building and $34.67 claimed for work on the Mechanical Building, be rejected.

**Resolved:** That the appropriation for Mechanical Appara- tus be increased by the sum of $350.00

**Resolved:** That Mr Joseph Bryan of the Board, be appointed a Committee to investigate the condition of the investments made by the trustees under the will of Arthur W. Austin of Milton, Mass. decd, and report to the Board the character of said investments, their value, solvency etc. Said Bryan is authorized, if he shall deem it necessary to do so, to employ Counsel to assist him in such investigation and to draw on the Proctor for such expenses as he incurs in the premises.

The death of Mr R. G. H. Kean, a former member of the Board of Visitors and for a time Rector, having been suggested, On motion, Mr Glass was requested to prepare memorial resolutions of Mr Kean for the action of the Board in regard thereto.

**Resolved, that the Rector be authorized to execute the authority to sell the tract of land of the Austin estate referred to in the letter of Mr Bentley W. Warren to the Proctor, which letter is in the following words and figures, to wit:**

You may recall that last summer a part of the piece of real estate owned by the trustees under Mr Austin's will was taken by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for park purposes. This left a small piece of the estate, containing about 5000 square feet, with restrictions against building on a part of it, thus rendering the lot really unavailable. We have now received an offer of $800.00 for this piece of land, which we consider it would be advantageous for the estate to accept. We have therefore prepared a petition to the probate court for leave to sell the remainder of the estate. If this meets with your approval will you kindly sign the assent to the enclosed petition, and as the purchaser is in something of a hurry, I would ask you to return the petition at your earliest convenience.

**Resolved: That the Rector and Visitors have learned with gratification that there is a desire on the part of the Alumni of the University to erect on these grounds an Alumni Memorial Hall which shall be used not only for preserving memorials of distinguished Alumni but as a place where visiting Alumni may meet and for such other purposes as the Alumni may prescribe.**

**Resolved: That the following recommendations of the Miller Board be adopted: viz,**

"Appropriation of the Miller Fund, recommended by the Miller Board:

The board has to its credit on account of Scholarships in addition to the above and unappropriated, $133 00 which was unexpended under one of the last year's scholarships. The Miller Board earnestly recommends that this sum be given to Mr J. N. Michie, a most worthy Miller School boy who is unable to attend the University. This sum to be donated provided his friends will raise any additional sum necessary to his expenses at the University and the Board of Visitors authority that he may enter upon same terms as if he were appointed to a scholarship. This however is not to be considered as the establishment of an additional scholarship, but an arrangement for this one year only."

**Resolved: That the Proctor, at the earliest practicable moment, restore the sinking fund to its full amount by the purchase of Virginia Century bonds.**

**The Depositary shall collect any bond or other security as it matures and shall deposit the same to a special investment account to be drawn upon by the Proctor for the purchase of such securities as may be approved by two of the Finance Committee, and such securities when paid for shall be delivered to the Depositary and be held for account of the same fund from which the purchase money was derived.**

**A special account shall be kept of each Fund and the reinvestments thereof.**

**All purchases of securities for any fund herein provided for shall be made by the Proctor, by and with the approval of two members of the Finance Committee.**
