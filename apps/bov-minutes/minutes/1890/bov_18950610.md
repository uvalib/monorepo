5. Resolved, that it is inexpedient in the judgment of the Board, to comply with the request of Mrs Cocke to be allowed to rent rooms on Monroe Hill for the use of her summer boarders, and that Secretary notify Mrs Cocke of this action.

6. Resolved, that the summer Students be permitted to occupy the rooms mentioned in section 144 of the Laws of the University, on the terms therein mentioned, but they shall not be required to board with the tenants of the University Hotels, provided when they do not board with said hotel keepers they shall be responsible for the dormitories so occupied without cost to the University, such being the legal intendment and effect of said section 144.

7. Resolved, that it would give the Board of Visitors very sincere pleasure to accede to the request made by the distinguished Profr of Common & Statute Law that his assistant, Raleigh C.

The Rector presented a resolution of the Washington, D. C, Society of the Alumni of the University and a letter of its secretary accompanying the same in relation to Profr Schele, which was read and considered and thereupon the following was adopted:

The Board acknowledges through the Rector the receipt of the resolution of the Washington Association of the Alumni of the University of Va of date April 15th 1895 and the reply of the Rector thereto, which resolution and reply are in the following words and figures, to wit:

At the regular annual meeting of the Washington Association of Alumni of the University of Virginia held in the City April 15th 1895, the following resolution was adopted:

Resolved, that this Association learns with deep regret that Profr Schele De Vere is now in great financial straits and earnestly requests that the Board of Visitors adopt some measures for his relief

Dear Sir, I received on yesterday a copy of the resolution of the Washington Association of the Alumni. Upon Profr Schele De Vere's resignation and severance of his connection with the University of Virginia, the Board of Visitors had no further power to adopt any measure for his financial relief, nor can they, without betraying their trust, expend the institutions money, except for such purposes as are prescribed by law. The resolution will be laid before the Board at its meeting in June.

And the Visitors approve in every respect the reply of of the Rector and in doing so they put upon record that no further evidence has been adduced or offered in refutation of the charges made against Profr Schele De Vere and the Visitors are therefore left no course other than to reaffirm their action in accepting the resignation of said Profr Schele De Vere.

A communication was received and read from Messrs Steele & others of Baltimore, Md in behalf of Dr Schele De Vere, whereupon it was,

Resolved, that the Secretary forward to Messrs Steele and others a copy of the resolution, (including a copy of the Rector's reply) adopted to-day in respect to the resolution of the Association of the Alumni of Washington, D. C., and express the regrets of the Board that it is not in their power to make provision for Dr Schele.
