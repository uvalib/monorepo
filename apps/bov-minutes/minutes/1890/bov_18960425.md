On the motion of Mr McCormick the following was ordered to be entered in regard to the letter of Mr Patteson above referred to.

A letter from Mr Camm Patteson to the Secretary, dated April 24th 1896, was presented to the Visitors by Mr A. C. Gordon and read and the Visitors deem it unnecessary to take any action on said letter other than to acknowledge its receipt.

On the application of Profr Wm M. Lile it was resolved that the Pavilion recently occupied by the late Professor John B. Minor be assigned for the use of Profr Lile.

After consideration the claim of Messrs McDonald, Bros & Spooner on motion the following was unanimously adopted:

In view of the fact that Messrs McDonald, Bros & Spooner have acted with courtesy and consideration in the matter of withdrawing from the position of Architects for the reconstruction of the Rotunda, and being informed of the dissatisfaction of these gentlemen with the compensation awarded them by resolution of the Board on March 13th 1896; and in view of the fact further that the Board is advised by an expert that the work done by Messrs McDonald, Bros & Spooner was reasonably worth $1500.00 after the deduction of the estimated cost of strengthening the terrace roof,

Resolved, that said resolution of March 13th 1896 be so amended as to make Messrs McDonald, Bros & Spooner's compensation $1500.00 instead of $1387.88; and that the other provisions of said resolution stand as passed at said meeting.

A communication was received and read, from Mr R. H. Fife in regard to debouching of a portion of the University sewerage upon his premises. On consideration whereof the following resolution was adopted:

The committee on the "Otts Lectureship" submitted its report which is as follows:

The Committee appointed to arrange the details necessary for the establishment of the Otts Lectureship on the Evidences of Christianity begs to report that it would be in their judgment contrary to the policy and tradition of the University of Virginia, and liable to produce future complications in the administration of the school, to accept the tender of Rev. J. M. P. Otts in the form, in which it has been brought before them. They recommend therefore in lieu of such acceptance the adoption of the following resolutions:-

Resolved,

1\. That the Visitors have learned with unfeigned gratification and interest the generous purpose of Rev. J. M. P. Otts toward the University of Virginia, and desire hereby to express their sympathy with the objects of the proposed Lectureship on the Evidences of Christianity.

2\. That those members of the Faculty of the University, who desire to promote the plan fostered by Dr Otts, be and are hereby authorized to arrange for the custody of the endowment fund of the Otts Lectureship, on any other similar foundation, to invite suitable persons to lecture at this University under conditions of time and place approved by the Faculty, to provide from the income of the fund for the payment of the lectures and the publication of the lectures, and to do such other acts as are necessary for the successful execution of the plan.

3\. That a copy of these resolutions be forwarded by the Secretary of this Board to Dr Otts, with a suitable expression of the thanks of the Board for his liberal gift.

On motion the said report, together with its recommendations, was adopted by a unanimous vote.

On motion Judge Legh R. Watts, was by a unanimous vote, elected Rector pro. tem. of the Board of Visitors until the next election.

Minor be retained in his chair by reelection at the expiration of his present term, which was read and on motion it was referred to the Special Committee on reorganization, consisting of Messrs McCormick, Harmon & Watts for consideration and report to the Board.

The Rector having laid before the Board the resignation of Profr Wm M. Thornton as Chairman of the faculty, On motion it was

Resolved, that the resignation of Professor Thornton as Chairman of the Faculty be accepted to take effect the first day of September 1896.

The Rector and Visitors of the University having received the resignation of Profr Wm M. Thornton as Chairman of the Faculty of the University in accepting the said resignation desire to put on record their appreciation of the services which Mr Thornton has rendered this institution.

For Eight-Years Mr Thornton has performed the duties of Chairman in addition to those of a full professor in which he has exhibited great ability and untiring zeal in promoting its interests.

When the great disaster of October 27th last swept away in fire our principal buildings, Professor Thornton exhibited the highest qualities of body and mind in meeting the emergency and repairing the disaster in his visits to the various points of the country to increase interest in the University and to secure aid for its restoration his influence was great and his success striking, for all of which the Board return thanks to Profr Thornton.
