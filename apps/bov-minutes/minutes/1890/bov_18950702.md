At a meeting of the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia held in purance of adjournment, on this 2nd of July 1895, (adjourned from June 11th 1895.)  
Present. The Rector and seven of the Visitors, viz, Messrs McCabe, Watts, R. W. Martin, Patteson, McCormick, T. S. Martin and A. C. Gordon.  

The Committee on Grounds and Buildings submitted its report which is in the following words and figures, to wit=  
To the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia.  
The Committee on Grounds and Buildings respectfully report as follows:  
1\. That the recommendation of the Faculty that they be authorized to make and enforce such regulations as will make it possible for the Chairman and Proctor to carry out systematically the collection of the accounts of students for board, be approved.  
2\. That in view of the present financial condition of the University, it is in the opinion of the Committee, inexpedient to undertake the erection of new dormitories; and the Committee suggests that further consideration of this matter be deferred until the final adjudication by the courts of the Fayerweather case.  
3\. That the Committee recommend the appropriation of Six thousand dollars out of the Fayerweather fund to cover the expense of changing the location of the present roadway along East Range, and for paving East and West ranges, and the approaches therefrom to the Lawn.  
4\. That the Committee recommend the appropriation of $500.00 out of the Fayerweather fund for the enlargement of the Mess Kitchen on Carr's Hill.  
5\. That the Committee recommend that a new light be placed at the alley running from Col Peter's residence to West Range.  
6\. That Mrs Gunther's application to sublet "Hotel F" has been withdrawn; and that she has given notice that she does not want said Hotel after the expiration of the present year.  
7\. That the Committee recommends the appropriation of $150.00 out of the Fayerweather fund for making the desired changes in the room adjoining the Chemical Laboratory.  

The Committee on "Conduct of Schools & Course of Instruction" in the University of Virginia, to which was referred so much of the Faculty report as relates to modifications in the requirements for the B. A. degree, & the substitution of a general elective degree of "Bachelor of Science" in place of the present degrees of "Civil Engineer", "Mining Engineer" & "Mechanical Engineer" in the Engineering Depart- ment, begs leave to report as follows:  
1st as to a modification of the requirements for for the B. A. degree.  
The wisdom of the Visitors in remodelling the scheme of the old Academic degrees has been amply vindicated by results. At the close of the past session (1894-95) were graduated twenty B. A.s, a thing that ten years ago would have been deemed impossible, so unwilling were students, under any of the former schemes, to offer for a degree, which was virtually a public advertisement of their defeat in obtaining the higher (M. A.) degree.  
The Visitors, by radically changing the whole degree system, have offered students a broad, strong, & reputable degree, & the results prove how quickly they have availed themselves of the opportunity to compete for the coveted reward of sound academic work.  
That from time to time modifications would have to be made in respect to details,-modifications that would inevitably suggest themselves in the practical working out of the scheme-the Visitors saw at the outset & so expressed themselves. But it may be said, without fear of successful contradiction, that the scheme in its essential aim & scope, has proved a decided success.  
To the Faculty, to whom the scheme, as it now stands, was referred for suggestions recommend the following modifications: of the existing requirements:  
"The degree of Bachelor of Arts will be conferred upon a student, who has been graduated in nine B. A. Courses, so selected from the following list that at least one is taken from each of the seven groups=  

A. Latin & Greek.
B. German, French, English Language.
C. Eng. Lit., History, Pol. Economy.
D. Logic & Psychology, Ethics & Hist. of Philosophy.
E. Mathematics, Mechanics, Astronomy.
F. Physics, Chemistry.
G. Biology, Geology."

To the minds of your Committee—;& we have given the matter our best thought—;this scheme has its strong & weak points. Under the existing requirements, there are but six groups of study, & Chemistry, Physics, Geology & Biology are embraced under one group (F), that of "Natural Science".  
But these varied subjects, while of equal importance, are unlike in scientific method & educational value & the grouping is consequently open to the criticism that it is irrational. By simply dividing the present group (F.) into two groups, (F.) Physics & Chemistry & (G) Biology & Geology, all criticism is silenced.  
The recommendation of the Faculty that nine B. A. Courses for these seven groups be required for the B. A. degree instead of eight courses for the existing six groups, also commends itself to your Committee. The weak points in the scheme seem to your Committee to be as follows=  

1\. Spanish & Italian are entirely omitted from the scheme, & it is surely the business of a great University not only to provide in those languages, but to assign them some place in an elective scheme of degrees.  
2\. Under the scheme submitted by the Faculty, a student electing the "English Language" from group B, might graduate B. A. & proceed M. A. without the slightest knowledge of or instruc- tion in any modern foreign language.  
3\. The basis of the whole scheme is that it offers wide election, & yet, under group D, the subjects taught in the "School of Moral Philosophy" alone are absolutely required. Furthermore, if a student were to elect both "Logic & Psychology", & "Ethics & the History of Philosophy" in group D. & wished to proceed M. A., electing "Moral Philosophy" as one of his M. A. courses, no further instruction is provided in that "School".  
4\. "Political Economy" is grouped illogically with "English Literature". It is really a philosophical subject & is treated by many authors as a branch of applied Ethics.  

In view of these objections, your Committee submit for your favorable consideration the following modified scheme:  

A. Latin, Greek.
B. (1) French, (2) German, (3) Spanish and Italian.
C. English Language, English Literature, History.
D. Logic & Psychology, Ethics & Hist. of Philosophy, Political Economy.
E. Mathematics, Mechanics, Astronomy.
F. Physics, Chemistry.
G. Biology, Geology.

Each student to elect nine subjects, at least one from each group. This seems to your Committee to present a scheme which is (1) evenly balanced, (2) rationally grouped, & (3) sufficiently broadened.  
The recommendation of the Faculty that the present degrees of "Civil Engineer", "Mining Engineer", & "Mechanical Engineer" be abolished & the general elective degree of "Bachelor of Science in the Engineering Dept" be substituted for it, is endorsed by Your Committee. A like change has been made at Harvard & the Mass. Inst. of Technology & the other great Engineering schools are falling into line.  
The requirements for this general elective degree, as printed on p. 8 of the last "Faculty report" (June 1st 189) are also recommended to be ordered by the Board.
