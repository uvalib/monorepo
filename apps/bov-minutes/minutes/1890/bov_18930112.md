Know all men by these presents, that I, Leita M. Kent, am held and firmly bound to the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia in the just and full sum of sixty Thousand dollars well and truly to be paid to the said obligee, Witness my hand and seal this 9th day of January 1893.

The condition of the above obligation is such, that whereas I have caused to be communicated to the said Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia my desire and purpose to endow a Chair of English Literature in the said University to be known as the "Linden Kent Memorial Chair of English Literature", as a memorial to my late husband, and to that end to pay to the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia the sum of Three Thousand dollars annually, the said payments to begin in the month of February 1893, and to continue to be made in the same month of each succeeding year, during my life, or until the sum of Sixty Thousand dollars for the permanent endowment of said Chair shall be paid as hereinafter provided, and I have provided by my will, that at my death said sum of Sixty Thousand dollars shall be paid out of my Estate to said object, for the permanent endowment of the Chair so to be established and named, And whereas the purpose and object of this obligation is more fully to secure and make certain against all contingencies, the continuance of said annuity and the ultimate payment of the said permanent endowment, which annuity and endowment are to be used exclusively for the maintenance and support of said Chair.

Now Therefore, the condition of this obligation is such, that if the said Chair shall be established and named as aforesaid, and that having been done, if the said annuity shall be fully and punctually paid as aforesaid, until such time as I may see fit to pay over the said sum of Sixty Thousand dollars in satisfaction of said intended legacy and permanent endowment; (The right to so satisfy and adeem which whenever I may see fit to do so, I reserve to myself), or until the said endowment be paid out of my estate; and if I shall in my life time pay over said sum of Sixty Thousand dollars, for said purpose, or after my death the same be promptly paid out of my estate, which I hereby charge for that purpose whether the said testamentary provision shall take effect or not, (provided however that there shall not be but one satisfaction of said sum of Sixty Thousand dollars), then this obligation shall be void, but otherwise shall remain in full force and effect.

The bond of Mrs Kent reported as above was turned over to the Board by Mr H. T. Kent, who was present in person, as her agent.

The Board then proceeded to the election of the professor to fill the new chair.

Professor Charles W. Kent of the University of Tennessee, was placed in nomination, and a vote was had, which resulted unanimously in favor of Professor Kent and he was declared elected.

The Chairman of the Faculty laid before the Board a Report of the Faculty dated Jan'y 12th 1893, made to the Board, containing sundry recommendations, which on motion were referred to the appropriate committees.

The following preamble and resolutions were reported by the Committee on the Conduct of Schools etc. which were approved and adopted by a unanimous vote:

Whereas, some doubt exits in the minds of some of the Faculty as to whether a candidate for M. A. must in all cases be a graduate in the B. A. courses of the subjects elected for his M. A. degree, it is hereby

1\. resolved and ordered that an applicant for M. A., whether a B. A. of this institution or of any other chartered institution of learning, shall in all cases be also a graduate in the B. A. courses of the four subjects elected for the M. A. degree.

2\. And it is further resolved and ordered that graduation in the B. A. courses of any subject shall be a prerequisite to graduation in the M. A. courses of said subject. But, if upon examination the student in any subject shall evidence ability to pursue both the B. A. course and the M. A. course of said subject simultaneously, he shall be allowed to do so.

3\. Resolved, that by the proper construction of the recent action of the Board in reference to the General degrees any student not an applicant for any of the general degrees, may be awarded a diploma as a graduate in any separate school, when he shall have satisfactorily passed in both the B. A. and the M. A. course in such school.

The Proctor laid before the Board a letter from Mr Walter D. Dabney in regard to printing and indexing the laws of the University, inclosing bids for the printing, which correspondence satisfied the Board that the appropriation of $200. made at the last meeting for the work is inadequate, which was considered, and on motion the following resolution was adopted.

Resolved, that the appropriation of $200. made at the last meeting of the Board for the indexing and printing of the Laws of the University be increased to the sum of $500. and the Proctor is instructed to cause the work to be done, on the best terms he can obtain, not exceeding the sum so appropriated.

The following resolutions were adopted:

Resolved that, on recommendation of the Faculty, the sum of one hundred dollars is hereby appropriated for the purchase of jars by Dr Dabney for the purpose of preserving pathological specimens.

Resolved, That the appropriation of $3000.00 out of surplus revenue for the renewal or construction of pavements on the University grounds, which was made at the last annual meeting, be and the same is hereby revoked and the matter is left open for consideration at the next annual meeting of the Board.

Resolved, That the Proctor be instructed to pay to the School of Biology $5.00 for each regular medical student in the Class in Histology for the present year.

Resolved, that until further ordered the Miller Scholarships awarded upon competitive examinations shall be given each year to the candidate who shall pass the highest examinations upon B. A. courses in Chemistry, Physics and Biology, and that each person holding a scholarship shall during his tenure of two years elect each year one third of his work in one of the following schools: Biology and Agriculture and Agricultural Chemistry, and Applied Mathematics. The scholarships shall be subject in all respects to conditions heretofore existing.

On motion the Board adjourned sine die.

Kent which was this day presented to the Board by Mr H. T. Kent in behalf of Mrs Kent, which bond is in the words and figures following, to wit:
