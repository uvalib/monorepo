Library Fund

$ 456.00

New appropriation

$1275.00

The Board met in pursuance of adjournment on the 5th inst. and notice thereof to the Visitors.

Present. The Rector and Messrs Kean, McCabe, T. S. Martin and Gordon, of the Visitors.

The following was adopted:

Whereas there seems some doubt in the mind of the Proctor as to whether the annual interest on the "Library Fund", amounting to $456. was meant to be included in the appropriation of $1275.00 for the purchase of books & periodicals, made at the meeting of the Board Decr 15th 1893, therefore

Resolved that the Proctor be & is hereby advised that it was the meaning & purpose of the Board to include the interest from the "Library Fund" in said appropriation, viz=

At this stage of the proceedings Visitor, Patteson appeared and took his seat at the Board.

Resolved that the resolution adopted by the Board of Visitors on the 30th of October 1891 (page 291 \[251\] of the Record), to the effect that the principal of sums of money donated to the University should be kept intact, and if used should be restored by a sinking fund for that purpose be, and the same is hereby repealed. the Board finding that the said sinking fund will be a charge upon the General resources of the University, greater than can be borne without serious interference with other indispensable objects.

The motion to reconsider the action of the Board at its meeting on the 15th of Decr 1893, in regard to the State Hospital, action upon which was postponed, was called up and considered, & thereupon the following resolutions were unanimously adopted:

Resolved, 1st That, the resolution adopted by the Board of Visitors at the meeting held on the 15th of December 1893 in regard to the establishment of a State Hospital at the University of Virginia be reconsidered.

The whole question being presented anew the Board on motion of Mr McCabe=

Resolved 1st that the Rector of the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia be, & is hereby, empowered to make a formal offer to the Legislature, or other, proper authorities, to appropriate the sum of $25,000.00 out of the "Fayerweather Bequest" for the purpose of building & equipping a hospital, to be located in the grounds of the University of Virginia, provided that the State of Virginia shall by law adopt the said hospital as a State Hospital & appropriate annually a sum not less than $10,00000 for the maintenance of said hospital; in consideration of which a certain number of patients, not exceeding 40 at any one time, shall receive Medical treatment & proper maintenance, free of hospital charges.

Resolved 2d, that, shall the Legislature of Virginia see fit to appropriate annually $10,000.00 for the maintenance of said hospital, then & in that case, the sum of $25,00000 out of the "Fayerweather Bequest" is hereby appropriated for the purpose of building & equipping the aforesaid hospital. The free patients in the hospital are to be apportioned in accordance with rules to be established by the Legislature.

On motion the following matters were referred to the Executive Committee of the Board for its action: viz,

1. Petition of the Dawson Investment Co. to be allowed to lay water pipes through a portion of the University grounds.

2. The condition of the floor of the Public Hall as regards safety.

3. The application of Profr John B. Minor for the erection of a water closet at the Pavilion occupied by him.
