The regular annual meeting of the Rector and Visitors was held on this date at 8:00 o'clock in the evening, with the following members present: The Rector, Armistead C. Gordon, and Messrs. Norton, Michie, Craddock, Lewis, Hatton, Irvine, White and Stearnes, and President Alderman.

Upon the recommendation of President Alderman, Associate Professor L. G. Hoxton was promoted to Full Professor of Physics, and his salary fixed at $2,750. to begin September 15th, 1916.

Upon the recommendation of President Alderman, the following professors were elected:

* Jno. L. Manahan, Professor of Education, at a salary of $2,750.00
* Robert Bennett Bean, M. D., Professor of Anatomy, at salary of $3,000.00

The application of Adjunct Professor Jas. S. McLemore for a leave of absence for one year to pursue his studies at Harvard, having the approval of Prof. Robert H. Webb and President Alderman, was granted.

The President brought to the attention of the Board a communication from the Charlottesville Chamber of Commerce, asking that the University join with the City and County in the publication of a booklet setting forth the advantages of this section of the state as a desirable location for those seeking residential, educational, and industrial location.

The President was authorized to use his discretion in the matter, and a sum not to exceed $150. was made available.

Upon the recommendation of the President, the request of the Dean of the Department of Engineering for the appropriation of the sum of $200. to entertain the Society for the promotion of Engineering Education, meeting here June 19 to 22nd, was granted.

The Bursar was directed to pay to J. Tinsley Coleman, Counsel for the University in the City Extension proceedings, in the Circuit Court of Albemarle, the sum of $62.76, covering his incidental expenses incurred in travelling to and from the City during said proceedings.

The following were elected to Ryan Scholarships for the session 1916-1917:

**Mr. Lawrence's election was conditioned upon his choice of the Scholarship or proposed Instructorship.**

Upon the recommendation of the Scholarship Committee of the Albemarle Chapter, D. A. R., Mr. D. Edgar Woods, Jr., was appointed holder of said scholarship for the session of 1916-17.

The following nominations for scholarships, fellowships, and assistants were confirmed:

Mr. Allan Perkins, Attorney for the University, brought to the attention of the Board the correspondence had with George Latham Fletcher of Warrenton, Va., in the matter of substitution of Mr. Walter H. Robertson as administrator and trustee of the estate of Miss Mary Amelia Smith, deceased, in the place of Thomas Smith, removed, and the following resolution was adopted:

**RESOLVED:** That the action of W. Allan Perkins, Attorney, in agreeing to the substitution of Walter H. Robertson of Warrenton, Va., as Administrator of the estate of Miss Mary Amelia Smith in the place of Colonel Thomas Smith, removed, as outlined in Mr. Perkins' letter to George Latham Fletcher of Warrenton, Va., under date of June 9, 1916, be and is hereby approved, ratified and confirmed.

It is further

**RESOLVED:** That Mr. Perkins be and is hereby instructed to take such steps as in his opinion may be proper, looking toward the proper substitution of a Trustee for the University of Virginia in the place of the said Colonel Thomas Smith, in order that any funds to which the University of Virginia may be entitled under contract of November 20, 1912, between the said University and said Thomas Smith and Frederick Waugh Smith may be properly secured to it.

Mr. Perkins' letter follows:

After receiving the information which has been given me to-day, in conference with yourself and Mr. Richards, in the matter of the substitution of administrator of the estate of Miss Mary Amelia Smith, deceased, in the place and stead of Thomas Smith, removed, I feel that the interest of the University of Virginia will be promoted by the appointment of Mr. Walter H. Robertson, in accordance with the plan which you and Mr. Richards outlined.

As attorney for the University of Virginia, therefore, I beg to request that you will take such steps as you may deem necessary to consummate this arrangement, and to have Mr. Robertson substituted as administrator, as aforesaid.

I also ask that, in the order appointing Mr. Robertson you will let it appear that he is not only appointed as administrator d. b. m., w. w. a., but that as such he shall act as trustee in the place and stead of the said Thomas Smith, under the contract between the University of Virginia, the said Thomas Smith and Frederick Waugh Smith, dated November the 20th, 1912.

The advisability of changing the regulations governing the appointments to Thomas F. Ryan Scholarships was discussed, and the following adopted:

**RESOLVED:** That a committee of three be appointed to consider the Ryan Scholarships, and report recommendations to the Board. The Rector appointed President Alderman, and Visitors Norton, and Hatton on said committee.

President Alderman announced the following gift to the Electrical Laboratory from The Sangamo Electric Company of Springfield, Ill., through Associate Prof. W. S. Rodman:

The Miller Board of Trustees reported that in accordance with the recommendation of the professor of the Miller School of Biology, it had adopted the following suggestions with reference to the appointment of the two-year Miller Scholarships and the filling of one of them for the next session by temporary appointment, and submitted same for ratification.

That the two-year scholarships are awarded, one at the end of each academic year, to the candidate intending to continue scientific work, who passes, with the highest aggregate of grades, Chemistry B-1 and Biology B-1.

That since no qualified candidate has appeared, and since the services of these men are very badly needed, Mr. B. D. Reynolds, an earnest and deserving Virginia boy, who has done excellent work this year in Zoology B-1, be appointed for the session of 1916-17, in order to tide the school over until next year.

These recommendations were approved.

The following resolution was adopted:

**RESOLVED:** That a scholarship in the Academic Department with the remission to the holder of tuition fee, be established, to be known as the "Alabama Federation of Women's Clubs Scholarship", and that this scholarship be awarded annually by the Rector and Visitors of the University on the recommendation of the Scholarship Committee of the Alabama Federation of Women's Clubs to a student from Alabama who is in need of financial assistance.

The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia desire to place on record an expression of their profound and lasting regret at the death of Richard Henry Whitehead for eleven years Professor of Anatomy and Dean of the Department of Medicine. These eleven years were transitional and formative years in the history of the ancient school of medicine in the University. They were years requiring reconstructive ability, insight into the changing nature of modern medicine, and intense devotion to medical science. In all these fields, Richard Henry Whitehead gave evidence of the possession of unusual genius and ability and the University, as a whole, and the Medical Department, as one of its units, are under lasting obligations to him for his career of achievement and service.

On motion, the Board then adjourned.
