The Board of Visitors having considered the application of the Washington Society for aid in payment of the debt incurred by said Society in the recent improvement and extension of their Hall, have reached the following conclusion- that they will direct the Proctor to pay to the Contractor the sum of $500 at the earliest practicable moment, and out of money not otherwise appropriated- Upon the express condition that the Washington Society within the next two years shall refund to the University the said amount- and that a formal acceptance of this condition must be given through the Society and its Officers, before the provision of this loan shall become binding.

Resolved- That the Board of Visitors cannot refrain from an expression of their high gratification at the success which has attended the inauguration of the New Schools of Analytical & Industrial Chemistry and Applied Mathematics. The construction, equipment and arrangement of the Laboratory give an earnest of the usefulness and important advantages which must result from the progress and full development of this School- Whilst the specimens of Drawing in Prof. Boeck's Department are really remarkable in view of the short time, imperfect appliances, & other difficulties with which the students have been forced to contend.

Resolved that the School of Prof. Mallet shall hereafter be entitled the School of Analytical & Agricultural Chemistry.

Resolved that the Professor of Analytical and Agricultural Chemistry be and he is hereby authorized to grant Certificates of Proficiency in the class of Industrial Chemistry, and that such a Certificate shall be sufficient in obtaining the Degreee of Civil Engineer.

Resolved that another Degree is hereby established to be entitled the "Baccalaureate of Letters" (corresponding to the Degree of Bachelor of Science). This Degree of L.B. shall be given to such students as shall have graduated in the Schools of Ancient & Modern Languages, Moral Philosophy, History & Literature, and it is further ordered that this Degree shall be conferred on any student who may have met the requirements during the current or preceeding Session.

Resolved, that the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia beg leave to express their deep interest in the proposed Physical Survey of the State, and will avail themselves of the earliest opportunity to take into consideration the propriety of cooperating with the Faculty of Washington College in this great work which promises such rich results to Virginia.

The Committee on Public Grounds and Buildings hereby report that they have made a general inspection of the repairs made since the last meeting of the Board, and find that sundry valuable and important improvements have been made. The roofing of the Rotunda was a necessary indeed an indispensable work, and the repairs to other buildings were timely as well as essential- It is deemed necessary that the steps leading to the Lecture Room of Professor Harrison, be put in order at once. They are in a delapidated condition and difficult of ascent or descent.

Upon the whole the Ground & Buildings of the University are in an improved condition- Some of the Brick inclosures require repairs, but this can be easily effected by the energy and attention of the Proctor.

On motion- Resolved that the foregoing report be accepted and approved.
