In all its history there has been no officer of this institution possessing finer qualities of mind and heart than those constantly shown in the life of Colonel Carter; and none more able and conscientious in the discharge of every duty. As Col. Carter's active career now closes—a long and honorable career as soldier and citizen, crowned by a decade of most faithful work in the Proctorship—the Board respectfully assures him of its hearty commendation and thanks, and of its earnest hope that a large measure of health and happiness may attend his declining years.

Dr. W. G. Christian having presented his resignation as Professor of Anatomy and Surgery,—

On motion, the Resignation is accepted with regrets, and the Board expresses its high appreciation of the ability of Dr. Christian, and of the services he has rendered the University in his department.

The resignation of Augustus H. Buckmaster, M. D., Professor of Gynecology, Obstetrics, Surgical Diseases, and Abdominal Surgery, has been received by the Board, coupled with a request that it be allowed to take effect on the 15th day of November next. The said resignation is accepted, and the Board here places on record its sense of regret at the severance of the connection of Dr. Buckmaster with the University, and will comply with his request as above expressed, if it be found practicable to do so.

Resolved:- That, in accordance with the recommendation of the Director of the Observatory, transmitted by the President of the University, George F. Paddock, F. W. Reed, and Charles P. Olivier be appointed Fellows in Astronomy for the year 19051906.

Resolved:- That the application of the Montebello Land Co. for leave to place a water-pipe through the University lands to connect with the City water main, be referred to the Superintendent of Grounds and Buildings, with power to act, taking care to protect the interests of the University in case he sees proper to grant the request.

Resolved:- That the Board of Visitors have been greatly pleased with the quarters they have been permitted to occupy in the New "Y.M.C.A." Building; and that the thanks of the body are hereby tendered to the Rev. Mr. McIlhany, General Secretary, for the kind accommodation.

In pursuance of a former resolution passed on April 13th, 1905, Judge A. W. Wallace, Chairman of the Finance Committee, submitted as his report, the following letter:-

I have your favor of June 3 enclosing copy of action of the Board of Visitors of the University relative to sales of real estate held by the Trustees under the will of Arthur W. Austin, and inquiring what action, if any, the Trustees have taken relative to sales of real estate.

We have succeeded in disposing of all the real estate in the City of Chelsea, as follows:-

62 Fifth St. was sold in November for $2,000., the purchaser paying $500. cash and giving a mortgage for $1,500. on which $100 has since been paid, reducing the mortgage to $1,400.

60 Fifth St. was sold in December for $2,000., the purchaser paying $400. cash and giving a mortgage for $1,600, on which $100 has since been paid, reducing the mortgage to $1,500.

24-28 Second St. was sold in April for $2,750., the purchaser paying $250. cash and giving a mortgage for $2,500.

There seems no immediate prospect of effecting a satisfactory sale of any of the other real estate at present. I think, however, the disposal of the Chelsea real estate has relieved us of the most undesirable property of this kind.

In pursuance of a foregoing resolution, the following agreement is here recorded;—

Know all men by these presents: that we, Charles P. Jones, Daniel Harmon, A. W. Wallace, R. Walton Moore, Eppa Hunton, Jr., B. F. Buchanan, Carter Glass, H. H. Downing and William Henry White being all the individual members of the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia, are jointly held and bound unto the Fidelity Savings and Trust Company of Charlottesville, Virginia, in the sum of eleven thousand Dollars, to the payment whereof we bind ourselves, our heirs and personal representatives.

Witness our hands and seals this 12th day of June 1905.

The conditions of the above obligation is such, that whereas on the 13th day of April, 1905, at the University of Virginia, a meeting of the Board of Visitors of the University was held, and the following order was entered, to-wit:-

"Whereas it appears from the report of the Proctor, that there will be a deficit in the current expenses for the year, for which it is necessary to make immediate provision, and

Whereas a doubt has been raised as to the authority of this Board under the law to borrow money for the purpose of meeting such deficit, it is agreed that the individual members of this Board will execute such contract as may be required, to be spread upon records of this Board, binding themselves jointly for the payment of such sum not exceeding $11,000.00, as may be required from time to time, to meet such deficit on the credit of which the Proctor, with the approval of the Executive Committee, is directed to borrow the funds to the limit above mentioned necessary to meet immediate requirements, and the Proctor is directed to repay the amounts borrowed, out of the current income of the University as the same comes into his hands." and,

Whereas an agreement has been made between the Proctor of the University, with the approval of the Executive Committee of the Board of Visitors, and the said Fidelity Savings and Trust Company, of Charlottesville, Va., for the loan by the said Company to the said Proctor, at the rate of three per cent per annum on such sums not exceeding eleven thousand dollars ($11,000.00) in the aggregate, as may be required from time to time to meet any deficit in the current expenses of the University for this fiscal year, said loan or loans to be evidenced by negotiable notes payable on or before October 15th, 1905, to be paid by the Proctor out of the current income of the University as the as the same comes into his hands, such sum so furnished to be credited (by credits on said notes) by the said Fidelity Savings and Trust Company with any deposits made at any time by said Proctor and no notes for such sums or any part thereof to be renewable after the fifteenth day of October, 1905,

Now, therefore, if the said Fidelity Savings and Trust Company is paid such sums above specified and evidenced, with interest at the rate of three per cent per annum until paid, then this obligation to be void otherwise to remain in full force.

(Signed) By Thos. H. Carter, Proctor

The following Report, submitted by the Proctor, was read by Mr. Harmon,—and is hereby made a part of this permanent Record,-

Office of Proctor, University of Virginia, June 12th, 1905.

To the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia.

Gentlemen:

I have the honor to submit to you the financial account of the University for the session 1904-1905, which is handed you with the preliminary statement of expenses and receipts to the end of our fiscal year, June 30th, 1905. It shows our income largely overdrawn; this Deficit being temporarily provided for under an arrangement with the "Fidelity Savings & Trust Co." of Charlottesville, Va., as authorized by a Resolution of the Board, April 13th, 1905.

The attendance of students for the session now closing is the largest in its history: viz. 705 as compared with 680 in 1900-'01.

Of the 705 students in attendance this session, 199 are Virginians, who took academic studies and are exempt from payment of tuition fees. Some of this number are professional students who took academic studies in addition to a part of a professional ticket. The whole number of Virginians, Academic and Professional, this session was 370.

The classes for the session now closing are as follows:

The excess over 705, the total number of students, is accounted for by the fact that some students took part professional and part academic tickets, and are counted twice in that way.

Although the number of matriculates has increased, the receipts from them at a per capita of less than one hundred dollars are smaller than the receipts from 660 students last year. This is due to a very large number of scholarships not paying at all, or paying little; to large deferred payments in the session on promissory notes, for one, two, three, four, and five years, and also to refunds.

The catalogue of 1903-4, page 148 states: "All tuition fees, University fees, the contingent deposits, rents of the University Buildings, and charges for service in the same, are payable upon entrance. Under special conditions, the Chairman is authorized to allow credit; but these deferred payments are in all cases to be properly secured."

The salaries of all teachers per annum amount to $83,400. and including the expense of the maintenance of the houses of those furnished with them, make over $7,000 per month. The books are balanced daily, and overlooked monthly by the Commissioner of Accounts, and vouchers found for all expenditures, and receipts accounted for.

We have now in the hands of the Virginia Trust Company, Richmond, Va., for account of the Sinking Fund to meet the bonds of the old debt of $69,500. maturing October 15th, 1905, the following securities:

This debt of $69,500 will be settled by the 15th, of October, 1905. The bonds that we hold are now selling at 97 3/8; should they go to 98 1/2 by that time, they will clear the whole debt; if not, arrangements can be made either with the Miller Board or with Prof. Stone, so that the remnant unsettled in full can be continued at 6%, now holding. The debt of $200,000. on the University property, can be lowered next year from 5% to 4%, making $8,000. a year instead of $10,000. Interest; and we even hope to get relief from this amount entirely, by the Legislature the coming winter. When this debt is taken up, it will relieve us of an annual payment of $7,200, for Interest and Sinking Fund, which we have carried from 1874 to date.

The appropriation of $31,000. received from the State, from special appropriation by the Legislature, has been expended in the erection of a new wing to the Hospital. There has also been expended an additional sum of $2,800. appropriated from the current Receipts of the University. The Chairman of the Building Committee reports that there is still due to the Contractors and Architects a balance of $2,203.25, for payment of which some provision should be made by the Board.

It is hoped at the coming session of the Legislature to get the $35,000 for the other wing of the Hospital, which will complete the whole as originally designed, and will give us a central Hospital of such proportions as will supply the needs of this University, and of this whole section of country.

I am much gratified to state that our President, Dr. E. A. Alderman, has succeeded in getting to date $228,000. Should we get $500,000. for this "Thomas Jefferson Memorial Endowment Fund," the Carnegie gift of another half million will fall into our hands; but if not, Mr. Carnegie has promised to give us dollar for dollar of the amount we obtain of the present half million.

We are in receipt December 12th, from the Fayerweather Fund of $4,600 net, which has been used in current expenses. We are advised by Mr. James L. Bishop, counsel for the Colleges, under date of May 2nd, that the Trustees are anxious to close their trust as far as possible, and make distribution of the balance of the Fund before the Commencements in June. We hope, therefore, to receive another payment on this account at an early date.

We are informed by Mr. Lewis Cass Ledyard, Executor of Hon. James C. Carter, that he gave a legacy of $10,000 to the University of Virginia without restriction of the gift. The will has not been admitted to probate. Legally the legacy is not payable for a year, unless the persons entitled to the residuary estate should consent to its being paid before that time. Mr. Ledyard states that one of the residuary legatees may be found incapable of giving such consent, as he is informed that she is in a retreat.

The Austin Fund yielding $9,212 last year, has given us only $7,898.26 this year. Check for this amount being received from Mr. Bentley W. Warren, Trustee, on April 15th, 1905.

I recommend that some arrangement be made with the City whereby the sewerage lines from West Lawn and West Range shall connect with the City's system near "Madison Hall." This would probably prove a solution of the present difficulty, and avoid further litigation with Mr. Eugene Massie, who holds some claim against the University of this account.

Granolithic Walks North of Rotunda, 1024 yards, can be finished at $1.00 a yard. I recommend that it be done at once, both for economy and for appearance. Afterwards the walks South of the Rotunda, extending from residence of Prof. Lile on East Lawn, around the Quadrangle to the residence of Prof. Fitz-Hugh on West Lawn, about 1320 yards, should follow. The walks were begun in 1895, two years before I entered upon my duties here, and were laid around the Lawn, only to Prof. Lile's and to Prof. Fitz-Hugh's, and Ranges, and from the Rotunda to the Post-Office. They should be continued to Monroe Hill and Dawson's Row, and to the Hospital, and elsewhere, regularly, until fully completed.

The University has the reputation of being the most beautiful College in the world, in its grouping of architecture, grounds and scenery, and is visited by many persons in the summer months particularly, and all the year in the intervals of trains passing.

The report of the Committee of the City Council, on Increasing Water Supply, January 25th, 1905, including a Report to that Committee by Mr. Rudolph Herring, and also a letter of Mr. George Perkins to the President, which has been referred to me by President Alderman, are herewith handed to you.

It seems to be the consensus of opinion that the Dam erected at Mayo's Rock, 2385 feet below the dam now used by Reservoir on Ragged Mountain, will give temporary relief, but many believe Moorman's River will ultimately have to be brought over in a pipe 15 miles long, in a few years, to furnish an increased supply. Mr. George Perkins will appear before the Board to explain position of City, and Mr. John B. Moon will show contract now existing between City and University in regard to same.

Under authority given by the Board, a students' boarding department was conducted on Carr's Hill until May 1st, when, in view of greatly increasing loss, it was deemed best that it be discontinued. The experiment has proved a signal failure, and has added to our already large deficit a sum of not less that $750.00

Mr. I. K. Moran has been the Clerk of the Proctor. I recommend that he be the Treasurer of the University, and report directly to the President. He entered the service with me, May 1st, 1897, and has been with me since that time—a more efficient and untiring officer in his duties, I have never known. I recommend that he be given $1,500 for his services as Treasurer, and that his daughter be given $300 a year for her services. He must have assistance in Matriculating students, and attending to the increased duties.

He is prepared to give Bond in the sum of $25,000.00 with the "Virginia Trust Co." of Richmond, Va. as surety. The expense of this should be borne by the University, as has been the custom with regard to the Proctor's Bond.

The Farm and Grounds are now under the management of Mr. J. R. Wood, who has been for two years the Manager of Teams, coal, grounds, taking off garbage, and is empowered by Judge John M. White for the performance of Police Duties, with instructions in that line. Since the war, I have not known a more efficient and active man in his department.

He receives $600. and lives in his own house. The house formerly occupied by his predecessor, is on Carr's Hill, and is rented for $100 a year, making his office a cost of $500. I ask the attention of the Board to the grounds, and farm and the coal service.

I ask that the house in which I have lived be given to Mr. and Mrs. Raleigh Minor. They have long wished and asked for a house on the Lawn, and stand first and rightly on the list of applicants. The father of each of the applicants, John B. Minor and Chas. S. Venable, is among the greatest men who have ever lived to give lustre to this University in all its history. I trust that it may be granted.

The remarkable report is in circulation that the office of Proctor and Superintendent of Grounds & Buildings will be abolished, and that the offices heretofore under him will report directly to the President.

The Board of Visitors are respectfully referred to the duties of this office of Proctor & Sup't., less the duties of Secretary, as described in "Laws of the University of Va., 1900, covering 10 pages, copies of which are on your table. The Buildings, Grounds, and Farm of 480 acres are assumed to represent from one million to a million and a half dollars. The improvements of 1895-'7 after the fire cost $440,000. The President is frequently away, and if present, cannot possibly attend to the details of any Office other than his own. No company in any army of from 50 to 100 men is without a Head. This Office has been in existence in some form since the establishment of the University of Virginia. Its value depends upon a good head. The fable tells us, "Better a herd of Deer led by a Lion than a herd of Lion led by a Deer." The Proctor & Superintendent of Grounds & Buildings can report directly to the President, and keep him informed as to its condition. It need not cost as much as it cost when embracing the Secretaryship, which I have recommended above to report to the President. In the matter of Coal alone, which represented last year 2415 tons of coal and requires the closest attention to keep within the bounds of Expense. This office is important.

The President's Financial Statement was received and considered; after which, the following was adopted,- Be it Resolved:- That the amounts hereinafter set out are hereby appropriated for the purposes specified, out of the following Estimate of Receipts and Expenditures, for the Session 1905-1906.

On motion the Board adjourned to meet at the call of the Rector.

Present: The Rector, and Visitors Downing, Wallace, White, Buchanan, Harmon, Hunton, and Moore.

The Board was called to order at 10:30 A. M., by the Rector; and President Alderman being present submitted his first annual Report. After the reading of this Report, that of the Proctor was also presented for consideration, when the following resolutions were adopted,—

Whereas the debt of $69,500 will mature on October 15th, 1905,

Resolved:- That the Finance Committee be directed to dispose of the securities of the Sinking Fund applicable to this debt, and pay off the debt and make report in writing to the next meeting of this Board. The said Sinking Fund securities consist of $68,800 par value Virginia Centuries, and $2,000 par value Georgia Pacific Bonds.

Resolved:- That the communication from the City Attorney of Charlottesville on the subject of the Water Supply of the University, be and the same is referred to the Executive Committee, with power to investigate the whole subject in conjunction with the Attorney of the Board, and submit their report with such recommendations as they may see fit to make to a subsequent meeting of this Board.

Resolved:- That Section (138) 132 of the Laws of the University, be and the same is hereby repealed and re-enacted so as to read as follows: "No one shall be allowed to matriculate as student except upon payment of the general charges prescribed by the enactments, (save in the cases provided for by section 95) and credit shall not be given students for Tuition fees beyond May 1st of each year; and such credit for that period shall take the form of a note or notes, satisfactorily endorsed, and provided further that any special cases which may appeal to the President may be arranged by him subject to the approval of the Board of Visitors."

Resolved: That the house on the Lawn, now occupied by Col. Carter be assigned to Prof. Raleigh C. Minor.

Resolved: That in the place of Dr. W. J. Humphreys, whose resignation is regretfully accepted, the Executive Committee, acting in conjunction with President Alderman, is authorized to engage the services of a competent instructor at an annual salary not exceeding $1,000. to assist Prof. Smith in the School of Physics.

Resolved:- That President Alderman is authorized to ascertain from the Trustees of the John B. Cary fund whether it is possible that the same can be turned over to the University upon condition that its income shall be applied to maintaining an Adjunct Professorship, for instruction in the history, literature, and interpretation of the Bible, upon a non-sectarian basis.

Resolved:- That a School to be known as the "Curry Memorial School of Education," be and the same is hereby established. And it appearing to the Board that legal notice has been published, it is further

Resolved:- That the Finance Committee is hereby authorized to receive the sum of $100,000, which Mr. Rockefeller has generously donated to the University, and to invest the same if possible at 5%, and are hereby given discretion to invest said sum through Messrs. Spencer Trask & Co. of New York, if they see fit so to do.

Resolved:- That the gift of Mr. Rouss of three thousand dollars per annum for a period of three years, of which the Board has been notified, be used to establish and maintain two adjunct professorships in the Engineering Department, at an annual salary of $1,500 each; one of the Professorships to be in the branch of Mechanical, and the other in the branch of Civil Engineering. To fill such professorships, on the nomination of President Alderman, Messrs. Charles N. McKergow and John L. Newcomb are now respectively elected.

Resolved:- That whereas the Bond for $11,000., executed by the individual members of the Board, pursuant to a former resolution, has been delivered to the Proctor, it is hereby directed to be spread on the minutes.

This general rule, moreover, is not to apply to Fellowships or Scholarships, to which a certain amount of teaching or other work for the University may be attached.

Resolved:- That Section 1, Chapter I of the Laws of the University is amended and re-enacted so as to read as follow:

"The Professors, Associate Professors, and Adjunct Professors, of the University, in their aggregate capacity, shall constitute, and be known as the Faculty."

All laws and parts of laws inconsistent with this resolution are repealed.

Resolved:- That President Alderman is requested to express to those mentioned in his report, who, since the first of the year, have testified their friendship to this institution by their several gifts, the Board's hearty and grateful appreciation of their generous action, which furnishes very timely assistance to the University in the prosecution of its work and the extension of its usefulness and influence.

Resolved:- That it is the sense of the Board that a meeting should be held annually in advance of the close of the Session, and preferably on the 12th of April of each year (except that it shall be on the 11th of April when the 12th falls on Sunday) for the consideration of the Budget and other matters that may be presented.

On motion the Board adjourned to meet at 9:30 A. M.

I have your favor of June 3 enclosing copy of action of the Board of Visitors of the University relative to sales of real estate held by the Trustees under the will of Arthur W. Austin, and inquiring what action, if any, the Trustees have taken relative to sales of real estate.

We have succeeded in disposing of all the real estate in the City of Chelsea, as follows:-

62 Fifth St. was sold in November for $2,000., the purchaser paying $500. cash and giving a mortgage for $1,500. on which $100 has since been paid, reducing the mortgage to $1,400.

60 Fifth St. was sold in December for $2,000., the purchaser paying $400. cash and giving a mortgage for $1,600, on which $100 has since been paid, reducing the mortgage to $1,500.

24-28 Second St. was sold in April for $2,750., the purchaser paying $250. cash and giving a mortgage for $2,500.

There seems no immediate prospect of effecting a satisfactory sale of any of the other real estate at present. I think, however, the disposal of the Chelsea real estate has relieved us of the most undesirable property of this kind.

"Whereas it appears from the report of the Proctor, that there will be a deficit in the current expenses for the year, for which it is necessary to make immediate provision, and

Whereas a doubt has been raised as to the authority of this Board under the law to borrow money for the purpose of meeting such deficit, it is agreed that the individual members of this Board will execute such contract as may be required, to be spread upon records of this Board, binding themselves jointly for the payment of such sum not exceeding $11,000.00, as may be required from time to time, to meet such deficit on the credit of which the Proctor, with the approval of the Executive Committee, is directed to borrow the funds to the limit above mentioned necessary to meet immediate requirements, and the Proctor is directed to repay the amounts borrowed, out of the current income of the University as the same comes into his hands." and,

Whereas an agreement has been made between the Proctor of the University, with the approval of the Executive Committee of the Board of Visitors, and the said Fidelity Savings and Trust Company, of Charlottesville, Va., for the loan by the said Company to the said Proctor, at the rate of three per cent per annum on such sums not exceeding eleven thousand dollars ($11,000.00) in the aggregate, as may be required from time to time to meet any deficit in the current expenses of the University for this fiscal year, said loan or loans to be evidenced by negotiable notes payable on or before October 15th, 1905, to be paid by the Proctor out of the current income of the University as the as the same comes into his hands, such sum so furnished to be credited (by credits on said notes) by the said Fidelity Savings and Trust Company with any deposits made at any time by said Proctor and no notes for such sums or any part thereof to be renewable after the fifteenth day of October, 1905,

Now, therefore, if the said Fidelity Savings and Trust Company is paid such sums above specified and evidenced, with interest at the rate of three per cent per annum until paid, then this obligation to be void otherwise to remain in full force.

On motion the Board adjourned to meet at 9:30 A. M.

I have your favor of June 3 enclosing copy of action of the Board of Visitors of the University relative to sales of real estate held by the Trustees under the will of Arthur W. Austin, and inquiring what action, if any, the Trustees have taken relative to sales of real estate.

We have succeeded in disposing of all the real estate in the City of Chelsea, as follows:-

62 Fifth St. was sold in November for $2,000., the purchaser paying $500. cash and giving a mortgage for $1,500. on which $100 has since been paid, reducing the mortgage to $1,400.

60 Fifth St. was sold in December for $2,000., the purchaser paying $400. cash and giving a mortgage for $1,600, on which $100 has since been paid, reducing the mortgage to $1,500.

24-28 Second St. was sold in April for $2,750., the purchaser paying $250. cash and giving a mortgage for $2,500.

There seems no immediate prospect of effecting a satisfactory sale of any of the other real estate at present. I think, however, the disposal of the Chelsea real estate has relieved us of the most undesirable property of this kind.

"Whereas it appears from the report of the Proctor, that there will be a deficit in the current expenses for the year, for which it is necessary to make immediate provision, and

Whereas a doubt has been raised as to the authority of this Board under the law to borrow money for the purpose of meeting such deficit, it is agreed that the individual members of this Board will execute such contract as may be required, to be spread upon records of this Board, binding themselves jointly for the payment of such sum not exceeding $11,000.00, as may be required from time to time, to meet such deficit on the credit of which the Proctor, with the approval of the Executive Committee, is directed to borrow the funds to the limit above mentioned necessary to meet immediate requirements, and the Proctor is directed to repay the amounts borrowed, out of the current income of the University as the same comes into his hands." and,

Whereas an agreement has been made between the Proctor of the University, with the approval of the Executive Committee of the Board of Visitors, and the said Fidelity Savings and Trust Company, of Charlottesville, Va., for the loan by the said Company to the said Proctor, at the rate of three per cent per annum on such sums not exceeding eleven thousand dollars ($11,000.00) in the aggregate, as may be required from time to time to meet any deficit in the current expenses of the University for this fiscal year, said loan or loans to be evidenced by negotiable notes payable on or before October 15th, 1905, to be paid by the Proctor out of the current income of the University as the as the same comes into his hands, such sum so furnished to be credited (by credits on said notes) by the said Fidelity Savings and Trust Company with any deposits made at any time by said Proctor and no notes for such sums or any part thereof to be renewable after the fifteenth day of October, 1905,

Now, therefore, if the said Fidelity Savings and Trust Company is paid such sums above specified and evidenced, with interest at the rate of three per cent per annum until paid, then this obligation to be void otherwise to remain in full force.
