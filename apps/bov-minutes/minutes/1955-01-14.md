Black; President Colgate W. Darden, Jr., Visitors Barksdale, Coxe, Dunn, Emmett, Gray, Howard, McWane, Mears, Mrs. Smith, Mr. Smith, Talbott, and Wheeler. Absent: Visitor Gravatt.

The minutes of the December meetings, previously distributed, were approved.

The President announced receipt of the following gifts and grants:

The following resolution was adopted by the Board:

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the resignation of Mr. Edward R. Estes, Jr., Assistant Professor of Applied Mathematics, be and it is hereby accepted as of the end of the first semester of the session of 1954-55.

We wish for him the highest success in his new undertaking.

The following resolution was adopted by the Board:

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the following persons be and they are hereby elected to the faculty.

* Mr. Allan Mounter, as Acting Assistant Professor of Biochemistry for the present session, effective February 1, 1955, his salary of $500 a month from the School of Medicine to be effective from April 1, 1955.
* Mr. Joseph C. Rupp, as Instructor in Biochemistry in the School of Medicine, effective February 1, 1955, at an annual salary of $1,000.

* Mr. Fred C. McCormick, as Assistant Professor of Civil Engineering, effective February 1, 1955. This is a replacement for Mr. Estes.

President Darden discussed a proposal from Mr. E. R. Porter concerning the renting of his property on Jefferson Park Avenue at $6,000 a year. The Board tabled this proposal.

The President reported that, during the calendar year of 1954, the Hospital Accounts Committee was authorized by resolution of the Board of Visitors to charge off uncollectible hospital accounts totaling $226,570.76. The total charged off during the year 1953 was $322,372.82.

President Darden laid before the Board the following letter from Dr. George B. Zehmer, Director of Extension, reporting consideration and action in recent months by the undergraduate faculties of the University at Charlottesville and at Fredericksburg pursuant to the Board's Resolution of 10 September 1954, relative to proposed undergraduate work in Wise County and in Northern Virginia.

In accordance with the wishes of the Board of Visitors as expressed in a resolution adopted at its September 10th meeting and at your request, I have consulted the Faculties of the University that would be directly involved concerning the establishment under University administration of a two-year college program at Wise, Virginia. I am glad to report that the Faculties of the College and of the Schools of Education and Engineering, without a dissenting vote, adopted resolutions approving in principle the establishment under University administration of one or more University branches in which the first two years of college work would be offered under regulations approved by the Faculties. I am glad to report, also that following this favorable action by the Faculties, the question was referred to the University Senate for its consideration and that at its January 4th meeting the Senate likewise adopted a resolution approving in principle the establishment of one or more branches under the provision specified by the faculties concerned.

In the meantime, I conferred, at your suggestion, with the Faculty of Mary Washington College with particular reference to the question as to whether or not Mary Washington wished to commit itself to accepting for the last two years of college work girls who completed satisfactorily the first two years at a University of Virginia branch. The Mary Washington College Faculty adopted unanimously a resolution expressing its desire to accept such transfer students.

I will appreciate your reporting the above facts to the Board of Visitors promptly in the hope that the Board will find it possible to reconsider this question at its January meeting.

After extensive discussion in which emphasis was placed on the importance of (1) restricting to the junior college (first two years) level any undergraduate programs set up under University administration away from Charlottesville, and (2) supervision by the University in the setting of standards approved by the University faculties, the Board adopted the following resolution:

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the President be and he is hereby authorized to proceed with the organization under University administration of a two-year college program at Wise, Virginia, and with planning for the establishment of similar work in Northern Virginia, the undergraduate transfer programs both in Wise County and in Northern Virginia to be limited to the first two regular years of college work, to be subject to the standards established by the faculties resident at the University of Virginia, and to conform to the requirements set by the Southern Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools.

Mr. Gray, on behalf of the special committee on outlying real estate, read to the Board a letter from Mr. Jackson N. Huddleston, of Huntington, West Virginia, forwarding advice from two appraisers on the value of Parcel No. 20, a 90-acre tract, the last real property remaining in the William J. Humphreys Estate, and recommending that an offer of $2,650 be accepted. The Board resolved that the University's Attorney be directed to proceed with negotiations for the sale of this tract for the sum of $2,650, and to prepare the necessary papers for execution by the President.

Mr. Mears reported that his special committee had met, but would have no report to make until its present studies were completed.

In a discussion of the dinner meeting held on January 13th with representatives of the Law School, the Rector and others praised the Law Faculty for effective work in maintaining and raising standards and the effective ways in which the Law Library has been used to extend its service to lawyers elsewhere, strengthening the relationship between the University and the legal profession in Virginia.

A motion by Miss Wheeler to hold regular Board meetings only on alternate months, except upon call by the Rector, was laid on the table, pending the receipt of committee reports that might call for a February meeting.

Mr. Allan T. Gwathmey, Associate Professor of Chemistry, accompanied by Mr. B. F. D. Runk, Associate Professor of Biology appeared before the Board to make recommendations on athletic policy. Mr. Gwathmey, in an extended statement, deplored what he considered the lack of communication between Board and Faculty, and urged the Board to take the lead in encouraging amateurism in intercollegiate football among the institutions in the Virginia area and in the Atlantic Coast Conference.

Under questioning by the Rector and others, Mr. Gwathmey said that he favored the continuance of intercollegiate football and that his proposal was the same as the one already undertaken as the result of the Board's conference with the University Senate's Committee on November 11th.

Mr. Runk, who also favored the continuation of intercollegiate football, made a brief statement in which he pointed to the danger of overemphasis on athletics and to the poor communication between Board and Faculty, in particular to the failure by the College Faculty to be fully informed of Board decisions and policy.

The prepared statements brought in by Mr. Gwathmey and Mr. Runk were ordered to be filed with the Secretary.

Mrs. Smith reported on a meeting of the Buildings and Grounds Committee held in the Rotunda on January 13th to discuss proposals by Professor Frederick D. Nichols for a study of the possibility of remodelling the interior of the Rotunda so as to correct the alterations made by Stanford White and restore the interior as it was from the time Jefferson built it until the fire of 1895.

Displaying Jefferson's original drawings and working notes for the Rotunda, Mrs. Smith pointed out that the reestablishment of the three oval rooms on the main floor would make the Rotunda again a center of the University by providing suitable spaces for the President's office, the Board, which will be too large for the present room after February, could also resume its nineteenth century practice of meeting in the Rotunda. Mrs. Smith noted that the Dome Room, restored to the symmetrical proportions that made it famous for its beauty among nineteenth century travelers, might be used as a museum of University history, and also for social occasions as was so often the case in the past, beginning with the dinner given for Lafayette in 1824.

After a discussion, it was agreed that the Virginia Fine Arts Commission be consulted and that Jefferson's drawings for the Rotunda interior be exhibited to Alumni through publication in the Alumni News.

The Board resolved that its next meeting should be held on Saturday, February 12th at 10:00 a.m.

President Darden laid before the Board letters of January 6th from Dean Charles C. Abbott and of January 11th from Dean Abbott and Dr. Lorin A. Thompson making recommendations regarding the curriculum, organization and name of the McIntire Undergraduate School of Business.

After discussion, the Board resolved that the school be designated the McIntire Undergraduate School of Commerce, its head to have the title of Director.

The President laid before the Board the following schedule of fees for the 1955 summer session.

Special fees for certain courses as announced in the summer session catalogue:

A Diploma fee of $5.00 must be paid by all degree applicants who were not registered in the preceding regular session of the University. This is payable at the beginning of the summer session at the end of which the degree is to be conferred. It is not returnable.

The Board resolved that the foregoing schedule be approved and adopted.

The Board resolved further that a special additional fee of forty dollars ($40.00) per course be charged to students in courses in Applied Music.

The President read to the Board a letter of January 13th from Mr. William H. White, Jr., with an enclosed copy of the will of the late Ida Ellis White (Mrs. Landon White) and a memorandum of certain personal properties in Mrs. White's estate. Mr. White's letter reported an appraised value of $279,829.55 for the total estate, of which the University of Virginia is one of four residuary legatees, and requested that the University join in the permission, already given by the other three residuary legatees, for the delivery to certain close friends and kinsmen of several personal items of sentimental interest from the residuary estate.

The Board resolved that the matter of the personal items be referred to the President and to the University's Special Counsel with authority to act at their discretion.

The Board adopted the following resolution:

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that Dr. Kurt F. Leidecker, Assistant Professor of Philosophy at Mary Washington College, be and he is hereby granted leave of absence without pay for the second semester of the session of 1954-55 in order to undertake an assignment in Germany.

The following resolution was adopted by the Board:

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that Mr. Lewis Allen Foster, Jr. be and he is hereby elected as Instructor in Philosophy at Mary Washington College for the second semester of the session of 1954-55, at a salary of $1,710 for this period. This is a temporary replacement for Dr. Leidecker, who will be on leave.

There was a general discussion of the affairs of the College, but the Chairman reported that the Committee on the College would have no report to make until a later meeting of the Board.

On motion, the meeting was adjourned at 1:30 p.m.
