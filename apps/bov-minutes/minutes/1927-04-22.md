Report of the Faculty Committee on educational program for the Blandy Experimental Farm was presented, read and approved, as follows:

After due deliberation and careful study, supplemented by a personal interview with several agricultural experts at V. P. I., the committee on "Blandy Experimental Farm" is of the opinion that the tentative educational program submitted below is practical, and furthermore, that it will (1) comply with the will of the donor, (2) be a service to the people of the State, and (3) will not conflict with the work which is now being done at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute. In light of these facts then, the following recommendations are made:

1. The appointment of a professor of Agricultural Biology who will also be director of the Blandy Experimental Farm. During the fall and winter terms this man should give courses at the University of Virginia. During the spring and summer months he should reside at the farm and direct the educational work given under the auspices of the school, supervise the investigations conducted by the students and undertake such research work as time and opportunity permit.

2. The establishment of five research fellowships, two carrying an annual stipend of $1,000.00 each, and three with stipends of $500.00 each, all of them including the remission of University fees. These fellowships should be open only to the holders of baccalaureate degrees in agriculture or biology and conferred on the basis of merit. All fellows are to be appointed annually and are eligible for reappointment. The holder of one of these fellowships would be expected to give approximately one hundred hours of his time per year to assisting with imparting information pertaining to agriculture or horticulture to the people of the state, particularly to the people in the immediate vicinity of the farm. Such work would comprise talks, demonstrations, exhibits, compilation of data to be used for the farmer's benefit and other similar things. It should be emphasized, however, that these are primarily research fellowships.

3. Appointment of an advisory council consisting of from five to seven local people, the director and manager of the Blandy Experimental Farm being members ex officio. These people could gather at regular or called meetings and discuss affairs relating to the local usefulness of this unit.

As to the instructional work, it is believed that efforts along this line should be in two directions:

1. The director and fellows, working in conjunction with state and federal agriculturalists, and in so far as practical, cooperating with the agricultural units at the Boyce and Berryville High School, at Boyce, and the Handley High School at Winchester, shall organize such courses of instruction as are practical and will be beneficial to the people of that vicinity. It appears that the most feasible plan for the present will be to organize several intensive short-courses of about five days duration. From five to six such courses could be given each year. The subjects to be discussed and the time the courses are to be given could be determined by the advisory council. In this way the staff would, for part of their time, actually "teach boys farming in its various branches, including fruit raising".

2. Fellows, or others desiring to take work in this field, should register in the department of graduate studies, at the University of Virginia, and take courses leading to graduate degrees in agriculture and biology. Courses of particular value in this connection would be: Genetics, Plant Physiology, Forestry, Entomology, Chemistry of Soils, Bacteriology, Economic Geology, Plant Pathology and Morphology, and Biometry. Some of these courses are already provided and most of the others could be arranged for without additional expenditures. The fellows would be expected to confine their class work to the fall and winter terms, moving to the farm in the spring with the director to begin, or to continue, their research, and also to assume their duties in helping to carry out the local educational program. Their work on the farm would continue through the spring and summer months. While there, they could be adequately housed in the ten-room brick building (Exhibit A). The second floor rooms of this building could be used as dormitories, while the rooms on the first floor could be converted into laboratories. No rent is to be charged for the rooms, but the students will have to pay for their meals. This may be a difficult proposition, but it is believed that satisfactory arrangements can be made.

Aside from the real need of a school in the state where advanced training in agriculture may be obtained, the importance of research and its relation to farming problems cannot be over-emphasized. Agriculture is the backbone of stable government and its efficiency has been increased by the application of scientific methods. In this manner insect pests have been combated, increased yields have been produced and the peoples of the world have been fed with less and less effort. To train men to do efficient research is the best method of dignifying and making profitable agriculture as a basic industry, and would, in this case, supplement and give point to the actual instruction provided for in the previous paragraph.

Estimates for cost of operation according to the plan herein set forth are:

The Professor in charge is to be furnished a house on the farm, rent free (Exhibit B).

I beg to advise that, pursuant to instructions given me at the March 1st meeting of the Board, I called on Bentley W. Warren and Irvin McD. Garfield, trustees of the Estate of Arthur W. Austin, on April 11th and received from them the corpus of the estate consisting of the following:

(See journal of Bursar p. 288)

Also a check for $7,157.33 representing the balance of the income in their hands as of April 12th, 1927, the date on which the settlement was completed.

The cash and securities belonging to the corpus of the estate have been deposited with the Peoples National Bank as custodian, in accordance with the directions of the Board, and a complete list of same furnished to the Chairman of the Finance Committee. The check representing the accumulated income has been placed to the credit of the income account of the estate on the books of the Bursar.

While in Boston, in compliance with your instruction, I made inquiry of Mr. Warren with respect to the request of Mrs. Mary A. McLaughlin that the University pay off the lien of $18,000 placed upon store and apartment property in order to purchase a residence for herself and husband, which request was reported to you at the March 1st meeting. Mr. Warren stated that while he had no personal or written request from Mrs. McLaughlin regarding the matter, yet, he was satisfied in his own mind that the message as delivered to him by Mr. McLaughlin was the one she has requested be conveyed; that at the time of receipt of the message she was too ill to have written the request - her death coming almost immediately after the request was received by him and transmitted to the University. He further stated that he had a very high regard for the honor and integrity of Mr. McLaughlin and was fully satisfied of its authenticity.

Mr. Warren then had Mr. McLaughlin come to his office where I had a personal interview with him resulting in the following information; he is 59 years of age; Mrs. McLaughlin was in her 67th year; they owned three store rooms with apartments above in West Roxbury, valued at approximately $35,000; they are located in a district of cheap property and are without tenants some portion of the time. The net income from this property is approximately $1,000 per year. A lien was placed on this property for $18,000 to purchase the residence as their home, for which they paid $19,000. The residence is an old one containing 12 rooms in a district where property is difficult to rent, and that it now was now vacant. The property has been for sale since his wife's death but no purchaser has been found. He received about $900 from his wife's estate which would be taken up in paying her bills. Mrs. McLaughlin spent $2,500 per year for 5 years in educating a niece at Wellesley, as well as some $3,000 in educating a nephew.

Mr. McLaughlin is in the lime and cement business with a brother from which business he says he receives from $1,000 to $2,000 per year.

They had been married about 25 years, and Mr. Warren stated that Mr. McLaughlin had been a very devoted husband and a great comfort to his wife. He further stated that he wished it understood that he held no brief for Mr. McLaughlin in this matter, having transmitted the message as requested, but he felt, that if the University could see its way to make some payment to Mr. McLaughlin he thought it would be worthily bestowed.

I discussed with Mr. Warren the question of the propriety of the University's erecting a suitable marker at the grave of the deceased and he was of the opinion that it would be a gracious recognition on the part of the University of the generosity of Mrs. McLaughlin.
