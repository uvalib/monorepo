Mr. R. E. Lee Taylor was appointed to work out the plans for the room in the Alderman Library to receive the valuable collection of books belonging to Mrs. Robert Coleman Taylor.

A special committee, consisting of Goolrick, Garnett and the Rector, was appointed to study the situation with relation to existing contracts with the Clinical Staff of the Medical School, in collaboration with the President and the Dean of the Medical School.

On motion, the following was adopted:

**RESOLVED**, by the Board of Visitors of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, that approval is given to request of GRAHAM BROTHERS in a letter dated August 18, 1945, for an extension of time of completion of the NURSES HOME from August 27, 1945 to December 20, 1945.

**RESOLVED**, FURTHER, that approval of this extension of time by the Federal Works Agency be requested.

The President advised the Board that it had been necessary to grant an extension of time for completion of the Nurses' Home Addition by the contractor and to request the Bureau of Community Facilities that construction be continued to completion, and read the correspondence with the Division Engineer of the Bureau of Community Facilities in the matter, following which the following resolution was adopted:

In reply to your telegram of August 20th., relative to the allotment for the above Project, we hereby request that construction be continued to completion and certify that:

The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia agree to provide any additional funds which may be required to complete the Project beyond the Federal allotment which, for this Project, is $147,500. (See Par.(e), page 6 of Application for this Project dated 14th January 1944 - Excell Construction Cost).

Mr. Perkins, Attorney for the University, appeared before the Board and made a report upon the claim of Mamie C. Covington, now pending before the Industrial Commission of Virginia, for compensation on account of the injury and death of her husband, Castor Covington, which occurred on the 19th of May, 1945, while said Castor Covington was employed as a storeroom orderly in the University Hospital. Mr. Perkins, after making a full statement of facts in this case, briefly outlined what he considered to be the law applicable thereto and reported that counsel for said Mamie C.

Mr. Perkins further made a recommendation to the Board that he be authorized to offer $500.00 in full settlement of the claim and he requested this Board to appoint a Committee with full power to act in the premises should said offer of $500.00 be declined. After a full discussion of the whole situation, it was

**RESOLVED**, that the Attorney for the University is hereby instructed to decline the offer of counsel for Mamie C. Covington as widow of Castor Covington, deceased, to settle her claims for compensation by the payment of $1500.00, but said Attorney is hereby authorized to settle claim, if possible, for a sum not exceeding $1000.00.

On motion, it was

**RESOLVED**, that the regulations with respect to use of motor vehicles by the students of the University adopted June 9, 1943 be rescinded, and that the regulations adopted July 6, 1942, be adopted in its stead, as follows:

No first-year students in the college, engineering, or education departments shall, while the University is in session, maintain or operate a motor vehicle in the University, the City of Charlottesville or the County of Albemarle, without the written consent of the Dean of the University.

The Committee submitted the following report, and its recommendations therein were adopted:

The Committee on the Consolidation of Mary Washington College with the University of Virginia is not yet ready to present a full report. However, in order that the conversion of Mary Washington into a liberal arts college may proceed without delay during the coming biennium, we submit the following recommendations for action at this time:

1. That the salary scale for faculty members of Mary Washington for the next biennium be:
   * That contracts with faculty members be made from year to year until the consolidation is complete.
2. That President Combs in consultation with the Chancellor decide on the new positions which are to be created for the first and second years of the next biennium, subject, of course, to the approval of the Rector and Visitors.

We recognize the fact that an educational institution is seriously hampered without an adequate library with good library service. As a college of liberal arts the library facilities of Mary Washington must be improved, and we recommend, therefore:

3. That provision be made in the budget of Mary Washington College for an annual library appropriation of $50,000. These sums are to be used for increases in library personnel, and for increases in books, magazines, binding, supplies, equipment, etc., under the direction of the librarian.

On motion the following motion by Mr. Garnett was adopted:

**RESOLVED**, that the report of the Committee appointed by the Alumni Board of Managers to investigate the present and post-war athletic situation be referred to a committee of the Board for its study and recommendation.

Mr. Chisholm, of the firm of Architects, Eggers & Higgins, presented the preliminary plans for the men's dormitories, cafeteria and women's building, which were examined by the Board and approved.

The location of the student union building, formerly assigned to location #6 on the plat of the University at the meeting on June 15, 1945, was considered and changed to the site parallel with the Memorial Gymnasium, east of the reflection pool and extending onto the playing field adjacent to the tennis courts.

The Rector explained to the meeting that the absence of Lewis C. Williams, a member of the Board, was due to illness, whereupon the Secretary was directed to communicate to him the sympathy and prayers of his fellow members for his speedy recovery.

President Combs presented the following matters, which were approved:

Dr. Warren G. Keith, elected Acting Associate Professor of History, at a salary of $2,600 per nine month's session, incumbency effective 9/17/45; tenure one year.

Mr. George S. Graham, elected Instructor in History for one year, at a salary of $2,000 per nine month's session, incumbency effective 9/17/45.

Mr. Bernard M. Fry, Assistant Librarian, leave of absence extended for one year in order to complete requirements for Ph. D. degree in Library Science.

The resignation of Miss Jane G. Scranton, effective immediately, to accept a position at the University of Vermont.

The salary of Miss Faith E. Johnston, Assistant Professor of Home Economics, be increased from $2,000 to $2,300 per session of nine months, effective 9/17/1945.

Pursuant to the instruction given to the President at the last meeting of the Board, authority has been secured from Governor Darden for the purchase of three lots from Mr. and Mrs. R. G. Winn and three lots from Mr. and Mrs. Charles B. Burton as a site for the proposed new heating plant, on the condition that the purchase price not exceed $1750 per lot. Originally the owners stated that they would not accept less than $2000 per lot. After some attempt to induce them to reduce the price without success, the real estate firm of Hunter and Gibson was requested to contact the owners in an effort to secure a better price. As a result, the owners have given a 30-day option to Hunter and Gibson, dated September 7, 1945, for the six lots in question at the price of $10,000, thus saving the college $2000 and making it possible to obtain the property under the authority given by the Governor. The above amount is a net price to the owners. The firm of Hunter and Gibson feel that it should be paid the sum of $300 for securing the options on behalf of the college. The purchase price to be paid the owners, plus the fee requested by the real estate firm, will be less than the $1750 amount per lot authorized by the Governor.

It is, therefore, recommended that the following action be taken:

**RESOLVED**, by the Board of Visitors of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that Mary Washington College of the University of Virginia be and is hereby authorized to accept the options obtained for the six lots and to pay Mr. and Mrs. R. C. Winn $4750 for lots numbered 15, 16, and 17, block 53, College Heights section, and Mr. and Mrs. Charles B. Burton $5250 for lots numbered 12, 13, and 14, block 53, College Heights section, upon execution of the deeds, together with certificates of titles and abstracts approved by the attorney for the University the proper officers of the Board are authorized and directed to accept said deeds, and make payment as herein before set out to the respective owners and have said deeds recorded, and to pay the real estate firm of Hunter and Gibson the sum of $300 for their services in securing the property on behalf of the college.

In compliance with instructions given to the President by the Board at its last meeting, the authority of Governor Darden has been secured for the purchase of the historic Brompton estate, containing approximately 174 acres with a colonial residence estimated to be worth from $35,000 to $40,000 in terms of what it would cost today to build, two barns, and one or two other out-buildings, including the small frame building used as headquarters for the Confederates during the Battle of Fredericksburg in the early part of December, 1862, price not to exceed $65,000.

It is, therefore, recommended that the following action be taken:

**RESOLVED**, by the Board of Visitors of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that Mary Washington College of the University of Virginia be and is hereby authorized to purchase the tract of land known as the Brompton property, embracing approximately 174 acres with a colonial brick residence and other appurtenances, and to pay a sum not exceeding $65,000 to the estate, upon execution of the deed, together with certificate of title and abstract approved by the attorney for the University, the proper officers of the Board are authorized and directed to accept said deed, and make payment as herein set forth to the estate, and have said deed recorded.

Mr. Goolrick was excused from voting on this resolution as he represents some of the heirs interested in the property.

Mrs. Willis presented the matter of providing rugs and draperies for the new home of the President whereupon the following was adopted:

**RESOLVED**, that a fund not to exceed $3,000 be appropriated to furnish rugs and draperies for the President's home at Mary Washington College, if the funds can be made available by the College.

President Combs presented his estimates for the Governor's bi-annual budget for 1946-48 showing requests for all purposes for 1946-47 of $2,537,454 and for 1947-48 of $1,028,876, with estimated revenues for each of the years of $651,235.

The meeting then adjourned.
