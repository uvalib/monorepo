A special meeting of the Rector and Visitors was held on this date at 10:30 o'clock in the office of the President. There were present the Rector, R. Gray Williams, Visitors James H. Corbitt, Christopher B. Garnett, Miss Bessie C. Randolph, Hollis Rinehart and Beverley D. Tucker, Jr., and President Newcomb.

The President made the following announcements:

**Enrollment:** 2982.

The President presented the resignation of Dr. John Calvin Metcalf, Linden Kent Memorial Professor of English Literature, and Dr. Richard Henry Wilson, Professor of Romanic Languages, which were accepted and the following resolutions adopted:

**RESOLVED**, by the Board of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the resignation of Dr. James Calvin Metcalf, effective June 15, 1940, be accepted with deep regret. The Board desires to record its appreciation of his long and distinguished service to this University as Linden Kent Memorial Professor of English Literature and Dean of the Graduate School. Dr. Metcalf has carried forward his work here with devotion and distinction and the Rector and Visitors wish for him the joy that comes of work ably done and hopes that he may have many years of happiness in his retirement.

**RESOLVED**, by the Board of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the resignation of Dr. Richard Henry Wilson as Professor of Romanic Languages be accepted with deep regret, effective June 15, 1940. Dr. Wilson has carried forward his work here since 1899 with devotion and skill and the Rector and Visitors wish for him the joy that comes of work well done and hopes he may have many years of happiness in his retirement.

Upon the recommendation of the President, Dr. Lucius Gaston Moffatt was elected Professor of Romanic Languages and Head of the Department in the University of Virginia, at a salary of $4,500, tenure to begin September 15, 1940.

The President presented an addendum to the Trust Agreement between the "Christian Woman's Board of Missions, of Indianapolis, Indiana, and the Board of the Rector and Visitors of the University for the establishment of a Chair of Biblical History and Literature within the said University", dated December 17, 1908, which addendum was duly signed by the President of the Christian Woman's Board of Missions, and, after full discussion, it was-

**RESOLVED**, by the Board of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the purpose of this addendum, which is to substitute "Religion" for "Biblical History and Literature" in the title of the professorship and of the School, be and the same is hereby approved.

**RESOLVED**, further, that the Rector be and is hereby authorized and requested to sign on behalf of the Rector and Board of Visitors an original and one copy of this addendum.

The President presented to the meeting a form of deed or bill of sale by which the University conveys to Appalachian Electric Power Company the physical properties and right of way of the 6900 volt electric distribution line owned by the University and situated in Pembroke and Newport Districts of Giles County, Virginia, on the waters of Mountain Lake, which now serves the University's Biological Station. Said instrument recites the fact that said conveyance is made in the interest of more efficient service and in consideration of the sum of $487,000 to be paid in cash by the Appalachian Power Company to the University. The President further stated that the form of this instrument had been approved by Mr. Perkins, Attorney for the University, and in the opinion of the President should be executed and delivered in the form submitted. It was, therefore-

**RESOLVED** that Dr. J. L. Newcomb, President of the University, be and he is hereby authorized and empowered to execute and deliver said deed or bill of sale to Appalachian Electric Power Company in the form submitted to this meeting, and that E. I. Carruthers, Secretary of the Board, be and he is hereby authorized and directed to affix the corporate seal of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia to said instrument and to attest the same, delivery of said instrument to be made upon receipt of $487,000 from said Appalachian Power Company.

The President presented to the Board of the Rector and Visitors a copy of a letter written by him to Governor James H. Price, under date of November 24, 1939, requesting authority for the Board of the Rector and Visitors to create a deficit in the sum of $25,000 for the construction of the West Addition to the University of Virginia Hospital. It was, therefore-

**RESOLVED**, by the Board of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that this request be and the same is hereby approved, and the letter is directed to be spread upon the minutes of the Board.

I am writing in the name of the Rector and Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia to request you to authorize them to create a deficit in the sum of $25,000 for the construction of the West Extension of the University of Virginia Hospital, putting this additional $25,000 as a recommended appropriation in your Budget to the General Assembly of 1940. This means that the Legislative Appropriation of $250,000 for the construction of this building would be increased to $275,000.

This is necessary for the following reasons:

1. Anticipating the inability to get the building within the appropriation, we cut out all requirements which were not absolutely necessary in the preparation of our plans and specifications.

2. We have availed ourselves of all deductible alternates which would not leave the structure in an unsatisfactory incomplete condition.

3. Bids have been opened publicly for this construction and the lowest bid exceeds the available money by $31,800. It is our purpose to forego reconditioning the rooms in the old Wing where they join on to the new; to give up all walks and landscaping, and to effect other economies in administration, which reduces to an absolute minimum a cost of $275,000.

4. To bring the construction within the $250,000 appropriation would be to leave unfinished and unfurnished the entire fourth floor of this building, which would leave out entirely all space for the important department of Ear, Nose and Throat, and when this work comes to be done at some later date, when the rest of the building will have been occupied, it means not only great inconvenience and trouble in the operation of the Hospital, but a substantial increase in cost necessitated by building over floors which are occupied and in the upstairs of a building which has been closed off. I estimate the increased cost to be at least 40%.

5. We think it would be decidedly unwise to reject these bids and ask for new ones, because we are convinced that in the re-bidding on this job the low bid would be above the low bid of the present contractor. The price of materials is increasing all the time, and a careful estimate made by us indicates that the present low bid is a very favorable one for us.

We feel strongly that a real emergency exists here which can only be wisely remedied by an authorization of an additional $25,000 of money, and we beg that you will make this authorization, both in the interest of efficiency of the University Hospital, and in the interest of economy for the State.

The President presented to the Board a copy of a proposed contract covering the flight training of students under the agreement with the Civil Aeronautics Authority, which contract had been prepared by Mr. W. Allan Perkins, Attorney for the University, and approved by Prof. F. T. Morse, Director of Aeronautical Training for the University of Virginia. It was thereupon-

**RESOLVED**, by the Board of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the President, J. L. Newcomb, be and he is hereby authorized and directed to execute this contract for and on behalf of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia.

The following was adopted:

**RESOLVED**, by the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the President be and he is hereby authorized to execute a release to Sidney S. Young upon the payment to the University of the sum of $270.00 covering the face value of a note given the University in settlement of his tuition fees.

The President presented the request of the College Topics Staff to increase the student subscription rate from $1.50 to $2.50 per session in order to provide sufficient funds to permit of five issues per week instead of three issues as at present. After consideration of the matter the request was declined.

Mr. Garnett stated to the Board that he had received a letter dated October 20, 1939, from Mr. J. Barrett Carter, representing Mrs. Elizabeth Herndon Rixey, only surviving heir and next of kin of Mrs. Betty C. Herndon, deceased, stating that Second National Bank of Culpeper has in its possession a collection of foreign coins which were placed with it many years ago for exhibition purposes. From Mr. Carter's letter it appears that these coins had been given to Mrs. Betty C. Herndon by her son, Dr. Cumberland George Herndon; that Mrs. Herndon had lent the coins to her son-in-law, Mr. C. J. Rixey, for display at Second National Bank of Culpeper, of which Mr. C. J. Rixey was then president. Mrs. Elizabeth Herndon Rixey has asked the Bank of Culpeper to give her the coins which she feels she is entitled to as the only surviving heir of Mrs. Betty C. Herndon.

The Bank asserts no ownership over the coins and will be glad to turn them over to Mrs. Rixey if in so doing it will incur no liability.

Dr. Cumberland George Herndon, the original owner of these coins, died May 5, 1911, leaving a will dated August 21, 1902. The residuary clause of his will gave certain bonds to the University which are to be held in trust and the income used for a scholarship in the Medical School.

By a contract dated March 28, 1913, Mrs. Lizzie H. Stearns, Mrs. George H. Sinclair and the University of Virginia being the only parties interested in the residuum of said estate, agreed among themselves how their respective interests in the residuum should be paid. Final settlement was made with the University on April 4, 1916, and the University has received its interest in the estate in full.

From the information we have been able to obtain in the matter, it would seem-

1. That Dr. Herndon had given his mother the coins in question several years before he died;

2. Therefore, none of the legatees under Dr. Herndon's will have any interest in these coins;

3. It appears that Mrs. Elizabeth Herndon Rixey is the only surviving heir and next of kin of Mrs. Betty C. Herndon;

4. While inquiry has been made as to the value of these coins we do not feel that this is really a pertinent question if we are correct in the statement of the foregoing facts;

I therefore suggest that the following resolution be adopted-

**RESOLVED**, that, in so far as the University's interest in the estate of Dr. Cumberland George Herndon, deceased, is concerned, Second National Bank of Culpeper be and is hereby authorized to deliver the box of coins now in its possession and claimed by Mrs. Elizabeth Herndon Rixey to the said Mrs. Elizabeth Herndon Rixey, or to such other person as may be able to establish a clear right to the coins as Executor, only heir, or next of kin of Mrs. Betty C. Herndon, deceased.

The President advised the Board that he had purchased a lot of Thomas Jefferson Portraits for the University at a cost of $150.00. The Bursar was authorized to pay for same from University funds.

Mr. Frederic W. Scott became chairman of the Finance Committee of this Board in 1921 and continued in that position until his death in October, 1939. During this long period of eighteen years Mr. Scott gave his great ability and large experience to the investment and management of the funds of the University that are under the control of this Board.

Mr. Scott's sudden death made it important to the Finance Committee of this Board, and the new Rector, that a study should be made of the University of Virginia investments.

This committee arranged with Messrs. Scudder, Stevens and Clark, Investment Counsel, to make an appraisal and classification of certain University of Virginia funds, to-wit: Consolidated Funds, Seward Estate, Blandy bequest and real estate and fraternity loans and the report made by these Investment Counsel is returned herewith. This report is dated December 15, 1939 and the schedules therefor are largely self-explanatory.

In the brief introduction to the schedules the Investment Counsel give a summary of the distribution of capital according to the Moody ratings. The figures apply only to the Consolidated Funds, which are of dominant importance in the combined appraisal.

In a summary at the bottom of page 3 the Investment Counsel find that about 40% of the capital in the Consolidated Funds represents issues of bond grade and the average current interest yield from this group is 3.91%. "In a current appraisal of the defensive strength of the position", say Investment Counsel, "approximately 9% in available cash should really be added to the prime bonds, making a total of 49%, or almost half of the capital in what could be termed a defensive backlog."

This report further finds that there is about 6% in second grade issues having a higher yield of 5.82%.

Investment Counsel then make this important summary:

"This brings the proportion of the Consolidated Fund accounted for to 55%, leaving a balance of 45%. Aside from the 2% in miscellaneous holdings, there is 30% in common stocks and 13% in the remaining bonds and preferred stocks which should realistically be considered the full equivalent of common stocks from the risk standpoint. A number of these high issues are not now paying income, but the majority are and on them the average yield is almost 7%, a clear indication that their intrinsic quality is open to question in the market."

"In summary, therefore, what might be called the \`Risk Capital' in the Consolidated Fund comes close to half of the total and is not fully revealed by the 30% common stocks alone."

It must not be forgotten that Investment Counsel did rate, appraise and classify all the endowment funds of the University of Virginia, amounting in 1939 to more than eleven million dollars ($11,020,113) but confined their study to the Consolidated Fund, the total of which is shown in their summary as $2,494,978.56; to Seward Estate funds shown in their total as $257,925.24, and the Blandy bequest shown in their summary as a total of $461,542.22, and Real Estate Notes and Fraternity Loans amounting to $247,195.27. The grand total for the funds named is $3,461,29. In round figures 8% of this total was in cash, 10% was invested in real estate and fraternity loans, 46% was invested in bonds, 21% was invested in common stocks and 11% was invested in preferred and guaranteed stocks. The income from these investments was about $123,000, or a yield of nearly 4%.

We insert at this point an exhibit under the caption "A Study of Investments Of All the Endowment Funds of the University of Virginia, Excluding the Folkes Scholarship Fund, for the two fiscal years 1938-39." The total of such investments for 1939 is a little over eleven million dollars and the total income therefrom is a little over $422,000, or an average return of 3.82%, but the test of good management applied to this Board must be the funds, covered by the appraisal and classification made by the Investment Counsel, for these are the funds under the management of this Board.

After obtaining the appraisal and classification from Investment Counsel, the Finance Committee spent some time in conference with Mr. James H. Scott and Mr. Buford Scott. We were advised that Mr. James H. Scott was the constant assistant of the late Rector in the management and investment of the investment funds of the University, immediately under control of the Board of Visitors, while Mr. Buford Scott was both the son and partner of Mr. Frederic W. Scott.

Mr. James H. Scott supplied the Rector and members of the Finance Committee with a copy of a letter that he wrote Mr. Frederic W. Scott on the 18th of last August and this letter is filed as a part of this report.

It appears that in 1930 the book values of the investments were changed to the then market and that this resulted in a net write-up of the book values of the various sums in the total of $235,928.14. Between 1930 and June 30, 1939, Mr. Scott reports that the sale and redemption of securities in the Consolidated Funds resulted in net profits of $56,823.68 over the book values as established in 1930. He then adds these profits to the write-up and gets a total addition to the book value of the Consolidated Fund of $292,752.00 and this sum he claims should be credited against the unrealized depreciation from book values on June 30, 1939 in the sum of $446,210.00, leaving a net shrinkage of $153,458.00.

The Board will be interested in determining the source of any profit realized on the sale of securities. Mr. Scott reports that most of the profit of $56,823.00, realized on the sale of securities between 1930 and 1939, was made from the sale and redemption of bonds in the industrial and miscellaneous bond group. After emphasizing that the principal losses have been in the railroad bond group and the railroad preferred and guaranteed stock group, Mr. Scott declares as follows, to-wit:

"While these losses have been offset in part by profit on industrial and miscellaneous bonds, the larger profits have come from the retention of common stocks received as legacies and held by the University over a long period. Through this combination the fund has been substantially kept intact through the recent difficult years."

It is common knowledge that it is very difficult to invest large funds in safe properties or securities and to obtain a satisfactory yield from such investments. If this Board should confine its investments to those investments in which section 5431 of the Code declares "fiduciaries may invest", the yield in income would be insufficient to meet appropriations that this Board now makes for the support of this University.

The fundamental question is, however, is this Board confined to the investments, sometimes designated as legal investments, under section 5431 of the Code of Virginia? This committee requested an opinion upon this question from Mr. W. Allan Perkins, the attorney for the University, and he advised that section 5431 was not mandatory, but permissive and that this section does not exclude the right of the fiduciary to invest in other securities than those enumerated in 5431, when in so doing the fiduciary exercises sound discretion.

It is the duty of this Board to exercise care and diligence; we are trustees who must exercise good faith, sound discretion, prudence and care.

While the section defining investments that a fiduciary may make is permissive and not exclusive, we must not forget that this section is a deliberate definition by the General Assembly of Virginia of the character of investments that are considered safe for trust funds.

While we do not think that this Board should be confined to the investments nominated in the statute, yet we do not think that this Committee should buy common stocks, without first obtaining the deliberate approval of the Board of Visitors of such investments.

Mr. James Scott's letter finds "that the unrealized depreciation of $78,524.00 in the common stock group would show instead an unrealized profit of approximately $140,000, if referred back to the original price at which the securities were bought or taken over."

There are many arguments in favor of prudent investment and careful dealing in high-grade common stocks. This committee is aware that the trustees of a number of our educational funds do invest a considerable percentage of such funds in common stocks and that the results, over a period of years, often justifies such investment.

Mr. James Scott's finding indicates that the investments made in common stocks by Mr. Fred Scott of certain of the funds under control of this Board were profitable. Of course, it must be remembered also that profits were realized from common stocks that came to this Board as gifts.

Even if no new common stocks be purchased at the present, the Finance Committee will still be faced with the continuing problem of when and at what price to sell common stocks that were not purchased by this Board, but that came into the portfolio of this Board by gift. It is, of course, the duty of this Board to exercise a wise and informed discretion in determining when and at what price disposition should be made of any of the investments. This Board has a clear right to retain common stocks that are a part of gifts to the University of Virginia as long as it would appear wise to retain such stocks. The problem is to determine when a particular investment, including common stocks, should be sold and there should be no general rule against the retention of such common stocks.

The Committee has gone over the list of investments shown in the report made by Scudder, Stevens and Clark and has marked the particular investments that should be held and those that should be disposed of. It is suggested that the Board consider giving the Finance Committee authority and discretion to dispose of any of these securities at such time and at such price as deemed best, or to exercise the Committee's best judgement in retaining any of these investments.

### HOW SHALL THIS FUND BE MANAGED HEREAFTER?

The Finance Committee has considered the advisability of employing investment counsel. The cost of employing investment counsel for this fund is estimated to be more than $7000.00 per year. This is a large sum and it is doubtful if the value of the services to be rendered by investment counsel will do more to promote a reasonably safe and profitable operation of the funds than can be accomplished by obtaining the constant advice of experienced and dependable investment bankers.

For the present, the Finance Committee recommends that this Board continue to consult Scott and Stringfellow, Investment Bankers, of Richmond, who are familiar with our funds and especially continue to consult Mr. James H. Scott, who worked intimately with Mr. Fred Scott for some years up to the time of his death. However, this Board should retain its freedom of action in order that it may have the right to consult other investment bankers or even, if and when deemed desirable, to consult investment counsel.

## SCOTT & STRINGFELLOW

You asked me last Friday to send you and each member of the Finance Committee of the University of Virginia Board of Visitors a copy of a portion of a letter written by me last August 18th to Mr. Fred W. Scott in which I summarized certain figures in regard to the handling of the Endowment Funds of the University in past years. I am, therefore, quoting below all of the letter which I read you that concerns the above matters omitting only certain personal matters contained at the end of my letter.

"From time to time you seem to be worried over the shrinkage in value sustained by many of the University's securities. While all funds of this kind have had a similar experience this is a poor consolation. However, you may be interested in some of the following facts in this connection.

"In 1930 Mr. Carruthers and I worked out a plan to consolidate many of the small funds of the University. Some of these had increased in value and others had diminished from their book values. In order to treat the funds equitably it was necessary to change our book values to the then market. This resulted in a net write-up of the book values of the various funds amounting to $235,928.14. Between 1930 and June 30, 1939 the sale and redemption of securities in the Consolidated Funds has resulted in net profits of $56,823.68 over the book values as established in 1930. Adding these profits to the above write-up makes a total of $292,752 which has been added to the book value of the Consolidated Funds. So while the Consolidated Funds together with the Seward Estate Fund showed an unrealized depreciation from book values on June 30, 1939 amounting to $446,210, there should be credited against this the above mentioned profits and write-up of $292,752, leaving a net shrinkage of $153,458.

"I have been unable to secure the figures showing realized profits in the separate funds from the time you became Chairman of the Finance Committee in 1921 up until 1930 but I am satisfied that these profits were considerable as this was, generally speaking, a period of rising prices. It was during this period, for instance, that you sold the stock of the Massachusetts Gas Companies on which a profit of $57,444 was realized. I feel pretty safe in saying that the profits realized prior to 1930 will more than take care of the loss in the unmarketable real estate loans which are included at their book values in the assets of the Consolidated Funds because no market values are obtainable.

"While the University will undoubtedly eventually sustain some severe losses in its holdings of railroad securities, these are partially offset in the totals as indicated above by several very handsome profits still unrealized - for instance, you will recall that the 1940 1400 shares of DuPont stock received from the Wills Johnson Estate and since multiplied through stock split ups was originally taken over (after adjustment for sale of rights and odd shares) at $18,146 and is now worth $224,000."

I enclose a summary of the investments of the University giving book values and present market values indicating an unrealized depreciation in the securities held by the University of $325,637 as of the close of the year 1939 as compared with an unrealized depreciation of $446,210 on June 30, 1939 as mentioned in my letter of August 18th, quoted above, so in other words, the securities have increased in value approximately $120,000 during the last six months of 1939, leaving an actual net loss in the funds of about $33,000 or a little over 1%.

Mr. Daniel asked how the University's investments had fared as between the different security classifications. I am not able to give you this information in full and accurate detail and a complete statement would require a considerable investigation in the records of the Bursar. However, I think the following information will be sufficient for your present purposes. The write-up in book value of securities in 1930 represented an increase in value entirely in the stock groups, there being a slight decline at that time in the value of the bond groups. The entry made on the Bursar's records at that time does not divide the write-up as between the common stock group and the preferred and guaranteed stocks. However, I have looked up the principal items of the write-up which are attached hereto in a separate memorandum. This does not include a large number of small items but it is quite apparent from this memorandum that at least 90% of the write-up occurred in the common stock group, the total of the eight items listed being over $220,000. It therefore appears that the unrealized depreciation of $78,524. in the common stock would show instead as an unrealized profit of approximately $140,000 if referred back to the original prices at which the securities were bought or taken over. In the preferred and guaranteed stock group the unrealized loss would be slightly reduced if referred to the original cost basis.

Most of the $56,823.68 profit realized on sale of securities between 1930 and 1939 was made from the sale and redemption of bonds, principally from those in the industrial and miscellaneous bond group. This group has, therefore, netted the University realized profits and also shows an unrealized profit of a similar amount, the combined total being in the neighborhood of $100,000. Profits realized in the past nine years in the railroad bond group would slightly reduce the unrealized losses now indicated in this classification but the railroad bond group would still show the largest depreciation of all, somewhere between $160,000 and $170,000.

It is rather interesting that the principal losses which have been sustained in the University's Endowment Funds have been in the railroad bond group and to a lesser extent in the railroad preferred and guaranteed stocks, most of which were considered very conservative high-grade investments at the time they were acquired. While these losses have been offset in part by profits on industrial and miscellaneous bonds, the larger profits have come from the retention of common stocks received as legacies and held by the University over a long period. Through this combination the Fund has been substantially kept intact through the recent difficult years.

I trust the above gives you the information desired.

At the request of the Rector, I am submitting herewith a statement upon the subject of the authority, duties, and liabilities of the Board of Visitors in connection with investment of funds belonging to the University, primary consideration being given to the question of whether the Board of Visitors shall be confined in making investments of University funds to so-called "lawful investments" or whether, in the exercise of a sound discretion, the Board may, without liability to its members, place the funds of the University in securities not included within the list of such "lawful investments" as defined by Section 5431 of the Code of Virginia.

### FIRST

## AUTHORITY OF THE BOARD OF VISITORS

Section 806 of our Code provides, among other things, that the University of Virginia shall be continued and the Visitors thereof shall be and remain a corporation under the style of- "The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia", and among other powers shall have the "power to accept, execute and administer any trust in which it may have an interest under the terms of the instrument creating the trust".

A careful search of our Code sections and Acts of Assembly has failed to disclose any specific limitation upon the foregoing broad grant of powers in the execution of trusts by the Board of Visitors. I am of opinion, therefore, that the Visitors of the University do not stand upon ground differing in any way from that occupied by any other trustee or fiduciary, and therefore in the management of all trusts committed to their care for the benefit of the University of Virginia, the Visitors are subject only to the principles of law applicable to fiduciaries generally.

## DUTIES OF THE BOARD IN MAKING INVESTMENTS

If I am correct in the foregoing conclusion, the statement of your duties becomes little more than an expression of elementary principles-

A trustee should exercise common skill, common prudence, and common caution; he must represent and protect the interest of all beneficiaries impartially, he must act honestly and in utmost good faith. A trustee must exercise sound judgement and prudence and due diligence, or that care and diligence which an ordinarily prudent man would exercise in the management of his own affairs. However, a trustee is not an insurer of the trust property or of results, and when it is shown that a trustee has been faithful and diligent, the Court will view his acts with liberality and indulgence and will not hold him responsible for more mistakes or errors of judgement, or for losses not attributable to lack of fidelity. (65 C. J., 648).

Section 5431 of the Code of Virginia authorizes fiduciaries to make investments in the securities enumerated or of the class or classes defined therein. The language of this statute is permissive. Fiduciaries may invest in these securities but this statute does not in any way exclude the right of the fiduciary to invest in other securities when in so doing he exercises a sound discretion.

Pre-eminent knowledge and uncommon foresight are not required of a trustee, but all that is required is that he should act in good faith and with the same care and diligence that a prudent man is accustomed to exercise in the management of his own affairs. To require more than this of a Trustee would be to deter man of integrity from taking upon themselves an office so necessary in the concerns of life from fear of anxiety, trouble and risk involved. (Elliott v. Carter, 9 Gratt. 541, Davis v. Harman 121 Gratt. 194; Cogbill v. Boyd, 77 Va. 450).

It is well settled that it is the duty of a trustee to preserve and protect the trust property for the benefit of the beneficiaries. Nothing more is required of a trustee than that he should act in good faith and with the same prudence and discretion that a prudent man exercises in his own affairs. (Shepherd v. Darling 120 Va. 586; Winder v. Nock 104 Va. 759; Halstead's Ex'rs. v. Ingram, 163 Va. 229.

## LIABILITIES OF THE BOARD

There is, of course, no question of liability where funds are placed only in "lawful investments" within the terms of the permissive statute above referred to. There are authorities in some of the jurisdictions which hold that where a trustee does not take advantage of the permissive statute, he will be held responsible for loss, but the great weight of authority, and certainly the practice in Virginia has been to regard these statutes simply as permissive and not as exclusive statutes. (1 Perry on Trusts, Sec. 459, Harrison on Wills and Administration, Pr. 381.) If, as stated above, the whole duty of a trustee is to exercise care and diligence, as expressed under the second heading above, then it follows as a corollary to said duty that liability will result where there is a failure to exercise such good faith, sound discretion, common prudence, and care.
