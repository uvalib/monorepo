**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that

WHEREAS the Addition to the Nurses' Home, Project VA. 44-356 has been completed in accordance with plans and specifications and all furniture and equipment has been received and installed, the Rector and Visitors hereby formally accept this Project from the Federal Works Agency.

A proposal submitted for a loan to the University Press from the Consolidated Endowment Fund to enable them to purchase now equipment was referred to the President to study and recommend action to the Board at its next meeting.

After a discussion concerning interest which had accrued during the war years on student loans, the Board directed that the collection of interest be suspended pending a full report from the Bursar, including a statement of the number of loans outstanding, the number delinquent, etc.

A petition was presented from students in the Medical School concerning fees for veterans in the Department of Medicine. The matter was referred to the President, directing that he meet with a committee of students and work out a solution to be presented at the next meeting of the Board.

Action on this matter was further deferred until the next meeting of the Board. The following resolution was adopted.

**RESOLVED** that it is the sense of the Board that the fee system as presently applied in the Medical School is inimical to the welfare of the University and should be abolished, and that one of the following methods be substituted:

1. Putting all medical faculty on a fair and equitable salary basis, some salaries to be decreased and some increased; no fees to be paid any member of the faculty.

   OR

2. Retaining doctors as faculty members paid a reasonable salary for rendering such instruction in the Medical School as agreed upon, and permitting them to engage in the private practice of medicine independent of the Medical School.

The President reported that changes in the hospital to accommodate the Child Guidance Clinic have been approved by the State Budget Director and that work is progressing.

The following resolution, prepared by Mr. Garnett, was presented to the Board and adopted.

**RESOLVED**, that in cases not under the jurisdiction of the Honor Committee and in lieu of any other rule or regulation now existing on the subject, the President is hereby authorized, in his discretion, to impose such penalty as he may deem appropriate, including expulsion from the University, for any conduct on the part of a student which tends to discredit or injure the University.

In cases of expulsion by the President, the student may appeal to the Board.

The catalogue shall be revised in conformity with this resolution.

The President reported that a private contractor had been employed to repair the building. The cost is estimated at $4,000 including needed equipment as set forth in a letter to the President from Mr. T. M. Carruthers. The Board approved this expenditure.

There being no further business to come before the meeting, the same was adjourned after a motion to that effect had been made, seconded, and carried.
