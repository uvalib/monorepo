## Special Summer Law Course

At a called meeting of the Board of Visitors on above date in the President's Office, East Lawn,

Present: The Rector, and Visitors Harmon, Norton, White, Moore, Buchanan, Flood, and Craddock, and the President,

The Board was called to order at 2:30 P. M., by the Rector, and the following was adopted:

Resolved That Mr. Walter H. Robertson be allowed to substitute six law tickets chosen from Junior and Senior Law courses, for the six Junior Law tickets; the same to be accepted in lieu of the electives-at-large required for the B. A degree, in accordance with the recommendation of the Faculty.

Resolved: That the necessary advertisement required by statute for the election of a professor of pharmacology, be made by the President.

Resolved: That the Board is gratified to hear of the settlement of the question involved in the litigation respecting the James will, and wishes to record its thorough appreciation of the very able and effective services rendered by Mr. Wm. H. White and his associates in representing and protecting the interests of the University.

Resolved That the Faculty be requested to allow Mr. James B. Green of the University of Virginia, licentiate in law, to have the following card in the next catalogue, either at the end of the law course, or in the back of the catalogue, as they may deem best, provided the same may be legally done, without causing additional postage expenses -

I hereby offer a special course of ninety lectures as follows: Rights, Wrongs, and Remedies,-Thirty. Evidence,Twenty. Equity,-Twenty, and Real Property,-Twenty. Beginning July first, and ending September first 1908. Fee forty dollars, on entering. No text-books will be required, as I give a full synopsis of course, and students will have the use of the Law Library without extra charge.

James B. Green, Licentiate in Law, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Va.

Resolved: That the Rector, President, and Wm. H. White be and are hereby authorized to prepare or cause to be prepared a suitable bill to be presented to the General Assembly at its coming session, authorizing the Rector and Board of Visitors to accept and administer the device and bequest to the University, contained in the will of the late Edward W. James, of Norfolk, Va.

Resolved That the consideration of the question of changes in the Academic degrees proposed by the Faculty, be postponed for determination at a future meeting of this Board.

Resolved That the resolution adopted at the last meeting relative to the employment of Mr. Moon be changed so as to read as follows "That Mr. John B. Moon be continued as General Counsel of the Board at a salary of $1000.00 per annum, in full of services and all expenses."

Resolved: That a committee of three be appointed to investigate and report to the Board the price of books charged at the book-stores which sell the students their text-books. Committee. Visitors Flood, Harmon, and Norton.

The following correspondence of the Chairman of the Finance Committee was approved and adopted as his report to the Board,-

Enclosed please find copy of my letter to The Virginia Trust Co. of this State, which you will please file as my report on the loan of $12,000.00 to Messrs. A. W. Mosby and H. E. DeWitt.

I will see that the permanent insurance policies are forwarded to The Virginia Trust Company at an early date.

I am sending you herewith, for the account of the Rec- tor and Visitors of the University of Virginia:

a. Bond of $10,000.00 of A. W. Mosby and H. E. DeWitt, payable five years from January 1, 1908, with interest at six per cent, evidenced by coupons, payable January 1st and July 1st. This bond is to be entered as the James C. Carter Bequest and so carried on your books.

b. Bond of A. W. Mosby and H. E. DeWitt, of $2,000.00, maturing five years from January 1, 1908, bearing interest at six per cent., payable semi-annually, January 1st and July 1st, evidenced by coupons. This amount is to be credited and carried as the Valentine Birely Scholarship Fund.

c. Deed of Trust, properly recorded, on business property, located on Main Street, Lynchburg, Virginia, securing these bonds.

d. Abstract of title to property, prepared by Sackett & Sacks, Attorneys, Lynchburg, Va.

The form of bonds, deed of trust and abstract of title have been examined and approved by John B. Moon, Attorney for the University.

I have, in my possession, Builders' Risk insurance policy, to cover the building, which is now nearing completion, for $5,000.00. As soon as the building is completed, I will have the permanent insurance for $10,000.00 taken out and forwarded to you, to be filed with these papers, as is contemplated in the deed of trust. The lot is valued at between $8,000.00 and $10,000.00, and the building will cost $17,000.00.

Kindly acknowledge receipt of these papers; and I will thank you also, to advise me of your decision in reference to the matter of compensation on the bond transaction with the National Exchange Bank. I have not heard from you in answer to my last letter, which I suppose is due to press of business upon you at this period.

The Virginia Trust Company insists upon its charge of $150.00 for its services with the loan of bonds to the National Exchange Bank. Mr. Gilliam, President of the Bank, took the position, in which I concurred, that $50.00 was a fair amount for his bank to pay for this service, and, while I feel that the charge of the Virginia Trust Company is somewhat excessive, inasmuch as they have declined to reduce it, I have authorized them to charge the account of the University of Virginia with $100.00, in settlement of balance on this transaction.

This act on my part was authorized by the Visitors at the last meeting of the Board.
