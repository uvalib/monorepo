RESOLVED that the title of Dr. Alfred P. Fernbach be changed from Assistant Professor of Political Science to Assistant Professor of Foreign Affairs, effective September 15, 1949.

The Board approved the purchase from the Harry R. Burke Estate of Thomas Jefferson's Prayer Book and three Jefferson manuscripts, at a price of $6,000. A contribution of $1,000 has been offered toward the purchase by Mr. Clifton Waller Barrett, and the $5,000 received in June 1948 from the estate of Alexander Weddell will make up the balance. The Secretary was asked to write Mr. Barrett, expressing the appreciation of the Board for his generous offer.

The assignment of the Newman house on Dawson's Row was referred to the Buildings and Grounds Committee of the Board, with authority vested in the Chairman, Mr. Garnett, to make the assignment should the Committee be unable to meet.

The general plans for the Women's Dormitory, which had been approved by the State Art Commission, were submitted for approval of the Board. After discussion Mrs. Wailes moved that the plans be accepted, and the motion was carried.

Preliminary plans for the Power Plant, which had been approved by the State Art Commission, were approved by the Board.

Plans for an underground storage room annexed to the present Hospital Record Room were approved.

A proposed amendment to the Constitution of the National Collegiate Athletic Association was approved as set forth below, the amendment to be presented at the annual meeting of the NCAA in January. In accordance with the procedure outlined for amending the Constitution, the Secretary was directed to send copies of this proposed amendment to the approximately three hundred members of the NCAA.

It is proposed to amend Article III, Section 4, Subsection (a) by adding thereto following the words "provided, however, that the aid thus awarded shall not exceed" the following words: "the amount necessary to provide room and board at the institution and".

And to further amend Article III, Section 4, Subsection (a) by adding thereto following the words "for stated incidental institution fees" the words "and for required books".

So that Article III, Section 4, Subsection (a) will read after having been so amended, as follows:

"(a) if approved and awarded on the basis of need by the regular agency established in the recipient's institution for granting of aids to all students, provided, however, that the aid thus awarded shall not exceed the amount necessary to provide room and board at the institution and the amount of tuition for instruction and for stated incidental institution fees and for required books, or"

The following resolution was adopted

RESOLVED that the Hospital Accounts Committee be and is hereby authorized to charge off as uncollectible, hospital accounts schedules 91-A, 91-C, 93, and 94, aggregating $17,480.92, recommended by them for cancellation.

Mr. Gay raised the question of whether or not the minutes indicated what policy was being followed by the Hospital Accounts Committee in recommending uncollectible accounts for action by the Board of Visitors. The Secretary pointed out that the policy followed was that recommended by the Auditor of Public Accounts and the procedures were based upon a similar arrangement in operation at the Medical College of Virginia. These accounts fall into two major categories. (1) Uncollectible accounts which have been processed with no results for a period of not less than six months by the Credit Manager of the University Hospital, then turned over to a collecting agent. If the agent is unable to collect these accounts, the Hospital Credit Manager advises the Hospital Accounts Committee so that they may be recommended to the Board of Visitors for cancellation. (2) Accounts for services to indigents, the recipients of which are certified to the Hospital by the welfare agencies.

The Board directed the Secretary in consultation with Mr. E. S. Campbell, architect for the renovation of Pavilion VIII, to purchase such furnishings as are necessary to equip the offices of the Board and of the President.

It was the opinion of the Board that the University would be delighted to accept a bust of Thomas Fortune Ryan, by Rodin, should it be offered, provided its acceptance were approved by the State Art Commission.

The committee investigating the American history and government requirement for a college degree had no report at this time because the committee of the faculty with which they were to meet had not yet been appointed by the President.

The question was raised whether the investigation should be limited to the University at Charlottesville. It was the sense of the Board that Mary Washington College should be included in the study.

A proposal by the Department of Medicine to institute a program of study leading to the degree of Bachelor of Science in Nursing was approved. The School of Nursing will function under the administrative direction of the Department of Medicine. A summary of the work to be offered was prepared by Dr. V. W. Lippard, Dean of the Department of Medicine, and presented to the Board.

"The first two years of the course will be offered at Mary Washington and other colleges and 66 semester hours credit will be accepted by transfer. During the summer sessions after the freshman and sophomore years, students enrolled in the program will attend six-week courses at the School of Nursing, for which 10 semester hours credit will be given. They will enter the School of Nursing at the beginning of the junior year for a period of two and one-half years, minus eight week vacation, and during that period will receive clinical instruction in the Hospital and sufficient classroom work for 48 semester hours credit. Total credits amount to 124 and practical experience to 856 days."

The following appointments to the faculty were made, effective July 1, 1950. For the present, these faculty members are to remain on the Hospital pay roll in their present pay classifications.

The following resolution adopted by the Council of the University of Virginia Law School Association was presented to the Board.

"RESOLVED, that the Council of the University of Virginia Law School Association recommend to the President, Rector and Board of Visitors of the University that tuition fees in the Law School be raised to the extent of Fifty Dollars ($50) per year for both Virginia and non-Virginia students."

The foregoing proposal was not approved. In lieu thereof, a resolution was adopted increasing the tuition of non-Virginians in the Law School by $100, effective September 1950, with no change in tuition for Virginia students.

The Board approved the following statement for release to the Press.

The Board of Visitors of the University meeting today considered the unprecedented situation created as the result of action by local officials directed toward the exaction of taxes levied on tangible personal property owned by University students.

The Board requested Mr. W. Allan Perkins, Charlottesville attorney and counsel for the University, to examine the problem and give his opinion respecting the legality of the proposed action. Mr. Perkins was also requested by the Board to arrange for the presentation of a test case or cases, which might result in the correction of erroneous assessments levied pursuant to the presently announced policies of tax collecting officers in Albemarle County.

The Board went on record in sharp criticism of the policy now being followed. It authorized a statement to the effect that, regardless of technical questions revolving around residence and ownership of tangible personal property and the situs of such property for tax purposes, the Board deplored this effort at tax exaction as hostile to the long range interests of Albemarle County, Charlottesville and the University community in general. The Board considered it significant that, according to information published in the Cavalier Daily of December 9th, tax enforcement officials in other educational communities throughout the State have no such conception of their duties as those apparently entertained by the local officials, and that in this community the present policy is now conceived for the first time in the history of the University, although the statutes now controlling have been in effect for many years.

The Board was especially critical of what it termed ill-advised and intemperate threats of jail imprisonment allegedly made by one Albemarle County official.

The Board expressed hope for the reversal of a policy which it regards as unwise and unfair to the University students and the University community.

The minutes of the September 8, 1949 meeting of the Executive Committee of the Development Fund were read and approved. The Rector stated that he had conferred with Admiral Halsey, who was in accord with the action of the Executive Committee.

The Rector pointed out that to carry out the recommendations of the Executive Committee of the Development Fund it would be necessary for certain work of the Fund to be continued, such as acknowledgment of payment of pledges, the sending of follow-up letters, etc. The Bursar was asked to supervise this work until February 1, 1950 or until such time as President Darden could make permanent arrangements for the transfer of the records of the Development Fund. The Bursar was authorized, in consultation with the Rector, to continue the employment of one or two secretaries of the Development Fund until February 1, 1950.

The Board approved a proposal by the Rector to authorize Admiral Halsey to occupy "Four Acres" for an indeterminate time at a monthly rental of $250, and further authorized his continued use of his present office in the Rotunda.

The report of the Finance Committee was approved and the Secretary was directed to spread it on the minutes.

At the last meeting of the Board of Visitors report was made by the Bursar of the receipt by the University of the gift from the late Christopher G. Memminger of the sum of $302,775.00, of which $186,775.00 was represented by securities and $116,000.00 in cash, and these funds were turned over when and as received to State-Planters Bank and Trust Company for handling as a part of the Consolidated Endowment Fund of the University.

Prior to the delivery of the securities, the Trustees of the Memminger Estate had acquainted your Committee with what securities were being held by it, with the view of ascertaining whether the University, as beneficiary of the trust, wished them sold and their cash values paid, or whether it would accept all or any part of such securities in kind. After full consultation with the Trust Investment Department of State-Planters Bank and Trust Company, and acting upon its advices, your Committee informed the Trustees of the Estate that those of the securities which were subsequently delivered to it in kind would be accepted by the University, and such as were not acceptable to it we understand were subsequently sold by the Trustees and the proceeds of their sale constitute a part of the cash subsequently paid to the University.

In view of the large amount involved in this generous bequest, your Committee has felt it both proper and appropriate to submit to the Board of Visitors a detailed statement showing the names, par amount, market value and yield at the time of their receipt, and the estimated annual income from each of the securities so delivered by the Trustees, in the aggregate amount of $186,775.00, as well as the names of the stocks, their aggregate cost and estimated annual return on the securities in which the $116,000.00 in cash was invested, and in order accurately and completely to report these facts, have requested State-Planters Bank and Trust Company to make a detailed report to your Committee for its submission to the Board of Visitors.

Such a report, bearing date November 15, 194, is hereto attached and, as it is self-explanatory, will not be commented upon except to point out that, as indicated therein, the present estimated annual yield upon the securities delivered in kind is 4.51% and the present estimated yield upon the common stocks purchased is 5.80%, giving an average yield of about 5% on the aggregate value of the Memminger bequest.

We are pleased to give you this special report with reference to the Christopher G. Memminger Estate Inheritance which consisted of the following:

The investment of the cash was approved by the Finance Committee as follows:

From the foregoing it will be observed that the estimated annual income on the securities received in kind and on the investment of the cash aggregates $15,192.00, which is an average yield of 5% on the Memminger Inheritance. In figuring this estimate of the annual income it should be recorded that we have used current dividend rates effective in 1949 including extras on the common stocks. It seems fair therefore to expect some fluctuation from year to year in the income from common stocks, particularly in view of the very favorable extra dividend declared by General Motors Corporation this year.

I think it should be stated that the securities which were received in kind were selected from the inventory of the Memminger Estate and were considered suitable for retention, both from the standpoint of the investments themselves and from the standpoint of how they would fit into the portfolio of the University of Virginia. In choosing the investments for the cash consideration was given to the investments already on hand and the diversification of the Consolidated Endowment Funds and in every instance except one the new investments represented additions to units already on hand so as to round them out to more normal size. The only new unit introduced was the Marshall Field and Company common stock. That explanation will explain the rather odd number of shares of some of the investments selected.
