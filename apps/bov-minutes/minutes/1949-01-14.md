The regular monthly meeting of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia was held on this date at 10 o'clock in the Office of the President of the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia, with the following present: President Colgate W. Darden, Jr. of the University of Virginia; Visitors Anderson, Carrington, Gravatt, Trout, Wailes, and Willis. Absent: Dr. M. L. Combs, President of Mary Washington College; Visitors Barksdale, Black, Calcott, Garnett, Gay, Mears, Miller and Stettinius.

In the absence of the Rector, Mr. Anderson was elected Rector pro tempore.

The minutes of the meeting of December 10, which had been copied and mailed to the members, were approved.

The President announced the following gifts:

Upon recommendation of the President, the following leave of absence, change of title, and elections were approved.

Dr. Frank Arthur Geldard, Professor of Psychology, granted leave of absence without pay for the second semester of the session of 1948-49 to work with the office of psychological research of the United States Air Forces.

The following resolution was adopted:

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the title of Dr. John Howe Yoe, Professor of Chemistry, be changed to Professor of Chemistry and Director of the John Lee Pratt Trace Analysis Laboratory.

Dr. Lyne Starling Reid as Acting Assistant Professor of Psychology for the second semester of the session of 1948-49, at a session salary of $3,510, half of this amount to be paid for the semester.

Dr. Woodbury Perkins as Instructor in Medicine, without compensation from the University, as of September 16, 1948.

The President informed the Board that the University might be requested to establish research agencies to assist State departments in the administration of laws concerning health, welfare, and education. He stated that several heads of departments of the State government had discussed with him the possibility of the University's undertaking such a program.

The President reported that the Garden Clubs of Virginia will undertake the restoration of the west gardens of the University. No cost figures are available as yet, but the President estimates the cost at $40,000 to $50,000.

Visitor: Captain Norton G. Pritchett.

Dr. Trout presented for consideration of the Board the question of the abolition of collegiate boxing at the University. He stated that doctors throughout the state felt boxing should be abolished, and that he had been approached by several doctors who reported latent development of brain trouble resulting from college boxing. He pointed out that the University of Virginia is the only school in the state which has not discontinued boxing. The Board of Visitors of the University of Wisconsin discussed this matter last year at the instigation of a doctor who is a member of their Board, but the effort to ban it there was defeated. Dr. Trout stated also that the American Neurological Society has been discussing this problem, and that he personally felt very strongly that boxing should be abolished at the University.

The President suggested the appointment of a committee to study the matter, with leading brain surgeons included in the membership.

Captain Pritchett pointed out that at the time of the death of Johnny LaRowe, former boxing coach, the whole matter was investigated with Dr. Coleman as advisor. Changes were made in the rules increasing the weight of gloves from 8 ounces to 10 to 12 and providing that all fights were to be stopped if any cut appeared. Captain Pritchett said that last year Al York, Head Boxing Coach, sent a questionnaire to all living members of former University of Virginia boxing teams. Replies were received from sixty-eight percent and all favored continuation of the sport.

Captain Pritchett stated that the Naval Academy has abolished inter-collegiate boxing but requires every student to participate in an intramural program of which boxing is an integral part. He pointed out that there are dangers in other sports almost as great as in boxing.

Mr. Anderson moved that the matter be referred to the Athletics Committee of the Board with Dr. Trout serving as medical advisor to the Committee, and the motion was passed.

The President reported that he had discussed the permanent organization of the Development Fund with the Rector over the telephone and that the Rector recommended that the reorganization of the Fund be completed by July 1, 1949, in which recommendation he concurred.

The President presented the following letter from Eggers and Higgins regarding the employment of consultants in engineering for preparation of the working drawings for the addition to Cabell Hall. The recommendations made by Eggers and Higgins were approved by the Board.

In accordance with your letter of December 10th and in accordance with the existent contract, we hereby propose the following engineers for the structural and mechanical engineering services, respectively, in connection with the preparation of the working drawings for the Academic Building.

To prepare the plans and specifications for the structural elements, such as foundations, reinforced concrete, etc., we propose the name of Marshall and Congwer, 1147 Connecticut Avenue, N. W., Washington, D. C. We have investigated the record of this firm very carefully, as well as consulting with other architects and public officials in the District of Columbia, and we find that they are very highly commended for their work with public agencies and other private architects.

For the mechanical engineering services, consisting of heating and ventilating, plumbing, etc., we submit the name of Karsunky, Weller & Gooch, 2011 "K" Street, N. W., Washington, D. C. We know this firm very well as they have done some prominent work with us for the U.S. Navy. Their record is outstanding and they are well equipped with the personnel and experience for this job.

Both of these engineers have agreed to perform all the necessary engineering services, respectively, on the basis of the fee arrangement now in force in contracts between the Commonwealth of Virginia and other architects and engineers.

If these two proposed firms are satisfactory, we propose to enter into contracts with them, using our regular form of engineering contract and appending thereto, and making it a part of the contract, the existing contract between ourselves and the University of Virginia, dated July 23, 1948. When the contracts are executed, we will forward to you an executed copy of the agreement between both engineers and ourselves.

Both of these engineering firms are located in the District of Columbia, close to our Washington office where the work will be performed.

May we have your confirmation of this arrangement so we may proceed forthwith with the necessary work for the Academic Building.
