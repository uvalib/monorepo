On motion

1. Resolved, that the communication of the Committee of the D. K. E.

2. Resolved, that the plans for such hall or building shall be subject to the approval of this Board.

The Finance Committee submitted the following report:

To the Rector and Visitors of the University of Va

Your Finance Committee respectfully report that pursuant to the resolution of the Board adopted at the last regular meeting we called upon the Proctor, and examined the bonds held by him for the University, and ascertained them to be as follows:

Of the bonds representing the Sinking Fund, the two University 8% of $1000. each, and the 2 Martha Randolph bonds have been cancelled, and Your Committee, under the direction of the resolution have cancelled the remaining $14,000.

2. Your Committee recommend the following appropriation suggested in the Report of the Faculty:

and in consequence of these appropriations, they recommend that the conditional appropriations made at the regular meeting be for the present, postponed.

3. They recommend that the Proctor be directed to purchase for the Reading Room used by the Y. M. C. A. an adequate supply of coal not to exceed \_\_\_ tons of hard coal and to furnish an adequate supply of light for said room. Provided, that not more than $100. be expended for both the fuel and the lights. And your Committee, in this connection, suggest that the fee charged students attending the Reading Room be reduced from $4. to $2. each, for the privilege.

4. They recommend that out of any funds not otherwise appropriated the sum of $200. be expended for advertising, under the direction of the Faculty.

5. It appearing that the allowance of $150. per annum, which has heretofore been made to the Commissioner of Accounts under resolution of the Board, was at the last regular meeting of the Board, reduced to $100. upon the recommendation of the Faculty, the reason for which does not appear. We recommend that such allowance be restored for the current and succeeding year to $150. per annum.
