The Professor of Technology & Agricultural Science will stand on the same footing with the other Professors in reference to fees from students attending his School—but the Assistant Professor of Mathematics shall only receive a fee of $25 from each student whom he may instruct in the special department of Engineering, except that in this respect the Faculty may make such modifications as time and experience may suggest.
