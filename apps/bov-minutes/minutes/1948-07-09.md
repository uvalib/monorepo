Moran and the University by which these ladies agree not to sell the property known as "Montebello" without first giving the University the refusal thereof; that this contract has been executed and acknowledged by Miss Virginia E. Moran, Miss Sarepta A. Moran and Miss Edna J. Moran. Mr. Perkins presented the executed contract to the meeting and fully explained its contents and it was thereupon -

**RESOLVED** THAT Colgate W. Darden, Jr., President, be and is hereby authorized and instructed to execute this contract in the name and on behalf of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, and Vincent Shea, Secretary, is hereby instructed to affix the corporate seal and to attest the same and to see that a copy of said contract is properly recorded in the Clerk's Office of the Corporation Court of the City of Charlottesville.

Mr. Perkins further reported that pursuant to instructions given him at the June 11 meeting of this Board, he had advised Mr. Holliday that the prices quoted by him on lots adjoining the Moran property were too high and that the University would not be interested in the purchase of these lots at the prices submitted.

The following agreement was presented:

WHEREAS, The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, generally known as the "University of Virginia," a corporation created and existing under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, and situated at Charlottesville, in the county of Albemarle, Virginia, is an institution of learning at which one or more units of the Transportation Reserve Officers' Training Corps are established, or about to be established; and,

WHEREAS, The Secretary of the Army, by virtue of the authority in him vested by Section 47 of the National Defense Act, approved June 3, 1916, as amended by the Act approved June 4, 1920, The Secretary of the Army is about to furnish and will from time to time hereafter furnish, to said University of Virginia, for the use of the unit or units of the Transportation Reserve Officers' Training Corps established at said University, or hereafter to be established thereat, such public animals, transportation, arms, ammunition, supplies, tentage, equipment, and uniforms as he may deem necessary, and to forage at the expense of the United States public animals so issued, subject to the provision that he shall require from the institution to which the property of the United States is issued under this authority a bond in the value of the property issued for the care and safekeeping thereof except for uniforms, expendable articles, and supplies expended in operation, maintenance, and instruction, and for its return when required.

NOW THEREFORE, KNOW ALL MEN BY THESE PRESENTS, that said The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia is hereby held and firmly bound unto the United States of America, in the just and full sum of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00) lawful money of the United States, for which payment, well and truly to be made, it binds itself, its successors and assigns, firmly by these presents.

THE CONDITION OF THIS OBLIGATION IS SUCH, that if the above-bounden The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia shall take good care of the property covered by this bond and shall when required by the Secretary of the Army, duly return the same in good order to him, or to such persons as he may designate to receive the same within thirty (30) days from the receipt of notice so to do, except uniforms, expendable articles, supplies expended in operation, maintenance and instruction, such property as has been worn out in the service for which it was intended, and/or property lost or destroyed without negligence of said The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, or its agents, including students under its jurisdiction, then this obligation to be void and of no effect; otherwise to be and remain in full force and virtue.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the above-bounden The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia has executed this instrument under its seal this ninth day of July, A.D., 1948, by its undersigned representative, pursuant to authority of its governing body.

THE RECTOR AND VISITORS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA

ATTEST:

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Secretary

It was, thereupon,

**RESOLVED**, that Colgate W. Darden, Jr., President of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, be and he is hereby authorized and requested to execute said bond in the name and on behalf of said The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, and that Vincent Shea, Secretary of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, be and he is hereby authorized and requested to affix the corporate seal of said Corporation to said bond, attesting the same and delivering the said bond to the Judge Advocate General of the United States Army.

Pursuant to direction of the Board at its last meeting, Mr. Vincent Shea, Bursar, presented a report on the provisions governing the use of revenues derived from the library fee imposed on each student. The matter was referred to the Attorney for the University with the request that he investigate the status of this fee under the act authorizing the bond issue.

A statement prepared at the request of the Board by Mr. Shea, Bursar, was distributed, showing the cost to the University of annuities purchased from the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association.

President Darden reported that on authorization of the Board given at its meeting on 11 June 1948, and after consultation with Dr. Jordan and the Committee on a Salary Plan for the Clinical Staff of the Department of Medicine, the following plan was agreed upon.

**Head of the Department of Surgery and Gynecology:** salary from the University $10,000, plus $5,000 guaranteed from departmental earnings - total $15,000. Fees from limited private practice credited to departmental earnings.

**Head of the Department of Internal Medicine:** salary from the University $10,000, plus $5,000 guaranteed from departmental earnings - total $15,000. Fees from limited private practice credited to departmental earnings.

Salary scale of other faculty members, exclusive of those in the Departments of Clinical Pathology, Ophthalmology and Otolaryngology, where special arrangements obtain, is shown below.

The University does not guarantee any of the income over and above the basic salary.

All professors of grades Full, Associate, and Assistant are required to contribute 20 percent of current earnings from private practice for running expenses of their respective departments, including support of research.

Fifty percent of the annual surpluses above ceilings from private practice earnings after all departmental expenses for operation and research, as approved by the Dean, have been paid, is to be allowed to accumulate and remain intact, to be placed in a common fund from which to draw for the improvement and development of the Medical School as a whole.

The budgets of all departments must be approved by the Dean of the Medical School. All financial transactions must clear through the Office of the Bursar and be subject to pre-audit.

The salaries of all employees of medical departments other than doctors are to be brought in line with the State Classification Plan for such employees.

Mr. Perkins, Attorney for the University, presented a request from Mrs. W. A. Lambeth to purchase a strip of land which adjoins a lot owned by her, and which strip is a part of certain property bequeathed to the University by the late Dr. Lambeth.

Mr. Perkins stated that the Board of Visitors has no authority to return any of the property. The matter was referred to the Buildings and Grounds Committee and the President was directed to act on the authorization of said Committee.

An offer by Mrs. A. E. Walker to sell the University certain property near the South Gate was referred to the Buildings and Grounds Committee for recommendation.

The following resolution was adopted:

WHEREAS, the Honorable William M. Tuck, Governor of Virginia, in a letter dated June 23, 1948, addressed to each member of this Board, called attention to the provisions of Section 22, 39 and 40 of the General Appropriations Act of 1948 (Acts 1948, pp. 1123 et seq.), imposing personal liability upon the members of the governing board of any state institution for deficit spending not previously authorized in writing by the Governor; and

WHEREAS, at a meeting of the Rector and Visitors held June 11, 1948, the General Budget of the University for the session year 1948-1949 was approved, in which expenditures in excess of estimated revenue in the amount of $56,048.00, were approved, and the Budget for the Hospital Division of the University for the same period was likewise approved, in which estimated expenditures in the amount of $97,514.00 over estimated income were included; and

WHEREAS, the President has this day advised the Board that the increase in student fees for the 1948-49 session, likewise approved at the June 11, 1948, meeting of the Board would more than offset the estimated deficit in the General Budget of the University for the same period, but, in view of the uncertainty of operating conditions in the University Hospital no accurate forecast can now be made whether, or to what extent, the deficit of $97,514.00 will actually arise from the operation of this Department for such session year;

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the President, the Bursar and all other administrative and accounting officers of the University are hereby instructed and directed to confine actual disbursements in the operation of the University, and in the operation of the University Hospital, to the amounts actually appropriated for those purposes in the General Appropriation Act of 1948, and that they shall in no way, manner or amount exceed such appropriations without prior knowledge of and approval from this Board; and

**RESOLVED FURTHER**, that the Bursar be and he hereby is requested and directed to submit to the Board monthly a statement of Income and Disbursements from all sources arising, together with a statement showing by Departments and/or Principal Accounts the amounts appropriated therefor and expended therein under the General University and the University Hospital Budgets.

The following resolution was adopted:

**RESOLVED** by The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the Board wishes to go on record that its recommendations of applicants for admission be given no greater consideration than those of any other alumnus.

The report of the Finance Committee on the disposition of the Randall-MacIver Trust Funds was presented by Mr. Black, Chairman, and was approved by the Board with thanks.

The Finance Committee respectfully reports to the Board of Visitors as follows:

At the May meeting of the Board this Committee was requested to report on the disposition of two certain trust funds known as the "Joanna Davidge Randall-MacIver Fund" and the "Virginia Mason Davidge Fund."

Each of these funds yields annually a total income of about $2,500.00.

The trust instrument which created the funds provides that the income shall be applied by the authorities of the University "to the foundation of two or more scholarships or fellowships, or similar benefactions, of such amounts and for such purposes as the governing Board of said University may determine."

The Committee had the benefit of a memorandum prepared by the donor, David Randall-MacIver at a conference with Dr. John L. Newcomb held some years ago. The Committee also consulted Dr. James Southall Wilson, Chairman of the Faculty Committee on Fellowships, and Dean Ivey Lewis, Chairman of the Scholarship Committee. Mr. Vincent Shea also gave us the benefit of his views. The memorandum provided that a student loan fund should be established with a portion of the trust income, and that the balance of the trust income should be used for fellowships and scholarships. However, it has developed that there is no longer a need of student loan funds. Apparently the memorandum, written in 1932, contemplated that the need of this loan fund would be a temporary one, since it proceeded to provide that when the need ceased, that the income should be used for fellowships.

The Committee has endeavored to follow as far as possible the suggestions of the donor made in the memorandum; however, this report, in some respects, does not follow the exact dictates of the memorandum. Where there has been a departure from the memorandum, it is the opinion of the Committee that there was, in each instance, a good reason for the departure.

Specifically, the Committee recommends that the Board establish two separate foundations, the first to be known as "Virginia Mason Davidge Foundation" consisting of five fellowships or scholarships, each of $500.00 annually, to be offered both to men and women, for graduate courses, or, in the discretion of the President, for undergraduate courses.

The second fund is to be known as the "Joanna Davidge Randall-MacIver Foundation." It will offer five fellowships or scholarships to male students in any school of the University, the allocation to be in the discretion of the President. However, in the distribution of these fellowships or scholarships, students in the fine arts, music, drama, art and architecture, are to be preferred.

The donor's memorandum provided as to this fund that - "half shall be definitely assigned to the Fine Arts Section; the remainder of them shall be assigned to any section that the President may determine."

It was the understanding of the Committee that the reference to "Fine Arts Section" meant the literal definition of the Fine Arts, that is, architecture, drama, music and art, and similar subjects.

The Committee, however, did not think it wise to allocate one-half of these fellowships or scholarships to the music, art and drama sections because of the doubt as to whether there would be a sufficient demand for these fellowships or scholarships if limited to courses in these subjects only. It has, therefore, recommended that preference be given to students in these courses, but that if no demand exists in these courses, students in other schools may avail themselves of these scholarships and fellowships.

In the distribution of the fellowships and scholarships under each foundation, the beneficiaries are to be selected upon the basis of their ability, scholarship, character and need.

Mr. Carrington, Chairman of a committee to study the National Collegiate Athletic Association regulations, reported that Captain Pritchett, upon his return from the NCAA meeting, had informed his coaches that no athletic scholarships could be offered for the session 1948-49. The coaches then wrote various prospects that the NCAA Code was being adhered to by the University.

Mr. Gay stated that at a meeting of the Special Committee on Athletics held at the Monticello Hotel on the night of May 20, it was agreed to recommend to the Board of Visitors that the University continue its policy of offering athletic scholarships through the Alumni Association.

**RESOLVED** that the President take steps to adjust the salary of Mr. Shea to compensate for the additional duties assigned to him.

The Attorney for the University, Mr. Perkins, reported that before a proper resolution could be drawn authorizing the issuance of revenue bonds in an amount necessary to complete the dining hall and cold storage facilities at Mary Washington College, it would be necessary to determine the exact amount of the bonds to be issued, the method of amortization, etc., and that to comply with the law a special meeting of the Board would be necessary to approve such a bond issue. Mr. Perkins further stated that he doubted the advisability of issuing revenue bonds without a firm source of revenue. He suggested that a dining hall fee might have to be imposed, the income from which would be earmarked for the amortization of the bonds.

Mr. Perkins stated that he was working with President Combs and Mr. Woodward, Treasurer of Mary Washington College, to determine the amount of bonds necessary, and planned to consult the Attorney General as to the legal requirements which must be met before such bonds could be issued.

Mrs. Wailes, Chairman of the Mary Washington Committee, reported that bids had been secured for the furnishing of the lower floor, containing the public rooms, of "Brompton," as the official residence of the President of Mary Washington College. The lowest bid received was approximately $23,000, by Miss McClelland, using furniture supplied by Biggs Antique Company of Richmond.

Mr. Darden stated that he did not think it wise to approve the furnishing of this property at the expense of the State. He suggested that the College be authorized to advance the money if the Alumnae Association of the College would agree to raise the money by private subscription.

Mr. Gay suggested that it might be advisable to liquidate the investment on the property. Mr. Darden stated that the land would be needed for future expansion of the College and that he did not believe it advisable to dispose of it.

The following resolution was adopted:

**RESOLVED** by The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that no funds of Mary Washington College be used in furnishing "Brompton"; and -

**BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED** that President Combs, if he takes up residence at "Brompton," be requested to furnish such rooms as he may occupy at his own expense, and that the matter of furnishing the public rooms at "Brompton" be left for future financing through the aid of Alumnae or other memorial or philanthropical organizations.

The Board authorized the President of Mary Washington College to investigate the possibility of refunding the balances due on two 1938 PWA Bond issues of $82,500 and $138,000, and directed the Chancellor of Mary Washington College, if such an arrangement can be worked out with the State authorities, to proceed with such refunding.

There being no further business to come before the meeting, the same was adjourned after a motion to that effect had been made, seconded and carried.
