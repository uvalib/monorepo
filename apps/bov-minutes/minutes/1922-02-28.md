The following resolution was unanimously adopted with respect to the lease to the City of Charlottesville of the tract of land on Observatory Mountain for the purpose of constructing a filter plant, and to certain charges covering the operation of said plant and the furnishing of water therefrom for the benefit of the University:

WHEREAS, at a meeting of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, held on November 29th, 1921, a resolution was adopted authorizing the lease to the City of Charlottesville of a tract of land owned by the University and situated on Observatory Mountain, containing approximately 3 1/2 acres, for the purpose of erecting a filtration plant for the City of Charlottesvill and the University of Virginia; and

WHEREAS, said resolution appropriated to the City of Charlottesville for the purpose of assisting in constructing said filtration plant the sum of $15,000.00, or so much, if any, thereof as might be appropriated by the Legislature for the purpose of improving the water system at the University; and

WHEREAS, the Legislature did not make such appropriation for the purpose of improving the water system at the University; and

WHEREAS, it is deemed important and necessary that the water supply at the University shall be augmented and purified and with a view to attaining that end the City of Charlottesville has submitted to the Rector and Visitors of the University the following proposition:

FIRST: That a tract of land now owned by the University of Virginia, situated on Observatory Mountain, containing approximately 3 1/2 acres, and a right of way for pipe line from said tract to the Lynchburg Road, through the land owned by the University, which right of way contains approximately 1 1/2 acres, all of which is accurately described on a plat prepared by Lee H. Williamson, C.P.E., dated January 1922, together with the rights of ingress and egress thereto over the lands of the University, under the supervision of the Superintendent of Buildings and Grounds, be leased to the City of Charlottesville without charge for a term of ninety-nine years with the privilege of renewal of said lease by said City at the expiration thereof.

SECOND: In view of the fact that that portion of the present six-inch pipe line now belonging to the University, which runs from the old reservoir to the site of the proposed filtration plant will become unnecessary upon the completion of said filtration plant, and will be abandoned, and the City of Charlottesville can use the pipe in this line to advantage, that the University give said pipe, consisting of about fifteen thousand feet of six-inch cast iron pipe, to the City of Charlottesville without charge, with the right of ingress and egress to University property for the purpose of taking up and removing said pipe; in consideration of which the City of Charlottesville agrees to place a six-inch pipe line from the present water main in Observatory Road past the site of the new gymnasium into Ivy Road, and also a six-inch pipe line out Rugby Road from University Avenue to the city limits.

THIRD: That the City of Charlottesville agrees to furnish to the University without charge 175,000 gallons of water per day, for the term of the lease contemplated hereby, for the use of the public buildings and of the officials, professors and employees of the University residing on University property. A meter shall be placed upon the water main leading to the University at the point where said main intersects with the City main leading from filterplant, which meter shall be read at monthly intervals, and all water in excess of said 175,000 gallons per day used aforesaid shall be paid for by the University at the minimum rate then charged by the City of Charlottesville for water, or at a rate to be agreed on, which rate, however, shall not exceed five cents per 1000 gallons.

FOURTH: The University to pay to the City of Charlottesville one-seventh of the cost of operating and maintaining the contemplated filtration plant, and the booster pump and station, said one-seventh, however, not to exceed the sum of $900.00.

And WHEREAS, the above proposition is considered advantageous to the University, and it is the sense of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the same should be accepted.

BE IT RESOLVED, That the Rector is hereby authorized and directed on behalf of the University of Virginia to enter into a contract with the City of Charlottesville, which contract shall have been first approved by the attorney for the University, carrying out and putting into effect the provisions set out above.

The following was adopted with respect to leave of absence to Prof. John H. Yoe:

RESOLVED, That leave of absence for one year, without salary, be and is hereby granted to Mr. John H. Yoe, Ass't Prof. of Chemistry.

The following was adopted with respect to leave of absence for Prof. R. C. Minor:

RESOLVED, That a leave of absence for the remainder of the session be and is hereby granted to Prof. R. C. Minor of the Law School, with salary, on account of illness, and the Rector be requested to express to him the sympathy and best wishes of the Board in his illness.

A letter was read from Prof. Minor suggesting arrangements to care for Prof. Minor's classes, during his absence, which was approved, together with the appropriation of $925 to pay the salaries of the necessary substitutes, as follows:

Mr. C. F. Melson will take over the course in Real Property, and Mr. W. F. Cox, Jr., will take care of the balance of Prof. Minor's work. Mr. A. R. Bowles, Jr., will take over the Commercial Law Course, now being taught by Mr. Cox, and Mr. R. Y. Button will be assigned to some of the under-graduate work heretofore done by Messrs. Cox and Melson.

Prof. Charles Hancock, Supervising Engineer, submitted the following report of expenditures in connection with the New Heating Plant, together with an estimate for the second unit thereof:

I beg leave to submit for your information the following statement of appropriations and ex- penditures for the new heating system:

The construction is now very nearly complete. East Range and East Lawn are now being heated by the new system, all radiators and piping are installed in the Rotunda, and the latter is now being tested under pressure to detect any possible leaks. Unless some unexpected trouble developes the Rotunda will have hot water turned on before the end of this week.

For the next step in construction I submit the following estimates and recommendations:

I respectfully recommend that you authorize construction in the general order outlined, and proceeding as far as the money available will permit.

The construction of the second unit was authorized in the following resolution, unanimously adopted:

RESOLVED, That as soon as the Appropriation Bill carrying an appropriation for the heating plant of $30,000 per year for two years, shall have been passed, the Committee on Heating is authorized to let a contract for the second section of the heating plant, at an estimated cost of $60,000, as per estimate of Prof. Chas Hancock, Supervising Engineer, herewith submitted.

RESOLVED, further, That the Bursar is hereby authorized to borrow, if need be, such sums from time to time as may be required to carry on the work until the appropriation contained in the Appropriation Bill for the year 1923-24 shall have become available.

With respect to the compensation to be alowed to Prof. Charles Hancock, Supervising Engineer, of the New Heating Plant, the President stated that after conference with some members of the Committee and Prof Hancock it was agreed that he should be allowed the sum of $1000 for his services in connection with the construction of the first unit, which action was approved by the Board, and it was further ordered that Prof. Hancock be allowed the sum of $1000 as compensation for his work for supervising the construction of the second unit of said plant.

The following offer of H. L. Spratte to rent the coal bin of the University was presented in writing:

In re; proposal to rent coal bins.

In connection with the coal bins and coal supply for the University, I desire to submit a proposal for your consideration. And in doing so, please understand that no gain is to be derived by me from the University, but on the other hand, the plan places the University's coal bins upon a income producing basis.

The coal requirements of the University are 5000 tons per annum, dumped over your bins; 3000 tons of which amount has to be delivered by truck or otherwise to the various heating plants on the University grounds. The cost of this delivery to the University is 42 cts. per ton. amounting to $1260 per year; this does not make any allowance for the other 2000 tons, which are consumed by the plant located at the bins. In addition to this, you have a repair and upkeep charge on the bins which amounts to $400.00 per annum, one-half of which is bonre by the C & O. This makes a total yearly cost of $1460.00, after your coal has been placed on the bins by the carrier.

My proposal is, to rent your bins for a period of 10 years for the purpose of supplying coal to the University community and vicinity, and in consideration for said rental, I agree to distribute, without charge, the 5000 tons of coal per year from the bins to the various heating plants. Your cost will end when the coal is placed by the carrier over the bins, and my duties will begin there and end when I have distributed the coal as the authorities at the University shall direct, which includes the delivery of the coal to designated pointes in front of the boilers of the plant at the bins, and also, the coal for the new Gymnasium which is estimated at 250 tons yearly. And I agree to assume the repair and upkeep charge of $200.00 per annum, in the same manner as now cared for by the University.

Should the University desire me to purchase coal for them, the price and quality of same shall be approved by the University before said purchase is made.

Satisfactory bond for the performance of these conditions to be furnished by me in such amount as shall be required by you.

I would like for the contract to become effective, beginning with the scholastic year 1922-23, in the event you should pass favorably upon the proposition. Such agreement as reached to be embodied in contract.

The following action was taken in the foregoing proposition:

RESOLVED, That the offer be accepted in principle, and the details of the necessary contract be arranged by the attorney of the University of Virginia, after consultation with the Superintendent of Buildings and Grounds, provided the coal of the University be kept in separate bins, and the offer to make good the loss in cars be not insisted upon, and the Rector is authorized to sign same on behalf of the Rector and Visitors.

The question as to whether the Centennial Endowment Fund should be held and administered by the Alumni Endowmment Board or by the Board of Visitors was discussed at some length, and in order that the question might be settled, Mr. Scott was appointed a Committee to associate with himself two other members of the Board to confer with the Alumni Board of Trustees with respect to said question.

A letter was read from Mrs. Slayden calling attention to the nuisance existing by reason of the trash and garbage of the University being dumped and burned near the power plant back of Cabell Hall. The matter was referred to the Committee on Buildings and Grounds.

On motion the meeting then adjourned.
