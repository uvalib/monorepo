Mr. E. C.

On motion of Mr. Gay that members of the faculty to be recommended for promotion be furnished to the members of the Board two weeks in advance of the meeting at which they are to be considered, together with their years of service and salary, same was adopted.

The following motion by Mr. Anderson was adopted:

RESOLVED that the sum of $2500 be and the same is hereby appropriated from the unexpended balance of the University's income on private endowment to pay its share of the cost of a report by the John Price Jones Corporation upon the feasibility and advisability of putting on a campaign to raise funds for the University and Alumni Association. The total cost is $3500â€”the remaining $1000 will be paid by the Alumni Association.

In connection with the recommendation of the special committee on the athletic situation submitted at a meeting of the Board, March 26, 1946, "that the remaining debt of the Old General Athletic Association to the University be balanced" in order to more clearly explain the intent of the action of the Board in the matter, the following motion was adopted:

Since it appears to the Board that the receipts from intercollegiate athletics over the last four or five years have exceeded the expenditures in this field during the same period by an amount equal to if not in excess of the debt of the old Athletic Association to the University of Virginia remaining at the end of the current year, and since the excess earnings of intercollegiate athletics have been used by the University for its general purposes instead of applying them to the payment of the old indebtedness;

NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that the remaining debt of the old Athletic Association to the University of Virginia in the amount of $25,681.55 evidenced by bonds of the Athletic Association, be and the same is hereby charged off our books and the bonds are hereby ordered cancelled.

On motion it was RESOLVED that a special committee of three members of the Board be appointed on Student Activities, to consider student problems, and to meet with the students, to act as liaison with the Board. Mr. Gay brought up the question of the University's relation to "Corks & Curls" and asked that the matter be referred to this committee for study and report back to the Board.

The following report of the Finance Committee was received and the recommendations contained therein were approved by the Board:

The Finance Committee of the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia, respectfully reports to the Board of Visitors, as follows;

That on May 22, 1946, a meeting of this committee was held at the office of Scott & Stringfellow in Richmond, Virginia, with the following present: Mr. Barron F. Black, Chairman, and Mr. Thomas B. Gay, two members of the Committee; Dr. J. L. Newcomb, President, E. I. Carruthers, Bursar, and Mr. Edward C. Anderson, Fiscal Advisor. The third member of the Committee, Mr. Maitland Bustard, was not present.

At that meeting, after full discussion, the following resolution was passed unanimously:

BE IT RESOLVED that interest on all fraternity loans be reduced to 4% as of January 1, 1942, and in the instance where a fraternity has paid more than 4% in the period from January 1, 1942, to July 1, 1946, the average above 4% shall be credited upon the principal of the loans of such fraternities. In addition, there shall be added to all fraternity loans these sums expended by the University of Virginia for taxes, insurance and repairs, and also sums owed the University for unpaid interest.

New contracts shall be worked out with each fraternity on the balances arrived at by this method with proper amortization of principal arranged for in these contracts. It shall be optional with all of the fraternities as to whether or not they shall accept this proposition.

The Committee respectfully recommends that the Board of Visitors take appropriate action affirming the action of the committee as set out in the resolution above stated.

President Newcomb presented the budget for 1946-47, carrying estimated revenues from all sources of $4,429,812.00, and estimated expenditures of $4,340,876.00, with an estimated surplus of $88,936.00 after considerable time had been devoted to studying the various divisions and departments, it was unanimously adopted.

On motion of Mr. Gay, it was RESOLVED, that beginning with July, 1946, monthly meetings of the Board be held on the second Friday in each month, and that the secretary give one week's notice to each member of the Board of such meeting.

President Combs presented the following recommendation on behalf of Mary Washington College which was approved:

* Increase in the salary of Dr. Lee W. Ryan, Assistant Professor of Spanish from $2,150 to $2,550 for the session of 1946-47, plus the additional pay effective July 1, 1946 in lieu of the bonus expiring June 30, 1946.

The following motion was defeated:

RESOLVED, that non-boarding male students be admitted to Mary Washington College next session, with the distinct understanding that this is not to be a permanent policy but is simply a temporary deviation from the traditional policy of the college in an effort to help relieve an unprecedented situation.

RESOLVED, that Mary Washington College be and is hereby authorized to purchase a tract of land lying between the northern boundary of the present campus and the New No. 1 highway, known as the by-pass, embracing approximately twelve acres, at a cost of $20,000, upon execution of the deed, together with certificate of title and bastract approved by the attorney for the University.

In addition, there shall be added to all fraternity loans these sums expended by the University of Virginia for taxes, insurance and repairs, and also sums owed the University for unpaid interest.

New contracts shall be worked out with each fraternity on the balances arrived at by this method with proper amortization of principal arranged for in these contracts. It shall be optional with all of the fraternities as to whether or not they shall accept this proposition.

The Committee respectfully recommends that the Board of Visitors take appropriate action affirming the action of the committee as set out in the resolution above stated.
