Resolved, that this resolution shall go into effect on the 15th day of September 1897.

The Rector announced that nominations were in order for filling the Offices of Proctor and Superintendent of Grounds and Buildings provided for in the foregoing resolutions.

Thereupon, Mr McCormick presented the name of Mr Wm D. Cabell and stated that he did so by request but would vote for him.

On motion of Mr Harmon,

Resolved, that the Bond of the Proctor be fixed at $50,000.00 with the usual conditions, to be approved by the attorney for the Board and that the University pay the cost of said bond.

On motion of Mr McIlwaine the following in reference to Col Mosby was unanimously adopted:

Whereas this Board has just heard with profound regret of the serious accident which has just happened to Col John S. Mosby within the bounds of the University of Virginia.

Resolved, that we deplore his misfortune and trust that a kind Providence will soon restore him to perfect health and strength, and the use of the Infirmary is hereby tendered to Col Mosby and his daughters so long as they need it.

Mr Harmon offered the following preamble and resolution and moved the adoption of the same:

Whereas McKim, Meade & White, the Architects in charge of the work of the University have, in response to resolutions of the Executive Committee adopted April 3d 1897, furnished the two following statements, showing that the amount necessary to complete the buildings under the contract with C. E. Langley & Co is $92,518.55, according to the claim of Langley & Co, which however includes certain items of Extra work which are in dispute and not conceded, and that the amount actually necessary to complete the work will not exceed $89,438.69, which said statements are as follows:

Needed to finish according to Langley & Co.

Langley applications, Ap1 8th:

University has advanced.

And whereas there may be due the contractors upon completion of the buildings more than the larger amounts named, therefore,

Resolved, that the Building Committee is hereby authorized to make an agreement with Langley & Co, the contractors for the University buildings to the effect that all future payments on the contract shall be made by warrants drawn by said Langley & Co and approved by the superintendent of Grounds & Buildings, after having been certified by the Architects, and until the buildings are finally completed and accepted that such payments and warrants shall be made only for current pay rolls and to other parties doing work and furnishing materials for work hereafter done and materials hereafter furnished.

Mr McIlwaine offered the following as an amendment to Mr Harmon's resolution:

Provided, however, that by this action it is not intended in anywise to release the Supervising architects from any liability arising out of their having given certificates for the payment of more money to the said contractors than they were entitled to under their contract.

Mr McCormick offered the following as a substitute for McIlwaine's amendment to Mr Harmon's resolution:

Provided, however this resolution is not intended in anywise to release any person whatsoever, responsible by law to the University on account of the planning and building of the new buildings at the University.

The vote was first taken upon Mr McCormick's substitute for Mr McIlwaine's amendment, which was by ayes and nos, a recorded vote being called for and ordered. On call of the roll the vote was as follows.

The substitute having been adopted the vote was then taken in like manner upon the original resolution of Mr Harmon as amended by Mr McCormick's substitute for Mr McIlwaine's amendment, which resulted in the adoption of the resolution so amended by the following vote:

In favor of the resolution as amended:

The Beta Theta Pi Fraternity of the University of Va through Mr Wm C. Cabell presented a petition and supplement to the Board which are in the following words and figures:

University of Virginia

To the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia.

Gentlemen. It is the desire of the University of Virginia Chapter of the Beta Theta Pi Fraternity to build a chapter house at an early date, and a committee of our Alumni are now engaged in the collection of the necessary funds.

We wish to secure from the University the ground upon which to build, and therefore petition you in the hope that such a concession may be granted us.

The house we propose to erect, will not cost less than $5000. while it will be our aim to secure as much as $10,000. to use for this purpose. Before the plans are fully decided upon, they will be submitted to your Board for approval as regards the style of the architecture. We would further petition you to assign us a site to the north of the Gymnasium.

Very respectfully, The University of Virginia Chapter of the Beta Theta Pi Fraternity.

Gentlemen. Deeming it best to specify definitely the amount of land desired and the length of time, within which we would ask to commence active building operations, we herewith append this note to the accompanying petition. We request that the lot, which you assign us begin at the North East corner of the present fence to Dr Lambeth's yard, fronting the driveway, and continue northward 225 feet and running back westward a depth of 200. feet. We would also ask that the period of three years, from July 1st 1897, be granted us, within which to commence building. Respectfully The University of Va Chapter of the Beta Theta Pi Fraternity.

Which on being read and considered the following resolution was adopted:

Resolved, that the application made by petition University of Va Chapter of the Beta Theta Pi Fraternity, this day presented and read is hereby granted subject to the conditions fixed and prescribed by the resolutions passed by the Visitors at a meeting held June 29th 1892. but clauses 5 & 6 of said resolutions are now so modified that the right to use the said buildings and to the exercise of the privilege and rights hereby granted shall not cease unless the said Chapter shall cease to use said proposed building for five consecutive years.

The written application and description of the land wanted for the purposes of said building are made a part of this resolution and to be recorded herewith. The Executive Committee is hereby empowered to carry out this resolution, and to make such a written agreement as will carry out the purposes embodied in this resolution.

The Rector submitted a report from the Chairman of the Faculty addressed to the Board and a copy of a letter from him in reply thereto, which, upon being read and considered, on motion the following resolution was adopted:

Resolved, that the letter of the Rector of the 25th of Feb. 1897, in reply to the resolution of the Faculty in respect to the shelving in the Rotunda, be approved as the sense of this Board; and that said resolution and letter of reply be spread on the minutes.

The resolution and letter, referred to above, are in the following words and figures:

To the Rector & Visitors of the University of Virginia. In the Report to the Visitors of Feb. 4th the Faculty said, that, being ignorant of the actual state of the University funds available for purposes of restoration, they made no recommendation on the subject of Library equipment. They have since heard that there is a deficit of about $10,500. in the funds presently available which are or will soon be required to discharge obligations already incurred. In view of this, of the statutory prohibition of the incurment of debt by the University, and of the disastrous effect upon public opinion and in the State Legislature of any defalcation in the payment of University obligations, the Faculty respectfully and earnestly recommend to the Visitors that no further expenditure be authorized for Library equipment or any other purpose in connection with restoration until the necessary money has been obtained and is actually available.

The rough shelves now at the Museum can be moved over to the Rotunda, and the books placed upon them and used, until better provision can be made and paid for.

Teste, Jas B. Baker, Secretary. Transmitted

P. B. Barringer,

Chairman of the Faculty.

Feb. 25th 1897.

Dr P. B. Barringer, Chairman of the Faculty of the University of Virginia.

My dear Sir, I herewith acknowledge the receipt of the resolution of the Faculty of \_\_\_\_\_ date, addressed to the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia. There may or may not be a meeting of the Board before their annual meeting in June, as soon as they meet I will bring the resolution before them. In the meantime, as the Rector and therefore a member of the Corporation, I desire through you to state to the Faculty, that as intelligent men and sworn officers of the law, the Visitors are fully aware of their obligations thereunder, and feel much their responsibilities as to the policy that should guide them, both as to the internal and external government of the institution. They will probably be unwilling and unable to transfer their responsibilities as to this management, to the Faculty, otherwise than as to the matters of discipline and the teaching of the separate schools, of which, however they must hold the general control, but they do not wish to interfere with the details. The finances of the institution, they will think, must be entirely under their control. The Building Committee seems to have been entirely ignored in the Faculty resolution. I, as the Chairman of that Committee, would state to the Faculty, that the Committee is in close connection with their parent body, and with a due sense of their responsibility to that body and acting under their direction.

A true copy Robert Robertson.

Sincerely Yours,

(Signed) W. C. N. Randolph Rector.

On motion of Mr Gordon the following resolutions of thanks for contributions to the Library were adopted by unanimous votes:

Whereas, the Syndices of the Pitt Press of Cambridge have generously donated to the University of Virginia £50. in books of said press as a contribution towards the restoration of the library of the University, which was so severely injured by the fire of November, 1895.

Resolved, that the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, in accepting said donation, do tender their most cordial thanks to said Syndices for this graceful and generous manifestation of sympathy.

Resolved, that a copy of these resolutions be transmitted to said Syndices, through Captain W. Gordon McCabe.

Whereas, the Clarendon Press of Oxford has generously donated to the University of Virginia £50. in books of said Press as a contribution towards the restoration of the library of the University which was so severely injured by the fire of November, 1895.

Resolved, that the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, in accepting said donation, do tender their most cordial thanks to said Clarendon Press for this graceful and generous manifestation of sympathy.

Resolved, that a copy of these resolutions be transmitted to said Clarendon Press, through Captain W. Gordon McCabe.

Mr Gordon, chairman of the Committee on the question of creating an Executive officer of the University submitted the report of his Committee, which was read and on motion the following resolutions were adopted in reference thereto:

Resolved, that the Report of the Committee on the question of creating an Executive Officer of the University be laid on table for consideration and action at the annual meeting in June 1897; and that the Secretary cause typewritten copies thereof to be made and forwarded to each member of the Board.

Resolved, further, that the Proctor do pay to J. Morton Fultz, Stenographer, his account of three dollars for services in connection with the preparation of said report.

Resolved, that the City of Charlottesville be authorized to erect a reservoir or stand pipe, on the grounds of the University at such point on the grounds as may be suitable and agreeable to the Visitors, to be determined at the regular annual meeting in June next and upon terms then to be agreed on.

Resolved, that a committee of three, consisting of the Rector, A. C. Gordon and Daniel Harmon, to examine the accounts of the late Proctor, the securities held by him for the University, giving a list of the same and at the same time to examine the accounts of the Chairman of the Faculty so far as he has received and disbursed any money, and said Committee shall report under this resolution to the Rector and Visitors. The said Committee of three shall make a full and complete examination and report as to all the conditions of the office of the late Proctor and they shall take a proper receipt from the incoming Proctor, at the foot of a copy of the Inventory to be taken as aforesaid, of all securities, monies and other properties that may be turned over to the incoming Proctor. The said Committee is hereby given the power to employ an expert and to contract with him for reasonable compensation.

On motion the Board adjourned sine die.

Teste,
