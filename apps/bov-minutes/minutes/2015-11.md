**Memorial Resolution for Franklin Kipps Birckhead**

**Frank Birckhead, a former member of the Board of Visitors, passed away unexpectedly on October 18. He was a valued member of the Board from 1994 to 1998 and a very active member of the Charlottesville and University Communities. The Rector read the following resolution, and on motion, the Board adopted the resolution:**

**MEMORIAL RESOLUTION FOR FRANKLIN KIPPS BIRCKHEAD**

**WHEREAS, Franklin K. Birckhead was born in Charlottesville, Virginia, and earned his B.A. in Commerce with a concentration in Accounting from the University of Virginia in 1976. While at UVA he managed the men’s basketball team and served as the team’s head manager for their first ACC championship in 1975-76; and**

**WHEREAS, Mr. Birckhead was founder and CEO of Moneywise Payroll, and was founder and President of the Jefferson Society of Certified Public Accountants; and**

**WHEREAS, Mr. Birckhead was a life-long Charlottesville resident who was dedicated to his community, serving on the boards of many organizations including the Miller School of Albemarle, the Piedmont Family YMCA, and the Senior Center; and**

**WHEREAS, Mr. Birckhead was an ardent fan and generous supporter of the UVA basketball team as well as other sports; and**

**WHEREAS, Mr. Birckhead was appointed to the Board of Visitors by Governor George Allen in 1994, and served with dedication until 1998; and**

**WHEREAS, Mr. Birckhead gave countless hours to the University while on the Board, serving on various committees including the Executive Committee, Student Affairs and Athletics, Finance, and as chair of the Audit Committee; and**

**WHEREAS, Mr. Birckhead passed away on October 18, 2015;**

**RESOLVED, the Board of Visitors commemorates the life of Franklin K. Birckhead, notably his exceptional contributions to the University of Virginia community, and extends its deepest condolences to his family and friends, including his wife Jackie, his children Ryan and Kipps, his brother Landon, and those whose lives he touched.**

**Comments by the Rector**

**The Rector asked Ms. Harker to give a brief report on the actions at the Medical Center Operating Board meeting the day before. This committee report can be found at:**

**Report by the President**

**President Sullivan introduced the new Vice President for Information Technology, Ron Hutchins, who assumed his position on August 1st. She said his role would be to anticipate UVA’s future IT needs while working with leaders to create and promote a University-wide strategy for information technology.**

**President Sullivan also gave a report on progress in implementing the Cornerstone Plan and the outlook for federal legislation and for the General Assembly’s 2016 session.**

**Cornerstone Plan**

**President Sullivan said the University continues to make steady progress in bringing the Cornerstone Plan to life. Some examples:**

*   **Career Services: As part of the Total Advising initiative, through the UVA Career Center six career communities are offered, focusing on Business; Education; Public Service; Government and Law; Engineering, Science, and Technology; and Creative Arts, Media and Design. These communities began last year as online-only virtual networks, but each one is now staffed on Grounds by a career adviser. These communities allow students, regardless of their majors, to get advice from alumni and employers about specific careers.  This semester, the communities are holding events focused on careers in global development; advertising; architecture; education policy; and the Foreign Service.**
*   **First-Year Seminars: The first-year advising seminars continue to grow; they are a critical part of Total Advising. This semester, 83 COLA (College Advising Seminar) classes and eight “Intro to Engineering” sections, enrolling a total of 1,723 students, are offered.**
*   **Total Advising Center: The initial design process for adapting the second floor of Clemons Library to create a “Total Advising Center” is complete. This centrally-located resource will allow students to find all the information they need related to advising, internships, career counseling, study abroad, personal mentoring, and so on. Construction will begin this January, and the Center will open by January 2017.**
*   **Pan-University Research Institute: Last month, the Provost issued a call for proposals for the next pan-university research institute. Letters of Intent are due November 16, with full proposals due before February 16. The new institute will be named by the beginning of May. This will be the second in a continuing series of pan-university research institutes that began with the launch of the Data Science Institute.**
*   **Generational Turnover of Faculty: In addition to regular, ongoing, faculty hiring plans, the Provost has approved 20 new faculty searches for interdisciplinary positions in partnerships across schools, as well as 11 “Target of Opportunity” searches. These strategic hires will help us in efforts to diversify the faculty.**
*   **Organizational Excellence: The University is in the pilot stage of redesigning the Travel and Expense Management program, with full integration to take place next spring. This will greatly enhance “duty of care” capabilities, increase the ability to comply with federal export-control regulations, and streamline travel and expense processes for travelers. The automation of expense reporting will significantly reduce processing costs. In fact, full implementation of automation will help eliminate an annual use of paper that, if stacked together, would be the height of three Rotundas.**

**Federal Outlook**

**President Sullivan said the recently-passed budget deal suspends the debt ceiling and lifts sequestration for FY 2016 and FY 2017. The deal also sets a short-term continuing resolution through December 11;**

**adds $80 billion to discretionary spending levels, split evenly between defense and non-defense; and cuts hospital repayment rates for newly acquired off-campus practices, and extends Medicare sequestration cuts to offset additional discretionary funding.**

**The House and Senate are negotiating final omnibus appropriations now; the deal should help with funding for research and student aid. Planned Parenthood and other partisan issues could still derail the omnibus bill.**

**_Research Infrastructure Needs/Improvement_**

**The federal government provided 60% of the University’s research funding in FY 2013. Most of the funding is still largely driven by competitive review, and it depends on the overall agency budget profile. Federal agencies have largely been held flat, but should see small increases in FY 2016.**

**Bipartisan support for research is apparent, but funding is always squeezed by larger priorities and disputes (healthcare, military benefits, etc.)**

**_Higher Education Authorization Act_**

**Many issues are affected by the Higher Education Authorization (HEA) Act, including student aid, accreditation, campus safety, debt repayment, and regulatory burdens.**

**The House and Senate are working on draft legislation, but they have focused on passing K-12 legislation first.  HEA will likely start moving early next year. Some likely issues and policies for inclusion in HEA:**

*   **FAFSA simplification**
*   **Streamlining student aid options**
*   **Restoring year-round Pell grants**
*   **Simplifying loan repayment options**
*   **Streamlining regulations**
*   **Reforming campus safety/sexual assault policies (some provisions from CASA)**

**_Campus Accountability and Safety Act (CASA)_**

**The Campus Accountability and Safety Act (CASA) is a bipartisan bill addressing Title IX compliance and sexual assault policies. Senator Warner is a co-sponsor.**

**The co-sponsors have worked with the community to improve legislation, but there are still concerns, including a one-size-fits all approach and inflexibility of some language; very large fines for non-compliance with Title IX; the role of confidential advisors and other new responsibilities for campus employees; a 24-hour notification mandate; and current legislation that does not address issues with OCR guidance or the length of OCR investigations.**

**CASA is unlikely to be adopted as currently drafted; some provisions may be rolled into the HEA reauthorization.**

**2016 General Assembly Session**

**President Sullivan said elections were held last week for all 140 members. Republicans maintained control of both the House (66-34) and the Senate (21-19). There are 11 new members of the House and eight new Senators.**

**President Sullivan said new members always bring changes in committee membership and leadership. This will be especially evident in the Senate, as five of the eight Senators who will not return in 2016 were committee chairs or co-chairs, including the co-chairs of the Finance Committee and the chair of the Education and Health Committee. This will have a trickle-down effect on the leadership and membership of most, if not all, of the 11 standing committees in the Senate.**

**She said legislators will begin pre-filing legislation next Monday, November 16 for the 2016 Session, and the Governor will present his 2016-18 biennial budget on Thursday, December 17. She said a summary of the Governor’s budget proposal will be prepared and sent to the Board after December 17.**

**There will be a focus on capital needs across the Commonwealth in 2016; the University anticipates a sizable capital appropriation to pass during the session. The Governor’s capital proposal will be announced in December, and we will have a better understanding of the intent of the House and Senate after the session convenes on January 13.**

**President Sullivan has been visiting with key legislators and talking with staff from both the money committees and the Department of Planning and Budget about capital priorities. These priorities were approved by the Board in June with a few additions in September. She said University administrators will continue to meet with legislators during the session, which is scheduled to adjourn March 12.**

**Comments by the Student Member**

**Daniel Judge focused his report on ways to improve the first- year experience. He is holding weekly open hours for students and forums with members of the Board as well as a series of talks in the first year dorms. Through these initiatives he has up-to-date knowledge of the first year experience.**

**Housing is a concern because first years are forced to select off-Grounds second-year housing in early October and this is stressful. The on-Grounds process is months later, but students are afraid to wait.**

**Advising: COLAs are very helpful as well as peer advising. There remains a serious need for advising from faculty in students’ chosen areas of study. Increasing interdisciplinary studies will help; students wish to dabble in a variety of fields. Non-majors get shut out of courses in certain areas. Course experimentation is a necessary element of a liberal arts education.**

**Mental health: Last year, 46% of students have had a period of depression that has caused difficulty in functioning. Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS), is very good, but due to limited resources they are not able to reach everyone. The more support and resources they receive will improve the first-year experience and help the entire student body.**

**Following Mr. Judge’s report, members of the Board discussed the issues presented and the Rector asked for a report at the next meeting on second-year housing and CAPS funding. Student access to certain classes was discussed in depth. President Sullivan said this issue is primarily in the College. The Rector asked the Provost and President to address this at the next meeting. Mr. Katsouleas said some of it is a matter of patience; upper class students have priority to complete their requirements and so first year students may need to wait. Mr. Judge agreed, but said some first-year classes are an issue. Mr. Garofalo added that he saw this first hand with his daughter and her first-year friends. He found that some of the first-year students were not aware they would be able to get into many of their preferred courses during the drop/add period at the beginning of the semester.**

**Comments by the Faculty Senate Chair**

**Dr. Nina Solenski focused on research in her presentation. Many faculty members want to do research and are passionate about it, but few are chosen to receive research grants. Faculty members have different foci: an individual faculty member may do more educating than research, or more administrative duties, and others spend more of their time in research. She emphasized that in the zeal for bringing on new researchers it should be remembered that faculty who are at the University now are important and also need funding and other resources.**

**Dr. Solenski showed statistics on underrepresented minority science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) faculty. She said the innovators of today include many women and minorities. She walked the Board through a typical day of a faculty member who conducts research. She said writing a research grant takes about 150 to 200 hours to complete, and associated administrative tasks consume a great deal of time. This time is time away from conducting the research.**

**Dr. Solenski said that for faculty, “publish or perish” is very real. Many articles are rejected by peer reviewed journals. Publishing is expensive. She listed all the information that is essential to a successful grant application, including explaining the availability of institutional resources and demonstrating how the research will be innovative.**

**Gifts and Grants Report**

**President Sullivan gave the following Gifts and Grants report:**

**Summary of Fiscal Year-To-Date through September 30, 2015**

Liquidity Management Policy

V. Risk Management 4

I. Overview

_Overview_

This policy documents the University of Virginia’s liquidity management guidelines. Within the context of this document, liquidity is defined as [cash](http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/cash.html) and cash equivalents, access to cash, and the convertibility of assets to cash in order to meet operating and financial needs during the operating cycle.

Liquidity risk is defined as an inability to meet payment obligations in a timely manner when they become due and the risk that assets may not be convertible into cash when needed. Liquidity risk is categorized into three risk types:

*   _Operating liquidity risk_ occurs when the University cannot fund its operating expenses due to insufficient liquid cash holdings.
*   _Financing liquidity risk_ occurs as a result of external financing activities and the potential for those financings to come due before maturity (e.g., commercial paper, putable debt, credit lines)
*   _Market liquidity risk_ occurs when the University is unable to convert assets into cash without significant losses.

This policy serves an important governance function by providing a framework to define liquidity, establishing and assigning responsibilities for managing the institution’s liquidity needs, evaluating the appropriate level of liquidity for the institution, and outlining sources of liquidity and procedures to access liquidity when needed. The objectives of this policy are to:

1.  Outline the University’s philosophy on liquidity management
2.  Establish a control framework for managing liquidity
3.  Establish liquidity management guidelines

The liquidity policy is meant to work in tandem with the University’s Board-approved Debt Policy, [Working Capital Investment Policy](http://uvapolicy.virginia.edu/policy/BOV-007), and Interest Rate Risk Management Policy.

II. Scope and Objectives

_Scope_

The policy governs University-wide liquidity management, including the Academic Divisions and the Medical Center. The policy does not govern liquidity management at University-affiliated foundations, including the University of Virginia Investment Management Company (“UVIMCO”).

_Objectives_

The policy exists to provide a framework under which the University seeks to achieve its liquidity management goals. The goals include providing sufficient liquidity to support the:

1.  cash flow needs of the annual operating cycle
2.  remarketing risk for the University’s putable debt
3.  University’s credit ratings

III. Oversight

_Oversight_

The Office of the Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer (“EVP & COO”) is responsible for implementing this policy and all liquidity activity for the University. This policy and any subsequent, material changes to the policy will be approved by the University’s Board of Visitors.

The University’s Office of the Treasurer manages liquidity and works in close coordination with the Medical Center and the UVIMCO to manage liquidity and associated risks.

The University meets periodically with UVIMCO to review the policy and ask that they assist in stress testing periodically.

IV. Liquidity Management

_Liquidity Sources and Uses_

The Office of the Treasurer manages liquidity to ensure access to sufficient cash during normal and stressed liquidity conditions. The University meets those needs with a combination of internal and external liquidity. The University categorizes liquidity sources as committed or uncommitted. Committed funding represents funding available to the University (e.g., cash and short term investments) as well as external funding sources where the provider has committed to providing funding, regardless of circumstance (e.g., bank lines of credit). Uncommitted funding are sources of liquidity that where the provider is under no commitment to fund (e.g., commercial paper buyers).

The University’s liquidity sources include the following:

*   Operating revenues
*   Cash and liquid investment balances
*   Commercial Paper
*   Operating Credit Lines
*   Dedicated Credit Lines supporting putable debt

Liquidity Uses

Liquidity is primarily used to satisfy (1) operating expenses, and (2) non-operating, episodic needs. Non-operating needs may include irregular investment or financing needs. Episodic needs may also include unplanned stresses to operating revenues or expenses. Liquidity uses include both operating and funding needs, such as:

*   Operating expenses
*   Planned debt service
*   Unplanned putable debt maturities

Liquidity Targets

**_Days Cash on Hand_**

Liquidity accessible within one month divided by daily operating expenses: Target >= 180 days

Day’s cash on hand (“DCH”) is a measure of the University’s contingent liquidity. It measures how

many days of operating expense an entity can support with its liquidity. DCH is defined as liquidity accessible within one month divided by daily operating expenses.

DCH is one of the metrics measured by the rating agencies and the University seeks to target a level of DCH that supports operations, in addition to supporting ratings goals.

**_Daily Liquidity as a Percent of Variable Rate Debt_**

Cash and liquidity divided by outstanding putable debt: Target >=1.5x

While having putable debt outstanding, the University will maintain sufficient unrestricted liquid investments and/or sources of liquidity satisfactory to the rating agencies for maintaining the highest debt ratings. Unrestricted sources of liquidity may be modified and/or replaced during the life of the putable debt in such ways that are satisfactory to the rating agencies and the University and that are within debt document parameters.

**_Spendable Cash and Investments / Operating Expense:_**

The sum of spendable cash and investments divided by annual operating expense: Target >= 2.0x

This ratio is a measure of total university spendable assets, without regard for the liquidity of the assets, divided by annual operating expense. This ratio assesses the financial strength of the University and provides a measure of “gross coverage” for operating expenses. It also seeks to eliminate some items that may skew a net assets coverage ratio (such as pension liabilities).

V. Risk Management

Monitoring and Reporting

The Office of the Treasurer is responsible for managing the daily cash position of the University, performing cash flow forecasting and variance analyses, and working with University units to monitor aggregate institutional liquidity.

The key liquidity reports to University senior management include:

_Monthly_

_Treasury Report -_ On a monthly basis, Treasury prepares a report that highlights, among other things, cash and investment holdings as well as liquidity ratios.

_Quarterly_

_Liquidity Scorecard -_ The University produces a quarterly report that lists the following items:

*   sources and uses under normal and stressed environments
*   stress tests
*   liquidity ratios

_Annually_

_Cash Flow Forecast -_ Annually, the Treasury Department develops a monthly cash flow forecast for the coming year. This report is used to project and manage cash flows throughout the year and support operating cash flow decisions.

The reports listed here may be amended from time to time as needed at the discretion of the EVP/COO.

Liquidity Source Diversification

The University attempts to diversify its various sources of liquidity. Diversification is sought by liquidity type (e.g., cash, bank lines, commercial paper) and by counterparty (e.g., operating bank lines with several counterparties, commercial paper issued by more than one dealer).

Diversification of cash and investments is obtained according to the diversification guidelines in the University’s Working Capital Investment Policy and UVIMCO’s Investment Policy Statement.

Liquidity Triggers

Triggers are intended to provide warning signs of events that could adversely impact the University’s liquidity. The occurrence of a trigger will be brought to the attention of the EVP/COO and result in the development of a risk mitigation plan, if necessary. Triggers include, but are not limited to:

*   material changes in committed or uncommitted liquidity sources
*   significant deviation from target cash balance of $100mm
*   credit ratings pressure resulting from liquidity ratios
*   difficulty remarketing putable debt
*   stress on distributions or available distributions from UVIMCO
*   stress on capital and bank markets affecting the ability to draw on operating lines or issue CP
*   a drop in a counterparty’s ratings
*   material changes in the liquidity profile of UVIMCO’s short-term or long-term pools
