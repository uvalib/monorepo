To aid in the performance of his duties, he may employ any assistants approved by the faculty. He shall be responsible for their conduct; and they may be removed at any time, either by himself or by the faculty.

He shall have the use of a dormitory, free of rent, may attend any of the lectures in the University without fee, and shall have free use of the books of the library; but he shall carry none beyond the precincts of the University, he shall take none from the library, the removal whereof is interdicted by the faculty,—;he shall return all taken out, within such time as the faculty shall prescribe,—;—; he shall be answerable for all damage, to the books, apartment, furniture or other property of the library, arising from any neglect or breach of his duty, and especially for all books taken from the library, contrary to rule.—;

For neglect of duty or misconduct in office, his functions may be suspended by the faculty, in the recess of the board of Visitors, & the suspension may be continued till the board shall reinstate him. During such suspension, his salary shall cease, unless otherwise ordered by the board of Visitors.

All vacancies in the office of librarian, occurring during the recess of the Visitors, whether by death, resignation, suspension or otherwise, shall be filled pro tempore, by an appointment by the faculty, to continue not longer than the next meeting of the visitors.

He shall keep a book in the library, in which he shall regularly enter every volume taken out, whether by a student, professor, or himself; with the time when the same was taken, and when returned: so that it may be always known in whose hands every book is, & the time that it has been in the hands of the borrower.

The librarian shall conform to all such rules as shall from time to time, be prescribed for his conduct by the board of visitors, or by the faculty, in pursuance of authority vested in them by the Visitors;—; and it is especially enjoined on him to be vigilant in preserving the books, room, & its furniture from all manner of injury: and, to this end, it shall be his duty to report to the proper authority, all breaches of the rules for the government of the library, committed by a student. He shall regularly debit the student with all fines & damages incurred by him, on account of the library, and report the same to the bursar, that the amount may be retained out of the deposit which will be herein required.

He shall see that every book belonging to the library be in its place on the shelves, upon the first day of every meeting of the Visitors; and not removed during their sitting, unless by their permission:—; in order that the whole library may be subject to their inspection.

Accurate catalogues of the books shall be kept by the librarian, and copies thereof, from time to time, furnished to the Visitors, professors, students and others, as shall be directed by the faculty.

At every meeting of the board of visitors, the whole library shall be carefully inspected, by the proctor alone, or by the proctor and such committee as the board shall appoint, in order to ascertain whether each volume be in its place, & in proper preservation, and a written report of the condition of the library shall be made to the board by such inspectors.

The professors of the University shall, at all times, have free use of the books of the library, and free access thereto, in the confidence that they will not keep the books longer than while in actual and active use, and that they will leave with the librarian a note of the books borrowed.

Such books as, on account of their rarity, value, peculiar liableness to injury, or for other good reason, ought not to be carried from the library, shall be designated by the faculty; and being so designated, they shall not be loaned to any one, or be carried from the library by any person, except by special permission of the faculty.

Students may borrow from the library all books not so prohibited, under the following regulations:

First—;before any book shall be loaned to a student, the faculty shall prescribe by a general regulation, the authority on which books shall be delivered to the student by the librarian, and the time within which they shall be returned—;regulating that time with reference to the size of the volume loaned, & to a diligent use of it by the student.—;and no book shall be loaned by any other than the librarian, or on any other authority than that so prescribed by the faculty.

Secondly—;books shall be lent to the student for the purpose of reading only, and not for the ordinary purpose of getting lessons in them as school books.

Thirdly—;No student shall have more than three volumes in his possession at any time.

Fourthly—;If a student shall not return a borrowed book within the time limited by the faculty, he shall receive no other until it be returned or paid for; and he shall moreover, pay, for every day's detention beyond the limitation, ten cents.

Fifthly—;if any student deface, injure or lost any book of the library, he shall pay the value of the book, if defaced; double the value, if otherwise injured; & threefold, if lose; and shall be suspended from the privilege of borrowing, during such time as the faculty shall adjudge: but if the book defaced, injured or lost be a volume of a set, the case shall be referred to the faculty, and the student may be compelled by their order, either to pay the fine, or to pay for the whole set, or replace it,—;he taking the old, and being relieved from the fine.

Sixthly—;before any student shall be permitted to borrow any book from the library, or to use any, he shall deposit with the bursar, the sum of ten dollars, and deliver the bursar's receipt therefore to the librarian for safe keeping. The receipt shall purport that the deposit is on account of the use of the library, & to be accounted for according to the laws of the University. The deposit shall be accounted for by the bursar, as follows:—;—; all fines incurred by the student and all damages assesses against him, on account of the library, shall be paid out of it, and the balance returned to the student at the end of the session. A monthly settlement shall be made by the librarian with the bursar, on account of this deposit; & whenever the whole deposit is exhausted, it shall be renewed by a like sum, or such smaller sum as the faculty may direct. Until so renewed, the privilege of the student to use the library shall cease. If the student object to any charge made against him by the librarian, the faculty shall decide.

The library shall be open to students every day except Sunday, during such hours as the faculty shall prescribe: but they shall be admitted within it, only for the purpose of consulting such books as they do not desire to carry from the library; and not for the purpose of borrowing books, or returning those already borrowed. Borrowed books shall be delivered out, and received back, at some convenient place without the library, to be designated by the faculty,—;within the hours when the library is open.

Students desiring to enter the library for the purpose of consulting books therein, shall obtain tickets of admission, in such manner as the faculty shall prescribe. The numbers to be admitted at any one time, shall be so limited as to secure order; such admissions shall be only within the regular hours for keeping open the library, and shall always be in presence of the librarian or one of his assistants.—; while so admitted, the student shall observe perfect order and decorum,—; shall preserve silence, shall abstain from injury, either to the books, the building, or the furniture,—;and he shall take no book from its shelf. Of any book that he shall wish to consult, he shall furnish a memorandum to the librarian or his assistant; and the librarian or his assistant shall place the book on the table provided for that purpose for the use of the student & shall return it to its place, when the student as done with it.

If any student, while in the library, shall do any damage, to any book, or to the building or furniture, or other property belonging to the University, he shall pay such damages as shall be assessed therefore by the faculty; and for this or any other misconduct while in the library, he shall be liable to such other punishment as the board in their discretion may adjudge.

Strangers whom the librarian may be willing to attend, may visit the library at such hours & in such numbers as the faculty may prescribe: but, to prevent derangement of the books, they are to take no book from the shelf, but in his presence. They may also be permitted to consult any book, to read in it, make notes or quotations from it, at the table, under such accommodations and arrangements as the librarian shall prescribe, on his own responsibility.

Resolved, that as soon as the sanction of the legislature can be obtained, there shall be established in the University, a Court of Record, to be called "The Court of the University," and to be organised as followeth:

The professor of Law shall be, en officio, sole Judge of the Court, and shall receive, as compensation for his judicial services, a salary not exceeding five hundred dollars, to be regulated by the Visitors & paid in like manner with his salary as professor of Law.

This Court shall have concurrent jurisdiction with the County court of Albemarle, over all offences against the laws of the land, except felonies, committed, by any, within the precincts of the University; and over all such offences, committed, by students, within the county of Albemarle. It shall moreover have jurisdiction over all such offences committed by students against the laws of the University, as shall from time to time, be made cognisable therein, by the Visitors.

Proceedings in this court for the punishment of offences against the laws of the land, shall be, in all respects, according to the course of the Common law courts in this Commonwealth: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and proceedings for the punishment of offences against the laws of the University, shall be according to the course prescribed by those laws.

The Judge of the Court shall be a Conservator of the Peace, within the County of Albemarle; and, within that limit, shall have the same power as a justice of the peace for the county, to arrest any one charged with an offence, to issue warrants for that purpose, to take recognisances of the peace, recognisances of good behaviour, and recognisances for appearance, either in his own court, or any other court where the offence may be cognisable.

The terms of the Court shall be monthly and quarterly, to be held on the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Monday of each month, except April, August and September; & continued from day to day, and from time to time, as long as the business shall require.

The quarterly terms shall be in November, March, May and July;—; and shall have jurisdiction of all causes cognisable in the Court.

The monthly terms shall be in October, December, January, February, and June; and shall have concurrent jurisdiction with the quarterly terms, of such causes only as are not tried by a jury.

At every quarterly term, a grand jury from the body of Albemarle County shall be summoned & impanelled, and solemnly charged on oath, to present all offences cognisable in the court. Every person qualified as a grand-juror for the County court of Albemarle, and moreover, all students of the University above the age of nineteen years, and all hotel keepers of the University shall be competent grand jurors in the Court of the University; and a due proportion of such students, under the direction of the Judge, shall be impanelled on every grand jury.

Petit-jurors for the court of the University shall be qualified in like manner as petit-jurors for the County court of Albemarle, except that no student shall be of the petit jury.

The Proctor of the University shall be the sergeant of the Court; and he, with such deputies as the judge may approve, shall summon all its juries, execute all its process, original, mesne, and final—;—;—; and perform all the duties in relation to the court, and to the judge thereof in vacation, that are performed by the Sheriff of a county, in relation to the County court, and the justices thereof in vacation.

The Sergeant and his deputies shall be conservators of the peace, within the County of Albemarle, and may command the posse comitatus, in like manner as the Sheriff, to enable them to execute their lawful authority. He shall have the same fees of offices as are allowed a sheriff for similar services.

The Court shall have the same power to issue process beyond its jurisdiction, & the same power to compell obedience to its lawful process & lawful orders, with that possessed by a County court in similar cases.

Until some other place of confinement be provided by law, the jail of Albemarle County, shall be used as the jail of the Court of the University, & the keeper thereof shall receive & detain in safe custody all persons lawfully committed thereto, by the said Court or its officers, or by the judge thereof in Vacation, in the same manner as if they had been committed by the authority of the County Court of Albemarle.

The Court shall appoint its own clerk, who shall hold his office during the pleasure of the court, shall give bond & security for the performance of its duties in such penalty as the Visitors shall prescribe, shall receive fees of office such as are allowed the clerk of the County court for similar services, and receive such farther compensation for the performance of his duties as shall be allowed him by the visitors from the funds of the University.

All Counsel & attornies licensed to practice in the courts of this Commonwealth, may practise in the Court of the University, on taking the proper oaths of office; and the Court shall appoint from among them, one who shall prosecute all pleas of the Commonwealth in that court, and shall receive the same fees and compensation for his services, as are allowed to an attorney for the Commonwealth, in a superior Court of law,—;—;to be paid in the same manner.

A memorial shall be presented to the legislature, at their next meeting, by the rector, on behalf of the rector and visitors, praying the establishment of a court for the University, on the principles of the foregoing enactment, or on such other principles as their wisdom may prescribe.

Resolved that for enactment 76, shall be substituted the —;—;following:—;—;If any student be irregular or making undue proficiency in all his classes for more than a month after his parent or guardian has been informed; or if the faculty are satisfied that he is not fulfilling the purposes for which he was sent to the institution, and is not likely to fulfill them, and his parent or guardian shall not withdraw him after having received timely notice thereof;—;—;—;—;the faculty may dismiss him:—;—;but they shall not exercise this power till they shall have given the student written information of the objections to his conduct, and have afforded him an opportunity of explanation and defence. Their order of dismissal shall assign the cause thereof, shall be communicated to the parent or guardian, and laid before the Visitors at their next meeting.

Resolved, that enactment 84. shall be amended as follows: after `their own family' add `and farther, that it be a condition expressed in the same lease that no hotel keeper shall entertain in his hotel, or within the precincts, any expelled student, for the term of five years after such expulsion; nor any dismissed or suspended student, during the continuance of such dismission or suspension.'

Resolved that each student who may reside without the precincts, shall be required to register his place of residence with the proctor.

Resolved that each student shall be furnished gratuitously by the proctor, with a copy of the enactments at the time of his matriculation.

The board adjourned to tomorrow.

Saturday, Oct. 7th. The board met pursuant to adjournment- present the same members as yesterday.

Resolved that the proctor be directed to refund to the several professors, the advances by them made for venitian blinds; when, in the opinion of the executive committee, such appropriation shall be justified by the state of the funds.

Resolved that the communication of the faculty respecting books, be referred to the executive committee: to be acted upon as the faculty shall advise & the committee approve.

Resolved that laborers for the University shall be procured and employed by the proctor, under the control of the executive committee.

Resolved, that the plan for a public examination & for conferring degrees, recommended by the faculty, is approved and adopted for the present; with this variation only: the examination shall commence on the 1st Monday in Decr., & the result of the faculty's deliberations thereon, made known on the fifteenth of that month.

Resolved as follows: After the present session, no student shall be permitted to board or lodge out of the precincts of the University, unless in the family of his parent or guardian, or in the family of some particular friend approved by the faculty.

The student shall not choose his quarters at pleasure;—;—;but his hotel & dormitory shall be assigned him by the proctor, under the control of the faculty;—;—;and they shall be so distributed among the different hotels, as to preserve equality of numbers at each, as nearly as convenient. In this assignment, the wishes of the student will be respected, as far as may comport with equality of numbers at the hotels, and fitness of residence in the dormitories: but students, being once located, must not be compelled to change their residence for the mere purpose of equality, and shall not be allowed to change either their hotels or dormitories, without the consent of the faculty.

The keepers of hotels shall not furnish luxurious fare to their boarders: but the fare shall be plentiful, plain, of good and wholesome viands, neatly served and well dressed; and, in all its details, conformable to such rules as the faculty may prescribe pursuant to this enactment.

The faculty are authorised, and required if they find it convenient, to prescribe the details of the fare at the hotels—;in the spirit of this enactment, assuring, as far as may be, uniformity throughout the institution.

The hotel keepers shall furnish the students not only with diet, but with bedding and furniture for their dormitories, fuel, candles, and washing: also proper attendance of servants for domestic and menial duties:—;the details of all which shall be regulated by the faculty. For all these, instead of the board now allowed, they shall receive one hundred and fifty dollars, for the ordinary session; and one half that sum for the next session.

If any hotel keeper shall fail to comply with the rules prescribed by this enactment or by the faculty, there shall be such deduction made from the amount of board allowed him, as the faculty shall judge proper.

The proctor shall superintend the hotels, shall inspect their tables and the furnishments of the dormitories, at least once a month, and whenever else he shall be required, by any hotel keeper, or boarder, or by the faculty; and he shall regularly report to the faculty all deficiencies and improprieties which he may observe or of which he may be informed.

Resolved that the communications of the professors respecting their tenements are referred to the executive committee. They are requested to inform the professors that the funds of the institution are in a condition which does not allow any application to that object at present: that the committee, as soon as the funds will permit, will cause the necessary out houses to be erected, & will consider the propriety of making the proposed alterations in their attids & cellars.

Resolved, that a copy of the proceedings of the Board be furnished by the Secretary to each member, as soon as practicable after the close of the present & each successive session.

Resolved that the secretary be instructed to cause to be prepared & delivered, as soon as practicable, to each member, a copy of the proceedings of the Visitors of the Central College, & of the former proceedings of the Visitors of the University.

Resolved that professor Emmet be authorised to suspend, till the further decision of the Visitors, the discharge of his duties as professor of Natural History, in regard to the Botanic Garden, & the subjects of Botany & Rural Economy.

A letter having been received from professor Key, the following preamble and resolutions were adopted in relation thereto.

The board regret, very deeply, that professor Key still desires to resign his office in the University. They cannot contemplate the loss of his valuable services, without apprehending very serious injury to the interests of the institution over which they preside, & to the interests of the country which has endowed it, and which looks with great solicitude, to its success: and they cannot cease to hope that professor Key, upon further reflection & further experience, will be reconciled to his situation, and find his feelings conspire with his interests in recommending its continuation. The Visitors are the more encouraged in this hope, from the circumstance that they are now endeavoring to introduce some radical changes into the government of the University, which may secure more order than has heretofore prevailed, & may relieve the professors from some of their most irksome duties. The ensuing winter will probably ascertain how far their efforts at reform will be crowned with success.

But the appeal which professor Key has not made to them, comes recommended by so much temperance and good feeling, and his proposition to resign is guarded by such reasonable cautions,—;that the Visitors cannot feel themselves justified in longer detaining him against his will. If therefore, when he shall have known what influence the events of the next winter will have upon his situation, he should still be unwilling to remain with us, his resignation must be accepted; however relectantly.

Therefore, Resolved, that if professor Key shall, at any time, between the first & the fifteenth of March next, by letter addressed to the rector, tender a resignation of his office, to take place at the end of the session which will terminate on the 4th of July 1827—; such resignation shall be accepted.

Resolved that the Secretary be requested to communicate the foregoing preamble and resolution, in answer to Mr Key's letter of the 3d of Oct.

Resolved that the executive committee are requested, as soon as they find it practicable, to cause the accommodations to be furnished, which are suggested in the communication of professor Bonnycastle.

Resolved that, after the close of the present session, the science of Political economy, shall be taught in the school of Moral philosophy, instead of the school of law.

Resolved that the faculty be requested forthwith to cause the small room on the first floor of the rotunda to be finished & fitted for the reception of the natural and artificial curiosities given to the University by the late venerable Rector; and to have them there suitably arranged for preservation & exhibition.

Resolved that the case & custody of the apartments containing the aforesaid donation of Mr Jefferson shall, for the present, be confided to the Librarian under such regulations as the faculty may prescribe.

Resolved that the Bursar, on behalf of the Rector & Visitors of the University, be authorised to borrow from either of the banks in Richmond, a sum not exceeding three thousand dollars; and to pledge for the repayment thereof, so much of the annuity of 1827, to be paid by the literary fund, as will be adequate thereto:—;and that the money so borrowed, be applied under the direction of the executive committee to the payment of the most pressing demands.

Resolved that the librarian is requested to receive from Thomas J. Randolph, executor of Thomas Jefferson deceased, the books bequeathed to the University by his will, and the bust mentioned in the letter of the exr, addressed to the Rector & Visitors; and to preserve them in the library, subject to the order of the executor.

Resolved, that the subject of stables for the hotels is referred to the executive committee, to be acted on as they deem sufficient.

Resolved that the funds of the University not justifying the appropriation of money to that purpose, the offer of the executors of Francis W. Gilmer decd., for the sale of his library, cannot at this time be accepted.

Resolved, that the sentence of the faculty expelling Thomas Barclay from the University, and the letter of Tho's Barclay to the board on that subject, have been considered, & the sentence is approved.

Resolved that the sentence of the faculty expelling C. Peyton from the University, is approved.

Resolved, that the case of —; Yeates, referred by the faculty to this board, not having been reached till a late hour of the last day of our session, and neither documents nor evidence being before the board, to enable them to act upon it,—;—;the consideration thereof is postponed till December.

The Youth of the Country cannot learn too early to respect the laws. To evade the process of the Courts necessary to the administration of justice, is a high contempt of those laws, and indicates a disposition to insubordination which required the decided reprehension of the board.

Resolved, therefore, that the faculty make known to the students that the Visitors strongly disapprove every attempt to evade the process of the Courts.

Resolved, farther, that any student, in any manner, evading the process of the courts, shall be liable to any of the penalties prescribed by the enactments of the University.

Resolved, that the room for the public examination shall be indicated by the executive committee, & prepared for the purpose by the proctor under their direction.

Resolved that in adjusting the accounts of the professors, their salaries shall be regarded as commencing at the date of the acceptances of their appointments, unless it shall have been otherwise specially provided, in the contracts with them.

The board then adjourned to the first Monday in December next.

# Report of the Rector & Visitors of the University of Virginia

## Determined on at their meeting in October 1826

To the President and Directors of the Literary fund.

In obedience to the law requiring that the Rector & Visitors of the University of Virginia, should make a Report annually, to the President & Directors of the Literary fund, (to be laid before the Legislature at their next succeeding meeting) embracing a full account of the disbursements, the funds on hand, & a general statement of the condition of the said University, the said Rector & Visitors make the following REPORT:

The first act required of the Board at their present meeting, was that of providing for the vacancy in the Rectorship, occasioned by a loss which clothed the whole land in mourning, & has fallen with peculiar force on the institution committed to their care. To that lamented event the Board cannot refer, without feeling that some tribute is due on their part, to the memory of a patriot & sage so distinguished by his various & invaluable services to his country; and so eminently entitled to manifestations of grateful affection from every portion of its citizens. After discharging with a zeal which never abated, and with abilities which commanded universal admiration, all the labours imposed by a series of most important public trusts, he did not cease in his retirement from them, to cherish that love of country and of liberty, which had been the ruling principle of his life. Reflecting more particularly on the great truth, that as no people can be happy but with a free Government, so no government can long be free, without knowledge for its conservative element, he determined to close his illustrious career by devoting the resources of his genius and his vast acquirements, to the erection of this monument of Science & Liberty: indulging to the last hour of his protracted existence, the gratifying confidence that under the auspices of the state to which it was dedicated, it would more than repay whatever might be done for it, by the lights it would diffuse, and the characters it would rear for the service & ornament of the Republic.

With an origin so propitious, and the continued patronage of the state, the Board are encouraged to expect that no part of the promised blessings will be disappointed, in the progress of the University to its destined usefulness.

Since the Report last made, the acquisition of a Professor of Law has completed the number required for the existing arrangement, and the matriculated students have encreased to 177: the state of the schools being,

This encrease justifies the expectation that additions to the number will continue to be made, as the benefits of the institution SHALL be unfolded, and regulations for extending and ensuring them shall be suggested by experience. The enactments now made with this view, will be laid before the Legislature as soon as they shall be duly prepared for the purpose.

From a comparative view of the tasks of the Professors of Law & Moral Philosophy, it was found convenient & mutually agreeable to the parties that the science of Political Economy should be taught in the school of the latter, instead of the former.

On a further consideration of the most eligible period for the session of the University, it has been provided that the next session shall commence on the first of February, and terminate on the Fourth of July, and that all future sessions shall commence on the twentieth of August in each year, and terminate on the fourth of July ensuing; but that there shall be one recess of all the schools, & no more, during each session: to commence on the fifteenth and terminate on the thirty first of December.

In pursuance of what was communicated in the last report the Library room in the Rotunda has been nearly completed, and the books put into it. Two rooms for the Professors of Natural Philosophy and Chemistry, and one large lecture room, have also been fitted for use. The work of the Anatomical Hall is so far advanced that it may be used early in the next session. The Portico of the Rotunda has been finished, with the exception of the flight of steps and the laying of the marble flags, which have been received and paid for. The work remaining to be done, is the finishing one large oval room, one small one, and the entrance Hall of the Rotunda with the unfinished parts of the Portico and about one fourth of the Anatomical Hall. Some small additions are also necessary for the better accommodation of the Professors in their Pavilions, and of the students in their Dormitories, and for a few other minor objects.

The receipts by the collector, of arrearages of subscriptions since the date of the last report, amount to $644.84 cents, leaving a balance still due of 8161.68 of which 3661.68 are considered sperate.

The accounts for the receipts, disbursements & funds on hand for the year ending with the month of September, as rendered by the Bursar & Proctor are given with this report as is required by Law.

In looking to the future, the Board, notwithstanding their anxiety to bring the establishment into a complete state, without exceeding its current resources, find, on comparing with these, the engagements and estimated demands for the present & the next year, that at the end of the next, an adverse balance will exist of not less than twenty thousand dollars; the extinguishment of which will require the estimated annual surplus of income, thereafter, for a period of about seven years.

In submitting this unavoidable result, the Board venture to hope that a favorable view will be taken by the General Assembly, of the advantage to the Institution from a public liberation of its funds from the debts otherwise weighing upon them; and of the prospect thence opened of earlier enlargements of its scope of action and usefulness.
