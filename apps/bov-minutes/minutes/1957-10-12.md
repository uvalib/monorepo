President Darden presented the following letter from the Comptroller:

With the last wage increase, the maintenance costs of our dormitories will be greater than the revenue. I believe that we should raise our charges $25 per student for all accommodations. This would make the charge in the new dormitories $200 instead of the present $175.

Many of our students are well able to pay this and those who would find it a hardship can be helped through University scholarship funds.

I am enclosing a schedule of room charges of thirty institutions, including the University of Virginia. Of these thirty, only two charge less than we do.

1. **Deficit, year ended June 30, 1957**\
   $4,197.33

2. **Estimated accumulative deficit, year ended June 30, 1958**\
   $10,000.00

### Student Health Service Fee Increase

Basis for the request for an increase in the Student Health Service medical fee from $20 to $25 beginning in the Session 1958-1959.

At the time of the organization of the Department of Student Health in 1938 the unit medical fee was tentatively placed at $15 per session. Due to deficits based mainly on increased costs of hospitalization, the fee was increased in 1950 to $20. Our request for a further fee increase in 1958 is based upon (I) increased costs of operation as reflected in (II) current and estimated annual deficits.

I. **Increased costs of operation**

1. Increased expenditures for personnel
   a. Merit increases\
   b. Social Security contributions\
   c. Virginia Supplemental Retirement System contributions\
   d. Salaries for new personnel, needed to provide services for a larger student population.
2. Initial expenditures for equipment due to expansion of Clinic space and facilities.
3. Increased costs for medical supplies, medications, new vaccines, office maintenance.
4. Increased expenditures for hospitalization and consultation services.

II. **Current and estimated annual deficits**\
For specific details referable to these needs, please refer to data itemized in our budget prepared for the biennium 1958-1959, 1959-1960, submitted to the Comptroller of the University on June 28, 1957, copy attached.

At a called meeting of the University Senate on October 3, 1957 the following programs were presented for final review and were approved. I should like now to recommend them to your office for submission to the Board of Visitors for its approval.

**Degree program in City Planning:** The School of Architecture proposes to establish a five-year program leading to the degree of Bachelor of City Planning. The pattern of the program parallels the existing curriculum in the School of Architecture and takes advantage of courses now being taught in the School of Architecture, the College of Arts and Sciences, and the School of Engineering. It will require the establishment of only three courses not currently being taught. Students may enter this program following completion of two years of a normal Bachelor of Arts program similar to the program now existing in the College of Arts and Sciences. This curriculum has been approved by the Virginia Council of Higher Education.

**Degree program in Architectural History:** The School of Architecture and the Corcoran Department of History of the College of Arts and Sciences propose to offer a program leading to the degree of Bachelor of Architectural History and administered jointly by both departments. This joint venture anticipates virtually no new course offerings but is made up almost entirely of courses now existing in the separate curricula of these two departments.

Attached are copies of both proposals.
