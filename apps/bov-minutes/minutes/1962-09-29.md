The Board covenants that from and after the time when the contractors or any of them engaged in constructing the Project or any part thereof shall cease to be responsible, pursuant to the provisions of the respective contracts for the construction of the Project or such part, for loss or damage to the Project or such part occurring from fire or lightning, it will insure and at all times keep the Project or such part insured with a responsible insurance company or companies, qualified to assume the risk thereof, against physical loss or damage caused by fire or lightning, with such exceptions as are ordinarily required by insurers of structures or facilities of similar type, in an amount not less than eighty per centum (80%) of the replacement value of the Project or such part, less depreciation, provided, however, that such amount of insurance shall at all times be sufficient to comply with any legal or contractual requirement which, if breached, would result in assumption by the Board of a portion of any loss or damage as a co-insurer, and such insurance may provide for the deduction from each claim for loss or damage (except in case of a total loss) of not more than two per centum (2%) of the total amount of insurance required by the application of the co-insurance clause, and provided, further, that if at any time the Board shall be unable to obtain such insurance to the extent above required, either as to amount of such insurance or as to the risks covered thereby or the deductible provision thereof, it will not constitute an event of default under the provisions of this resolution if the Board shall carry such insurance to the extent reasonably obtainable.

The proceeds of such insurance shall be available for, and shall to the extent necessary be applied to, the repair, replacement or reconstruction of the damaged or destroyed property. If such proceeds are more than sufficient for such purpose, the balance remaining shall be deposited to the credit of the Sinking Fund. If such proceeds, with other available funds, shall be insufficient for such purpose, such proceeds shall be deposited to the credit of the Sinking Fund or shall be used to purchase bonds, as the Board by resolution may determine.

### Section 606.

The Board covenants that no contract or contracts will be entered into or any action taken by which the rights of the bondholders might be impaired or diminished.

### Section 607.

The Board covenants that it will keep an accurate record of the total cost of the Project, of the fees, rents, charges and other revenues collected, and of the application of such revenues. Such records shall be open at all reasonable times to the inspection of all interested persons.

The Board further covenants that, if so requested in writing by any bondholder within the month of July after the close of any fiscal year, it will cause the Comptroller of the Institution to make a report from the books and accounts relating to the Project for the preceding fiscal year. Within the next two months copies of such report shall be filed with the Secretary to the Board and the State Treasurer and shall be mailed by the Comptroller to all bondholders who shall have filed their names and addresses with the Comptroller for such purpose. Each such report shall set forth in respect of the preceding fiscal year an income and expense account for the Project, the percentage of use of the Project, the details of all bonds paid, the amount on deposit at the end of such fiscal year to the credit of each Fund created under the provisions of this resolution and the details of any investment thereof, a schedule of all insurance policies which are then in effect, stating with respect to each policy the name of the insurer, the amount, number and expiration date, and the hazards and risks covered thereby, and also the findings of the Comptroller as to whether the moneys received by the Board under the provisions of this resolution during such fiscal year have been applied in accordance with the provisions of this resolution and whether the Board is in default of any of the covenants contained in Sections 401 and 402 of this resolution.

### Section 608.

The Board covenants that it will not sell or otherwise dispose of or encumber the Project or any part thereof and will not create or permit to be created any charge or lien on the revenues therefrom ranking equally with or prior to the charge or lien of the bonds secured hereby on such revenues. The Board may, however, sell or dispose or permit the sale or disposal by the Institution of any furniture, fixtures, apparatus, tools, instruments or other movable property acquired for or in connection with the Project or any materials used in connection therewith, if the Board shall determine by resolution that such articles are no longer needed or are no longer useful in connection with the construction of the Project or the operation and maintenance of the Project. The proceeds of any sale made under the authority of this Section shall be deposited to the credit of the Sinking Fund.

### Section 701.

In case the time for the payment of any coupon shall be extended, whether or not such extension be by or with the consent of the Board, such coupon shall not be entitled in case of default hereunder to the benefit or security of this resolution except subject to the prior payment in full of the principal of all bonds then outstanding and of all coupons the time for the payment of which shall not have been extended.

### Section 702.

Each of the following events is hereby declared an "event of default", that is to say. If:

(a) payment of the principal of any of the bonds shall not be made when the same shall become due and payable, or

(b) payment of any instalment of interest shall not be made within thirty (30) days after the same shall become due and payable, or

(c) the Board shall for any reason be rendered incapable of fulfilling its obligations hereunder, or

(d) the Project or any part thereof shall be destroyed or damaged and shall not be promptly repaired, replaced or reconstructed (whether such failure be due to the impracticability of such repair, replacement or reconstruction or to lack of funds therefor or for any other reason), or

(e) final judgment for the payment of money shall be rendered against the Board as a result of its ownership or operation of the Project and any such judgment shall not be discharged within sixty (60) days from the entry thereof or an appeal shall not be taken therefrom or from the order, decree or process upon which or pursuant to which such judgment shall have been granted or entered, in such manner as to stay the execution of or levy under such judgment, order, decree or process or the enforcement thereof, or

(f) an order or decree shall be entered, with the consent or acquiescence of the Board, appointing a receiver or receivers of the Project or any part thereof or of the revenues thereof, or if such order or decree, having been entered without the acquiescence or consent of the Board, shall not be vacated or discharged or stayed on appeal within sixty (60) days after entry thereof, or

(g) the Board shall default in the due and punctual performance of any other of the covenants, conditions, agreements and provisions contained in the bonds or in this resolution on the part of the Board to be performed, and such default shall continue for thirty (30) days after written notice specifying such default and requiring same to be remedied shall have been given to the Board by any bondholder.

### Section 703.

### Section 704.

In case any proceeding taken by any bondholder on account of any default shall have been discontinued or abandoned for any reason, then and in every such case the Board and the bondholders shall be restored to their former positions and rights, respectively, and all rights and remedies of the bondholders shall continue as though no such proceeding had been taken.

### Section 705.

No holder of any of the bonds shall have any right in any manner whatever to affect, disturb or prejudice the security of this resolution or to enforce any right hereunder, except in the manner herein provided, and all proceedings at law or in equity shall be instituted, had and maintained for the equal benefit of all bondholders.

### Section 706.

### Section 707.

No delay or omission of any bondholder to exercise any right or power accruing upon any default occurring and continuing as aforesaid shall impair any such right or power or shall be construed to be a waiver of any such default or an acquiescence therein, and every power and remedy given by this Article to the bondholders may be exercised from time to time and as often as may be deemed expedient.
