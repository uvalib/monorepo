Also present were James E. Ryan, Ian B. Baucom, Jennifer Wagner Davis, K. Craig Kent, M.D., Susan G. Harris, Donna P. Henry, Cliff Iler, Kennedy Kipps, Mark Luellen, David Martel, Augie Maurelli, Clark L. “Chip” Murray, Margaret Grundy Noland, Debra D. Rinker, Margot M. Rogers, and Colette Sheehy.

Presenters were President Ryan, Ms. Lily A. Roberts, Ms. Tish Jennings, Chief Timothy J. Longo.

The Rector called the meeting to order and led the Visitors in the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. Clement then made a short statement about a recent article in the Washington Post on text messages sent among members of the Board. He said the messages create a negative and inaccurate portrayal of the University as a place where disparagement comes before civil discourse and mutual respect. He denied that he ever made disparaging comments about the Finance department; he has great respect for their work and for the work of other employees at the University. He asked the Visitors to set an example for our students, staff, and faculty.

Mr. DePasquale added some thoughts about the strength of the Board as a collective body—each member has one voice and one vote. There is a huge opportunity for advancing the University as a Visitor. The largest disconnect for a Visitor is getting the job as a member of the Board confused with the administration’s jobs.

Mr. Ellis then apologized for the texts; he said they were private and confidential messages that were still out of place.

The Rector then moved on to the published agenda. On motion, duly seconded, the minutes of the December 8-9, 2022 meeting of the Board of Visitors were approved:

**APPROVAL OF THE MINUTES OF THE DECEMBER 8-9, 2022 MEETING OF THE BOARD OF VISITORS**

RESOLVED, the Board of Visitors approves the minutes of the December 8-9, 2022, meeting of the Board of Visitors.

**Discussion with University Leadership**

Mr. Ryan thanked Ms. Lily Roberts for her work with the Board, and then launched into his agenda.

He said he thought he would use the time to continue a format that has worked well, which is to share some good news that might be a little under the radar, followed by a challenge the University is facing, and finally to offer an item for discussion and feedback.

_The Good News_

Recently a UVA Today story announced that the U.S. Department of State named UVA as a Fulbright U.S. Student Program Top Producing Institution for the 2022-23 academic year, which for doctoral-granting institutions means 10 or more awards offered. The Fulbright is a competitive and prestigious award that sends recipients abroad to work, study, and become immersed in their host country. In 2020, UVA had 22 recipients, which was the most among publics. In 2022-23, UVA had 18, which was the second most among publics, one behind Rutgers.

In 2022-23, 18 UVA students were offered Fulbright awards, and 15 accepted the award. They are visiting countries such as Mexico, Spain, France, Ivory Coast, Jordan, Thailand, South Korea, Vietnam, Taiwan, and the Philippines.

Since 2014, UVA has had at least 10 students receive the Fulbright in all but two of those years. By comparison, between1946 and 2014, we had 10 students receive the Fulbright in only one year.

As impressive as UVA’s record on the Fulbright is, it’s just part of the incredible growth of prestigious awards on Grounds. He introduced Andrus Ashoo, director of UVA’s Office of Citizen Scholar Development, who has been at UVA since 2014 and deserves a great deal of credit for his oversight of this program. Mr. Ashoo has also recently taken on oversight of the undergraduate research program, and the Office of Citizen Scholar Development is in the process of becoming the home to both. Over the past nine years, student participation has increased four-fold, and now more than 1200 students participate in the fellowship process, including students at UVA Wise.

President Ryan spoke about the Rhodes Scholarship, which is perhaps the most prestigious award that can be granted to students. It involves a fully funded, full time, postgraduate award which brings young people from around the world to study at Oxford.

UVA has had 54 Rhodes Scholars. Excluding the service academies, UVA has the highest number of recipients among public institutions in the U.S. since the scholarship started in 1902. This is not just an historical artifact, as UVA has had the highest number of awards in the last 5 years, and in the last 10 years. UVA is currently 10th among all universities, public and private.

The Marshall Scholarship provides the opportunity to study at the graduate level at a U.K. institution in any field of study. Since 2014, UVA has doubled the number of its Marshall Scholars from 8 to 16. These are great opportunities for students and demonstrate how our talented staff supports them through the process.

_A Challenge UVA is Facing_

The increase in gun violence in the City of Charlottesville is at the top of many people’s minds. Nationally and locally, law enforcement has seen an increase in violence, especially gun violence. UVA houses more than 7,000 students on Grounds, but most students live off Grounds, so it is critical to work with local agencies in addressing the problem. No matter where students live, creating a safe and secure environment in which to live, learn, and work is the administration’s priority. 

Mr. Ryan gave some examples of initiatives:

*   *   National level – faculty working group convened by the Karsh Institute on causes of gun violence and how to address them;
    *   State level – advocacy for legislation that would close the higher education loophole;
    *   University level – changes to threat assessment processes and the ongoing external review process; and
    *   Local level – Community Safety Initiative – working in conjunction with the City and County; most notably the regional law enforcement agencies are cooperating on collecting and reviewing crime data and analyzing predictive patterns and trends.

Chief of Police Tim Longo and EVP and Chief Operating Officer J.J. Davis expanded on local and University initiatives to prevent gun violence, working with the City of Charlottesville and Albemarle County.

_Item for Feedback_

Mr. Ryan then shared an item for feedback: the Council of Presidents Statement on Free Expression. He gave a recap of how UVA’s Statement of the Committee on Free Inquiry and Free Expression came about, as a reminder to members of the Board.

He said given a strong discourse on Grounds about free expression in the classroom and as it relates to visitors to Grounds, and given the centrality of free expression and inquiry to the academic mission, in January 2021 he decided to form a committee that would set forward a strong and clear articulation of UVA’s values when it came to following truth, wherever it may lead. The Committee was remarkably impressive, accomplished, and diverse--in every sense of that term. Members were intentionally selected to ensure the widest possible range of viewpoints, as well as representation from the Board of Visitors, students, faculty, staff, and alumni. Leslie Kendrick, vice dean of UVA’s School of Law and director of the Center for the First Amendment at UVA Law, is a renowned expert on the First Amendment and free speech and chaired the committee. The final statement was decided upon after much debate but received a unanimous endorsement from the Committee, and it was approved by the Board of Visitors in June 2021.

He said Governor Youngkin made free speech on college campuses a priority of his when he came into office in 2022. That April, he met with the Council of Presidents (COP) and asked the group to draft their own statement on free expression that would apply to all institutions of higher education in Virginia. A working group was formed by then Council of Presidents chair, Makola Abdullah of Virginia State University, to make a recommendation to the full COP for a response to the Governor’s request. Mr. Ryan was part of that group, and they produced a final statement that the Governor has now asked to have approved by the boards of visitors. (The full statement is reproduced below the resolution approving it.)

President Ryan asked the Visitors to provide any ideas they may have along these lines, and a lively discussion ensued followed by unanimous approval of the resolution endorsing the Council of Presidents’ statement.

**STATEMENT ON FREE SPEECH**

WHEREAS, the Council of Presidents, at the Governor’s encouragement, formulated a statement expressing their collective commitment to promoting and protecting free speech;

RESOLVED, the Board of Visitors endorses the Statement on Free Speech articulated by the Council of Presidents. This statement is consistent with, and supports, the University’s Statement of the Committee on Free Expression and Free Inquiry endorsed by the Board in June 2021.

**Council of Presidents Statement on Free Speech**

As presidents of Virginia’s public colleges and universities, we unequivocally support free expression and viewpoint diversity on our campuses. Free expression is the fundamental basis for both academic freedom and for effective teaching and learning inside and outside the classroom. Our member universities and colleges are bound to uphold the First Amendment. We are committed to promoting this constitutional freedom through robust statements and policies that are formulated through shared governance processes and through actions that reflect and reinforce this core foundation of education. We value a scholarly environment that is supported by a diversity of research and intellectual perspectives among our faculty and staff. We pledge to promote and uphold inclusivity, academic freedom, free expression, and an environment that promotes civil discourse across differences. We will protect these principles when others seek to restrict them.

**Remarks by the Rector**

The Rector commented on the resilience of the community and the hard work put in by so many following the tragedy in November. The efforts to help students, faculty and staff heal, and to review everything with an eye to making processes better, has not gone unnoticed.

Mr. Clement suggested that those on the Board who have not had a chance to sit in on a class should do so. Faculty should be notified in advance of attending. He said he was certain faculty will welcome their presence.

He spoke briefly about the vice rector election that is part of the June meeting every two years. He asked that he and Mr. Hardie be notified by April 15 of any candidacy and for members to refrain from actively discussing with other members until after that date. He said the established practice for selecting a vice rector is for the board to meet in closed session in June to consider the candidates with a final vote in open session. The June closed session also includes an evaluation of the president as well as other issues, so he hoped the process for vice rector selection would be efficient. All members of the Board may run except those who will complete their second term on the Board this year. Members who will be eligible for reappointment to a second term within the next four years are eligible to run for vice rector.

Mr. Clement remarked that this is Lily Roberts’ last regular meeting as student representative, and he thanked her for her work this year. He asked Ms. Roberts to give remarks.

**Remarks by the Student Representative**

Ms. Lily Roberts’ comments are reproduced verbatim:

Thank you, Mr. Rector,

I have found recently that observation, mainly walking around grounds, speaking to passersby, and overhearing conversations, has aided me greatly in gauging student sentiments. Overwhelmingly, I can tell you this—the unexpectedly nice weather has been a welcomed opportunity to connect with one another in outdoor spaces as we continue to heal from a challenging fall semester. If you have not been in Charlottesville recently, it has been especially warm outside—I think we had one day in the low 80s last week. Seeing students coming from different experiences around the Lawn, walking to and from classes, taking a short nap in between classes, or sharing a quick meal with a friend has been so lovely to see.

In most of my conversations with students, a main priority I hope to work with you all on and hand off to my successor is addressing ever-increasing concerns around our community’s safety. Though I represent students in my remarks, it is important to recognize that safety in our geographical area extends far beyond the concern of just students. With increasing frequency, we receive community alerts concerning aggravated assaults and other incidents near Grounds which often reminds us of the twelve hours of lockdown and uncertainty we experienced in November. It is a re-traumatization that only adds to the complexity of our journey toward healing in this community.

Safety, both physical and psychological, related to gun violence, is a wicked problem in American society. As we embark on addressing this issue, I hope that we may realize this: there are no quick solutions unfortunately, but we can play to the strengths of our community—our researchers, our health system, and the diverse experiences of our community members—to create a collaborative, interdisciplinary approach to addressing physical and psychological safety moving forward.

As we work toward addressing safety in our community, as is the goal of our beloved institution, we have a charge to share our approaches broadly. I saw our community begin to share the lessons we learned from the aftermath of our tragedy with Michigan State University students who experienced the loss of three students and a similar lockdown, on the three-month anniversary here. I thank our administrators, students and all community members who provided their support to MSU.

It is quite hard to believe that this is the final meeting of my term. Just as I’ve started to get accustomed to the flow of these meetings, my time has come to an end. I have thoroughly enjoyed seeing Thomas Jefferson’s vision of lifelong learning put into practice in this space. It has been great to be in this space with all of you coming from diverse backgrounds and viewpoints and engaging in dialogue. Of course, Academic and Student Life is among my favorite committees, Buildings and Grounds is the unexpected place I saw this vision come alive—from discussing the smokestack on the Corner, to red brick, to the beloved, soon-to-be former communications shed.

It is even harder to believe that the class of 2023 is about 80 days from Final Exercises. I won’t tear up yet, but it is overwhelming to reflect on all the changes my class has experienced since entering UVA. We are the bicentennial class, coming in after the 2019 NCAA Men’s Basketball National Championship, which I have heard more times than you would expect, strongly influenced the decision of my peers to come. We came in just before the Board approved the “Great and Good: 2030 Plan.” A semester and a half into our time here, right before March Madness, our experience changed fundamentally when the COVID-19 global pandemic hit. Then, the national racial reckoning we experienced in the summer of 2020, then the insurrection on January 6, 2021 and conversations around ‘viewpoint diversity’. As my peers would say, it is going to be a hard day for future students when the APUSH curriculum comes to include this time period.

Importantly, much of the time of classes entering UVA after our first year has been shaped by national conversations around tradition. We have been challenged by one another and what is occurring in society to be inquisitive about traditions we uphold and the moment in society they derived from. I hope you’ll continue to uphold your charge to preserve traditions but stay open to embracing new traditions that current and future students will continue to invent to reflect the historical moment we’re living through.

Throughout my time here, I have noticed momentary glimpses of student engagement with decisions being made in this room. But this year, I have seen more widespread engagement among students with decisions the Board makes. More prominent press coverage of the decisions being made here and the people seated around this very table have definitely contributed to this. To put this in a context that picks up on the great conversation we had about Student Self Governance: the example of governance in this room can be a model for our engagement in the system of Student Self Governance. I hope you will all take seriously the immense opportunity we all have to lead by example by holding ourselves to values we are entrusted to protect—honor, integrity, civility and diversity in all of its forms. I have been encouraged by members, past and present, who have mentored me throughout my time in this role and inspired me to hold myself to these high standards.

I have greatly appreciated this immense opportunity to be of service to my fellow students and to this institution. Debbie and Susan, I thank you for always welcoming me into the office, always having snacks and providing your listening ears and encouragement. To my most recent predecessors, Sarita Mehta, Mazzen Shalaby, and Derrick Wang, I thank you all for providing your wisdom during difficult moments and reminders to enjoy the experience throughout my term. Thank you to Logan Smith, my counterpart at UVA-Wise, with whom I have worked closely to increase the partnership between the two campuses.

And to you all, the Board, and senior administrators, thank you for patience, kindness, and overwhelming support throughout my time. I have great appreciation for each of you for the support and guidance you have provided throughout the year. I am especially grateful that you all entrusted me with the responsibility to represent my peers. Though I will never claim to have done this job perfectly, or even as well as I hoped to, I thank you all for allowing me to complete the first part of my journey here at UVA. I have greatly enjoyed the chance to get to know each of you and will stay in touch with you.

Finally, to the next student member, I hope that you will continue to serve the student body with your background and experiences shaping the way you represent the voices and perspectives of our fellow students to this Board. This responsibility is quite the undertaking and may overwhelm you at times. You may not always handle every situation as well as you hope to or be able to make everyone happy along the way, but I hope that you will be gracious with yourself and foster many new relationships along the way. I want to impart this last piece of advice to you: please do not forget to make sure you take time for yourself and your own needs: sleeping, eating, taking the necessary steps in your classrooms to finish the degree you came here for. I expect that you will learn, grow, and share a unique love that I and student members over the past 40 years have.

**Remarks by the Faculty Senate Chair**

Professor Tish Jennings spoke about the statement on free speech, the process for selecting a faculty representative to the Board, gun violence concerns of faculty, the Strategic Research Infrastructure Initiative, and a recently launched faculty salary study. She ended with a statement on civil discourse in the pursuit of inclusive excellence. The statement is as follows:

The UVA faculty is committed to fostering an environment of civil discourse as we strive for inclusive excellence based in our values of diversity, equity, and inclusion. We feel that this is especially important at this university because we have a long history of exclusion. We believe that open and respectful communication is essential to creating a welcoming and inclusive community where all individuals can thrive. We are dedicated to engaging in conversations that embrace diverse perspectives and opinions, and to actively seeking out and valuing the voices of those who may hold different viewpoints than our own. We acknowledge that civil discourse is not always easy, but we believe that it is necessary to build understanding and empathy among individuals with differing backgrounds and experiences. We aim to listen with an open mind, speak with respect, and approach every conversation with a willingness to learn and grow.
