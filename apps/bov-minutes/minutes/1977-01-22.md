## REPORT ON LITIGATION

Mr. George G. Grattan, IV, reported to the Board on litigation involving the University. In summarizing his remarks, he advised that the University is frequently involved in legal actions related to the collection of hospital bills and other accounts.

The Rector requested that reports of litigation be made to Board members once each quarter unless in his judgment earlier advice is warranted.

## DISCUSSION OF CONTINUING THE UNIVERSITY'S MEMBERSHIP IN THE ASSOCIATION OF GOVERNING BOARDS

Following discussion, it was the sense of the meeting that the Rector, the President, and the Secretary would make a final determination as to continuation of membership in the Association of Governing Boards.

## INVITATION OF VICE-PRESIDENT JOHN OWEN TO BOARD MEMBERS

Mr. John Owen, Vice-President for Development, advised Board Members that the Development Office has now moved to its new quarters in the Northwest wing of the Rotunda and he invited members of the Board to use his reception room for family and friends when they visit the Grounds.
