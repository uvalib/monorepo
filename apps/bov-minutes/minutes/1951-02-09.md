### The following resolutions were adopted.

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the name of the School of Surgery and Gynecology be and it is hereby changed to the School of Surgery.

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the School of Preventive Medicine and Bacteriology be and it is hereby organized as two separate schools to be known as the School of Microbiology and the School of Social and Environmental Medicine.

The following resolution was adopted.

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the Hospital Accounts Committee be and it is hereby authorized to charge off as uncollectible accounts schedules 184, 185, 186 and 187, aggregating $7,069.96, recommended by them for cancellation.

The Inter-Fraternity Council requested permission to hold rushing at the close of the spring semester this year, as many students now in the University expected to be called into service in June. The President stated that he had referred the petition to the Committee of Deans and the Committee on the Lower Division. He requested authority of the Board to amend the present regulations for this year only, should the proposal meet with the approval of the committees mentioned above. A resolution was adopted leaving the decision in the matter to the discretion of the President.

A proposal from the Virginia Electric and Power Company to erect two electric poles on University property, as shown on a sketch presented by the President, was approved. The setting of these poles will provide an alternate source of power for the University in case trouble should develop on the present line.

President Darden presented to the Board the following letter.

I am writing you by direction of the Executive Committee of the Board of Trustees of The Corcoran Gallery of Art to present a formal request that the University of Virginia be so gracious as to provide space in its art museum building for a selected group of the most valuable works of art in the collections of The Corcoran Gallery of Art in the event that the international situation seems to require the removal of these irreplaceable treasures from the city of Washington. It is my understanding, based on two discussions with you and with Mr. O'Neal, the Acting Director of the Museum, that this action would be endorsed by you provided that we release the University from all liability for loss or damage from any cause whatsoever to any of the works of art which might be housed in the University, and provided further that the University would not incur any expense in connection with the transportation or housing of the works of art in question. Both of these above points are completely satisfactory to the Gallery.

It is my further understanding that the Gallery would be permitted to occupy the following storage areas. A section of the second floor storage room measuring approximately 19½ × 36 feet. The Gallery would cause a brick partition extending across the narrow side of this room to be constructed and would install therein a bank vault door at its own expense. The other room is the gallery on the ground floor measuring approximately 22 feet by 45 feet. Here we would be permitted to change the lock on the steel door to provide greater security.

The Gallery would provide and pay for its own guards and watchmen for round-the-clock protection and we would also construct, at our own expense, a number of temporary pylons or partitions to provide for extra wall display space in the galleries on the first and second floors where exhibitions of paintings and other works of art from time-to-time would be organized for the benefit of the students.

On behalf of the Executive Committee of the Board of Trustees, I take this opportunity of expressing our deep appreciation for the generosity of the administration of the University of Virginia in giving this pressing problem such favorable consideration and I sincerely hope that the Board of Visitors will see fit to approve our request, which I think will prove to be not only of great service to the Gallery but also of value to the University and its students.

The Board approved in general the proposal but requested that the President place a time limit on the use of the museum by the Corcoran Gallery, and that a saving clause be inserted in any agreement, whereby the Corcoran Gallery would agree to move its collection upon reasonable notice, should the University need the space utilized.

President Darden said that he wished to advise the Board that the National Gallery of Art had asked the University if permission might be secured to build an air-conditioned storage warehouse on University property. This warehouse would be used by the Gallery during the present emergency and when it was no longer needed by the Gallery it would be given to the University. The President stated that no definite proposal had been received as yet from the National Gallery, but he simply wanted to keep the Board informed.

Mr. Gay pointed out that a sizable number of University graduates of the Law School had in recent years been failing the State Bar Examination. A discussion of the matter then occurred which may be summarized as follows.

It is the practice on the part of the State Board of Law Examiners of asking questions which concern the Virginia Code. It was freely admitted that the law course at the University of Virginia does not cover the Virginia Code. However, in order to do this adequately, a great amount of time would be required. The subject of the Virginia Code would be of little interest to out-of-state students, and we are very anxious to retain in the membership of the Law School a considerable number of out-of-state students. It was first proposed that some change be made in the courses at the Law School. Then, however, it seemed to be the consensus that the fault did not lie with the Law School, but rather with the kind of questions asked by the law examiners. When this stage of the discussion was reached, a motion was passed requesting President Darden to confer with Dean Ribble and suggest that the deans of the law schools appear before the Board of Law Examiners and lay before that Board the dilemma of the law schools and inferentially ask that the nature of the questions be more in relation to the general law, rather than to the statutes of Virginia.

### The following resolutions were adopted.

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the new infirmary building at Mary Washington College be named in honor of Dr. Hugh Mercer, and as customary, that the college be authorized to install a bronze plaque carrying the name of the building and other appropriate information.

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the central unit of the new Fine Arts Group now under construction at Mary Washington College be and is hereby named Jesse Ball duPont in honor of Mrs. Alfred I. duPont in recognition of her generosity and deep interest in the college.

President Combs stated that inquiries had been received by the college as to whether or not the Board of Visitors would entertain the establishment of a Naval ROTC Unit of Waves at Mary Washington College, should the Navy desire to establish same. Whereupon a resolution was adopted by the Board approving the establishment of such a unit should it be asked by the Navy.

The question of a calendar for the Mary Washington budget was deferred until the March meeting.

### Bids as follows were received on the Physical Education and Classroom Building:

The above building contains 633,500 cubic feet. The low bid received was $1.07 per cubic foot.

President Combs did not recommend the acceptance of these bids. He did suggest an appearance be made before the Governor to ask release of a part of the conditional appropriation for the Science Building, to finance the Physical Education Building. However, President Darden discouraged this, because he recited a recent discussion he had with Governor Battle in which the Governor stated flatly that he could not release these conditional funds.

President Combs was instructed to reject the above bids. The appropriation for the above building amounts to $300,000. President Combs stated that he believed the school could finance a loan of $150,000 on this building, but an additional $300,000 would still be needed. He suggested that the Governor be asked to release a part of the conditional appropriation for the Science Building to finance this structure. The matter was referred to the Mary Washington Committee to decide which building should be constructed first; the Mary Washington Committee was then asked to refer the financing of the building to the Finance Committee.

The meeting was then adjourned.
