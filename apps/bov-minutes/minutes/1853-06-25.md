Wednesday Morning June 29th 1853

Mr Mason from the Committee of Finance presented the following report-

The Committee of Finance have had under consideration the matters referred to them and submit the following report-

They have found the accounts of the Proctor & the Bursar duly audited & examined by P. E. Bacon Esqr who was appointed Commissioner for that purpose, & certified by him to be correct and that each item of disbursment is sustained by a proper voucher, and your Committee have regarded that certificate as evidence of the fact

These estimates provide for all the regular expenditures of the University for the payment of interest on the debts to Mrs Randolph & to Mr Cocke and for a disbursment of near two thousand dollars for repairs of the buildings. The periodical payment of the annuity with the Balance on hand will probably enable the Bursar to meet the claims of the contractors on the new building & although a deficit will exist in the fiscal year the surplus revenue of the next year will meet it & the completion of the new building, superseding necessity for further expenditure on that account will leave that surplus applicable to the desirable object of liquidating the floating debts of the University.

Your Committee invite your attention to the credit to the University in the past years accounts, arising from surplus fees. The charges to the students have not been increased, and yet under the regulation of a maximum allowance to the Professors of $3000 respectively the credit from that source, amounted last year to $7514 66/100. Before the limitation of the Professors income was fixed, they were charged with rent of dormitories, fuel & light for their Lecture rooms, and the State has imposed an income tax which charges continue, and they are still thus chargeable, while the surplus of their fees goes into the Treasury of the University. Your Committee believe that it was the intention of the Visiters to secure to the Professors the sum of $3000 per annum where the fees exceeded that sum, Under existing circumstances their receipts do not realize so much. Your Committee recommend that the surplus fees may be subjected to the charges above enumerated, & report the following resolutions.

Resolved that if it be necessary in meeting pressing demands on the University within the next six months to anticipate the income of the University by a temporary loan, the Executive Committee be authorized to direct the Proctor to negotiate a loan at one of the Banks in Charlottesville of not more than five thousand dollars for a period not exceeding four months-

Resolved that whenever the fees of any school shall exceed three thousand dollars per session the surplus shall go to the University charged with the payment of dormitory rent, fuel & lights for lecture rooms and income tax so as to ensure to the Professors respectively three thousand dollars each-

The question being put on the resolutions recommended by the Committee of Finance, they were severally agreed to-

Mr Stevenson from the Committee of inspection made the following report which on motion was received, approved, and referred to the Executive Committee

The Committee of Inspection having discharged the duty assigned them beg leave to report:

That they found the several departments of the University in apparently good order, and condition-

In the Library room the books appeared to be arranged according to the order of the printed catalogue & the shelves labelled with printed labels corresponding with each of its chapters. There are forty or fifty engravings & prints (the donation of the late Christian Bohn) hung upon nails driven into the columns, and badly arranged and detracting from the appearance and beauty of the room, and which in the opinion of your Committee ought to be removed and placed in some other suitable position- The museum might be used for that purpose.

The Laboratory & Lecture Room in the new building have been filled up in the most convenient manner by Dr J. S. Smith. It appears that the original scheme of having iron benches in the lecture room was thought not to have sufficient advantages to compensate for the increased expense. Two years interest upon the cost of iron benches being amply sufficient to renew entirely the wooden benches as they now stand. The substitution therefore of wood instead of iron affords comfort with easy renewal of such parts as may be defaced by the students-The tables and other arrangements about the lecture rooms are most convenient for the purposes to which they are applied-The Laboratory we also examined in detail, with reference to its fixtures- Two small rooms have been cut off from the main room for a store and instrument room. The tables are constructed with reference to the future use of the Laboratory for practical instruction; the tops of them are made of thick St Domingo mahogany, the only kind of wood your Committee understand fitted for tops of laboratory tables- Dr Smith who attended us, next explained the arrangements for conducting chemical apparatus in the Laboratory with perfect ventilation and escape of all vapors- This seems to be happily accomplished by two pieces of structure of glazed iron frames with proper arrangement of furnaces, sand baths, water baths &c- The supply of the Laboratory with water (an important consideration in view of cleanliness, the first feature of a good laboratory) has been also well accomplished at less expense and with vastly more convenience than by the former plan of digging a well near the Laboratory. This was brought from the cistern back of the Chapel by a leaden pipe & distributed in a fitting manner over the Lecture room and Laboratory. Connected with the latter is a portion of the north arcade, that has been enclosed and is now used as a cellar for coals &c, but your Committee understand that this arcade, with the portion now used by the Janitor, can be fitted up at any time (by enlarging the windows) so as to furnish an extension to the Laboratory, whenever required and could be made in any respect not much behind the present Laboratory, & when thus extended it might be made to accommodate forty or fifty working students.

It appears to your Committee that the whole building capacity of lecture room, Laboratory &c is not surpassed by any institution of the kind, and equalled probably by very few. Indeed there is nothing in the opinion of the Committee to prevent its development for the most perfect instruction in agricultural, manufactural & pharmacopeial Chemistry.

In examining the various parts of the University we found great delapidation and injury to many parts of the buildings &c; many of the doors of the dormitories have been cut & injured & some of them actually torn down from their hinges. The glass in many of the windows of the offices attached to the Hotels are broken out and defaced- The plastering beneath the terraces in many places have fallen down from leaks in the covering, which is rotting down and which require immediate and suitable repairs.

They found the public water closets filthy & a perfect nuisance & endangering the health of the students.

We also found in front of many of the dormitories a part of the brick under pinning broken down for the purpose of ventilation; instead of having it done in the rear of the buildings.

We also found the stone steps of the Rotunda in a state requiring attention and repair- In the present state of the steps the bases of the columns are in danger, & the Committee recommend immediate reparation of the same.

The Committee are decidedly of opinion that in relation to the preservation, weakness and condition of the buildings &c of the University, some more efficient guards should be provided and enforced to protect & preserve them-

All which is respectfully submitted to the Board

On motion of Mr Mason,

Resolved that the Board of Visiters have during the short period of Professor Smiths connection with the University witnessed with gratification satisfactory proof of great learning & earnest devotion to his duties sustaining the high reputation which he brought here, and justifying the high confidence reposed in him. The Board of Visiters entertaining these views take pleasure in expressing their regret at Professor Smiths separation from the University and especially express their sense of Dr Smiths important services in fitting up & arranging the Laboratory of the School of Chemistry.

The Rector laid before the Board a circular letter from the Proctor with a public advertisement as follows:

"School at Gordonsville"

"The Subscriber will open a boarding school for boys at Gordonsville Va on the 25th of September next.

The course of instruction will be based upon that pursued at the University of Virginia and will afford a thorough preparation either for college or for the business pursuits of life

The location has been selected with an eye to its unequalled advantages being in a beautiful region of country, remarkable for health and refined society and accessible by railroad and stages from every quarter- The buildings have been thoroughly repaired, & will afford comfortable accommodations for about fifty boarders.

Instruction in the several departments will be given by Mr John C. Pettus and Delaware Kemper graduates of the University."

And upon consultation with the Visiters of the Board they deemed it proper to request the attendance of Col Kemper for any explanation that he might be disposed to make upon the subject- Col Kemper accordingly appeared before the Board & gave an explanation of the subject contained in the circular & advertizement & then withdrew

Whereupon the Board proceeded to deliberate on the subject & came to the following resolution

Resolved unanimously as the opinion of the Board of Visiters now present that under the existing circumstances the situation of Col Kemper is such as to render it not only incompatible but also unpracticable for him to discharge the duties of the Proctor of the University in a manner satisfactory to the Board of Visiters

Ordered that the Secretary communicate to Col Kemper the action of the Board-

The Board thereupon adjourned until tomorrow morning

Thursday Morning June 30th /53

Present the same Board as on yesterday with the exception of Mr Stevenson

The Board of Visiters being informed that Wm S. Kemper Esqr regards the resolution adopted yesterday and communicated to him as his dismissal from the office of Proctor, adhering to the resolution aforesaid deeming his presence and the superintending care of the Proctor at all times especially during the vacation as indispensable to the security of the buildings and property of the University, and not satisfied that this attention has been given or may be calculated on in the future, it is ordered that his office of Proctor be hereby vacated

Ordered further that George W. Spooner be appointed to perform the duties of Proctor until one shall be permanently appointed and for the purpose of making said appointment when the Board adjourn, it will adjourn to meet again on Thursday the first day of September next.

Ordered that N. H. Massie as Commissioner be authorized & required to examine & certify to the Chairman of the Faculty such accounts as may be due & payable on account of work or materials done or rendered about the new Building or addition to the Rotunda, until a Proctor shall be appointed, and the acting Proctor is hereby authorized to pay said bills on the certificate of said Commissioner under the direction of the Chairman-

On motion of Mr Randolph

Resolved that the Superintendent of the New Building be directed forthwith to cause strong and substantial shutters to be put to the sub-basement windows of the building.

The Rector laid before the Board a communication from Professors Cabell and Howard asking for a transfer of certain duties now pertaining to the school of Chemistry to the Lecturer of of Anatomy - And thereupon the following preamble & resolutions were agreed to-

Whereas the Board of Visiters are satisfied that the interests of both the academical & the Medical departments of the University would be promoted by assigning to the Lecturer on Anatomy the duty of teaching Materia Medica & Therapeutics and by requiring the Professor of Chemistry in consideration of the relief thus afforded him to give a more extended course of instruction to the Academic students on Agricultural Chemistry and to the Medical students on practical Pharmacy it is resolved

1\. That the Professor of Chemistry be relieved from the duty of teaching Materia Medica & Therapeutics & that these subjects be assigned to the Lecturer on Anatomy

2\. That in consideration of the relief thus afforded to the Professor of Chemistry he be required to give a more extended course of lectures on agricultural chemistry and to furnish practical instruction in Pharmacy according to the plan pursued in the Philadelphia school of Practical Pharmacy as set forth in an announcement laid before this Board by the Medical Professors,

3\. That the fee to be paid by each medical student to the Lecturer on Anatomy and Materia Medica be twenty five dollars And if the aggregate amount should exceed two thousand dollars the surplus shall be appropriated to the purchase of specimens for the cabinets of Anatomy & Materia Medica

4\. That the Lecturer on Anatomy and Materia Medica be relieved from the duties of the Demonstratorship & that of lecturing on Pathological Anatomy and that he be authorized to nominate with the advice & consert of the Medical Professors a Demonstrator of Anatomy to be paid as heretofore-

5\. That the annual appropriation of fifty dollars now allowed to the Professor of Materia Medica be continued to the Professor of Chemistry to carry out the provisions of the foregoing resolutions with reference to the instruction to be given in Practical Pharmacy

On motion of Mr Mason

A communication from the Faculty relative to the weekly reports of the Professors & the modification of the law concerning the intermidiated examinations, was read & thereupon it is ordered that the consideration thereof be postponed-

The Rector laid before the Board a petition of sundry students of the University relative to the charge for room rent of licensed boarding houses without the limits of the University, which on motion of Mr Mason was ordered to be referred to the Faculty-

In accordance with the prayer of the Hotel Keepers of the University and in view of the greatly increase cost of the means of living

Ordered that in future the Board at the Hotels be increased to $120 per session, & that the Hotel Keepers be allowed the use of four acres of land each in addition to that now allowed by the regulations of the Board of Visiters, to be assigned them by the Proctor under direction of the Chairman of the Faculty and enclosed at the cost of the Hotel Keepers respectively-

Circular Letter                      of Col Wm S. Kemper in relation to a school in Gordonsville-

It has been a cherished object with me for several years to establish a first class Boarding school for boys upon the completion of the education of my sons at the University with a view of placing them in a situation by which they would be enabled to earn a comfortable & honourable livelihood

To enable me to carry into effect that object I have recently purchased a beautiful situation at Gordonsville within 1/2 mile of the intersection of the two great leading rail roads of the State. There is perhaps no position in Virginia possessing nore advantages for the proposed object than the one selected Being in a beautiful & healthy region of country in the midst of an enlightened community, accessible from every point by railroad & stages together with its proximity to our noble University very justly termed "the pride of the South" I feel great confidence that a Boarding School for Boys thus located and conducted upon right principles, must commend itself to the attention as I am determined it shall merit the confidence & patronage of an enlightened public-

Although I have filled an obscure position at this seat of learning for the last seven years, I think I may without arrogance claim some little credit at least for aiding in "building up her broken down walls and clothing her waste places with verdue", and in retiring from her immediate service feel that I could not better subserve her interests than by training fresh & worthy recruits to replenish her ranks.

I shall engage some gentleman of experience to take charge of the school, assisted by my eldest son together with such other aid as the demands of the School may require. My connection with the University gives me peculiar advantages in procuring the best talent for that purpose.

The object of this Circular, is simply to call your attention to the subject, and respectfully ask your friendly cooperation

As soon as my arragements are completed I will advertize in the papers

The receipts during the fiscal year ending May 31st ult amounted to

Bacon Esqr who was appointed Commissioner for that purpose, & certified by him to be correct and that each item of disbursment is sustained by a proper voucher, and your Committee have regarded that certificate as evidence of the fact

These estimates provide for all the regular expenditures of the University for the payment of interest on the debts to Mrs Randolph & to Mr Cocke and for a disbursment of near two thousand dollars for repairs of the buildings. The periodical payment of the annuity with the Balance on hand will probably enable the Bursar to meet the claims of the contractors on the new building & although a deficit will exist in the fiscal year the surplus revenue of the next year will meet it & the completion of the new building, superseding necessity for further expenditure on that account will leave that surplus applicable to the desirable object of liquidating the floating debts of the University.

Your Committee invite your attention to the credit to the University in the past years accounts, arising from surplus fees. The charges to the students have not been increased, and yet under the regulation of a maximum allowance to the Professors of $3000 respectively the credit from that source, amounted last year to $7514 66/100. Before the limitation of the Professors income was fixed, they were charged with rent of dormitories, fuel & light for their Lecture rooms, and the State has imposed an income tax which charges continue, and they are still thus chargeable, while the surplus of their fees goes into the Treasury of the University. Your Committee believe that it was the intention of the Visiters to secure to the Professors the sum of $3000 per annum where the fees exceeded that sum, Under existing circumstances their receipts do not realize so much. Your Committee recommend that the surplus fees may be subjected to the charges above enumerated, & report the following resolutions.

Resolved that if it be necessary in meeting pressing demands on the University within the next six months to anticipate the income of the University by a temporary loan, the Executive Committee be authorized to direct the Proctor to negotiate a loan at one of the Banks in Charlottesville of not more than five thousand dollars for a period not exceeding four months-

Resolved that whenever the fees of any school shall exceed three thousand dollars per session the surplus shall go to the University charged with the payment of dormitory rent, fuel & lights for lecture rooms and income tax so as to ensure to the Professors respectively three thousand dollars each-

The question being put on the resolutions recommended by the Committee of Finance, they were severally agreed to-

Mr Stevenson from the Committee of inspection made the following report which on motion was received, approved, and referred to the Executive Committee

The Committee of Inspection having discharged the duty assigned them beg leave to report:

That they found the several departments of the University in apparently good order, and condition-

In the Library room the books appeared to be arranged according to the order of the printed catalogue & the shelves labelled with printed labels corresponding with each of its chapters. There are forty or fifty engravings & prints (the donation of the late Christian Bohn) hung upon nails driven into the columns, and badly arranged and detracting from the appearance and beauty of the room, and which in the opinion of your Committee ought to be removed and placed in some other suitable position- The museum might be used for that purpose.

The Laboratory & Lecture Room in the new building have been filled up in the most convenient manner by Dr J. S. Smith. It appears that the original scheme of having iron benches in the lecture room was thought not to have sufficient advantages to compensate for the increased expense. Two years interest upon the cost of iron benches being amply sufficient to renew entirely the wooden benches as they now stand. The substitution therefore of wood instead of iron affords comfort with easy renewal of such parts as may be defaced by the students-The tables and other arrangements about the lecture rooms are most convenient for the purposes to which they are applied-The Laboratory we also examined in detail, with reference to its fixtures- Two small rooms have been cut off from the main room for a store and instrument room. The tables are constructed with reference to the future use of the Laboratory for practical instruction; the tops of them are made of thick St Domingo mahogany, the only kind of wood your Committee understand fitted for tops of laboratory tables- Dr Smith who attended us, next explained the arrangements for conducting chemical apparatus in the Laboratory with perfect ventilation and escape of all vapors- This seems to be happily accomplished by two pieces of structure of glazed iron frames with proper arrangement of furnaces, sand baths, water baths &c- The supply of the Laboratory with water (an important consideration in view of cleanliness, the first feature of a good laboratory) has been also well accomplished at less expense and with vastly more convenience than by the former plan of digging a well near the Laboratory. This was brought from the cistern back of the Chapel by a leaden pipe & distributed in a fitting manner over the Lecture room and Laboratory. Connected with the latter is a portion of the north arcade, that has been enclosed and is now used as a cellar for coals &c, but your Committee understand that this arcade, with the portion now used by the Janitor, can be fitted up at any time (by enlarging the windows) so as to furnish an extension to the Laboratory, whenever required and could be made in any respect not much behind the present Laboratory, & when thus extended it might be made to accommodate forty or fifty working students.

It appears to your Committee that the whole building capacity of lecture room, Laboratory &c is not surpassed by any institution of the kind, and equalled probably by very few. Indeed there is nothing in the opinion of the Committee to prevent its development for the most perfect instruction in agricultural, manufactural & pharmacopeial Chemistry.

In examining the various parts of the University we found great delapidation and injury to many parts of the buildings &c; many of the doors of the dormitories have been cut & injured & some of them actually torn down from their hinges. The glass in many of the windows of the offices attached to the Hotels are broken out and defaced- The plastering beneath the terraces in many places have fallen down from leaks in the covering, which is rotting down and which require immediate and suitable repairs.

They found the public water closets filthy & a perfect nuisance & endangering the health of the students.

We also found in front of many of the dormitories a part of the brick under pinning broken down for the purpose of ventilation; instead of having it done in the rear of the buildings.

We also found the stone steps of the Rotunda in a state requiring attention and repair- In the present state of the steps the bases of the columns are in danger, & the Committee recommend immediate reparation of the same.

The Committee are decidedly of opinion that in relation to the preservation, weakness and condition of the buildings &c of the University, some more efficient guards should be provided and enforced to protect & preserve them-

All which is respectfully submitted to the Board

On motion of Mr Mason,

Resolved that the Board of Visiters have during the short period of Professor Smiths connection with the University witnessed with gratification satisfactory proof of great learning & earnest devotion to his duties sustaining the high reputation which he brought here, and justifying the high confidence reposed in him. The Board of Visiters entertaining these views take pleasure in expressing their regret at Professor Smiths separation from the University and especially express their sense of Dr Smiths important services in fitting up & arranging the Laboratory of the School of Chemistry.

The Rector laid before the Board a circular letter from the Proctor with a public advertisement as follows:

"School at Gordonsville"

"The Subscriber will open a boarding school for boys at Gordonsville Va on the 25th of September next.

The course of instruction will be based upon that pursued at the University of Virginia and will afford a thorough preparation either for college or for the business pursuits of life

The location has been selected with an eye to its unequalled advantages being in a beautiful region of country, remarkable for health and refined society and accessible by railroad and stages from every quarter- The buildings have been thoroughly repaired, & will afford comfortable accommodations for about fifty boarders.

It has been a cherished object with me for several years to establish a first class Boarding school for boys upon the completion of the education of my sons at the University with a view of placing them in a situation by which they would be enabled to earn a comfortable & honourable livelihood

To enable me to carry into effect that object I have recently purchased a beautiful situation at Gordonsville within 1/2 mile of the intersection of the two great leading rail roads of the State. There is perhaps no position in Virginia possessing nore advantages for the proposed object than the one selected Being in a beautiful & healthy region of country in the midst of an enlightened community, accessible from every point by railroad & stages together with its proximity to our noble University very justly termed "the pride of the South" I feel great confidence that a Boarding School for Boys thus located and conducted upon right principles, must commend itself to the attention as I am determined it shall merit the confidence & patronage of an enlightened public-

Although I have filled an obscure position at this seat of learning for the last seven years, I think I may without arrogance claim some little credit at least for aiding in "building up her broken down walls and clothing her waste places with verdue", and in retiring from her immediate service feel that I could not better subserve her interests than by training fresh & worthy recruits to replenish her ranks.

I shall engage some gentleman of experience to take charge of the school, assisted by my eldest son together with such other aid as the demands of the School may require. My connection with the University gives me peculiar advantages in procuring the best talent for that purpose.

The object of this Circular, is simply to call your attention to the subject, and respectfully ask your friendly cooperation

As soon as my arragements are completed I will advertize in the papers

The receipts during the fiscal year ending May 31st ult amounted to

$60310.52

Disbursments during same period

56777.17

Leaving on hand unexpended the end of the year

$ 3533.35

The receipts include the proceeds of the loan authorized by the act of February 17th 1852 & the disbursments embrace expenditures on the addition to the Rotunda which are extraordinary and not to be regarded as regular annual charges. The large amount of receipts & expenditures is thus explained. On an analysis of the accounts it appears that the ordinary current revenues of the University for the past year from the annuity allowed from the Literary fund, from rents, surplus fees, assessments & other regular sources of income amounted to

$31282.17

Ordinary annual disbursments

25606.46

Which if not affected by extraordinary demands would have left a bal: unexpended of

5675.71

The actual balance remaining unexpended in the hands of the Bursar on the first of June inst was

$ 3533.36

Assuming that the same number of students may be expected as have attended the present session and the same amt of revenues will be accrued which is

31282.17

There will be available for current year

34815.53

The regular expenditures of the University for the current year may be estimated at

$26,606.46

By report of Superintendent it appears there will be

payable to the contractors on the new building for reserved percentage & estimates according to the stipulations of their contracts

11,301.25

And that officer estimates as necessary to complete the building & grade the grounds around it at the further sum of

3,000.00

$40907.71

Deficit

Wednesday Morning June 29th 1853

Mr Mason from the Committee of Finance presented the following report-

The Committee of Finance have had under consideration the matters referred to them and submit the following report-

They have found the accounts of the Proctor & the Bursar duly audited & examined by P. E. Bacon Esqr who was appointed Commissioner for that purpose, & certified by him to be correct and that each item of disbursment is sustained by a proper voucher, and your Committee have regarded that certificate as evidence of the fact

These estimates provide for all the regular expenditures of the University for the payment of interest on the debts to Mrs Randolph & to Mr Cocke and for a disbursment of near two thousand dollars for repairs of the buildings. The periodical payment of the annuity with the Balance on hand will probably enable the Bursar to meet the claims of the contractors on the new building & although a deficit will exist in the fiscal year the surplus revenue of the next year will meet it & the completion of the new building, superseding necessity for further expenditure on that account will leave that surplus applicable to the desirable object of liquidating the floating debts of the University.

Your Committee invite your attention to the credit to the University in the past years accounts, arising from surplus fees. The charges to the students have not been increased, and yet under the regulation of a maximum allowance to the Professors of $3000 respectively the credit from that source, amounted last year to $7514 66/100. Before the limitation of the Professors income was fixed, they were charged with rent of dormitories, fuel & light for their Lecture rooms, and the State has imposed an income tax which charges continue, and they are still thus chargeable, while the surplus of their fees goes into the Treasury of the University. Your Committee believe that it was the intention of the Visiters to secure to the Professors the sum of $3000 per annum where the fees exceeded that sum, Under existing circumstances their receipts do not realize so much. Your Committee recommend that the surplus fees may be subjected to the charges above enumerated, & report the following resolutions.

Resolved that if it be necessary in meeting pressing demands on the University within the next six months to anticipate the income of the University by a temporary loan, the Executive Committee be authorized to direct the Proctor to negotiate a loan at one of the Banks in Charlottesville of not more than five thousand dollars for a period not exceeding four months-

Resolved that whenever the fees of any school shall exceed three thousand dollars per session the surplus shall go to the University charged with the payment of dormitory rent, fuel & lights for lecture rooms and income tax so as to ensure to the Professors respectively three thousand dollars each-

The question being put on the resolutions recommended by the Committee of Finance, they were severally agreed to-

Mr Stevenson from the Committee of inspection made the following report which on motion was received, approved, and referred to the Executive Committee

The Committee of Inspection having discharged the duty assigned them beg leave to report:

That they found the several departments of the University in apparently good order, and condition-

In the Library room the books appeared to be arranged according to the order of the printed catalogue & the shelves labelled with printed labels corresponding with each of its chapters. There are forty or fifty engravings & prints (the donation of the late Christian Bohn) hung upon nails driven into the columns, and badly arranged and detracting from the appearance and beauty of the room, and which in the opinion of your Committee ought to be removed and placed in some other suitable position- The museum might be used for that purpose.

The Laboratory & Lecture Room in the new building have been filled up in the most convenient manner by Dr J. S. Smith. It appears that the original scheme of having iron benches in the lecture room was thought not to have sufficient advantages to compensate for the increased expense. Two years interest upon the cost of iron benches being amply sufficient to renew entirely the wooden benches as they now stand. The substitution therefore of wood instead of iron affords comfort with easy renewal of such parts as may be defaced by the students-The tables and other arrangements about the lecture rooms are most convenient for the purposes to which they are applied-The Laboratory we also examined in detail, with reference to its fixtures- Two small rooms have been cut off from the main room for a store and instrument room. The tables are constructed with reference to the future use of the Laboratory for practical instruction; the tops of them are made of thick St Domingo mahogany, the only kind of wood your Committee understand fitted for tops of laboratory tables- Dr Smith who attended us, next explained the arrangements for conducting chemical apparatus in the Laboratory with perfect ventilation and escape of all vapors- This seems to be happily accomplished by two pieces of structure of glazed iron frames with proper arrangement of furnaces, sand baths, water baths &c- The supply of the Laboratory with water (an important consideration in view of cleanliness, the first feature of a good laboratory) has been also well accomplished at less expense and with vastly more convenience than by the former plan of digging a well near the Laboratory. This was brought from the cistern back of the Chapel by a leaden pipe & distributed in a fitting manner over the Lecture room and Laboratory. Connected with the latter is a portion of the north arcade, that has been enclosed and is now used as a cellar for coals &c, but your Committee understand that this arcade, with the portion now used by the Janitor, can be fitted up at any time (by enlarging the windows) so as to furnish an extension to the Laboratory, whenever required and could be made in any respect not much behind the present Laboratory, & when thus extended it might be made to accommodate forty or fifty working students.

It appears to your Committee that the whole building capacity of lecture room, Laboratory &c is not surpassed by any institution of the kind, and equalled probably by very few. Indeed there is nothing in the opinion of the Committee to prevent its development for the most perfect instruction in agricultural, manufactural & pharmacopeial Chemistry.

In examining the various parts of the University we found great delapidation and injury to many parts of the buildings &c; many of the doors of the dormitories have been cut & injured & some of them actually torn down from their hinges. The glass in many of the windows of the offices attached to the Hotels are broken out and defaced- The plastering beneath the terraces in many places have fallen down from leaks in the covering, which is rotting down and which require immediate and suitable repairs.

They found the public water closets filthy & a perfect nuisance & endangering the health of the students.

We also found in front of many of the dormitories a part of the brick under pinning broken down for the purpose of ventilation; instead of having it done in the rear of the buildings.

We also found the stone steps of the Rotunda in a state requiring attention and repair- In the present state of the steps the bases of the columns are in danger, & the Committee recommend immediate reparation of the same.

The Committee are decidedly of opinion that in relation to the preservation, weakness and condition of the buildings &c of the University, some more efficient guards should be provided and enforced to protect & preserve them-

All which is respectfully submitted to the Board

On motion of Mr Mason,

Resolved that the Board of Visiters have during the short period of Professor Smiths connection with the University witnessed with gratification satisfactory proof of great learning & earnest devotion to his duties sustaining the high reputation which he brought here, and justifying the high confidence reposed in him. The Board of Visiters entertaining these views take pleasure in expressing their regret at Professor Smiths separation from the University and especially express their sense of Dr Smiths important services in fitting up & arranging the Laboratory of the School of Chemistry.

The Rector laid before the Board a circular letter from the Proctor with a public advertisement as follows:

"School at Gordonsville"

"The Subscriber will open a boarding school for boys at Gordonsville Va on the 25th of September next.

The course of instruction will be based upon that pursued at the University of Virginia and will afford a thorough preparation either for college or for the business pursuits of life

The location has been selected with an eye to its unequalled advantages being in a beautiful region of country, remarkable for health and refined society and accessible by railroad and stages from every quarter- The buildings have been thoroughly repaired, & will afford comfortable accommodations for about fifty boarders.

Instruction in the several departments will be given by Mr John C. Pettus and Delaware Kemper graduates of the University."

And upon consultation with the Visiters of the Board they deemed it proper to request the attendance of Col Kemper for any explanation that he might be disposed to make upon the subject- Col Kemper accordingly appeared before the Board & gave an explanation of the subject contained in the circular & advertizement & then withdrew

Whereupon the Board proceeded to deliberate on the subject & came to the following resolution

Resolved unanimously as the opinion of the Board of Visiters now present that under the existing circumstances the situation of Col Kemper is such as to render it not only incompatible but also unpracticable for him to discharge the duties of the Proctor of the University in a manner satisfactory to the Board of Visiters

Ordered that the Secretary communicate to Col Kemper the action of the Board-

The Board thereupon adjourned until tomorrow morning

Thursday Morning June 30th /53

Present the same Board as on yesterday with the exception of Mr Stevenson

The Board of Visiters being informed that Wm S. Kemper Esqr regards the resolution adopted yesterday and communicated to him as his dismissal from the office of Proctor, adhering to the resolution aforesaid deeming his presence and the superintending care of the Proctor at all times especially during the vacation as indispensable to the security of the buildings and property of the University, and not satisfied that this attention has been given or may be calculated on in the future, it is ordered that his office of Proctor be hereby vacated

Ordered further that George W. Spooner be appointed to perform the duties of Proctor until one shall be permanently appointed and for the purpose of making said appointment when the Board adjourn, it will adjourn to meet again on Thursday the first day of September next.

Ordered that N. H. Massie as Commissioner be authorized & required to examine & certify to the Chairman of the Faculty such accounts as may be due & payable on account of work or materials done or rendered about the new Building or addition to the Rotunda, until a Proctor shall be appointed, and the acting Proctor is hereby authorized to pay said bills on the certificate of said Commissioner under the direction of the Chairman-

On motion of Mr Randolph

It has been a cherished object with me for several years to establish a first class Boarding school for boys upon the completion of the education of my sons at the University with a view of placing them in a situation by which they would be enabled to earn a comfortable & honourable livelihood

To enable me to carry into effect that object I have recently purchased a beautiful situation at Gordonsville within 1/2 mile of the intersection of the two great leading rail roads of the State. There is perhaps no position in Virginia possessing nore advantages for the proposed object than the one selected Being in a beautiful & healthy region of country in the midst of an enlightened community, accessible from every point by railroad & stages together with its proximity to our noble University very justly termed "the pride of the South" I feel great confidence that a Boarding School for Boys thus located and conducted upon right principles, must commend itself to the attention as I am determined it shall merit the confidence & patronage of an enlightened public-

Although I have filled an obscure position at this seat of learning for the last seven years, I think I may without arrogance claim some little credit at least for aiding in "building up her broken down walls and clothing her waste places with verdue", and in retiring from her immediate service feel that I could not better subserve her interests than by training fresh & worthy recruits to replenish her ranks.

I shall engage some gentleman of experience to take charge of the school, assisted by my eldest son together with such other aid as the demands of the School may require. My connection with the University gives me peculiar advantages in procuring the best talent for that purpose.

The object of this Circular, is simply to call your attention to the subject, and respectfully ask your friendly cooperation

As soon as my arragements are completed I will advertize in the papers
