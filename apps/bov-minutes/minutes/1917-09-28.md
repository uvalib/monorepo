A called meeting of the Rector and Visitors was held on this date at 10:30 A. M., with the following members present: The Rector, Armistead C. Gordon, Goodrich Hatton, Judge Norton, Wm. H. White, G. R. B. Michie, John W. Craddock, R. Tate Irvine, Robert Turnbull, and President Alderman.

It was ordered that the minutes of the meeting of May 31, 1917 be copied from the journal and sent to the members for review.

President Alderman announced the following gifts, acknowledgment of which had been made in due form:

A letter was read from Mr. Bentley W. Warren, one of the Trustees of the Arthur W. Austin Estate, advising the Board of the resignation of Mr. Endicott as a trustee of said estate, and suggesting the names of Mr. Irvin McDowell Garfield and Mr. Moses Williams as desirable persons to fill the vacancy. The Board chose Mr. Garfield and directed the secretary to so notify Mr. Warren of its action.

It having been brought to the attention of the Board that vacancies in the Thomas Forturn Ryan Scholarships existed in the Third, Fifth and Ninth Districts, by reason of those elected at the May meeting of the Board to fill the scholarships for those districts, have enlisted in the military service of the United States, on motion, the following selection for these districts was made, namely:

In filling the vacancy in the Eighth District, the following offered by Judge Norton was adopted:

**RESOLVED:** That the Ryan Scholarship for the Eighth Congressional District be transferred from Chas. B. Sullivan to Mr. Charles Bruce Norton, the former having withdrawn from the University, and that all fees chargeable against Mr. Sullivan be mitted, he having been drafted for the army.

Upon recommendation of the President, the Bursar was appointed to account to the War Department for Army property loaned the University for use by the Reserve Officers' Training Corps.

On motion, the following appropriations were made:

On motion, the following was unanimously adopted:

Whereas the notice of the purpose to elect a Professor of English Literature has been duly published according to the requirements of the Virginia statutes, be it

**RESOLVED**, That, upon the recommendation of President Alderman, John Calvin Metcalf, M. A., Professor of English Literature in Richmond College, be elected to fill the Poe Memorial Chair of English Literature, made vacant by the resignation of Dr. Chas. Alphonso Smith, at a salary of $3,300. per annum, his duties to begin with the opening of the session of 1917-18.

On motion, the following was unanimously adopted:

**RESOLVED**, That, upon the recommendation of President Alderman, Mr. Raymond Freas, Ph. D., (Johns Hopkins) be elected Adjunct Professor of Chemistry at a salary of $1,400. per annum, his duties to begin with the session of 1917-18.

Upon the recommendation of the professors of the several schools, and with the approval of the President, the following Assistants, Student Assistants and Scholarship holders were appointed:

In the matter of refund of fees paid by students who may be drafted for the army, the following was adopted:

**RESOLVED:** That the release of fees by students who may be drafted be left to the President, with the expression of the Board that as a policy such release be made.

A committee from the Miller Board which was meeting at this hour at the University, was received, and stated that it was desired by the Miller Board that some expression from the committee appointed by the Board of Visitors be had in the matter of the use of a house for the Miller Professor; whereupon, the Rector, Chairman of the Special Committee, was requested to draft a letter to the Miller Board, setting forth the decision of the Committee. The following letter was immediately sent:

I beg to report to your Board through you, that in June last the two committees of the Miller Board and the Board of Visitors of the University met at the Board of Visitors' House, and agreed that the status of the buildings on the grounds known as the "Mallet House", continue unchanged.

The following recommendations of the Academic Faculty, with the approval of the President, were adopted:

1. **Resolved**—;\
   That 3 hours in French and 3 hours in German be required for the Vocational B. S. degree (described in the current catalogue, page 157, as the "Bachelor of Science in a Special Subject".)

2. **Resolved**—;\
   That Mr. Joseph W. Coxe be allowed to substitute an advanced course in Chemistry for Spanish in his application for the B. S. in Chemistry.

3. **Resolved**—;\
   That any student registered in the College prior to the present session may receive credit for Physical Training on the same basis as for Military Training; but that no such student shall receive credit for both.

The following letter and report of the Superintendent of Grounds and Buildings was read and ordered spread on the minutes:

**Concerning the increased cost of labor and mechanics**

1. The drivers have been raised from $1.00 to $1.25 per day.
2. Fireman from $30.00 per month to $37.50.
3. Laborers from $1.25 per day to $1.37 1/2.
4. The carpenter, brick and plaster worker has quit because we could not compete.
5. The steam-fitter has been raised from $40.00 per month to $52.00.
6. All material-lime, cement, hardware, paint, horse feed, sand, stone, etc., has advanced an average of 25 percent during the last three months.

I respectfully urge you to provide a truck for hauling at the University. I have estimated from $2,279. up to $3750. for a 2-ton dumping truck. I recommend the one at $3750. which is a Packard or Pierce Arrow, but I will be glad to have the cheapest.

The report was approved and the recommendation relative to the purchase of a truck was referred to the President with power to act.

President Alderman read a letter from Mr. Lewis Cass Ledyard, one of the executors of the estate of Colonel Oliver Payne, claiming that the legacy of $200,000.00, to the University of Virginia, in the will of Colonel Payne, had been anticipated and settled by the payment to Dr. Alderman, of $250,000.00 as set out in the said letter, which letter reads as follows:

The Executors under the will of Colonel Payne are informed by Mr. Fuller that in or about the month of July, 1917, at the Colonel's country place at West Park, Colonel Payne told Mr. Fuller that in his will he had made a legacy of $250,000. to the University of Virginia, but that he had decided to give that sum presently, instead of waiting until death. Mr. Fuller further states that the next day Colonel Payne gave to you his check for $250,000. for the benefit of the University and said to you substantially what he had said to Mr. Fuller about the provision in his will and about his subsequent decision to make the gift presently.

Colonel Payne was mistaken in his statement to Mr. Fuller as to the amount of the legacy which he had given to the University under his existing will, which was $200,000. and not $250,000. This was the will which was made by him in 1915 and which remained unchanged until his death.

I have no doubt that you will corroborate the statements made as above by Mr. Fuller.

Upon these statements I think it fair to say to you that the Executors are advised that by this transaction the legacy to the University was satisfied, and on their behalf I am writing to ask whether the University is not also of the same opinion, and if so whether it would be willing to file a renunciation of the legacy.

The reason we are asking this question now is that if this payment by Colonel Payne to you and the accompanying statements operated as a satisfaction, it is necessary for us to have that fact established in the various transfer tax proceedings which we will have to institute in connection with his estate.
