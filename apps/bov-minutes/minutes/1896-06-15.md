The Faculty's report was read to the Board, after which the Executive Committee submitted its report which was read and on motion the same was received and ordered to be spread upon the minutes, said report is in the following words and figures, to-wit:

### The Executive Committee of the Visitors respectfully recommend as follows:-

1. That the following fellowships be established in the University, the holders thereof to have the title of "Fellow" in the several departments named, and to be paid the salaries stated, viz=

That it shall be the duty of said fellows to act as instructors in their several departments, under the supervision of the several professors in said departments, and their names shall be published as such in the University Catalogue.

Said fellows shall be exempt from matriculation and tuition fees, and shall be elected by Committees of three members of the Faculty, each, selected by the whole Faculty from the schools or departments cognate to the subject of the particular fellowship, upon competitive examination. Any student of the University may compete in said examination; and the term of each Fellowship shall be two years; and no fellow at the expiration of his term shall be eligible to re-election in his department.

Provided, however, that for the session of 1896-97, the instructors already chosen in the above schools shall be continued at the salaries fixed above; and said competitive examination for Fellowships to begin with the session of 189798, shall be held at such time or times during the session of 1896-97 (7) as the Faculty may determine; and provided further, that the instructors of 1896-97 shall be eligible to compete for said fellowships.

2. That the position of Assistant Demonstrator of Anatomy be abolished for the present.

3. That the salary of Prof. Geo. Frederick Holmes be, with his consent, reduced from $2000. to $1000. per annum.

4. That Prof. J. H. Gilmore be elected Chairman of the Faculty, and that he be relieved of instruction in the Law Department except in the School of International Law; and that his salary as chairman and professor be $3000. and a house, or commutation.

5. That the branches of Mercantile Law and Constitutional Law, Evidence and Equity be taught by the other Law Professors and the Adjunct Professor, as they may determine; and that it is the sense of the Board that the Professor to whom the branch of Constitutional Law shall fall shall extend said branch to include the law of Constitutional Limitations.

6. That one of the instructors in Astronomy shall be retired, and the salary of $540. heretofore paid to said instructor be applied, so far as may be necessary, to insurance upon the Astronomical building and apparatus.

7. That the School of English be abolished as a separate school; and that instruction in English be provided for as hereinafter set out.

8. That the schools of the Romance Languages and of the Teutonic Languages as now constituted be re-organized as "The School of Modern Languages" with two professors of Modern Languages; and that said school be sub-divided into the branches of French, Italian, Spanish, German and English; and that said several branches be taught by said two professors as they may determine.

9. That professors, James A. Harrison and W. H. Perkinson be elected Professors of Modern Languages, the former at a salary of $3000. and a house, and the latter at a salary of $2600.

10. That there shall be but one janitor for the Medical Hall and Chemical Laboratory.

11. That the appropriation for grounds and buildings be fixed at $5000. which shall include the wages of the hands employed and also the wages of head janitor or plumber and the wages of a day policeman, who shall also be boss of the hands employed, such wages to be fixed by the Superintendent of Grounds & Buildings.

12. That the Gymnasium appropriation for the session of 1896-97 be $450.

In the event that the attendance of students should fall below 500, which is the probable number on which the estimate of Expenditures is based in the report of the Faculty, then the salaries of the Professors and adjunct professors shall be subject to a pro-rata abatement to make up such deficiency.

Resolved, that the recommendation numbered I in the Executive Committee's report with regard to the establishment of five fellowships be referred to the Faculty for report and recommendation as to details as the Faculty may deem proper; said report to be made to the next meeting of the Board; and that the Instructors in Latin, Greek, Physics, Pathology and Biology be continued at the salaries named in said Committee's Report, the reduction in the salary of Instructor in Biology, to be subject to the approval of the Miller Board. adopted.

Resolved, that the salaried position of Assistant Demonstrator of Anatomy be dispensed with for the present, in accordance with the recommendation of section 2 of the report of the Executive Committee. adopted.

Resolved, that the salary of Prof. Geo. Frederick Holmes be reduced from $2000. to $1000. in accordance with the recommendation of the Executive Committee's Report; it being represented to the Board that Profr Holmes consents to said reduction. adopted.

Resolved, that in place of the three instructors now employed by the Astronomical Department there be elected by a competitive examination to be held by the Profr of Astronomy and two other professors in cognate departments, to be chosen by the Faculty, three Fellows in Astronomy, who shall not only do post-graduate work in said department, but as may be necessary, act as instructors in said department, their salaries to be $400. per annum; but said Fellows shall for the session of 1896-97 be appointed by the professor of Astronomy. adopted.

Resolved, that the Astronomical buildings and apparatus be insured out of the Astronomical fund. adopted.

Resolved, that the Schools of English, of the Romance Languages and of the Teutonic Languages as now constituted be reorganized as "The School of Modern Languages" with two professors of Modern Languages and that said school be sub-divided into the branches of English, German, French Italian and Spanish; and that said several branches shall be taught by said two professors as may be determined hereafter by the Board at its present session. This resolution is adopted by the Board in view of the deficit in the revenues of the University and in what the Board regards as the direction of an absolutely necessary retrenchment, the teaching of English Literature being provided for in the Kent Memorial School of English Literature.

Resolved, further, that professors James A. Harrison and Wm H. Perkinson be elected professors of Modern Languages, the former at a salary of $3000. and a house, or commutation thereof, and the latter at a salary of $2600. These resolutions shall go into effect at the beginning of the session of 189697.

These resolutions were adopted by a recorded vote upon a call of the roll as follows:

Resolved, that hereafter there shall be but one janitor for the Medical Hall and Chemical Laboratory as recommended in the report of the Executive Committee. adopted.

Resolved, that the appropriation for Grounds & Buildings be fixed at $5000., which shall include the wages of the hands employed and also the wages of head Janitor or plumber, and the wages of a day policeman who shall also be boss of the hands employed, such wages to be fixed by the Superintendent of Grounds and Buildings. adopted.

Resolved, that the Gymnasium appropriation for the session of 1896-97 be $450. in accordance with the recommendation in the Report of the Executive Committee. adopted.

Resolved; That in the event that the attendance of students during the session of 1896-97 should fall below five hundred, which is the probable number on which the estimate of expenditures is based in the Report of the Faculty for the session just ending, then the salaries of the professors shall be subject to a pro-rata abatement, to make up such deficiency, as recommended by the Executive Committee's report. adopted.

Resolved, that in the School of Modern Languages the subjects of English, French and Spanish be assigned to Profr Harrison and the subjects of German and Italian be assigned to Profr Perkinson. adopted.

Whereas, the Faculty of the University have put on record in their report to the Visitors their appreciation of the conduct of the students of the University at and subsequent to the late fire; in the following language: "We desire to draw especially to the attention of the Visitors the admirable conduct of the student body at, and subsequent to, the fire that destroyed the University buildings. What seemed a great disaster eventually showed itself as in one sense a great blessing; kindling in the hearts of the students a most intense patriotic devotion to Alma Mater, cementing the relations between faculty and students by bonds of deep sympathy and kindly feeling, and developing in the students themselves such powers of self restraint and appreciation of the crisis through which the institution was passing, that it seems worthy of a permanent record in this place." and whereas the Visitors cordially approve the expression of the Faculty on this subject-,

Resolved, that the Visitors desire to reiterate and to place upon their records their appreciation of the exemplary conduct of the students under trying circumstances of discomfort and inconvenience since the destruction of the Rotunda and Annex, and that they beg to assure the students of their purpose to provide by the beginning of the next session ample and comfortable lecture rooms which will obviate the discomfort and inconvenience that have been so patiently borne. adopted.

Resolved, that the foregoing resolution be read to the students on the Final Day. adopted.

Resolved, that the language of the Catalogue under the head of "Academical Degrees" p. 35 be altered under "group B. Modern Languages" to read as follows: "French, Spanish, Italian, German or English", and that the words, "Modern English" be eliminated from "Group C. History and Literature". adopted.

Resolved, that the prospectus prepared by Mr John B. Moon, and this day read to the Board, for the sale of the $200,000. five per cent bonds of the University of Virginia be and the same is hereby approved, and that the same shall be signed by the Rector of the Board and attested by the committee on finance. adopted.

Resolved, that whereas by a resolution heretofore this day adopted by this Board the Rector was requested to call for the payment of such amount from the State Treasury as would make the monthly allowance to the University the sum of $4166.66 for the months which have elapsed since October 1st 1895 instead of $3333.33 per month which has been actually paid, the said first named sum being the amount to which it would appear the University was entitled per month under the general appropriation bill passed by the General Assembly of Virginia March 3d 1896, and whereas a doubt has been suggested as to when the increased appropriation by the Legislature to the University would be held to begin; and by the terms of the Act of the said General Assembly approved January 23d 1896 and entitled "An act to enable the Rector & Visitors of the University of Virginia to repair the loss sustained by that institution by the fire of October 27th 1895" it was provided that the $10,000. per annum therein appropropriated to the Rector & Visitors of the University should be paid "in equal semi-annual instalments at such times as they may fix"; now therefore in the event it should be held that the whole of said sum of $50,000. per annum is not payable to the University in monthly instalments beginning on the 1st day of October 1895 as aforesaid, but that said Rector & Visitors are entitled to the additional $10,000. per annum specified in said Act of Jan'y 23d 1896 to be paid as therein specified, then and in such case the said Rector & Visitors do hereby fix the times for the payment of said $10,000 per annum as follows: The first $5,000. or semi-annual instalment thereof shall be paid on the 1st day of August next (August 1896) and each succeeding semi-annual instalment of $51,000. shall be paid at the end of each six months thereafter, so that said instalments shall be paid on the 1st day of February and the 1st day of August during each year thereafter.

A letter was received from Profr James M. Garnett in the following words and figures, to wit-:

Having learned that the chair which I have the honor to hold in the University has been merged into the School of Modern Languages by your Hon. body, I would respectfully inquire whether this action results from any dissatisfaction with the conduct of the chair, what are the grounds of such dissatisfaction, if any, & on what evidence it is based.

As this is a matter that seriously concerns my professional reputation, I would request the fullest & most complete investigation, & the opportunity to rebut any charges that may have been made.

On consideration whereof, the letter having been read to the Board, the following resolution was adopted by a unanimous vote:

Resolved; The Board of Visitors desire to inform Prof. Garnett, in reply to the letter this day received, that their action in reorganizing the school of English of which he has been the Professor in charge, was not actuated by any lack of confidence in his high character as a man or in his ability & attainments as a scholar.

The following resolutions in relation to Prof Gilmore were submitted and upon a vote thereon were defeated by a majority of the Visitors voting in the negative:

Resolved, that Profr J. H. Gilmore be elected Chairman of the Faculty for one year from Sept 15th 1896, and that he be relieved of instruction in the Law Department except in the branches of International & Constitutional Law, and that his salary as Chairman & Professor be $3000. and a house or commutation therefor.

Resolved, further, that the branches of Criminal Law, Evidence and Equity to which shall be added Constitutional Limitations be taught by the two other Law Professors and the Adjunct Professor of Law as said two full professors may determine.

Resolved, that a Committee of three shall be appointed by the Rector who shall consider and report to this Board at a meeting to be called by the Rector at the request of said Committee as to the expediency of electing a chairman of the Faculty, who shall not only preside over the Faculty meetings, but shall be the Executive Officer in charge of, and at the head of University affairs; that if said Committee shall recommend the appointment of said Executive officer, they shall specifically define his duties in said report; and shall recommend what salary shall be paid such officer, and suggest the names of one or more persons whom they shall deem eligible for such position.

The Rector appointed as said Committee Messrs Gordon, Bryan & McIlwaine.

Resolved, that Dr P. B. Barringer be elected Chariman of the Faculty for the term from Sep. 1st 1896 to July 1st 1897 with the compensation of $500. for the term.

Resolved, that Mr. Robert Robertson be elected Superintendent of Grounds & Buildings for one year from this date at a salary of $1200. for the year.

Resolved, that it is the sense of the Visitors, in view of their desire to encourage post-graduate work, that whenever any qualified student of the University shall apply to any professor for instruction and examination for the Ph: D. degree, it shall be the duty of such Professor to furnish such student proper instruction, and at proper time or times examine him for such degree in his department.

Resolved, that the resignation of Prof. Ormond Stone from the chair of Astronomy which was placed in the hands of the Rector be laid upon the table.

Resolved, that the resignation of Prof. Stone as Editor in Chief of the Annals of Mathematics, be accepted; and that Prof. W. H. Echols be elected Editor-in-Chief of said Annals of Mathematics, with authority to select his associate Editor or Editors.

The Board of Visitors have learned with regret of the decline of interest among the students in the two Literary & Debating Societies of the University, the Jefferson and Washington Societies.

The value of the training for certain important duties of Citizenship, to be had in well conducted debating societies is so great that its loss to the students of this University would be seriously felt by its alumni in all parliamentary & forensic situations in which they may be placed after leaving their Alma Mater.

The Board is impressed with the importance amounting almost to a necessity of restoring the proper functions & influence of these Parliamentary gymnasia to the students of this University, but it believes that this can best & indeed can only permanently be done by the students themselves when they duly appreciate the value of the training to be had in these debating societies & pursue a line of conduct which will secure & retain the interest of its members the societies will revive and flourish.

The character of the Societies & their success will respond instantly to the adoption of the test of merit as their exclusive claim to the honors of the Societies this test to be determined upon principles of honor by the members of the societies themselves.

If any other influences are permitted to affect the choice of the honor bearers of the societies, then decay will be sure and speedy.

With the hope and expectation that such a course of conduct will prevail in the Societies the Board of Visitors hereby establish in each of the Literary Societies, The Jefferson and the Washington, a Medal to be known as the Rector and Visitors' debating Medal, to cost not exceeding $50., to be awarded by the members of each Society respectively to the best debater in that Society during each session, and to be delivered at the end of the session.

Resolved, that the action of the Board of Visitors in respect to the establishment of debaters medals in the Literary Societies be communicated to the Faculty with the request that they take steps to bring it to the knowledge of the students & to give such aid as they may deem proper in carrying out the views of the Board.

Resolved, that the bill of McKim, Meade & White referred to this Board be and the same is hereby referred to the Building Committee with authority to act.

Resolved, that Walter D. Dabney be and he is hereby elected a full professor of law in the University of Virginia, and that A. H. Buckmaster is elected professor of Gynecology, Obstetricks and Practice of Medicine for the period of one year, and that Raleigh C. Minor is elected Adjunct professor of Law.

Resolved, that a Committee of three be appointed to consider and report to some future meeting of this Board the propriety of establishing a University printing press and office, where the publications of the Faculty & the Board may be printed, Said Committee shall ascertain and report the cost of equipping and running such an office and what saving, if any can be made thereby.

Committee under above resolution.

Messrs Bryan, Gordon & Randolph.

Whereas in the opinion of the Board it is necessary to have a re-organization of the Law Department, and in the interest of economy, the abatement of one professorship,

Resolved, that the course of instruction be increased by the addition of the subject of Constitutional Limitations, and that the arrangement of all the studies be left to the decision of professors W. M. Lile and W. D. Dabney upon conference with adjunct professor, R. C. Minor, the same to be apportioned between themselves as they may deem best.

That Professor James H. Gilmore be removed as professor of Law to take effect Sept 14th 1896.

In adopting this course the Board wishes to take the occasion to express the greatest respect for Professor Gilmore as a man, and for his ability as a lawyer.
