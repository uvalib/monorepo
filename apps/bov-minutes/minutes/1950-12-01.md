ELECTIONHOSPITAL ADMINISTRATIONNCAA MATTER
------------------------------------------

On call of the Rector, a special meeting of the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia was held at 2:00 p.m. on this date in the offices of Hunton, Williams, Anderson, Gay & Moore, Electric Building, Richmond, Virginia, with the following present: The Rector, Barron F. Black; President Colgate W. Darden, Jr., of the University of Virginia; Visitors Emmett, Garnett, Gay, Gravatt, Howard, Mears, Talbott, and Willis. Absent: Visitors Anderson, Barksdale, Carrington, Smith, and Wailes.

On recommendation of the President, the following election was approved:

Dr. Edward P. Cawley elected Professor of Dermatology and chairman of the school, effective February 1, 1951, at a basic salary of $5,000 per year.

Dr. Emmett, as Chairman of the Medical Committee of the Board, submitted a report in its behalf in connection with the services of Dr. Lentz as Administrator of the Hospital, and developed at some length the activities of his committee in considering Mr. Lentz' qualifications and the reasons for its recommendation that Dr. Lentz be not continued in his present position. After a very full discussion of the matter, in which Mr. Darden, President, participated, the following preambles and resolutions were, upon motion duly made and seconded, unanimously adopted.

WHEREAS, at a meeting of this Board, held on the 13th day of October, 1950, the matter of the retention of Dr. Lentz as the Administrator of University Hospital was referred to the Medical Committee of the Board for consideration and investigation; and

WHEREAS, the Medical Committee has this day reported to the Board that it has held meetings with respect to this matter with the Executive Committee of the Hospital and has had an expression of their individual views with respect to Dr. Lentz' fitness and competency and has also conferred with Dr. Lentz, and has now reported to the Board that, in its judgment, Dr. Lentz is no longer capable or qualified satisfactorily to discharge the duties of the office of Administrator of the Hospital and has recommended to the Board that his services as such be terminated at such time and in such manner as the Board may think proper and appropriate;

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that upon the basis of the report and recommendation of its Medical Committee to the effect that after full investigation they have concluded that Dr. Lentz is no longer capable or qualified satisfactorily to discharge the duties of the office of Administrator of the Hospital, the President be, and he hereby is requested to ask for and if possible obtain Dr. Lentz' resignation from the position which he now holds, and that in the event of his unwillingness to resign, his employment by the University of Virginia be, and the same hereby is, terminated effective January 1, 1951, and that the President be and he hereby is requested and directed as of that date to relieve Dr. Lentz from the discharge of any duties heretofore performed by him.

RESOLVED FURTHER, that Dr. Lentz' compensation be continued at the same monthly rate now being paid him to July 1, 1951.

Mr. Gay, in the absence of Mr. Carrington, reported for the Special Committee on the Study of NCAA Regulations. He stated that no meeting of the Committee had been held since the last meeting of the Board of Visitors. One had been scheduled for twelve o'clock this date, but the other members of the Committee were unable to attend. Captain Pritchett, however, had come, and he and Mr. Gay had discussed what action should be taken prior to the annual meeting of the NCAA in January. The present agenda of the NCAA meeting schedules action on expulsion of institutions in non-compliance with regulations prior to discussion of the amendment of its eligibility rules. Mr. Gay stated that he thought it would be advisable for the University to prepare a letter to be sent to all members of the NCAA advising them that the University of Virginia was going to ask for a change in the order of business at the NCAA meeting so that the question of amending the rules could be discussed prior to a vote on the expulsion of members in non-compliance with rules and regulations

After discussion of this proposal, it was the sense of the Board that a strong case could be presented by the University if Captain Pritchett would deliver a statement at the meeting requesting deferment of action on expulsion until proposals to amend the rules had been discussed. The Board requested Mr. Gay to work with Captain Pritchett in the preparation of an appropriate statement for presentation at the NCAA meeting.

On motion the meeting was then adjourned.
