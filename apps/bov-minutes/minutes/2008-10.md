ACC Certification

The Rector read the annual “Governing Board Certification Form Academic Year 2008-09,” as he is required to do by the Atlantic Coast Conference:

“As Chairman of the Governing Board at the University of Virginia, I attest that:

1.  Responsibility for the administration of the athletics program has been delegated to the Chief Executive Officer of the Institution.
2.  The Chief Executive Officer has the mandate and support of the Board to operate a program of integrity in full compliance with NCAA, ACC and all other relevant rules and regulations.
3.  The Chief Executive Officer, in consultation with the Faculty Athletics Representative and the Director of Athletics, determines how the institutional vote shall be cast on issues of athletic policy presented to the NCAA and the ACC.”  
    

The Certification is signed by the President in addition to the Rector.

The Rector then asked the President to give his customary report.

Report by the President

The President spoke principally to the State budget situation: the Governor’s Office, he said, is now projecting a budget shortfall of as much as $2.9billion. The University and other state agencies have been asked to submit plans to cut spending by 5%, by 10% and by 15%.

For the University, this would mean cutting by $7.6million at 5%, and up to $22.8million at 15%. To cover this latter cut in our state budget would mean reducing all existing budgets by 6.2%.

A budget reduction plan was submitted to Richmond on September 26th; the University will receive precise reduction requirements later in the fall.

This reduction, the President pointed out, will be in addition to the $9.7million reduction put in place in 2007-08.

The Capital Campaign continues in spite of the economy. A Virginia 2020 weekend retreat was held at Manchester Village, Vermont recently; another is planned in Phoenix in November. Two 2020 retreats will be held in the spring, including one for parents of current students.

Gifts and Grants Report

Philanthropic giving to the University and its related foundations for the current fiscal year – which began July 1st – through August 31st, came to $22,806,660.29, a decrease of $13,217,849.17 (or 36.7%) over the same period last year.

The President noted, however, that although giving levels are down from last year, they are comparable to the 2005-2006 fiscal year levels for the same period.

The Nursing School, the Jefferson Scholars Foundation, the Claude Moore Health Sciences Library, the Center for Politics, the Women’s Center, and the Law School have shown significant increases in giving over the previous year.

Listing some significant gifts since the previous Board meeting, the President noted an additional bequest of $1,500,000 from the estate of Gertrude S. Greenslade for the use of the College; a gift of $1,000,000 from Mr. and Mrs. C. Dice Hammer for the Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery in the Medical School; a gift of $1,000,000 from Mr. and Mrs. Raymond J. Harbert for the Joel B. Piassick Research Professorship in Law; and a $750,000 grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation for “An Electronic Imprint at UVa Press.”

Some important pledges received are $1million from Frederick P. Hitz and Mary Buford Bocock Hitz, and $300,000 from Frederic S. Bocock for the Bocock and Hitz Public Service Scholarship Fund in the Batten School. Also, $375,000 from Edward J. Dobbs to the Jefferson Scholars, and $250,000 from David R. Verklin for Media Studies in the College.

Resolution Approving the Gifts and Grants Report

RESOLVED, the President’s Gifts and Grants Report is

approved.

\- - - - - - - - - -

The Board resumed its meeting in Open Session after adopting the following resolution certifying that its deliberations in Executive Session had been conducted in accordance with the exemptions permitted by the Virginia Freedom of Information Act:

That we vote on and record our certification that, to the best of each Board member’s knowledge, only public business matters lawfully exempted from open meeting requirements and which were identified in the motion(s) authorizing the closed session, were heard, discussed or considered in closed session.

Report of the Commission on the Future of the University

The Report was divided into elements of proposed concentration: “Jefferson Public Citizens;” “Academic Leadership;” “Center for Advanced Study of Teaching and Learning;” “Center for Computation-Intense Research and Scholarship;” “International Programs;” and “Science, Technology and Research.”

The Report was received with interest and enthusiasm and was followed by a discussion.

The general discussion in turn was followed by a discussion of the funding of the initiatives proposed in the Commission’s Report. The Board then adopted the following resolution:

APPROVAL OF ALLOCATION OF FUNDS TO SUPPORT PHASE ONE INITIATIVES OF THE PRESIDENT’S COMMISSION ON THE FUTURE OF THE UNIVERSITY

**WHEREAS, the President’s Commission on the Future of the University has engaged faculty, students, staff, and alumni in naming strategic priorities and core values; and**

**WHEREAS, the President’s Commission on the Future of the University presented the Board of Visitors with the first phase of plans for the future of the University; and**

**WHEREAS, the Vice President for Research and the Vice Provost for International Programs are developing plans for the second phase of recommendations from the President’s Commission on the Future of University;**

**RESOLVED, the Board of Visitors accepts the initial plans of the President’s Commission on the Future of the University and will allocate funds requested to support these initiatives once a plan has been reviewed and approved by the Rector and Vice Rector; and**

**RESOLVED FURTHER, the Board of Visitors requests the chairs of the President’s Commission on the Future of the University draft a budget, implementation plans and timelines, and measures of success for research buildings, graduate student support, and growth of the faculty for presentation and consideration by the Board of Visitors at its Fall 2009 meeting; and**

**RESOLVED FURTHER, the Executive Vice President and Provost and the Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer shall provide reports to the Board of Visitors on an annual basis describing progress on the implementation of the recommendations of the President’s Commission on the Future of the University.**

ATTACHMENT A

2008-2010 BIENNIAL BUDGET REQUESTS

ATTACHMENT A

AGENCY 207 – Academic Division:

_Produced in Virginia ($1.7 million (need to develop updated proposal) GF in year two)_ – The University has partnered with the Virginia Community College System to increase the number of undergraduate engineering degrees awarded in the Commonwealth. Students complete the first two years of coursework at a community college, then enroll in the University of Virginia and complete an engineering bachelor’s degree program through both on-site and asynchronous technology. At full implementation in six years, the University projects to award an additional 400 degrees annually. These students, all of whom are expected to be Virginians, will be incremental to the number of students previously approved by the Board of Visitors in the University’s official enrollment projections. The request represents start-up costs (recruiting, course design, equipment) of $1.3 million, plus the ongoing general fund’s share of base budget adequacy funding per undergraduate engineering student for the incremental in-state students (32 FTE) who will join the University in the summer of 2009.

_Operations and Maintenance Costs for New Facilities ($1.5 million GF in year one and $3.7 million GF in year two)_ – The University requests ongoing support for operations and maintenance costs of new facilities scheduled to open in the 2008-2010 biennium.

_E&G Utility Cost Increases ($1.6 million GF in both years)_ – The cost of electricity, natural gas, coal, and oil has increased far in excess of inflation over the past three years, particularly with the lifting of the rate cap on electricity. As a result, the University has been compelled to direct a sizable share of discretionary base budget adequacy funding to pay the cost of utilities rather than invest in core educational programs and support enrollment growth. This request will allow the University to appropriately fund utility costs and appropriately invest in educational programs on an ongoing basis.

_UVa Health Plan Cost Increases ($1.1 million GF in year two)_ – We request ongoing support to maintain the state’s funding of the University-sponsored health care plan at a comparable level to the state funding provided for other state-sponsored health plans.

_Graduate Financial Support ($2.0 million GF in year two)_ – This additional ongoing support will enhance our ability to compete for the most promising graduate students by improving the competitive position of our most prestigious graduate fellowships, creating first-year fellowships, increasing the number of dissertation year fellowships to reward innovative research, and providing competitive enhancements to recipients of prominent national fellowships, such as those from the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health.

_Graduate Financial Aid Restriction for In-State Students (Language Only)_ – We request removal of the existing requirement that 50 percent of general funds allocated to graduate student financial assistance be made to Virginia residents. High quality graduate students play a vital role in recruiting world class faculty, attracting external grant support, and improving the stature of the University’s research enterprise. One no-cost measure of support for graduate students would be the elimination of this requirement. Increasingly our highest quality applicants are from out-of-state and require a higher level of commitment from the University. Many graduate students remain in the Commonwealth after graduation, even becoming the faculty of our public and private colleges and universities. Out-of-state graduate students frequently bring spouses and families to the region to have a settled life here. Allowing the University to award state support to the highest quality graduate students, regardless of their residency, will provide the University additional flexibility in building a world-renown research enterprise.

_New Cabell Hall Renovation ($76.12 million in year two)_ – $3.9 million in planning funds was provided in 2008-2009. Construction funds are needed in 2009-2010 in order to be prepared to proceed with this project upon the completion of the South Lawn project. The project will include abatement of asbestos and other hazardous materials, needed repairs, code and accessibility compliance modifications, updates to building systems to provide modern functionality, and upgrades to finishes and furniture. The major building system updates will include adding sprinklers, adding HVAC and removing the old heating system, modernizing the elevators, and renovating electrical, alarm, and telephone/data distribution systems.

_Ruffner Hall Renovation ($19.8 million in year two)_ – $250,000 was provided in 2008-2009 for pre-planning. Construction funds are needed in 2009-2010 in order to be prepared to proceed upon the completion of Bavaro Hall. This project repairs and/or replaces major infrastructure systems in Ruffner Hall, constructed in 1973. The project includes a structural evaluation and replaces building systems including HVAC, flooring, electrical, fire alarm system, sprinklers, masonry, roofing, skylights, doors, windows, hardware, interiors, signage, furnishings, site work, and plumbing. It also removes asbestos and lead based paint.

_Ivy Stacks Shelving Retrofit ($7.5 million in year two)_ – The University’s Ivy Stacks remote shelving facility provides cost-effective storage space for the University’s library collections, but is nearing capacity. Replacing the current shelving system (high-rise, human retrieval) with a state-of-the art robotic retrieval system will increase the capacity of the current facility from 800,000 volumes to 1.5 million volumes and defer the need for a second facility for ten years. These funds will cover the procurement and installation of the system, as well as retrofitting the facility to accommodate the new system.

AGENCY 209 – Medical Center:

_Increase Medicaid Prospective Inpatient Payment Rates_ _($1.3 million GF and $1.3 million NGF in year two)_ – The 2008-2010 Appropriation Act reduced the level of reimbursement to the Commonwealth’s academic medical centers, also leaving federal cost matching dollars on the table.

AGENCY 246 – University’s College at Wise:

_Expanded Student Access through the AIMS Scholars Program ($682,400 GF and 5 FTE in the second year)_ – The College at Wise continues to have a student body which demonstrates the highest financial need in the Commonwealth. The College at Wise has been successfully piloting its AIMS Scholars Program in a targeted area which has seen these students transition from the community college to the College at Wise. This amendment will expand this scholarship program by 50 students (at $6,477 each = $324,000). It will also add two staff to advise students on financial aid (two at $35,000 + fringes = $91,000) and three faculty (three at $54,500 + fringes = $213,000). The faculty will focus on successfully integrating the scholars and others into Wise, increasing the likelihood of retention and on-time graduation. The request also includes $55,000 in OTPS to support the aid and transition/retention programs.

_Development of Internal Telecommunications Operations ($609,600 GF and 2 FTE in the second year)_ - The continuing growth of the College at Wise is making evident the need for an internal telecommunications operation to handle telephone, wiring, voicemail, programming, and support services. An aging campus telephone system and cable plant is causing many on and off-campus communication problems and a replacement of analog telephone technology with voice over internet protocol (VoIP) telephone technology is imperative for the near future. This amendment for ongoing funding will enable the College at Wise to replace its current system with newer technology, continue and enhance telephone service for internal and external constituents throughout the state, and give the College at Wise better reporting and call tracking services to control telephone costs across the institution. The ongoing cost will be $169,900 and two FTEs. The one-time cost for the system replacement is $440,000.

_New Library ($3.5 million GF planning in year two)_ – During the College at Wise’s last SACS accreditation, student study space in the existing library barely met the minimum standard, and with the growth experienced since that time, it will not be in compliance during the next accreditation process. This planning funding will allow us to determine how to construct a new facility to meet the current and future academic needs of the institution, to include space to house and increase the College at Wise’s collection – which is critical as new and larger academic programs have been introduced in the interim – as well as provide important study and instructional spaces for the student body. To meet accreditation needs, planning must begin immediately, with construction expected to begin in 2010-2011.

**PLAN FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A**

**FOCUSED ULTRASOUND PROGRAM**

AT THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA

ATTACHMENT B

**PLAN FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A FOCUSED ULTRASOUND PROGRAM**

**AT THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA**

**The Focused Ultrasound program will be facilitated by the investments provided by the Commonwealth and the Focused Ultrasound Foundation (FUSF). The funds will provide the necessary infrastructure to allow clinical and translational research as well as leverage the provision of clinical procedures as they are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.**

**_Initial Investment_**

**The initial investment will be roughly $8.7 million and will be provided as follows:**

**• $4.0 million allocated by the Commonwealth - $1.0 million for the modular facility and $3.0 million in Ultrasound equipment;**

**• $4.0 million from an external foundation, Focused Ultrasound Foundation (FUSF) - $2.5 million for a consigned MRI for 5 years and $1.5 million in operating cash; and**

**• $0.680 million to be shared by the School of Medicine, Medical Center, and FUSF for facility and other contingencies not provided in the sources above.**

**_Operational Plan_**

**The assumptions used in the model are all based on conservative estimates for both revenues and expenses. We have worked to limit the future risk to the University by using the external funding for the fixed expenses. To the degree that revenue assumptions are not accomplished, the expenses associated with this endeavor will not be incurred. Aside from the initial investment – all expenses are variable. Even the maintenance contract is considered to be a long-term variable expense.**

**As a result, the University and its faculty have an ideal opportunity for a research operation with a strong upside and limited risk exposure.**

Year One: We plan to initiate research and trials in the areas of fibroids, breast cancer, palliative bone, and the brain. Research funding is assumed to come from the National Institutes of Health, the ultrasound equipment manufacturers, and the FUSF.

In addition, we estimate that we will provide 25 uterine fibroidablations that will be reimbursed by commercial insurance

**payers. Revenues from these activities will be $403,225. Aside from the research support, an additional $500,000 will be provided by the FUSF for operational cash needs, resulting in a total of $903,225. Expenses in the first year $436,099 and are made up entirely of variable costs associated with the projected research and procedures.**

**Year Two: We plan to continue the studies above and add research in the areas of the liver and prostate. Procedures in all areas grow and the estimated revenues from those procedures will increase from $403,225 to $736,450. Total revenues, including the FUSF support, will grow to $1,236,450. Variable expenses also grow with the increased procedures and in Year Two the maintenance contracts on the equipment ($420,000/year) begin. Total expenses will increase from $436,099 to $1,222,977.**

**Year Three: Research and clinical volumes continue to increase and research involving kidneys is projected to begin. In order to avoid being overly optimistic, we have assumed that one of the clinical trials areas stops. Total revenues are estimated to increase from $1,236,450 to $1,329,675. Expenses grow at a commensurate rate, increasing from $1,222,977 to $1,333,732.**

**Years Four and Five: While we have projected changes in the mix of services, we have not projected growth in total procedure volumes. The major change that occurs in Year Four is that the $500,000 annual commitment from the FUSF will be complete and the program will depend upon reserve cash (from the Year One surplus) and competitive educational and research awards to replace the operating cash commitment.**

**_Alternative Financial Plan_**

**If a consigned MRI is unavailable, the capital plan would be revised as follows:**

**2**

*   **The FUSF will provide an additional $1.6 million in cash support in the first year.**
*   **GE and Insightec will include additional years of free maintenance in the purchase agreements equivalent to $0.600 million – a reduction in the expenses listed in the previous plan.**
*   **The University will purchase the specified GE MRI for $2.2 million**

**Under the new strategy, the University would not have any incremental capital or operating expense and would own the MRI rather than use it on consignment.**
