NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the following statement of patent policy and procedure be and it is hereby approved:

I. Purpose, Coverage, and Objectives.

1\. Purpose. The purpose of this statement is to establish the patent policy of the University with respect to inventions with which it may be concerned and outline uniform procedures to be followed in seeking their patenting and development. It is intended that all provisions of this statement, whether relating to policy or procedure shall be construed and administered in accordance with the research policy of the University which has been separately stated.

2\. Coverage. This statement covers all inventions made by a faculty member, official, employee or student of the University or made by any other person occupying a position which the University deems to be such as to make him a member of the academic community of the University, when the invention results from University research as herein defined.

It also covers inventions that do not result from University research when any such invention is referred to the University for handling as hereinafter provided in Section V.

For the purpose of administering this statement "University Research" means. Any research supported by funds administered by the University or for which facilities operated or controlled by the University are used.

Although an invention may result from activities which fall within the above definition of University research, nevertheless, if it results from a project undertaken by the University pursuant to a contract between the University and an outside sponsor and during the effective period of such contract, the terms and conditions of that contract, instead of the provisions of this statement, will govern the handling of the invention and the rights of the parties interested. It is contemplated that all such contracts between the University and an outside sponsor of research will be made in accordance with the University's stated research policy. When, by the terms of a contract between the University and an outside sponsor of research, the University is given the right to elect whether or not it will take over an invention, or when the outside sponsor renounces any rights under the contract in favor of the University, in either such event, the invention will be handled by the contracting authorities of the University in accordance with the circumstances and merits of the individual case.

3\. Objectives. The principal objectives of this statement are:

1. To adhere to the University's research policy in the administration of the policies and procedures set forth in this statement.
2. To provide adequate recognition and incentive to inventive talent by securing to the inventor a just share of any proceeds from the development of his invention, and at the same time to recognize and protect the equity to which the University is entitled in inventions resulting from University research.
3. To make inventions resulting from University research and other inventions handled through the University, as provided in Section V, widely available to qualified users in the public interest, under conditions calculated to promote their most effective development and utilization in the public interest, free from unnecessary exclusions or restrictions.
4. To assure as far as practicable that funds accruing to the University from its equity in inventions which result from University research or from other inventions which may be handled through the University as hereinafter provided, will be employed for the purpose of advancing and encouraging further research within the University.

II. The University Patent Committee.

The Patent Committee is a standing committee appointed by the President of the University to administer the policies and procedures established by this statement. Except as may be herein otherwise provided with respect to the referral of inventions to research corporation, the Patent Committee cannot commit the University to act, but can only recommend and report to the President of the University to whom it is responsible. Any contract or agreement to which the University is party must be entered into on behalf of the University by its duly authorized contracting officials.

The Patent Committee has no authority initially to pass upon the propriety or acceptability of any research project or any contract tendered to the University by an outside sponsor of research. The Patent Committee will, however, investigate, report, and make its recommendations on any specific questions referred to it by the President and relating to an invention or patent in which the University is interested, including questions that may arise from contracts for sponsored research.

III. Relations Between the University and Research Corporation.

Research Corporation, hereinafter referred to as "Research" is a non-profit foundation which distributes its total net income as grants-in-aid of research to colleges, universities, and scientific institutions. As stated in its charter, it was established to receive and to acquire inventions and to render the same more available and effective in the useful arts, to provide means for the advancement of scientific investigation by contributing the net earnings of the corporation to scientific and educational institutions, and to receive other monies and property and to apply the same to the objects specified.

In general, it is not the University's policy to take title to an invention or patent. The University has, however, entered into an agreement with Research whereby if the Patent Committee recommends the assignment of an invention to Research and it accepts this assignment, Research patents and commercializes the invention without expense to the inventor and agrees to pay a share of the gross income to the inventor. The net income from the invention, after the payment of the inventor's share and certain special expenses in connection with the invention, is shared between the University and Research. The University, in turn, is free to allocate its share of the net income received from Research for any purpose it deems advisable. In making such allocations, however, it is to be understood that preferential considerations will be given to requests from the school or department from which the invention arose.

IV. Relations Between the University and Faculty Members, Officials, Employees and Students and Others, Procedure.

All faculty members, officials, employees and students of the University, in consideration of their association with the University and of their privilege of using funds administered and facilities controlled by it, are urged to handle all inventions and patents during such associations, and resulting therefrom, as follows:

1. Every person covered by this statement shall promptly inform the Chairman of the Department in which he is conducting the research, of any invention made by him during the progress of such research. If the Department Chairman is of the opinion that the invention resulted from University research or is doubtful as to whether or not it resulted from University research, he shall report the invention together with all pertinent information to the Patent Committee.

2. If the Patent Committee, after consultation with the Department Chairman and the inventor, finds that the invention resulted from University research, the Committee will submit the invention to Research Corporation for its consideration pursuant to the contract between the University and Research Corporation described in Section III, unless, because of extraordinary circumstances the Committee further finds that the best interests of the University and the inventor require a different method of handling the invention. The inventor shall furnish the Patent Committee with all necessary drawings and other pertinent data, to be forwarded to Research Corporation to enable that Corporation to give full consideration to the merits of the invention.

3. If the Patent Committee finds that the invention did not result from University research, it will report the fact to the President of the University with the recommendation that the University, through its proper contracting officer, inform the inventor that the University has no interest in the invention.

4. If Research Corporation accepts an invention submitted to it by the University as herein provided, the inventor shall in accordance with the contract between the University and Research Corporation, execute all papers which may be necessary or appropriate to assign the invention to Research Corporation for handling on the terms set forth in the aforesaid contract.

5. When an invention resulting from University research is accepted by Research Corporation under its contract with the University, the inventor will receive 15 per cent of the gross income accruing to Research Corporation from the invention. The University's share will be its percentage of the remaining net income pursuant to the terms of its contract with Research Corporation.

6. If an invention resulting from University research is submitted to Research Corporation but is not accepted by that Corporation, the Patent Committee shall promptly notify the inventor and, after consultation with the inventor and his Department Chairman, shall report the matter to the President of the University with the Committee's recommendation either (a) that the invention be relinquished to the inventor to be handled by him as he may see fit, free from any claim of the University, or (b) that the University and the inventor enter into an agreement for the assignment, patenting or licensing of the invention in such manner and upon such terms as will best promote and protect the interests of the inventor and the University, including the terms upon which any proceeds of the invention will be shared by them. If the Committee's recommendation to relinquish the invention to the inventor is accepted, the President or the authorized contracting officer of the University will so inform the inventor by appropriate letter. If the recommendation of the Committee to pursue the invention further as outlined in this paragraph is accepted, the inventor shall abide by the University's decision and shall execute all papers and instruments which may be necessary or appropriate to carry that decision into effect.

7. If an invention resulting from University research is not submitted to the Patent Committee to Research Corporation for the reasons mentioned in paragraph 2 of this section IV, the subsequent procedure shall be the same as that prescribed in paragraph 6 of this section IV for inventions submitted to, but not accepted by, Research Corporation.

8. If a research unit exists independently of a department, reference herein made to the Chairman of the Department shall mean the Administrative Officer of the unit.

V. Privilege to Refer Inventions Which Do Not Result from University Research.

Any person covered by this statement may refer an invention made by him which did not result from University research to the Patent Committee with the request that it be submitted to Research Corporation pursuant to the contract between the University and that Corporation The Patent Committee shall thereupon forward a description of the invention and such other data as the inventor may provide, to Research Corporation for its consideration. If the invention is accepted by Research Corporation, the inventor shall agree to execute all papers which may be required to assign the invention to Research Corporation in accordance with its contract with the University and to effectuate its handling of the invention. In such cases the inventor shall be entitled to whatever share he may specify of the gross income received by Research Corporation from the invention, not to exceed 40 per cent thereof, and the University will inform Research Corporation accordingly. Any such amount in excess of 15 per cent will be deducted from the University's share of the net proceeds to be received by it from Research Corporation. If Research Corporation does not accept an invention submitted to it under the terms of this section V, the Patent Committee shall promptly so notify the inventor and he shall be free to handle the invention as he may see fit, free from any claims on behalf of the University.

At the June meeting the Chancellor reported on the cost of constructing the new dormitory and the methods of financing to be used. On construction projects it has been customary to obtain the Governor's permission to negotiate a temporary loan through the State Treasurer for the difference between the appropriation and the proposed cost of construction. This temporary loan will be repaid from the proceeds of the sale of bonds.

The Director of the Budget has informed the Chancellor that it will be necessary that the Board, in a formal resolution, authorize the proposed method of financing from the sale of bonds and for the temporary loan from the State Treasury. The proposed method of financing the dormitory is as follows.

It is hoped that the sale of the bonds can be deferred until the constitutionality of the Act establishing the College Building Authority has been determined, since it is believed that a lower interest rate can be obtained by sale through that agency.

The following resolution was adopted:

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that Mary Washington College be and it is hereby authorized to obtain a loan of $520,000 from the Treasurer of Virginia, subject to the approval of the Governor, for the purpose of financing the proposed dormitory, said loan to be repaid from the proceeds of the sale of dormitory revenue bonds.

The Chancellor reported that since the request was submitted to the Board for an easement across the Brompton property for the water line to the location of a new reservoir on the Brompton property, the City of Fredericksburg has decided on another location for the reservoir and wishes therefore to terminate the request.

The City will request at a later date an easement for a 24-inch water line to cross the College campus to supply the new location of the proposed reservoir which will be to the south of the "Park and Shop" shopping center. The suggested easement would enter the College campus at the service road on Sunken Road in the vicinity of the abandoned swimming pool, and follow a ravine to College Avenue to the north of the Fine Arts Building.

The Lt. General Albert J. Bowley Scholarship Fund was established by Mrs. Albert J. Bowley for the purpose of providing two scholarships to be known as the "Lt. General Albert J. Bowley Scholarship" and the "Annie Fleming Smith Scholarship." The first gift establishing this fund was 200 shares of du Pont stock. The College later received an additional 100 shares of the same stock. In addition, the fund has received shares of General Motors common stock under the anti-trust ruling that the du Pont Company shall divest itself of its holdings in General Motors. The above securities are now a part of the Consolidated Endowment Fund of the University of Virginia. Mrs. Bowley requests that this fund be established as a separate fund to be known as the Lt. General Albert J. Bowley Scholarship Fund.

The following resolution was adopted:

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the securities which have supported the Lt. General Albert J. Bowley Scholarship Fund be withdrawn from the Consolidated Endowment Fund of the University of Virginia and be established as a separate scholarship fund to be known as the "Lt. General Albert J. Bowley Scholarship Fund" to be administered by the State-Planters Bank of Commerce and Trusts of Richmond.

The Chancellor reported the receipt of a gift to Mary Washington College of $5,000 from an anonymous donor to be used "for purposes not otherwise provided for in the financial structure of the College." Expenditures from this fund are to be made in the Chancellor's discretion and both principal and interest may be spent.

The following resolution was adopted:

WHEREAS an anonymous donor has made a gift of $5,000 to Mary Washington College for the Chancellor's use in supporting programs not otherwise provided for in the College's budget,

NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that we hereby express our deep appreciation to the anonymous donor for this gift which is to be used to enrich the College's academic program and direct the Secretary to transmit a copy of this resolution to the anonymous donor as a mark of our thanks for his beneficence.

The Chancellor reported on enrollment at Mary Washington College for the 1964-1965 academic session.

The Chancellor reported that, as a part of Virginia's celebration of the Civil War Centennial, the City of Fredericksburg had appointed a subcommittee of the City's Civil War Commission known as the Richard Kirkland Memorial Committee with the responsibility for raising funds to erect a statue in honor of Richard Kirkland.

Richard Kirkland, a sergeant in the Confederate Army from South Carolina, was a hero of the Battle of Fredericksburg which took place on December 13, 1862. Sergeant Kirkland risked his life in crossing the stone wall on Sunken Road to bring water to wounded Federal soldiers and became known as the "Angel of Mayre Heights." Equal contributions of $15,000 each had been made by the states of South Carolina and Virginia to underwrite the cost of the statue. Mr. Felix D. de Weldon had been commissioned, the Chancellor continued, as the sculptor for the statue at a cost of $25,000. Mr. de Weldon is known throughout the world for his sculptures which include the Iwo Jima flag raising statue, the Pioneer Woman, and many works placed in various countries. Mr. de Weldon is a member of the U. S. Fine Arts Commission which reviews and approves monuments and buildings in the District of Columbia.

Mr. de Weldon on examining the sites available has recommended as an ideal site the recent property acquired by Mary Washington College on Sunken Road opposite Brompton. It was near this park that Sergeant Kirkland performed his heroic feats and it is also at the point where the only original part of the stone wall remains. Mr. de Weldon suggested that there would be a possible need for an access road to the monument. The Richard Kirkland Memorial Committee has sufficient funds to landscape the property in accordance with the recommendations of Mr. de Weldon.

The Richard Kirkland Memorial Committee has made a formal request for permission to erect the monument on the College's property. If this request is approved, the City of Fredericksburg will formally donate this monument to Mary Washington College to become its property with the College being responsible for maintenance.

The following resolution was adopted:

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that Mary Washington College be and it is hereby authorized to accept from the legal owner the Richard Kirkland Memorial Statue to be erected on the recently acquired property opposite Brompton on Sunken Road subject to all legal requirements to be approved by special counsel for the University and subject further to the approval of the Governor and the State Art Commission.

The Chancellor stated the City of Fredericksburg is planning to install a sanitary sewer line which will improve this facility to the residential area of College Heights and the recently annexed section of the City to the south. The city is asking that two easements be granted, one, following a small creek across a section of the College's Brompton property where the College property intersects William Street and where the small creek in question flows into Hazel Run, to the next adjacent property owned by College Heights Community Swimming Pool, the other where the proposed sanitary sewer would cross two small segments of the College property along Hazel Run.

It was pointed out that in the event the College should wish to erect any structure on the Brompton property, this sanitary sewer would prove an advantage.

A copy of the proposed agreement granting the easements in question prepared by the City, together with plats showing the route of the proposed sewer, and the easements to be granted was exhibited to the Board. The Chancellor reported that the agreement in question had been approved as to form by the University's special counsel.

After consideration, upon motion duly made and seconded it was,

RESOLVED, by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that, on the recommendation of the Chancellor of Mary Washington College, and approved by the President of the University of Virginia, the grant to the City of Fredericksburg of two easements to construct a sanitary sewer on the Brompton property of Mary Washington College, more fully described in the Agreement submitted to this meeting and on the plats attached thereto, be and the same is, hereby approved and authorized.

The President stated the Town of Wise was engaged in the installation of a water line for which it needed an easement over the lands of Clinch Valley College. It was pointed out that the water line would be beneficial to the college and that in the event the water line should interfere with the use of the surface of the ground by the college it would be relocated at the Town's expense.

The proposed agreement granting the easement in question prepared by the Town attorney, together with a plat showing the route of the proposed water line and the easement to be granted, was exhibited to the Board. The President reported that the Agreement had been approved as to form by the University's special counsel and had been approved otherwise by Chancellor Vaughan.

After consideration, upon motion duly made and seconded, it was,

RESOLVED, by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, that the grant of an easement to construct a water line on the property of Clinch Valley College, the route of which is more fully described in the Agreement submitted to this meeting and on the plat attached thereto, be and the same hereby is, approved and authorized,
