### University of Virginia, Board of Visitors

September 10, 1861

The following members of the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia met today in pursuance of adjournment on the 16th of July last- viz Col Thomas J. Randolph, Rector, and Franklin Minor, James Neeson and Wm H Terrell.

A quorum not being present the Board adjourned to meet on the 16th of September inst: and requested the Secretary to inform the absent members of the same and request their attendance.

Jax. D. Jones, Secretary pro tem.

This day came the following members of the Board of Visitors in pursuance to the adjournment on the 10th inst. viz Thomas J. Randolph, Rector, Franklin Minor, C. H. Aylett, and James Neeson.

The members present not constituting a quorum the following preamble and resolutions were effered and adopted by them, viz

Whereas a quorum of the Board of Visitors has failed to assemble either at the adjourned meeting of the 10th day of September inst: or at the meeting appointed for this day; And whereas it seems very doubtful whether a quorum can be assembled in time to make the arrangments necessary to the welfare of the University during the session which will commence on the 1st day of October 1861. And whereas several professors of the University of Virginia having been called to positions in which they are deemed serviceable to the public interests, and being engaged in a struggle in which every thing dear to man is involved. We believe that every Institution and every man should yield to every inconvenience and sacrifice required by the public service-therefore we, the members of the Board of Visitors now present, recommend & advise the following resolutions to the sanction of the Board at the first meeting at which a quorum may be obtained & that in the mean time the Executive Committee take the proper steps to carry out such recommendations.

Resolved therefore-

1.  That in consequence of the resignation of L. M. Coleman Esqr Professor of Latin, the schools of Latin & Greek be placed in charge of Professor Gildersleeve during the session beginning October 1, 1861; and that, if it be found necessary in the judgments of the Executive Committee, an assistant Instructor should be appointed in the said schools, whose salary shall be fixed by the Executive Committee.

Resolved

2.  That in consideration of his employment in the war department of the Confederate States, leave of absence for one year from the     day of       1861 should be granted to Professor A. T. Bledsoe & that his salary & all other emoluments from the University should be stopped during such absence, except that Professor Bledsoe may continue to occupy and enjoy the use of the Pavilion & grounds he has heretofore occupied.

Resolved

3.  That Robert T. Massie be appointed Professor of Mathematics during the next session and that he receive the same salary and fees, and have the same position as a regular professor, except that no pavilion be assigned to him during his residence at the University - But the Executive Committee may make provision for giving him rooms within the precincts.

Resolved

4.  That the appointment of a Professor of Military Science & Civil Engineering should be postponed & that the Exercises in that school be suspended until the further action of the Board- Unless the Executive Committee shall be of this opinion that the interests of the University require an earlier organization of that school.

Resolved

5.  That leave should be granted to Dr Cabell, Dr. Davis and Dr. Allen to act as Surgeons of the Confederate States in the hospital in Charlottesville while retaining their connection with the University- with the understanding that if their pay from the C. S. & the University added together should exceed the maximum fixed for their salaries, the surplus should accrue to the University.

Resolved

6.  That L. M. Coleman Esq. may continue to occupy the Pavilion and grounds heretofore occupied by him, until his successor be appointed.

Resolved

7.  That the distribution of dormitories by lot should be suspended for the next ensuing session.

This day came the following members of the Board of Visitors in pursuance to the adjournment on the 10th inst. viz Thomas J. Randolph, Rector, Franklin Minor, C. H. Aylett, and James Neeson.
