The Board then adjourned to meet again tomorrow morning at 9 oclock.

The Board met according to adjournment- Present the same members as on yesterday.

Resolved that the action of the Rector in the sale of the Bonds of the University to the amount of $30,000 is hereby fully sanctioned and approved- and that in addition to the guaranty by which the general resources of the Institution are pledged for the redemption of these Bonds, the Rector is hereby authorized & instructed to have a Deed of Trust (or such other Legal Instrument of writing as may be necessary) prepared, executed and recorded for the permanent setting aside and appropriation to the payment of these Bonds of the whole (or so much as may be needed) of the funds from the bequest of Thomas Johnson.

On motion of Col. S. Watts

Resolved that the thanks of the Board be presented to the Hon. B. Johnson Barbour, Rector of the University of Va., for his valuable and efficient services, in procuring upon terms entirely satisfactory to the Board, & advantageous to the Uni- versity, the loan reported by him and authorized by a resolution of the Board in July last.

Resolved That the attention of the Proctor is hereby called to the resolution adopted by the Board in June 1868 in reference to the fitting up of an apparatus Room for Prof. Smith, and the removal of the partition in the room of the Professor of Applied Mathematics- and that he is hereby requested to carry out such instruction as speedily as possible.

The Board of Visitors having considered the application of the Washington Society for aid in payment of the debt incurred by said Society in the recent improvement and extension of their Hall, have reached the following conclusion- that they will direct the Proctor to pay to the Contractor the sum of $500 at the earliest practicable moment, and out of money not otherwise appropriated- Upon the express condition that the Washington Society within the next two years shall refund to the University the said amount- and that a formal acceptance of this condition must be given through the Society and its Officers, before the provision of this loan shall become binding.

Resolved that the Rector is hereby requested to call a Meeting of the Board of Visitors on such day as he may select after conference with the Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Miller Fund.

On motion- The Board then adjourned till tomorrow morning at 9 oclock.

The Board met according to adjournment . Present the same members as on yesterday.

Resolved that the status of Professor Boeck is hereby changed from that of Adjunct to Full Professor- with the usual allowance of $300 for House rent.

Resolved- That the Board of Visitors cannot refrain from an expression of their high gratification at the success which has attended the inauguration of the New Schools of Analytical & Industrial Chemistry and Applied Mathematics. The construction, equipment and arrangement of the Laboratory give an earnest of the usefulness and important advantages which must result from the progress and full development of this School- Whilst the specimens of Drawing in Prof. Boeck's Department are really remarkable in view of the short time, imperfect appliances, & other difficulties with which the students have been forced to contend.

Resolved that the School of Prof. Mallet shall hereafter be entitled the School of Analytical & Agricultural Chemistry.

Resolved that the Professor of Analytical and Agricultural Chemistry be and he is hereby authorized to grant Certificates of Proficiency in the class of Industrial Chemistry, and that such a Certificate shall be sufficient in obtaining the Degreee of Civil Engineer. Also that the Prof. of Mathematics be and he is hereby authorized to employ an Assistant Instructor on the same terms as those prescribed in the Schools of Latin & Modern Languages.

Resolved that another Degree is hereby established to be entitled the "Baccalaureate of Letters" (corresponding to the Degree of Bachelor of Science). This Degree of L.B. shall be given to such students as shall have graduated in the Schools of Ancient & Modern Languages, Moral Philosophy, History & Literature, and it is further ordered that this Degree shall be conferred on any student who may have met the requirements during the current or preceeding Session.

Resolved, that the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia beg leave to express their deep interest in the proposed Physical Survey of the State, and will avail themselves of the earliest opportunity to take into consideration the propriety of cooperating with the Faculty of Washington College in this great work which promises such rich results to Virginia.

Resolved That in reply to the application of H. Massie Esq in reference to the use of land, the Proctor be instructed to turn over such land to Mr. Massie as can be surrendered without detriment to the University.

Resolved That the Chairman of the Faculty in conjunction with Prof. Mallet and the Proctor be requested to select the most suitable location on the University land for the Establishment of an Experimental Farm, with full estimates of proper expenditures for the same, and report at the meeting of the Board in September next.

Resolved, that the appropriation to the Library be deferred to the Meeting of the Board in September, in order that it may be as liberal as is consistent with the means at our disposal.

Resolved that the thanks of the Board of Visitors are due and are hereby tendered to Green Peyton Esq. for the engineering skill & judicious management displayed in the construction of the new water works.

Resolved, That in view of the numerous complaints made against some of the Hotels in reference to the Fare, it is hereby ordered that hereafter students will be allowed to form clubs of their own, which under the supervision of the Proctor and with full responsibility for all irregularities, may provide their own table.

The Committee on Public Grounds and Buildings hereby report that they have made a general inspection of the repairs made since the last meeting of the Board, and find that sundry valuable and important improvements have been made. The roofing of the Rotunda was a necessary indeed an indispensable work, and the repairs to other buildings were timely as well as essential- It is deemed necessary that the steps leading to the Lecture Room of Professor Harrison, be put in order at once. They are in a delapidated condition and difficult of ascent or descent.

Upon the whole the Ground & Buildings of the University are in an improved condition- Some of the Brick inclosures require repairs, but this can be easily effected by the energy and attention of the Proctor.
