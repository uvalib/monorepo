A special meeting of the Rector and Visitors was held on this date at 8 p.m. There were present Visitors Buchanan, Hall, Hart, Scott, and the Rector C. H. Walker, and President Alderman.

Minutes of the meetings of June 14th and July 6th, which had been copied and sent to the members, were approved.

The President presented a statistical report of the registration for 1926-27 showing a total of 2101 students in the regular session, being an increase of 77 over the same day of the previous year.

The President announced the following gifts and was requested by the Board to acknowledge the same on behalf thereof:

Bequest of Walter F. Taylor, of New York, of approximately $50,000 payable upon the death of two life tenants.

From the Graduate Nurses' Association of Virginia, $40,000 in cash, and note for $10,000, for the establishment of the Sadie Heath Cabiness Department of Nursing in the University.

From Mr. John Armstrong Chaloner, $5,000 to finance an expedition for Dr. S. A. Mitchell, Director of the Leander McCormick Observatory, to observe his seventh total eclipse of the sun, to be known as the "McCormick-Chaloner Eclipse Expedition to Norway".

RESOLVED, That the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia acknowledge and appreciate with great gratitude the handsome gift of Mr. John Armstrong Chaloner to finance an expedition for Dr. S. A. Mitchell, Director of the Leander McCormick Observatory, to observe his seventh total eclipse of the sun, to be known as the "McCormick-Chaloner Eclipse Expedition to Norway". The Rector and Visitors have in mind the former generous gifts of Mr. Chaloner and they take great pleasure in acknowledging this latest gift, manifesting as it does not only interest in the University, but appreciation of scientific research. Resolved further, That this resolution be spread upon the minutes of the Rector and Visitors.

From Mrs. R. H. Dean, of Scranton, Pa., $50.00, as an appreciation of what the University has done for her son. (She asks that no publicity be given the gift.)

From Mrs. George C. Webb, in memory of her husband, the late Judge George C. Webb, of Lexington, Ky., 938 volumes of law books, including text books, Decisions, Reports, and Digests.

From the Medici Society of America, to the Extension Department, 50 reprints of famous paintings, cash value of approximately $500 or $600.

Receipt, on August 17, 1926, of $10,000 of the bequest (reported last November), under the will of Mrs. Lelia Bennett, of Albemarle, $5,000 of which is for the hospital endowment, and $5,000 to be added to the Students Loan Fund, which has been set up on the books as the "LELIA BENNETT LOAN FUND".

From Mr. Isaac C. Blandy $5,000 for the replacement of the Blandy Farm. (Mr. Blandy asks particularly that no publicity be given to this gift).

Upon recommendation of the President the following action was taken in the matter of leave of absence of Prof. Dumas Malone, and the election of Prof. Simms and Instructor von Storch:

RESOLVED, by the Rector and Visitors, That a leave of absence, without salary, be granted to Professor Dumas Malone, of the Department of History, for the second half-year of the session, in order to teach at Yale University.

RESOLVED, further, that Mr. Henry H. Simms, of New York City, be and is hereby elected Acting Assistant Professor of History from February to June 1927, at a salary of $1,500, in consideration of the leave of absence granted to Professor Malone, and that the difference of $500.00, between the salary of Dr. Malone for the half-year and that to be paid to Mr. Simms, be used for the enrichment of the Library in the School of History.

RESOLVED, by the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, That Mr. Earle Gregory von Storch, be and is hereby elected Instructor in the Department of Art and Architecture, at a salary of $2,000.

Those Instructors, Assistants, and Scholarship and Fellowship holders appointed by the President since the last meeting of the Board, for the session 1926-27, were approved in the following motion, which was adopted:

RESOLVED, That the Rector and Visitors approve of the action of the President of the University, taken during the Summer Quarter, in making the following appointments:

The following budget for 1926-27 for the Institute for Research in the Social Sciences was presented and approved:

The President read a communication from Prof. W. R. Smithey, Professor of Secondary Education, concerning the work of the Southern Woman's Educational Alliance being conducted under his direction in Albemarle County and stating that Miss Dorothy Nelson had been selected by Dr. O. Latham Hatcher as holder of the Southern Woman's Educational Alliance Scholarship, and that she is now registered here as a graduate student. Miss Nelson furnishes a car but it is understood that the University would take care of its running expenses. He also reported that Mr. E. W. Gregory, Jr., who was an Instructor in the Department last session, had been appointed for the session of 1926-27, at a salary of $300, provided in the foregoing special appropriations. The appointments of Miss Nelson and Mr. Gregory were approved, and the expense for running Miss Nelson's car was approved.

The President presented a letter from Dean Lila of the Law Department in connection with the application of Mr. Samuel Bradford Stewart, Jr. for admission to the Law School, in which he stated that owing to fact that Mr. Stewart was not of the required age to be admitted, having not quite reached his eighteenth year, he had been obliged to deny him admission, but stated, that by reason of Mr. Stewart's somewhat phenomenal record in the College Department, he would have no objection to matriculating him in the Law School, and in fact recommends that this concession be made. On motion it was resolved that Mr. Samuel Bradford Stewart, Jr., be admitted as a regular student in the Department of Law.

The question of the manner and character of planting trees on the principal lawn of the University and elsewhere, if necessary, was referred to the Buildings and Grounds Committee.

The request of D. E. Brown, Graduate Manager, for the use of the land lying between the Ivy Road and the C & O Ry. for athletic purposes was referred to the Buildings and Grounds Committee for action and report back to the Board.

Dr. E. A. Kincaid, in charge of the University Commons now being run as a cafeteria, reported that during 1925-26, 202,100 meals were served at a cost of 26.49 &cent; per meal, with a net profit of 5 per meal, or a little more than one-half a cent, resulting in a credit balance for the year of $1,152.68.

The President stated that it has been suggested that the seal which is now being used on the diplomas be discarded and the new one done by Duncan Smith, now being used on our publications, be substituted in its place, but as there was some question as to whether or not the seal now in use had ever been formally adopted by the Board, the matter was referred to our attorney for report.

The Bursar reported that the sum of $63,000 had been collected on the Medical Buildings Fund subscriptions and that the same had been placed with the two local banks on certificates of deposit, bearing 4% interest.

The Bursar submitted his report for the year 1925-26 in printed form, copies of which were furnished to each member of the Board.

A letter was read from Mr. C. H. H. Thomas, Chairman of the P. K. A. Scholarship Committee, with reference to substituting room #33 West Range for room #31 West Range as a dormitory for the P. K. A. scholar, in order that room #31 might be turned over to the Alumni Association as a Woodrow Wilson shrine, in which he stated that he felt confident such exchange would be approved by the general fraternity, and such substitution met with the approval of the Board.

On motion the meeting then adjourned to November 6th at 10 a. m.

An adjourned meeting of the Board was held on this date at 10 a. m. at which were present Visitors Buchanan, Hall, Hart, Hull, Rinehart, Scott and Walker, and President Alderman.

Prof. Bruce D. Reynolds, Chairman of the Faculty Committee on the Blandy Experimental Farm, submitted the following report:

The Committee appointed to study conditions relating to the Blandy Experimental Farm wishes to report the following:-

Subsequent to being notified by Mrs. Blandy and her lawyer that they considered the University coming into possession of the farm as of the day Mr. Blandy died, arrangements were made for taking over the management of the property and Mrs. Blandy's lawyer was notified accordingly, about the tenth of August. On August 25, Mr. J. H. Funkhouser of Whitepost, Virginia, was appointed temporary manager at a salary of $60.00 per month.

Mr. Funkhouser was instructed to make the necessary preparations for gathering the crop of apples and to handle any other business which might come to his attention. It should be said to the credit of Mr. Funkhouser that he has done his work so well that it seems as if the University will realize at least $2,000.00 net from the sale of apples. Besides this, there will be money coming in from the sale of hay and for grazing privileges. On the other hand, it should be stated that Mrs. Blandy will probably submit a bill for labor and management from March 25 to until August 11.

The question of replacing the farming machinery, tools, etc. has been carefully considered and it is believed that the five thousand dollars available for this purpose will be adequate. In addition to the $5,000.00 given by Mr. Isaac Blandy, it is suggested that an equal amount be placed in one of the local banks before February 1, 1927, to be used as a line of credit. This fund could be used in paying the laborers and various other items which will be constantly coming up. Very likely it would have to be supplemented before the end of the year.

Mr. Funkhouser has been authorized to engage the services of Mr. George Kirby and his son for the next year, beginning January 1, 1927, at a combined salary of $75.00 per month, plus the usual prerequisites. These men are exceptionally good workers and it was necessary to engage them ahead of time in order to get them. Besides these there should be one or two more regular laborers, one of which should be well trained in orchard methods.

It is further recommended that Mr. H. T. Antrim, Forest, Virginia, be appointed manager of the farm for a period of one year, beginning January 1, 1927, at a salary of $1,800.00 plus home, garden, cow, keep of riding horse, three pigs and some chickens. The attached letters substantiate the good opinion formed by the committee as to the qualifications of Mr. Antrim.

The duties of the manager shall consist of supervising the farm and farm crops, hiring the labor, purchasing farm supplies (through the Bursar), selling the farm crops, keeping books and all other duties pertaining to farm management.

During the first year the crops will have to be confined to corn, cow peas and a few things of that sort. Of course, the orchard will require careful consideration. For the first few years the live stock should be limited to work horses and milk cows. As soon as more money is available, stock raising should be encouraged as a part of the regular agricultural enterprise.

It is believed that the manager should be given a liberal opportunity to work out the various farming projects according to his best judgment. Until a director of the experimental farm is obtained, the present committee, or another one, might act in an advisory capacity, especially in all matters involving the expenditures of large sums of money. It is probable that the manager should be placed under a small bond.

A second report pertaining to the educational phase of this undertaking, will be submitted later. It is imperative to attend to the farming problem as soon as possible, if a satisfactory working force is to be obtained.

On motion, the Committee on the Blandy Experimental Farm, appointed at the meeting of the Board July 6th, composed of Messrs. Rinehart and Hart, was continued and given authority to carry out the provisions of the report, as to operating the farm, contained therein.

Prof. Reynolds also read a report from the Committee on the proposed educational scheme to be instituted at the Blandy Experimental Farm. Same was referred to a subcommittee of the Board for study and report back, after conference with the Committee of the Faculty and the President. The Rector appointed on this committee Messrs. Rinehart, Hart and Williams.

The President stated that he had had some correspondence with Mr. Joseph F. Moore, of Berryville, Attorney for Mrs. Blandy, wich respect to certain matters in connection with the bequest of Graham F. Blandy of the farm to the University, which are, or might become, issues between the widow of said Blandy and the University, or between the Executors of the estate of Graham F. Blandy and the University with respect to construing certain portions of the will, and that Mr. Moore suggested a friendly suit for the purpose of securing Court construction thereon. The questions to be covered are as follows:

1\. To establish such rights as Mrs. Blandy may have in the roads and telephone lines which cross the University property and the maintenance of these roads and telephone lines.

2\. For an accounting of the farm operations from the time of Mr. Blandy's death to the date when the University took over the operation of its share of the property, which was approximately September 1st.

3\. To settle the construction and maintenance of joint line fences.

Mrs. Blandy is extremely anxious to have that part of the farm which is now the property of the University, kept as a bird and game sanctuary and that no hunting be ever permitted on this property. She wishes this established by court decree, but Mr. Moore suggests that a letter from the President to Mrs. Blandy, assuring her of the University's purpose in this matter, would probably be better for the University.

If a substantial wire fence will be satisfactory to the University as a line fence between Mrs. Blandy's property and that of the University, Mrs. Blandy will agree to erect such fence at an estimated cost of $450.50, one-half of which she will pay, provided the University will pay the other half. This estimate does not include placing gates in this line fence, which the University would probably not need and Mrs. Blandy would pay for such gates as may be needed for her purpose.

In disposition of the foregoing matter, Mr. Hall presented the following motion, being duly seconded and adopted:

RESOLVED, That the Attorney for the Board be instructed to reply to the communication received from the Attorney of Mrs. Georgette H. Blandy and say that in view of the acceptance of the devise and the execution of the agreement to carry out the terms thereof, it is the sense of the Board that no suit in equity is necessary to construe the will of Graham F. Blandy, deceased; or to settle any account with reference to maintenance and conduct of the Blandy Farm to August 1, 1926; that it is the desire of the Board to insure Mrs. Blandy a right of way or easement to the Winchester and Berry's Ferry Poad, and to the White Post as the same now exists, as well as an easement for the telephone line and pole and wire line for transmission of electric current as the same now exists; that with reference to the cutting of cedars on the land of Mrs. Blandy and the maintenance of the farm as a bird and game sanctuary, it is the sense of the Board that it would not be proper to pass any resolution in respect thereto, which might be construed as an attempt to determine the future policy of the University in the management of the Blandy Farm; and that as at present advised the Board has no intention of permitting any hunting on the Blandy Farm.

Mr. Rinehart brought up the condition of the road leading into Lambeth Field from Rugby Road, and, after consideration, on motion it was

RESOLVED, That the Buildings and Grounds Committee be authorized to expend not to exceed $500 to recondition the said road.

With respect to the application of Omicron Chapter of Beta Theta Pi Fraternity for a site on which to erect a chapter house on the land of the University lying between the Memorial Gymnasium and Ivy Road, the Board viewed the proposed location, and disposed of the matter in the following motion, duly seconded and adopted:

RESOLVED, That the application of the Omicron Chapter of Beta Theta Pi for a site on the land lying between the Memorial Gymnasium and the Ivy Road be not granted.

Mr. Scott stated that if the Superintendent of Buildings and Grounds would have the grass and brush cut off the land lying between the Memorial Gymnasium and the Ivy Road, and the hedge along said road trimmed, he would pay the cost of same.

On motion the meeting then adjourned.
