The President made the following announcements:

* Enrollment to date, 2705.

* Resignation of Prof. Richard Heath Dabney, in which the following motion, made by Mr. Christopher B. Garnett and seconded by Mr. Lewis C. Williams, two of his old students, was adopted:

  **RESOLVED**, by the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the resignation of Dr. Richard Heath Dabney, Corcoran Professor of History in the University, be and the same is hereby accepted with regret. Dr. Dabney has carried forward his work here at the University for nearly fifty years with devotion and skill, and the Rector and Visitors wish for him the joy and satisfaction which come of duty faithfully performed.

* Resignation of Mr. I. Martin Leavitt, in which the following motion was adopted:

For two years Mr. Leavitt has been successfully assisting in the teaching work of the Law School and the Rector and Visitors wish for him distinguished success in the practice of law.

* Application of Prof. Thomas P. Abernethy for loan from the endowment funds of $8,000 at 5% to be used towards the erection of a residence to cost $10,500 on the Barracks Road, just off Rugby Road, to be repaid after the expiration of five years at the rate of not less than $500 per year, to be secured on 1st mortgage, was granted.

* The matter of widening West Range Road was referred to Mr. R. Gray Williams to be taken up with Mr. H. G. Shirley and Mr. Massie.

* The proposed addition to the Hospital for accommodation of psychiatric patients was approved in the following motion, adopted:

  **RESOLVED**, by the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the New Buildings Committee of the Board, acting in conjunction with the President, discuss informally with Mr. R. E. Lee Taylor the possibility of adding two stories to the Preventorium Wing of the Hospital, for the hospital care and treatment of psychiatric patients, out of the money contributed to the University by Mr. Paul G. McIntire for this purpose, and

  **RESOLVED**, FURTHER, that if this building proposal becomes financially feasible the Committee is authorized and directed to enter into an agreement with Mr. Taylor for the preparation of plans and specifications at a compensation not to exceed 5 percent of the cost.

* The President stated that his attention has recently been called by Mr. Paul Goodloe McIntire to the terms of two trusts created by Mr. McIntire, as of December 5th, 1923, by which funds amounting to some $300,000.00 were deposited by Mr. McIntire with United State Trust Company of New York, the income to be applied toward the support and maintenance of Mr. McIntire's daughter, Miss Charlotte Virginia McIntire, during her life, and at her death said income to be paid by the Trustee to the University and applied by the University to certain scholarships under conditions accurately defined in said trust agreements.

Mr. McIntire stated to the President that it was his desire to revoke the provisions of said trusts with reference to creating said scholarships and to substitute therefor a provision directing the Trustee to pay the income from these trusts after the death of Mr. McIntire's daughter to the University for such general purposes as the Board might from time to time deem wise. The question of thus changing the terms of said trusts was referred to Mr. Perkins, Attorney for the University, and after some correspondence with Attorneys for United States Trust Company, Mr. Perkins made report that he and the attorneys for the Trust Company had agreed that it would be necessary for Mr. McIntire to file a petition in the Circuit Court of Albemarle County to which the Trustee and the University would be made parties respondent. All future possible students to whom scholarships might be awarded under the provisions of the trusts would be brought into the proceeding as parties unknown, under the provisions of Section 6069 of the Code of Virginia, and an order entered in that proceeding approving and authorizing the change in said trusts in accordance with Mr. McIntire's wishes, as expressed in the petition.

Mr. McIntire was advised of this conclusion and stated that he felt it proper to ask that the University should institute and conduct such proceeding to a finality.

It was, thereupon, **RESOLVED** that the Attorney for the University be and is hereby authorized, with the consent and approval of Mr. McIntire, to prepare and file the necessary petition in the Circuit Court for the County of Albemarle, and Dr. J. L. Newcomb, President, is hereby authorized to execute and file an answer to said petition in the name and on behalf of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, in which answer the University shall express its consent to the changes in said trusts requested by Mr. McIntire in his said petition, and shall unite in the prayer thereof.

* Request of Mrs. Charles M. Fauntleroy for the release of 100 shares of United States Steel common stock from the University's bequest from her late husband, was declined, as set forth in the following motion, unanimously adopted:

  **RESOLVED**, that the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia have heard with sympathy and interest the request of Mrs. Fauntleroy for the release by the University of Virginia of its interest in 100 shares of United States Steel stock. After consideration by the Board it was agreed that the request of Mr. Fauntleroy be refused, and the compromise settlement of the Estate of Charles M. Fauntleroy approved at the meeting of the Rector and Visitors, held October 23, 1937, is hereby ratified and confirmed.

* Special appropriation of $1,500 was voted for purchase of equipment for the Laboratory of Bacteriology and Preventive Medicine for the fiscal year 1937-38.

* Investment of University of Virginia Reserve Account Funds for P. W. A. Bonds was disposed of in the following motion, adopted:

  **RESOLVED**, by the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, that the Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Virginia be and he is hereby authorized to invest funds in the Reserve Account of the Sinking Funds for the payment of University of Virginia, P. W. A. Bonds, in direct Government obligations.

* The following contract between the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway Co. and the University of Virginia, covering upkeep of coal trestle and siding, was approved:
