### THE RECTOR AND VISITORS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA CHARLOTTESVILLE 22903 207 Minor Hall 8 January 1966

The Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia met on this date at 10:00 a.m. in the Office of the President for a called meeting with the following present: Rector Charles R. Fenwick; President Edgar F. Shannon, Jr.; and Visitors Cross, Faulconer, Hobbs, Kendig, Kuykendall, Lantor, Montague, Parrish, Walker, and Williams. Absent: Visitors Camp, Johnson, Lewis, Rogers, and Wilkerson. Chancellor Grellet C. Simpson was present for a part of the discussion.

The minutes of the meeting of 11 December 1965, previously distributed, were approved as corrected.

The Board proceeded to a discussion of the recommendations affecting the University contained in the Report of the Higher Education Study Commission to the Governor and the General Assembly of Virginia (Richmond: Commonwealth of Virginia, December 1965). The major policy issues in the Report which affect the University are: (1) the proposal to remove all community colleges and branches from the parent institution (except George Mason College) and place them under a State board; (2) the recommendation for the creation of an independent university in northern Virginia probably based on George Mason College; (3) the suggestion that eventually Mary Washington College be separated from the University and placed under its own board; (4) the suggestion that all institutions not now coeducational might want to become coeducational on their own part; (5) the recommendation that all extension work be coordinated by the State Council of Higher Education; and (6) the proposal that the State Council of Higher Education review all biennial budget requests by the institutions of higher learning to the Governor and General Assembly.

Lengthy discussions were held on all these points and three specific actions were taken as follows: (1) the adoption of a statement of policy concerning the proposal to separate the community colleges and branches from the University; (2) the adoption of a statement of policy concerning George Mason College; and (3) the adoption of a resolution concerning Mary Washington College.

## COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND BRANCHES

The following statement of policy concerning the colleges and branches of the University was adopted unanimously: The Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia expresses its appreciation for the study and effort that have gone into the Report of the Higher Education Study Commission and especially for the emphasis in the Report on the need for additional educational opportunities and facilities for the people of Virginia. The Board also feels that the establishment of community colleges throughout the Commonwealth is commendable, in order to provide a broader educational opportunity for the citizens of the Commonwealth. The branches and so-called "community colleges" of the University are not comprehensive community colleges in the terms of the Report but instead are branches of the University and are serving as regional colleges. With regard to its branches, the University has been committed to this program for a number of years with substantial contributions and the enthusiastic support of the localities. The record shows that the association between the parent institution and the branches has enabled these institutions to acquire well-qualified faculty members, attract students, and therefore provide improved education. The University is prepared to continue this successful relationship so long as it appears to be in the best interests of education in the Commonwealth.

## GEORGE MASON COLLEGE

The following statement of policy concerning George Mason College was adopted unanimously: The Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia went on record on 8 October 1965 as favoring a four-year status for George Mason College, and the biennial budget request submitted by the President of the University on 16 August 1965 to the Governor and the General Assembly included funds to provide for the third and fourth years of college work. It was the consensus of the Board that it is prepared to develop graduate work at the institution as appropriate and that George Mason College should remain a part of the University of Virginia.

## MARY WASHINGTON COLLEGE

The following resolution was unanimously adopted: RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that an item relating to the future status of Mary Washington College be placed on the docket for the regular meeting of the Board in February 1966 and that the Mary Washington College Committee be requested to explore in advance of that meeting the various aspects and implications of the proposal to separate Mary Washington College from the University of Virginia and to present at the February meeting a preliminary report on the advantages and disadvantages of such a proposal.

On motion the meeting was then adjourned at 2:00 p.m.
