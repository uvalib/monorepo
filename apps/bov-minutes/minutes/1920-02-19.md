Minutes of meetings of the university's governing body which is the legal owner and operator of the institution. Recorded in the minutes are appointments and other personnel decisions concerning faculty, decisions about construction of facilities, gifts to the university, and all other board actions, decisions and resolutions.

At the adjourned meeting set for this date there were present Rector R. Tate Irvine, and Visitors Hatton, Norton and Michie. As there was not a quorum present, no business was transacted.

A special meeting of the Board of Visitors was held on this date at 8 o'clock P. M. with the following members present: the Rector, R. Tate Irvine, and Visitors E. L. Greever, Harris Hart, Goodrich Hatton, Geo. R. B. Michie and Alexander F. Robertson.

The minutes of the meeting of January 12th, not having been sent out to the members of the Board for approval, were passed by.

President Alderman reported a gift from Miss Grace E. Arents, Richmond, Va., of the library of her uncle, Mr. Lewis Ginter, consisting of some three to five hundred volumes.

Mr. Michie, chairman of the special committee appointed to elect a professor of Physical Training, reported that they had selected Dr. Rice Warren, his services to begin September 15, 1920. In connection with the foregoing report, the following offered by Mr. Michie was unanimously adopted:

**RESOLVED**, That among other duties the professor of Physical Training shall have complete control of football and baseball coaching with full power, authority and responsibility.

The question of change in title of Dr. W. A. Lambeth from Director of Fayerweather Gymnasium which was considered at the meeting on January 12th and laid on the table, was taken up and the following unanimously adopted:

**RESOLVED**, That the title of Dr. W. A. Lambeth be Director of Physical Education instead of Director of the Fayerweather Gymnasium.

The following recommendations by the General Faculty concerning requirements for admission of women to the graduate and professional departments of the University were adopted:

1. **General Age Limit**\
   Candidates for admission must be more than twenty years of age on the date of registration.

2. **Admission to the Department of Graduate Studies**\
   Same requirements for women as for men: viz., a baccalaureate degree.

3. **Admission to the Department of Medicine**\
   That the requirement for the admission of women be the same as for the admission of men, namely, two years of prescribed college work.

4. **Admission to the Department of Law**\
   Regular students - A baccalaureate degree, or failing this, not less than twenty-two years at the nearest birthday, and in addition two years of college work.\
   Special students - The applicant must be at least twenty-three years of age, and fulfil the other requirements as prescribed in the regulations for the admission of men.

5. **Admission to the Department of Engineering**\
   That women who have had two years of college work be admitted as regular students of engineering.

6. **Admission to the Department of Education**\
   That women meeting the entrance requirements of this University, and having credit for two years of college work aggregating thirty session-hours of academic work, to be prescribed by the faculty in Education, shall be admitted to the Curry Memorial Department of Education.

7. **General Agreement**\
   Women who have completed elsewhere the group-electives required for the vocational B. S. (usually two years, aggregating thirty session-hours) may be admitted as candidates for this degree.

The following offer of Mr. Michie was adopted:

**RESOLVED**, That the 25% increase in the salaries of professors and administrative officers who have been with the University less than three years shall go into effect as of September 15, 1919.

The President explained to the members the situation with respect to the University's request for State appropriation at the present session of the legislature, stating that he had appeared before the finance committee in an effort to have the amount stated in the budget presented by the Governor to the legislature increased from $221,000 and $211,000 per annum respectively, to such sums as would adequately care for the University needs and that he left Richmond feeling that he had been able to secure an increase to the above amounts of $50,000 per annum, but he now learns that the amount has been cut to $39,000. After a full discussion of the matter it was the sense of the Board that the President should make an effort to have this amount changed to at least $50,000.

The meeting then adjourned.
