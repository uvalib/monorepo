That the urgency of the advancing season, & the importance of procuring workmen before they become generally otherwise engaged for the season, render it necessary for expediting the objects of the University, that certain measures be forthwith taken, which, if delayed until the first actual meeting of our successors, would materially retard those objects.

That Alexander Garrett, treasurer of the Central college, be continued as the depository of the funds of the institutions, with authority to exercise the powers and perform the duties of Bursar of the University until otherwise provided.

That to meet the immediate and pressing calls for money he be authorised to recieve from the treasury of the state the sum of fifteen hundred Dollars, in part of the public endowment of 15,000. Dollars for the present year.

That a copy of these proceedings be laid before the Governor and council for the exercise of the power of controul committed to them by the same act of the legislature, should they think proper to exercise that power on any part of these proceedings
