Mr. Christopher B. Garnett was elected Chairman of the meeting.

Gray Williams, Rector of the University, and suggested the preparation of a memorial in his honor to be spread upon the minutes of the Board, and, on motion of Mr. Stettinius that Mr. Garnett be requested to prepare such memorial, to the preparation of which Mr. Garnett gave consent, it was adopted.

Mr. Anderson moved the election of a Rector to succeed Mr. R. Gray Williams, and upon the motion being approved placed in nomination Mr. Edward R. Stettinius, Jr., who was unanimously elected.

The President announced the enrollment of the University as of this date 2420.

Receipt and Release of the University of Virginia in re. Deed of Trust executed by David Randall MacIver to the United States Trust Company of New York, Trustee. On motion the matter was disposed of in the following resolution adopted:

**RESOLVED**, that the action of E. I. Carruthers, Bursar of the University of Virginia, in executing and delivering to the United States Trust Company of New York, Trustee under deed of trust dated May 27, 1932, made by David Randall MacIver, said receipt and release be and is hereby approved, ratified and confirmed in all respects.

The requests of certain fraternities for additions to their present loans from the University secured on their houses, to be used in making needed repairs and to meet demands of private parties who had made loans to aid in the erection of the houses, were referred to the Finance Committee.

President Newcomb stated that he had received an application from a woman student from the eastern shore of Virginia for a Bayly-Tiffany scholarship to enable her to attend Mary Washington College and felt that he could not authorize the award as the bequest establishing the scholarships made no mention of their award to women students, and that at that time Mary Washington College was not a College of the University, and requested action by the Board. Following some discussion of the matter, the question of making the said scholarships available for Mary Washington College was referred to the Attorney General of the State for his opinion.

The President stated that he had received a communication from the Surgeon General of the U. S. Army inviting the University to apply for the establishment of a Reserve Officers Training Corps unit in the Medical Department of the University, which was disposed of in the following motion adopted:

**RESOLVED**, by the Board of Visitors of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, that the President is authorized and empowered to make application to the Adjutant General for the establishment of a Reserve Officers Training Corps Unit in the Medical Department of the University of Virginia.

It was suggested that the special committee of the Board on Student Activities undertake to include the Mary Washington College in their studies. After some discussion it was **RESOLVED**, that this be added to the duties of the Committee of the Board on the Mary Washington College, and this committee was empowered to deal with all matters connected with the Mary Washington College.

Mr. Barron F. Black, Chairman of the Finance Committee, submitted the following report, which was approved:

To the Board of Visitors of The University of Virginia:

The Finance Committee of the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia respectfully submits the following report:

There is attached hereto marked "Exhibit A" a schedule showing the transactions of the Finance Committee regarding the Consolidated Endowment Funds of the University of Virginia for the period January 1, 1946 to July 1, 1946.

In this schedule is reported "Stocks sold and called", "Stocks purchased", "Bonds sold and called", and "Bonds purchased". From these headings it will be seen that many of the transactions are somewhat involuntary and in the form of stocks and bonds called. On the other hand, many of them are sales and purchases of securities where the Committee has itself exercised its best judgment after seeking advice from those skilled in investments. The Committee respectfully asks the approval of the Board of its actions as set out in the attached Schedule A.

This Committee has actively functioned since January of this year, at which time a chairman was appointed; only recently Mr. Gay has become a member.

It has a number of problems ahead of it. There are a few securities which at the opportune time should be disposed of. Yet there is a comparatively large amount of cash awaiting investment, and it is one of our prime objects not to too greatly lower the income from the fund. The question of the proper proportions of investment in the various forms of securities is an ever-recurring one.

On all of these problems the Committee has been fortunate in having the wise counsel of Mr. Edward C. Anderson, as well as the facilities of his firm, Messrs. Scott and Stringfellow, at its disposal.

In addition, very recently Mr. J. Harvie Wilkinson, Jr., Vice President of the State Planters Bank and Trust Company of Richmond, Virginia, has kindly consented to sit with the Committee at its meetings and advise with it on its various problems.

We think that progress has already been made by the Committee, and that gradually an organization will be developed capable of properly directing the investments of the funds in charge of the Board of Visitors.
