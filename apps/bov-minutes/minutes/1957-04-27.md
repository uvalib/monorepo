The Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia held its regular meeting at 10.00 A.M. on this date in the Office of the Chancellor of Mary Washington College, at Fredericksburg, with the following present. The Rector, Frank Talbott, Jr.; President Colgate W. Darden, Jr.; Chancellor Grellet C. Simpson, and Visitors Berkeley, Bryan, Coxe, Emmett, Gravatt, Gray, Greear, Hartfield, Jones, McWane, Martin, Pollock, Mrs. Smith, Mr. Smith, and Wheeler. Mr. Edgar E. Woodward, Bursar of Mary Washington College, was present during the discussion of the College budget.

The minutes of the meeting of 9 March 1957, previously distributed, were approved.

The Rector informed the Board that he had appointed Mr. McWane to succeed the late Mr. Howard as a member of the Committee on Mary Washington College.

On behalf of the special committee appointed on March 9th, Judge Smith presented the following resolution:

**RESOLVED**, by the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia, that in the passing of Dowell Jennings Howard on 23 February 1957, the University and the public schools of Virginia have suffered a deep and permanent loss.

A devoted servant of public education in Virginia since 1919, and for the past seven years a member of this Board, Dowell Howard won and held the respect of those who shared his generous labors, we here record our warm affection for him and the sorrow which his death has brought to us.

As a soldier in time of war, and an unselfish leader in the affairs of his Church and city, as in his unstinting services to the schools and colleges of Virginia, Dowell Howard worked with the same unvarying integrity and sincerity which made him a natural leader in his profession. The crisis in public education that developed during his administration of Virginia's educational system was met by him with a firm resolve to maintain and strengthen the public schools. His devotion to his state and country and his buoyant confidence in the Jeffersonian ideal of education as their democratic bulwark were never shaken. We shall hold him in grateful memory.

The Board approved and adopted the foregoing resolution, and the Secretary was directed to have copies put into suitable form and presented to Mrs. Howard and her children.

President Darden announced to the Board the death on April 26th of Dr. Bruce Dodson Reynolds, Chairman of the Department of Biology and former Director of the University's Mountain Lake Biological Station in Gile's County. Mr. Reynolds had served as a member of the Biology faculty since 1923.

There were expressions of the affection and esteem in which Professor Reynolds was held, and the Secretary was directed to record in the permanent minutes the deep sense of loss felt by the Board, and the gratitude of the Visitors for his devoted and valuable services to the University.

The President announced the following gifts and grants:

In discussing the gifts, President Darden noted that acceptance of the Seven Society's gift would require specific action by the Board, and that he would not be in a position to propose such action until a later Board meeting.

The Board adopted the following resolution, subject to the reservation in the case of Mr. Kownacki that the President obtain a security check:

The Board adopted the following resolution:

**RESOLVED**, by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the Hospital Accounts Committee be and it is hereby authorized to charge off as uncollectible accounts Schedules 666, 669, 670, 674, 677 and 678, aggregating $71,836.69, as recommended by it.

The President stated that American Telephone and Telegraph Company is constructing an underground telephone system to be used for long distance communications and as a part of that system had requested the University to grant it an easement of right of way under a road right of way approximately 50 feet in width owned by the University as a part of the Blandy Farm in Clarke County of Virginia, the wires, etc of the Company to be buried beneath the road. The Company was prepared to pay $50.00 for the grant of the right of way in question. The matter had been referred to Mr. Minor, the University's special counsel, who was of the opinion that under Section 23-77.2 of the Code of Virginia, 1950, as amended, The Rector and Visitors were authorized to grant such easement. He then presented a draft of the instrument granting the easement in question, which draft, he stated, had been approved by Mr. Minor.

After consideration of the instrument as presented, upon motion, duly seconded and carried, it was:

**RESOLVED**, that it is deemed proper for The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia to grant to American Telephone and Telegraph Company, in consideration of $50.00, the perpetual easement and right of way across the road right of way connected with Blandy Farm, Clarke County, Virginia, described in the instrument presented to this meeting, the grant of such easement to be in the form of the instrument so presented.

**RESOLVED**, further, that Colgate W. Darden, Jr., President, be and he is hereby authorized and empowered to execute said instrument in the name and on behalf of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, and that Francis L. Berkeley, Jr., Secretary, be and he is hereby authorized and empowered to affix the corporate seal of the University to such instrument and to attest the same.

The President then referred to the request of the City of Charlottesville for a right of way for the enlargement of the intersection of West Main Street and Jefferson Park Avenue and for the widening of Jefferson Park Avenue, which request had been considered and tentatively approved by the Board at its meeting on March 9, 1957. In accordance with the Board's instructions, the matter had been referred to Mr. Minor, the University's special counsel, who had rendered an opinion that under the provisions of Section 23-77.2, of the Code of Virginia, 1950, as amended, The Rector and Visitors were authorized to grant easements for streets over any property owned by it, when in the discretion of The Rector and Visitors it is deemed proper to grant such easement, and that it was not necessary to obtain the Governor's approval of such grant.

He then presented to the Board the deed granting to the City of Charlottesville said street easement, drafted by Mr. Minor, stating that it had been approved in the form presented by the City Attorney on behalf of the City of Charlottesville.

After consideration of this deed as presented, upon motion, duly seconded and carried, it was:

**RESOLVED**, that it is deemed proper for The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia to grant to the City of Charlottesville, a perpetual easement and right of way for street purposes over the portion of the lands of the University of Virginia, described in the deed presented to this meeting, the grant of such easement to be in the form of the deed so presented.

**RESOLVED**, further, that Colgate W. Darden, Jr., President be and he is hereby authorized and empowered to execute said deed in the name and on behalf of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, and that Francis L. Berkeley, Jr., Secretary, be and he hereby is, authorized and empowered to affix the corporate seal of the University to said deed and to attest the same.

President Darden reported that the staff of the Judge Advocate General's School, having formed an officers' mess and desiring to issue beer to its members, would require a license from the Virginia Alcoholic Beverages Control Board. The ABC Board, Mr. Darden believed, would deny the license if the University made any objection, and he hesitated to make such an objection in view of the fact that the beer would be issued only in the officers' lounge of the dormitory building, occupied exclusively by the J. A. G. School and removed from other dormitory areas. The following letter from the University's Special Counsel was read to the Board:

I have your letter of March 28, 1957, requesting my opinion in regard to the above captioned matter, and I have given careful consideration to the correspondence enclosed therewith. It is my understanding, however, that the University is not interested in the arguments as to whether or not the J.A.G. School will have to obtain and pay for a license to dispense beer, but is interested in whether or not it can legally consent to the issuance of such license for sale of beer on University property. My opinion will therefore be confined to that point.

An exhaustive search of the Virginia statutes governing the sale of alcoholic beverages has failed to disclose any statute forbidding such sale. My examination of the statutes included not only the provisions of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act, but also the statutory provisions relating to Universities and Colleges, and to educational institutions in general, as well as those relating to State property. The closest approach to the problem is found in Section 4-31 of the Code of Virginia, 1950, as amended, dealing with the right of the ABC Board to refuse to grant a license. That section (4-31(2)(d)), provides as follows:

"The Board may refuse to grant any license mentioned in this Chapter if it shall have reasonable cause to believe:

That the place to be occupied by the applicant

Is so situated with respect to any church, synagogue, hospital, public, private or parochial school, college or university, public or private playground or other similar recreational facilities, or any state, local or Federal government operated facility, that the operation of such place under such license will adversely affect or interfere with the normal, orderly conduct of the affairs of such facilities or institutions."

I am therefore of the opinion that there is nothing in the statute law of Virginia which forbids the issuance of such license for sale of beer on University property. As I do not have available a copy of the lease between the University and the United States Government as to the J.A.G. School dormitory, I cannot say whether the subject matter is touched on therein.

The propriety of the University giving either express or tacit permission for the sale of alcoholic beverages on University grounds is a matter of policy upon which I express no opinion. I would think, however, that if permission is to be granted, it should be given by resolution of the Board of Visitors.

Board of Visitors' action on the attached indenture is in order, and I suggest that the Board consider a motion to instruct its Secretary to communicate to Mr. Edward S. Handy, in care of Mr. Junius Fishburne of the Peoples National Bank, Charlottesville, Virginia, their satisfaction over, and acceptance of, the provisions of the deed.

For your own information, let me say that Mr. Venable Minor drew this instrument, that Mr. Shea has vetted it, and that it is an irrevocable deed to the University, funded at present with something in the order of $1500. The wills of Mr. and Mrs. Handy are at present so drawn that the trust fund set up in the deed becomes the eventual beneficiary of an estate worth today approximately a quarter of a million dollars.

The Handys are, of course, free at any time to change these wills, leaving the deed worth only its present $1500 value, but it is my impression that their present intention is the result of long and careful deliberation, and is not likely to be changed except under unlikely and unpredictable circumstances.

In further reference to our telephone conversation of a few days ago in regard to the exchange of the University and Equitable Realty Corporation, whereby Equitable Realty Corporation undertakes to convey in fee simple to the University, a triangular piece of land lying along the western boundary of the soccer field in exchange for a ninety-nine (99) year lease from the University of another triangular parcel adjoining the first, I am enclosing herewith a plat of the properties to be exchanged, on which the property to be conveyed to the University is designated as Parcel A and marked in blue, while the parcel to be leased to Equitable Realty is designated Parcel B and marked in red.

I have no doubt that you would like to have this plat with you at the time you bring this matter before the board to obtain their approval, in substance, to exchange subject, of course, to their giving final approval of the necessary documents at a future meeting.

After the enclosed plat has served your purpose, I will appreciate your returning it to me as I will need it in the preparation of the documents in question.

At the direction of the Assembly of Professors of the University of Virginia I have the pleasure to transmit to you herewith a resolution passed by this body at a recent meeting. As you doubtless know this body is composed of all members of the University faculty of professorial rank. I am confident that the sentiments expressed in this resolution accurately express the feelings of the University faculty.

Word has reached the faculty of the Graduate School of Business Administration that you have expressed the intention of resigning from the presidency of the University within the next two years. At a meeting of the faculty of the School held on February 27 it was unanimously voted that I be instructed to write to you on behalf of the faculty and respectfully ask you to reconsider such a decision and remain in office for the full term of your office.

We want you to continue as chief executive of the University of Virginia for the following principal reasons:

1. We like you and Mrs. Darden as friends and neighbors and would be sad to have you leave the University community.
2. We like the way you run the University.
3. We think it improbable that a successor could be found who could so effectively interpret the University to the State government in all its branches and interpret the State government to the University.
4. We feel that the healthy growth of the Graduate School of Business Administration will be greatly helped by your being in office during its first formative years. It is your School. A change of administrative climate at this early stage could be prejudicial to the School's development.

It is understood, of course, that this plea does not apply if your rumored decision stems from any reason of health or family concern which only you could determine.

We have just had a meeting of the law faculty at which concern was again expressed about your consideration of resignation. I am writing for myself and my colleagues, and at their direction, in saying that this would be a great misfortune to the University and to us personally. We heartily endorse the resolution of the Association of Professors.
