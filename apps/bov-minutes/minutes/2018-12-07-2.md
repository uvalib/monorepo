RESOLVED, the Board of Visitors approves the minutes of the September 12, 2018 meeting of the Board of Visitors.

**Consent Agenda**

Upon motion, the Board approved consideration of addenda to the published meeting agenda.

**RESOLUTION TO APPROVE ADDITIONAL AGENDA ITEMS**

RESOLVED, the Board of Visitors approves the consideration of addenda to the published Agenda.

**Discussion with University Leadership**

Mr. Conner made brief opening remarks and congratulated Dr. Lateef for election as chair of the Prince William County School Board, and Dr. Britt for his admission in the inaugural class of College of Surgeons Master Educators.

President Ryan reviewed the agenda for the session, and asked Mr. Conner to begin the governance discussion.

**Governance**

Mr. Conner outlined a proposal for discussing two questions: what do we want our relationship with our president to be, and what do we want to do as a Board, i.e. how do we position ourselves to focus on the things we want to focus on? He said he would like to see shared governance and partnership with University leadership based on trust, communication, and respect for each role. Minimizing exceptions to standard policies is part of this. He said the Board wants a realistic view of the University from leadership and time in meetings to engage in discussions of strategic issues.

Mr. Conner said Board members should better coordinate requests for information from management. He suggested that members go through the chair of the appropriate committee when requesting information. He said a member may always call the Rector or the Vice Rector as well. He asked that if a member wishes to have an item on the agenda for a meeting, the member call the Rector or Vice Rector with the suggestion.

Mr. Conner suggested that management produce a scorecard or dashboard of metrics on the University.

He said a revised process was needed for presidential assessment, which is an important duty of the Board. The Board should engage in self-assessment on a regular basis; an outside party should be engaged to assist with the self-assessment.

Mr. Conner spoke about shortening board meetings to two days. He said this necessitates concurrent committee meetings in order to create the time for discussion with management. In order to inform all members of the Board of the activities of committees, short, concise, committee reports to the full Board would be included in the full Board agenda.

A discussion ensued about meeting structure. Mr. Murray suggested that each of the major committees should have one meeting a year that is with the full Board so that everyone has an opportunity to attend the committee meeting once a year.

President Ryan offered some initial observations:

*   Communication is key, and he will put in place a plan for one of the members of senior leadership to contact each member of the Board approximately once a month for a one-on-one discussion.
*   A set of metrics – dashboard – will assist the Board in understanding strengths and weaknesses.
*   The line separating governance and management is key. Senior leadership was hired to lead, so they need some room to do so.

Mr. Walker said he wants to add value as a member of the Board, and the experience for each member should be tailored to their interests and strengths. He pointed out that on other Boards he has participated in, an assumption is made that everyone has read the materials in advance and powerpoints and presentations are minimal, leaving time for discussion. Mr. Conner said powerpoint presentations at the meetings should be reduced to essential ones.

There was general agreement about condensing powerpoints, shortening committee meetings, allowing for more discussion, and possibly eliminating the need for most concurrent meetings. Mr. Conner pointed out that major issues could be brought to the full board sessions with leadership.

The senior leadership team offered observations. Ms. Davis pointed out that focusing on broader strategic issues would assist management because the Board can offer substantial expertise; the many transactional issues brought to the Board take up a great deal of time and may not be a good use of the Board’s expertise. Dr. Shannon suggested that webinars on targeted subjects would be a way of educating members of the Board more efficiently than calling every member of the Board individually. President Ryan said the Board could assist in identifying future threats and opportunities – this would be helpful to management.

Mr. Conner said that through this discussion he has concluded that many members prefer consecutive meetings held over two days and he and the Board secretary would develop a schedule along these lines. He asked members to contact him with issues they would like to address in the full board leadership sessions. Mr. Murray said staff should highlight the items in the advance materials that will be discussed at the committee meeting so that if a member has a question about another item the member may bring that to the attention of the committee chair in advance.

The Statement of Visitor Responsibilities was approved with an amendment from Mr. Murray on advising the administration about politics and the Commonwealth.

**Approval of Statement of Visitor Responsibilities**

Upon motion duly seconded, the Board approved the following resolution. The Statement of Visitor Responsibilities is attached to these Minutes.

**APPROVAL OF STATEMENT OF VISITOR RESPONSIBILITIES**

RESOLVED, the Board of Visitors approves the Statement of Visitor Responsibilities – Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia, dated December 7, 2018; and

RESOLVED FURTHER, the Statement of Visitor Responsibilities shall be provided to new appointees to the Board of Visitors within 30 days of notification to the University of their appointment.

**Development of the Strategic Plan**

President Ryan introduced Michael Lenox and Margot Rogers, co-chairs of a working group on facilitating a process for developing a strategic plan, to give an overview of the planning process. Ms. Rogers walked through the timeline of community involvement with 60 events around Grounds, the “Ours to Shape” website, and other opportunities for engaging constituents in the strategic planning process. The website is a repository for input.

Mr. Lenox said the working group is not developing the strategic plan; they are gathering data for senior leadership to develop the plan in the spring.

President Ryan said he thought the new strategic plan would build on the current Cornerstone Plan. Mr. Conner said there will be metrics for the strategic plan and a funding mechanism for the pillars of the plan. Dr. Shannon said the Health System strategic plan will roll up to the University plan. In answer to a question, President Ryan said the Emmet/Ivy task force and the community relations task force will feed into the strategic planning process.

**Guidelines for Strategic Investment Fund (SIF)**

President Ryan led the discussion. He said there was a general sense the current process for approval is overly cumbersome and the use of the fund was not tied to an overall strategic vision for the University. The Board decided to suspend funding projects until January to allow the new president to determine how to move forward. He said the fund would be used to fund the strategic plan; however, that will not happen until the strategic plan is completed, which will be next fall. In the interim, President Ryan proposed that the SIF be used for the following: 1) to replenish the matching fund for faculty chairs, as strengthening faculty is a perennial issue for the University; 2) to allow for the continued funding of research through a streamlined process devised by the provost, the provost-elect, and the vice president for research; and 3) to leave open the possibility of funding a remarkable opportunity that comes across our radar.

Mr. Conner said the only money available to fund the strategic plan is the SIF, and he is supportive of it. He is proud of the process so far, but it is not sustainable because of the time and energy it took for everyone involved including the faculty who developed proposals. Mr. Murray agreed that the process is unsustainable and the guidelines should be revisited at some point. Mr. Walker said capital should be used to unlock other capital, through the state or otherwise. Mr. Griffin said there should still be hard choices made about which initiatives should be funded; the SIF should not allow the University to avoid making those hard but necessary decisions.

**Renewal of Bicentennial Professors Fund**

Upon motion duly seconded, the Board approved the following resolution.

**RENEWAL OF BICENTENNIAL PROFESSORS FUND**

WHEREAS, in December 2017 the Board of Visitors approved allocating out of the earnings on the Strategic Investment Fund up to $75 million over four years for matching private gifts for endowed chairs in any school; and

WHEREAS, this program, the Bicentennial Professors Fund, has been very successful in its first year, providing matching funds of $37,581,833 for donor commitments, and reserving funds earmarked for certain schools of an additional $22,666,667 to-date; and

WHEREAS, the Bicentennial Professors Fund matches 50 cents on the dollar to endow chairs of $1 million or more for emerging scholars; 50 cents on the dollar to endow chairs for mid-career scholars of $2 million or more; and $2 dollars for every $3 dollars of private philanthropy for distinguished scholar endowed chairs of $3 million or more; and

WHEREAS, it is anticipated the full $75 million will be dedicated for endowed chairs within the next year;

RESOLVED, the Board of Visitors approves allocating up to an additional $75 million out of the earnings of the Strategic Investment Fund for the Bicentennial Professors Fund matching program over four years, to sunset on December 31, 2022; and

RESOLVED FURTHER, the current terms on which Bicentennial Professors Fund matching is made available shall apply to the additional allocation.

\_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_

The Board recessed from 12:30 to 1:30 p.m. for lunch and resumed the full Board meeting at 1:40 p.m.

**Committee Reports**

Brief committee reports were provided by the chairs of the committees: Health System Board, the Committee on The University of Virginia’s College at Wise, Advancement Committee, Academic and Student Life Committee, Buildings and Grounds Committee, and the Audit, Compliance, and Risk Committee.

**Remarks by the Chancellor**

Chancellor Donna Henry said a new undergraduate research journal has been published by faculty at the College at Wise, the online RN/BSN program has been approved by the accreditors, SACS/COC, and the Master’s of Art in Teaching has been forwarded to the State Council (SCHEV) for approval.

The College at Wise has joined the Common Application system, and half of all applications have come in through the Common App. Applications are up, so the College is on a trend for a healthy enrollment in the fall. The second class of Smith scholars will be admitted in the fall, and they provide 25 full-ride scholarships.

In other news, through UVA, funding has come in for the Appalachian Telehealth Initiative. This will be a community-broad outreach. The Nest has opened, which is a little house in Wise utilized as a center for entrepreneurship and innovation that was supported by the Strategic Investment Fund as well as funds from a generous donor. The Oxbow Center renovations are complete and it will have a major focus for cybersecurity technology and innovation. Several companies have requested space in the facility, and they will hire some College at Wise students.

The UVA Provost fund is supporting the new Center for Multicultural Studies. Some students visited the National Memorial for Peace and Justice in Montgomery, Alabama, to see how that facility operates, and Ms. Henry will visit there as well.

**Remarks by the Student Member**

Student representative Brendan Nigro distributed a handout with updates from two student organizations: the Latinx Student Alliance and the Asian Leaders Council. He said both organizations are working with senior leadership to better support the needs of minority students on Grounds. He commended the work of the President, Provost, and other senior leadership in working with these students and being responsive to their needs.

Mr. Nigro reviewed issues and opportunities for graduate and professional students. The graduate and professional student community on Grounds consists of nearly 7,000 students across 11 schools. He mentioned some of the common frustrations for graduate and professional students.

Graduate students are concerned about affordable housing at the University. Many students are not able to afford adequate housing in the housing market within the city. The $24,000 subsidies granted in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, for example, only go so far in a housing market where a one-bedroom and bath near the University can easily cost $9,500 or more a year. Many students in the graduate schools are forced to commute from nearby localities with cheaper rent, but then they find a lack of parking geared towards their needs. There is currently no differentiation between undergraduates and graduates in parking plan rates despite their different needs. Providing centralized, affordable housing catering to graduate and professional students may help to alleviate some of these stressors on the students and researchers who are so important to faculty discovery and the University’s research portfolio overall.

Mr. Nigro said another consistent concern of graduate and professional students is the lack of a robust sense of community. For the students who seek to be a part of the University’s broader community, we ought to think about how we can best make them feel like a critical part of the community. In trying to ensure a better sense of belonging for our graduate and professional students, we should recognize the unique challenges and timelines of their studies, for example, by providing student services over the summer when many graduate students are doing their research. Making sure that graduate students feel supported and are provided opportunities to engage in the broader University community will breed a culture of support and growth for our graduate and professional students that will not only continue to create talented researchers and professionals, but also dedicated alumni.

The last issue he addressed from the perspective of graduate and professional students is the particular challenges of graduate student families: students who have children. No formalized system of parental leave for the non-birth giving parent is one of the issues. Mr. Nigro thanked Provost Katsouleas’ team for hearing this issue and taking action by changing University policy to allow both parents eight weeks of parental leave.

Childcare costs in Charlottesville are often steep and unrealistic for many families relying on a graduate student stipend as a main source of income. Thinking about utilizing resources in the Curry School of Education’s early development and learning programs to help graduate students with childcare is a model other peer universities have employed.

Another issue is health care for partners of graduate and professional students. While students pay into the services at Student Health with their required fees, their families are unable to attain basic services for low cost. While maintaining a pediatrics division in Student Health is certainly not feasible, would it be possible for partners to get basic treatment and consultations at Student Health if there were an offering to pay a second Student Health fee? This is an especially pressing issue for international students whose partners, in many cases, do not have work visas and/or cannot qualify for federal assistance in health insurance to mitigate costs.

Finally, the issue of graduate student housing for families: there is very little housing provided by the University appropriate for families, and even that is sparse and delegated by lottery with no preference to students with children. This could be a consideration for the Emmett-Ivy Task Force.

**Remarks by the Chair of the Faculty Senate**

Mr. Brunjes spoke about college faculty and how they came to be faculty members. He said many think that faculty just teach a class now and then, but the best ones are like virtuoso musicians or rock stars. These are people who somewhere along the way became interested in something, pretty much to the exclusion of everything else.  They weren’t necessarily born with talents or abilities; all of them practiced and worked very hard. Malcolm Gladwell has estimated that it requires around 10,000 hours of practice to start to be proficient at something.  He said most of the faculty, during high school or college, took a class, or had a mentor, or worked in a lab, had an assignment, or took a trip somewhere and along the way they realized that some topic was the most interesting thing they could possibly imagine.  For Mr. Brunjes, it’s the development of the brain. These people go on to graduate school because it gives them the opportunity to live in a sheltered environment where they can spend all day, every day, reading, discussing, and thinking about whatever it is they find interesting.  They get caught up in a topic and it’s not that they can’t get out of it, they don’t want to!  They would rather think and write about it than do almost anything else.

Mr. Brunjes said in order to feed their passion for whatever it is, these people get jobs as faculty members.  As such, they can continue to do their thinking and work, with the added perquisite that they are paid to do it. They can give lectures to students, work closely with graduate students and post docs, and live in a world where they can spend lots of time with big ideas, sewing them together or ripping them apart.

The faculty job description is to discover new knowledge and to disseminate it to those interested.  They can get cranky when they are asked to do things that distract them from it.  In order to advance, you cannot just have great ideas, you need to put them in the marketplace of ideas by writing books and papers and grants.  In order for books and papers and grants to be published, the faculty must sit on committees (local, state, national and international) and read and review them. In order for departments to hire faculty, someone needs to review applications. To promote them, their accomplishments must be analyzed. New students must be chosen, mentored and evaluated.  Sooner or later, faculty members who really just want to think about ecosystems or photosynthesis or cultural differences might end up spending all of their time sitting in meetings or filling out forms. However, deep in each one, there is an incredible story about how at one point in their life they found something that was captivating enough that they couldn’t get away from thinking about it. 

Mr. Brunjes challenged the Board to verify this. He suggested that Board members ask any faculty member about what they do, and perhaps more importantly, how they got to where they are.

**Mead Endowment Presentation and Discussion**

Mr. Tom Darbyshire introduced a short video clip that describes the passion behind the Mead Endowment. The Mead Endowment encourages faculty-student engagement at the University. Boots Mead was a professor, mentor, and friend of students, and in 2002, a group of UVA alumni created the Mead Endowment to encourage more faculty to engage with students outside the classroom, as Boots so often did. Every year, a group of professors are handpicked by their deans, including 10 from the College and one from each of McIntire, Engineering, and Darden. At a Rotunda dinner, they are inspired to “walk in the footsteps of Boots.” Each of the faculty members submit a “dream idea” that allows them to engage closely with a small group of students. The Mead Endowment funds these projects. The faculty then return to the dinner the following year and report on their efforts, which provides inspiration for the incoming faculty. Since 2002, over 150 professors have participated, creating special experiences for thousands of students.

The Mead endowment also hosts welcome dinners for new faculty and encourages faculty-student interactions. The new faculty are given a $300 social allowance to host an engagement, and they are encouraged to do it right away, early in their UVA career.

All full-time faculty receive “Mead Money” to host students for lunch. Thousands of lunches have taken place over the years.

Statement of Visitor Responsibilities

Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia

December 7, 2018

This statement of responsibilities was adopted by the Board of Visitors (“Board”) of the University of Virginia (“University”) on December 7, 2018 to inform newly appointed Visitors of the expectations of Board service, and to serve as a reference point for self-evaluation of performance of the Board and its committees.

The Board is the governing body of the University, a Virginia public corporation under the name and style of “The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia”. By statute, the 17 voting members of the Board are appointed by the Governor of Virginia. Broadly, the Board has oversight responsibility for advancing the University’s mission and goals, for assuring the proper stewardship of the University’s resources and assets, and for monitoring the implementation of institutional strategy and policies. Among the Board’s primary and most important duties are appointing and evaluating the University’s president.

As the Board of the University, we are committed to effective governance accomplished through a Board culture characterized by dedication, diligence, collaboration, teamwork, candor, transparency, and accountability.

Every member of the Board is expected to fulfill the following responsibilities:

Dutifully Serve as a Member of the Board

*   Visitors make service to the University a high priority and commit the time and effort to educate themselves about University matters, prepare for and attend meetings of the Board and its committees, and engage constructively in the work of the Board.
*   Visitors actively seek leadership roles on the Board, and carry out the responsibilities associated with those roles.
*   Visitors work collegially with other Visitors, the president, and as appropriate, faculty, students, staff, and other University constituents.
*   Visitors promote the role of the Board as a policy-making oversight body that supports the president, senior administration, and the faculty in their management of the University’s operations and implementation of institutional strategy and policies.
*   Visitors understand and act consistently with the principle that they serve the University as a whole and not any particular school or constituent.

Advance the Values and Mission of the University

*   Visitors understand that they owe a fiduciary obligation to act in the best interests of the University.
*   Visitors support the University’s broader public mission and promote the values of a public university, including serving as conduits for conveying the interests of citizens and political leaders of the Commonwealth to the University.
*   Visitors participate in the life of the University, including attending major University events (e.g. Fall Convocation, Final Exercises).
*   Visitors respect the concept of student self-governance and the University’s Honor System.
*   Visitors actively safeguard principles of academic freedom for the University and its faculty and endeavor to protect the University from outside influences seeking improperly to shape it.
*   Visitors help the University obtain the resources it needs to support its mission.

Uphold the Integrity of the Board

*   Visitors understand and adhere to the Manual of the Board of Visitors, University policy, and applicable laws, rules, and regulations, including the Virginia State and Local Government Conflict of Interests Act and the Virginia Freedom of Information Act.
*   Visitors adhere to the highest standards of personal and professional integrity, including avoiding real or perceived conflicts of interests. Visitors do not use service on the Board, or information obtained through service on the Board, for personal advantage or for the advantage of family members, friends, or business associates.
*   Visitors abstain from asking the president or others for special treatment for anyone beyond that which is generally available, and understand that the president and the Board office are the primary contacts within the University with regard to Board business. This section does not prohibit routine letters of recommendation for admission or employment.
*   Visitors do not speak on behalf of the University or the Board unless designated by the rector and/or the president to do so.
