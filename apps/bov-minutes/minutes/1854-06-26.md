And the condition of the terraces as reported is such that they must to a very considerable extent be immediately renewed or repaired. But this Committee does not concur with the report of estimates in the full extent of repairs which it proposes. A total renewal may require the sum of 14,204.90cts but in their opinion a sufficient renewal and repair can be done for the sum of

The regular day for meeting having occurred on Sunday, there was no assemblage of members of the Board until Monday the 26. when the following visitors appeared at the Board and took their seats. Andrew Stevenson Esqr, William Lucas, Henry A. Wise, James L. Carr, Andrew McDonald and F. B. Miller. William J. Robertson Esqr, presented his commission from his Execellency Joseph Johnson Governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia appointing him a visitor of the University of Virginia, and thereupon took his seat at the Board.

The Rector Joseph C. Cabell being absent, the Board proceeded to organize when Andrew Stevenson was unanimously elected Rector Pro. Tem.

A communication from the Monticello Bank asking for a change in the place of deposit of the Funds of the University, was laid before the Board, when it was; Resolved that the Board deem it inexpediert to make any change in the place of deposit of the funds of the University at the present time.

Col Harrison B Tomlin presented a Commission from his Excellency Joseph Johnson Governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia appointing him a Visitor of the University of Virginia, and thereupon took his seat at the Board,

The Rector laid before the Board an Estimate of George Nicols (Builder of New York) of the labor and materials necessary to the repairs of the Terrace roofs of the University, and the Proctor appeared and gave the necessary explanation as to the manner and terms upon which Mr Nicols had been employed and the compensation to be made him, Whereupon the Board directed that the Proctor be authorized to settle the account of Mr Nicols and pay him the amount, not exceeding the sum of seventy five dollars.

On the motion of Mr Miller it was,

Resolved that the Board proceed to the appointment of the Executive Committee, and the Committees of Finance, Inspection and Library; Whereupon

Messrs Stevenson Robertson and Tomlin were appointed Executive Committee.

Messrs Wise and Carr Committee of Finance.

Messrs Tomlin, McDonald and Lucas Committee of Inspection.

And Messrs Robertson & Miller Committee to inspect the Library.

The Proctor and Bursars accounts and reports were laid before the Board, and referred to the Committee of Finance.

The report of the Librarian was laid before the Board and referred to the Committee on the Library;

The report of Mr Nicols was on motion referred to the Executive Committee.

Dr McGuffy appeared before the Board presented a memorial and made a statement in regard to granting certain testimonials to resident graduates of his class, upon which the Board took time to consider.

A communication from F. Eardman was presented to the Board containing a report, plans and estimates, for a supply of water, which were referred to the Executive Committee.

The Board then adjourned until tomorrow morning at ten o clock.

***

## Tuesday June 27th 1854

The Board met this morning pursuant to adjournment, present the same gentlemen as on yesterday with the exception of Mr Stevenson who was detained from his place by indisposition

Mr F. B. Miller was unanimously chosen as Rector pro tem during the absence of Mr Stevenson.

The Committee of Finance then presented the following REPORT. The Committee of Finance have examined the accounts and vouchers of the Proctor & Patron and Bursar as they find them audited and reported by the Commissioner of the University and submit the following report:

In accordance with the practice heretofore, the certificate of the Commissioner is taken as evidence of the fact that the items of disbursement are sustained by proper vouchers.

This balance is proved by the correspondence of accounts, on comparison of the statements by the Proctor and Bursars accounts

The increase of "surplus fees" more than accounts for this gain upon the estimates.

The estimates of the Proctor for the coming year beginning the 1st of June 1854 and ending the 31st of May 1855. are

This estimate however "does not include the additional work on the embankment around the New Buildings, but includes the roofing with slate of the Pavilions occupied by Professor Schelé and the Hotel occupied by Mrs Ward contracts for which have been made," what the estimates for the additional work on the embankments will be, will depend upon the report of the Executive Committee.

To pay a balance of $4000, on a debt of $4921.66 authorized to be borrowed at June session 1853, due to the Farmers Bank of Virginia at Charlottesville and renewed from time to time, and payable 24th July next, provision will have to be made. The easiest mode of payment will be to authorize the Proctor to curtail this balance out of the balance on hand, and current receipts for the coming year, with authority to renew the note in Bank from time to time until the balance is extinguished.

Wood is becoming a serious subject of cost to the University.

The improvements of transportation to Charlottesville are so increasing that the cost of coal as a substitute for wood will probably be greatly diminished, And it is submitted that a discretion shall be allowed the Proctor to substitute coal grates, for wood fire places in case he shall find that the reduction of the cost of fuel will decidedly compensate for the change of fire-place construction.

The Proctor calls the attention of the Board "to the fact that the Farmers Bank, where the Patron is required to deposite the students funds, are charging a discount of not less that one per cent on all southern money and that during the year they have received $91.15 by way of discount. This is a cause of great complaint with the Students" To require the Bank of Deposite to receive any and all funds at par would be unreasonable as some funds from extreme distances may not be bankable or current at all. But the Bank in consideration that it"works off" many discounted funds at par, and makes a profit upon the gross amount of deposites, ought not to charge University students with the ordinary rates of discount. If the rate of discount be extra-ordinary, or the funds be not current, the Bank should charge only its own losses upon the receipt of such funds, on these terms the University should continue its deposites with the Farmers Bank, but if that Bank will not accept these terms, the Patron should be authorized to negotiate the deposites with some other Banking Institution which will receive them on the most favorable terms.

The Proctor complains that there is no privacy on the lot where he resides and that his family is subjected to great annoyance. It is recommended that he be allowed Dormitory No 56 adjoining his house.

It is recommended also that he be allowed to purchase a fire proof safe for the use of his office not to exceed the cost of one hundred and fifty dollars.

The report of the Committee of Finance was accepted and the suggestions therein contained adopted, with the exception of that relating to Dormitory 56 which was stricken out unanimously. The Committee of inspection submitted the following report.

The Committee of inspection on yesterday commenced their duties, and closed the examination this morning "The lecture rooms were generally found in a dirty & filthy condition the excuse for which was that so many duties were assigned to the servants that they were unable to perform them promptly.

The Library is in its usual condition the Books appearing to be arranged according to the original design. The bequest of Mr Madison has lately been procured, so far as your committee are aware, in full, and the Books are now in the Library numbering 431 volumes. The engravings referred to last year in the report of the committee, still remain as they were. Prof Smith having made a communication to the Board of Visitors in reference to the Philosophical apparatus, and the enlargement of the room designated for them, the whole question is submitted to the Board of Visitors, as well as the subject of an addition to the Philosophical apparatus as recommended by Prof Smith."

A communication has also been made to the Board by Prof Maupin in reference to the Purchase of chemicals, which is earnestly commended to the attention of the Board. The full report made at the last session of the Board as to the condition of the Buildings, obviates the necessity of reporting any further on that subject. The Board is aware of the immediate necessity of repairs, and it is earnestly recommended that the steps before the Rotunda be reset at once as a few months may result in the entire destruction of the Portico unless these repairs be made. All which is respectfully submitted.

H. B. Tomlin, And McDonald , W. Lucas.

On motion of Col Tomlin it was resolved that the Proctor report to the board how many dormitories there are in the University, and how many are occupied by Professors and other Officers of the University, giving the names of those thus occupying them, and that he report forthwith.

Col Tomlin offered the following resolutions.

Resolved. That in future there shall be two Professors in the School of Law, and that James P Holcombe Esqr (the present Adjunct Professor) be appointed Professor of the Chair now established in that school.

The subject taught in the School of Law shall be divided between the two Professors in the following manner to Professor Minor shall be assigned the duty of giving instruction in the Feudal, Common & Statute Law; and to Professor Holcombe shall be assigned the duty of giving instruction in Equity and in the Laws Civil, Mercatorial, Maritime and of Nature & Nations also in the principles of Government and Constitutional Law.

Resolved that Professor Holcombe shall receive an annual salary of $1000 payable in like manner with the salaries of the other Professors, and to Commence on the first day of July 1854. The fees received in the School of Law shall be equally divided between the two Professors, provided however that neither of them shall receive more than the maximum amount of compensation now allowed Professors.

It is further resolved that leave be granted to Professor Holcombe to reside, at any convenient distance, without the precincts of the University, there being at present no Pavilion which can be assigned him.

The Board requested Mr. Holcombe to appear before them and confer with them on the subject matter of the foregoing resolutions, which conference having taken place, and the Board desiring a similar conference with Mr Minor and learning that Prof Minor was unwell directed their secretary to wait upon Mr Minor and ascertain from him whether he was well enough to appear before the Board or see a committee of their body. The secretary therupon proceeded to execute this commission, returned and made the following Report. "That on his way to Prof Minors residence he met Dr Davis Mr Minors Physician, and requested to know of him whether his patient was in a condition to appear before the Board; Dr Davis stated to the secretary that Mr Minor was too unwell to appear before the Board or see a committee of their body, the secretary therefore did not see Mr Minor."

After some deliberations the resolutions of Mr Tomlin were adopted.

The Proctor made a verbal report in response to the resolution respecting dormitories occupied by Professors and other officers of the University, accompanying said report with a drawing of the University showing how and by whom Dormitories were occupied.

On motion of Mr Wise it was.

Resolved that the subject of the appropriations of Dormitories by the Professors and Officers of the University be referred to the Executive Committee, and that they report as early as they can consider the subject, with instructions to resume all the dormitories for the use of the students which are not now necessarily occupied by the Professors and Officers.

Dr Howard made a verbal application to the effect that the quarters salary in the chair of Mathematics, due the 1st of January 1854, should be paid to him as representative of Dr Courtnays estate, which on motion was rejected.

On motion of Mr Robertson the following preamble and resolutions were adopted.

Whereas it appears, from a printed circular issued by Prof Agassiz that he offers his European Works for sale, at half price if ordered before the 1st of July and that he will make a further reduction of 10 per cent if a complete set be taken, and whereas it further appears that a Majority of the members of the Board of Visitors have concurred in the propriety of the purchase of thses books on the advantageous terms thus offered.

Resolved that the necessary sum, not exceeding $135.00 be appropriated for the purchase of a complete set of the European Works of Prof Agassiz.

Mr Wise moved to take up the corsideration of the communication from Prof McGuffy in relation to granting an additional "Diploma" in the class of Moral Philosophy, which motion was decided in the negative.

The Board then proceeded to the reading of testimonials of the various applicants for the Chair of Mathematics in the University, and before concluding the same the Board received through Mr Tomlin a communication from Prof Maupin in regard to the wants in his department which was laid upon the table for the present.

The Board then proceeded with the reading of the testimonials of applicants for the Chair of Mathematics and concluded the same.

The Board then adjourned until tomorrow morning at nine Oclock.

***

## Wednesday June 28th 1854

The Board met pursuant to adjournment present the same gentlemen as on yesterday with the addition of Mr Stevenson.

Mr Robertson moved to reconsider the resolution adopted on yesterday in relation to Dr Howards application on behalf of Dr Courtnays estate, which motion was lost.

The Executive Committee laid before the Board, the plan of a Hall submitted to them by the sons of temperance, which plan had been approved by said Committee.

The Rector Joseph C. Cabell appeared at the Board and took his seat, When

On motion of Mr Stevenson, the Board proceeded to elect a Professor of Mathematics to fill the Chair vacated by the death of the lamented E. H. Courtnay. Whereupon Mr Albert Taylor Bledsoe of the University of Mississippi was duly elected.

On the motion of Mr Robertson it was

Resolved that hereafter the salaries of Professors, where it is not otherwise expressly stipulated, shall commence from the time when they shall accept their appointments and shall cease whenever from death resignation or removal they shall cease to perform the duties of their chair (The following should have been inserted before the resolution of Mr Robertson)

On motion of Col Tomlin,

Resolved that the salary of Prof Bledsoe shall commence at the commencement of the next session, which motion was rejected,

Mr Carr presented a petition from Arthur L. Rogers relative to the fee paid by him in the school of Political Economy which was laid on the table.

A communication from the Society of Alumni inclosing a letter from Dr Joynes was received and on motion ordered to be read.

The memorial of the Washington Society was taken up and on motion, Messrs Tomlin and McDonald were appointed a committee to examine into the propriety and expediency of the petition presented in their memorial,

Mr Robertson presented a petition from the Hotel Keepers asking an increase of Board, which was unanimously rejected.

The Rector laid before the Board the following Report.

Upon the passage of the act of the Legislature appropriating $25,000 out of the public Treasury for repairing the Terraces and providing a supply of water at the University, it became very desirable with a view to enable the Board of Visitors to act promptly at the annual meeting, to procure the preliminary information necessary for that purpose in advance of the meeting, But there was no executive committee in being to procure this information. Being deeply impressed with the necessity of making this preparation I addressed myself to the Faculty inviting them to assume the authority of acting in place of the executive committee for this purpose. The Faculty declined to accede to the proposal, and urged the same proposal back upon myself in my capacity of Rector of the Board of Visitors. I consented to take the responsibility under the impression that it might be useful to the Board. With a view to ascertain the best mode & probable cost of procuring a supply of water. I addressed myself in the first instance to Mr E. H. Gill superintendent of the Central rail road and formerly chief engineer of the G R & Ku Co. inviting him to make the requisite survey & examination of the environs of the University and to prepare plans and Estimates. Mr Gills engagements not permitting him to undertake the task he recommended Mr F Eardman of Philadelphia as a very skilful experienced & suitable agent. I applied to Mr Eardman and invited him to the undertaking with a pledge of reasonable compensation for his services. Mr Eardman as you are already apprised, accepted the appointments, came on to the University, and prepared the lucid and very satisfactory Report which is now before you. On the subject of the repairs of the Terraces, I addressed myself for information to Mr Alx. J. Davis architect of New York. It was by the direction of Mr Davis that Mr Nicols came to the University, and prepared the report and estimate-which is upon your table. It is unnecessary for me to enter upon the substance of these reports, my only object in this brief report, being, to state the measures which I assumed the authority to adopt on behalf of the board, and to ask their approval and confirmation. I will only add that I hope the preliminary information thus prepared will be found to be a sufficient basis for immediate action on both the important subjects to which it relates.

On motion of Mr Wise Resolved, that the Rectors report be received and that the measures therein recited, as having been taken by him on behalf of the Board of Visitors be approved and sustained by the Visitors.

***

## June Thursday 29th 1854.

The Board met pursuant to adjournment present the same gentlemen as on yesterday.

On motion of Mr Stevenson it was

Resolved that the reports of F Eardman & J Nicols upon the subject of repairs to the Dormitories, & a supply of water to the University be referred, to a Committee whose duty it shall be, forthwith to report to the Board what action is to be taken upon these subjects. The following gentlemen were appointed a committee under the foregoing resolution, Messrs Wise Miller and Lucas.

On the Motion of Mr McDonald the following resolution was adopted.

Resolved that the Proctor be directed to pay to Mr Eardman the sum of one hundred and ninety one dollars being the balance due on his account for his survey, plans explanations and estimates for introducing water within the precincts of the University.

Col Tomlin offered the following resolution which was adopted

Resolved that the Proctor be and he is hereby directed to pay to James W. Saunders the sum of one hundred dollars the compensation agreed upon, for his services in relation to the Madison devise, Mr Saunders having relinquished his right to the 5 per cent on the value of the Books recovered. A communication from certain Boarding House Keepers without the precincts of the University asking for some provision as to board paid by students was laid on the table.

On motion of Mr McDonald it was.

Resolved that the small room between dormitories No 4 & 6 be appropriated to the use of the Secretary of the Board of Visitors to be used as an office wherein to preserve the papers and records of the Board of Visitors.

Resolved that the Proctor be and he is hereby authorized to have such cases and presses put up in said room as may be necessary to preserve the archives of the Board of Visitors.

Mr Wise from the Committee to report upon the subject of repairs to the Terraces and a supply of water, submitted the following.

"REPORT. That for these objects and these objects alone an act was passed by the Legislature of Va. at its last session, appropriating $25,000 to be applied under the direction and control of the Board of Visitors. The act limits no amount within the sum appropriated to either object, but the sum of $25000 as they ar informed, may be apportioned between the two objects of water works and repairs of terraces. When the act was passed it was based upon conjectural estimates only, and the sum of $25000 was supposed by the Legislature as well as by those who obtained the passage of the act to be sufficient. But it was the design of the Legislature and of the Board of Visitors that both these objects should be accomplished. Since then formal and detailed estimates have been made, and according to reports before the Board the sum of $25,000 is found to be insufficient to complete both these objects, and the questions now are.

1st Shall the Board attempt to execute either or both, without further aid from the Legislature? and

2nd If so, how?

This is exclusive of cost necessary to carry water into the Pavilions Dormitories \&c and exclusive of cost of a site for one of the fountains and of water way therefrom to the grounds of the University. The Committee thinks that the cost of engineering may be dispensed with and that it is not necessary at present or at first to carry the water into the Pavilions. What the cost of the site for a fountain & the water way will be they have no ata for estimating at this time but they suppose, that including every expense, ample water works may be constructed for the sum of $25,000 and that the expense may be reasonably limited to that amount in case the Board shall determine to make contracts therefor. Shall such contracts be ordered?

This will be the balance on hand after paying the item of extraordinary expense for the year of $4,124 the debt due the Farmers Bank.

The only considerable extraordinary balance this committee is aware of is the cost of the additional work on the embankment around the new building. What the probable cost of that will be, they are not informed. But upon the whole, they are confident that with due economy the sum of from $8000 to $12000 may certainly be made available to the construction of the water works by the 1st of June in the year 1856. That time will include the period of the session of the Legislature and will be ample enough for doing all the work of repairs to the terraces and of constructing the water works. Both objects then are within the ways and means of the University. According to any reasonable estimate, and within such time too as, in case of any unforseen cause deminishing the ways and means of the University; will afford full opportunity to apply to the Legislature for relief.

The committee, then, recommends to the Board the following plan of proceeding-

1st Limit the amount to be expended for repairs of terraces to a sum not exceeding $10,000 and direct the Proctor to advertise, (in some of the leading newspapers of Richmond, Washington, Paltimore Philadelphia & New York), for, and receive, proposals for that work for two months, and at the end of that time the Executive Committee shall select from among the bidders the person with whom to make contracts therefor within the sum limited.

2nd To limit the amount to be expended for constructing water works to a sum not exceeding $25,000 and to direct the Proctor, in the same papers to advertise, for and receive proposals for those works for two months and at the end of that time the Executive Committee shall select from among the bidders the person with whom to make contracts therefor within the sum limited.

3rd That for renewall & repair of terraces the Proctor be authorized to pay Contractors in cash the amount necessary to complete the work within the sum limited.

4th That for constructing the water works he be authorized to pay the contractors two fifths of the amount necessary to complete the work within the sum limited in cash, and that for the remaining three fifths of the debt of construction of water works and bonds of the University shall be given in the usual form payable on the 1st day of July 1856. And these terms shall be notified in the advertisements of the Proctor for proposals.

5th That in case there be no proposals either for repairs of terraces or for constructing water works within the time and upon the terms named, then the Proctor shall report the fact to the Proctor, who may in his discretion call a special meeting of the Board.

6th That $2500 for the year ending 1st of June 1855 and $7500 for the year ending 1st of June 1856, be set apart out of the surplus fees, to accrue for those years respectively to meet the cost of those works.

7th That the Proctor shall contract for the repairs of terraces and for construction of water works to be completed in such time as the Executive Committee may prescribe.

8th That in any event, whether the means of the University to be applied as proposed, will probably fail or not to fulfil the contracts for these works and to complete them, the Rector and Board of Visitors should memorialize the Legislature, at its next session, to appropriate to these works a sum sufficient to meet any deficiency of the amount already appropriated.

The Committee cannot omit to urge upon the Board the imminent risk of all the University buildings by fire. They are ensured to the amount only of $50,000 which would not compensate for one tenth of their loss. The water works and the repairs are both works of immediate and pressing necessity and should not be postponed a day for the want of a sum so small as any deficiency can possibly be beyond the amount which the Legislature has already granted. The grant already made by that body shows its approval of the works and authorizes the Board to presume it will grant the amount of any reasonable deficiency, and justifies its undertaking their construction without further delay.

The Proctor, in executing his duties under this discretion of the Board, should be subject, of course, to the supervision and controul of the Executive Committee, and that Committee is instructed to give their earnest and active supervision to these works.
