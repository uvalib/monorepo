The regular monthly meeting of the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia was held on this date in the Office of the President of the University of Virginia at Charlottesville, Virginia, with the following present: The Rector, Barron F. Black, President Colgate W. Darden, Jr., of the University of Virginia; Visitors Barksdale, Emmett, Gay, Gravatt, Mrs. Smith, Wailes, and Wheeler. Absent: Visitors Carrington, Coxe, Howard, Mears, Mr. Smith, and Talbott.

The minutes of the meeting of November 14, 1952, which had been copied and mailed to the members, were approved.

Dr. Robert Henning Webb, former Professor of Greek, who had been on the staff of the University since 1904, died November 2, 1952.

The following resolution was adopted by the Board:

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the resignation of Dr. Louis S. Graham, Instructor in Pathology, be and it is hereby accepted as of June 30, 1953. Dr. Graham has accepted a position on the faculty of the University of Alabama.

The following resolution was adopted by the Board:

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that Mr. and Mrs. Jesse S. Ogden, Assistant Professors of Extension Teaching and Associate Directors of Community Services, be and they are hereby granted leave of absence without pay, to serve as advisors in Africa in community development programs, from January 15, 1953, to May 1, 1953.

The following resolutions were adopted by the Board:

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that Mr. Frederick D. Nichols, Visiting Associate Professor of Art and Architecture, be and he is hereby promoted to Associate Professor of Art and Architecture as of the beginning of the session of 1952-53.

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that Majors Arnold Lynn Hall, Herbert Frank Hartzell, Gerald Rosenthal, and Raymond James Wardrop, Assistant Professors of Military Science and Tactics, be and they are hereby promoted to Associate Professors of Military Science and Tactics, as of December 12, 1952.

The following resolutions were adopted by the Board:

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that Dr. Thomas Harrison Hunter be and he is hereby elected Dean of the School of Medicine and Professor of Internal Medicine, as of February 1, 1953.

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that Dr. Feliks Gross be and he is hereby appointed Visiting Professor of Foreign Affairs for the second semester of the 1952-53 session, at a salary of $3,500.00.

Mr. Black called to the attention of the Board the fact that attendance at the meetings held at Mary Washington College at Fredericksburg, Virginia, was quite low. He thought it important that as many members of the Board be present at meetings as possible. He suggested that the Board consider the possibility of reducing the number of meetings held at Mary Washington College from three per year to two per year.

President Darden said that he had a related matter that he wished the Board to give some consideration to. It was his suggestion that the Board meet only every other month, but for two days. In this way Thursday afternoon and evening could be spent with representatives of the several schools, and the regular business meeting would be held as usual on Friday morning. In this way the Board would become more familiar with the faculties of the several schools and with their problems.

Both of these matters were taken under consideration by the Board.

The Secretary was requested to notify the members of the Board well ahead of this special meeting, so that they might arrange their schedules accordingly. He was also asked to schedule the three groups to be heard at forty-five minute intervals.

The Rector pointed out that the president of the Alumni Association had not sent copies to the various alumni chapters of the various athletic reports, which the Board had referred to the president of the Alumni Association, with the request that they be distributed to the several chapters. Mr. Gay stated that he thought the Board should not take final action on this matter without the various alumni chapters having an opportunity to express themselves. After considerable discussion, The Rector or the President was requested to contact Mr. Faulconer, president of the Alumni Association, to ask him to forward the various athletic reports to each alumni chapter.

Should Mr. Faulconer advise The Rector or the President that he was unable to make such a distribution because of instructions of his Board of Managers, the secretary was requested to forward these reports to the several chapters, with a letter requesting each chapter to communicate its views concerning this matter to the delegates appointed to represent the Alumni Association at the special meeting of the Board of Visitors.

The following resolution was adopted by the Board:

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the Hospital Accounts Committee be and it is hereby authorized to charge off as uncollectible accounts Schedules 323, 326, and 327, aggregating $11,553.90, recommended by them for cancellation.

The President reported that the state auditor had made his report comparing the operations of the University Hospital with the Medical College of Virginia to the Governor, and that the Governor had agreed to write the President as to what deficit he would authorize for the University Hospital for the biennium. Members of the Board asked that copies of the auditor's report be sent to them. The President stated that he felt sure it would be agreeable, but he would have to ask the Governor, as the report was made to him.

The M. C. Hill Funeral Home has purchased this property, which lies across Fry's Spring Road from the University power plant. The President pointed out that the property had been offered to the University of Virginia at a price of $34,000, which we did not have and which he considered too high a price for the property.

Prior to its purchase, Mr. Hill had secured a rezoning of the property to permit the operation of a funeral home. The President pointed out that the University can appeal to the Court to order the zoning board to re-hear the case, if the University feels that its property would be damaged by the opening of a funeral home there. The President stated that he had checked into the matter with the University's Special Counsel, and it was his recommendation that no appeal be made. The Board approved of this recommendation, but no formal resolution was adopted.

The President presented a bill from the Special Counsel for the University for $750.00 plus costs amounting to $172.50 in connection with the hearing by the Wage Stabilization Board, concerning this matter. The Board approved the payment to the Special Counsel for this brief.

President Darden presented a letter from the Trust Department of the Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company of Chicago, requesting authority of the Board for the expenditure of the principal of the trust fund to take care of Mrs. Latimer, whose husband left her a life interest only in the income of the estate. The Board approved the expenditure, subject to advice by our Special Counsel that the University has the authority to enter into such an agreement.

The Law Class of 1902 has established a trust fund to be administered by the First and Merchants National Bank of Richmond. Prior to the establishment of this fund, Mr. Owsley Brown wished to donate to the fund 1000 shares of the Brown-Forman Distillers Corporation. Pending the establishment of the fund, Mr. Brown was advised by the University's Special Counsel to register the securities in the name of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia. The University has been holding these securities pending establishment of the trust, whereupon the following resolution was adopted:

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University that 1000 shares of Junior Preferred Stock of the Brown-Forman Distillers Corporation be transferred to the First and Merchant's National Bank of Richmond as trustee of the Law Class of 1902 Fund.

President Darden presented the following letter from Mr. George O. Ferguson, Registrar:

"Between 1920, when women were first admitted to the University, and the present, three women have been awarded the degree of B. S. in Architecture, thirteen have received the B. S. in Commerce, and five the B. S. in Chemistry. All of these degrees were awarded on the basis of work in the regular session of the College.

"No woman has ever been admitted to the regular session as a candidate for the degree of Bachelor of Arts, and no woman has ever received this degree on the basis of work in the regular session of the College.

"However, between 1925 and 1939, twenty-one women were awarded the degree of Bachelor of Arts as students of the Summer Quarter. The general revision of degree and residence requirements of 1936 has made the award of summer session B. A. degrees impracticable in the last dozen years, although I know of no legislation to prevent the award of these degrees in the summer.

"I believe the following quotation from the current undergraduate catalogue, pages 60-61, adequately represents our practice in admitting women to the College in the last twenty years. 'Women are not admitted to the College of Arts and Sciences as candidates for the degree of Bachelor of Arts, as pre-professional students, or as special students. They may, however, be admitted as candidates for the vocational degrees of Bachelor of Science in Architecture, Bachelor of Science in Chemistry, or Bachelor of Science in Commerce. In order to be admitted as a candidate for a vocational degree, an applicant must be at least twenty years of age, and must have completed, in an accredited college, at least two full years (sixty semester-hours) of academic work with satisfactory grades.' I believe that in a very few instances the President of the University has waived the age requirement for admission to candidacy for a vocational degree.

"Prior to twenty years ago, a few women of the local community were admitted to the College each year as 'special' students, to take certain courses of their choice. They were not admitted as candidates for degrees. There was never any legislation to permit the admission of women as special students. They were admitted by special approval of the President in each case. However, the number of applicants for admission as special students became so great that the practice of admitting any of them was discontinued about 1932.

"I hope this is the information you desire, but if you wish additional details, I think I can probably supply them. Our records of the degrees awarded women since 1920 are quite complete."

The Rector stated that following the resolution of the Board at its November meeting, he had referred this matter of the admission of women to the College of Arts and Sciences to the Attorney General for an opinion, but he was not sure that he had stated correctly the practice as followed by the University in the past. Mr. Ferguson's letter clarified the matter, and he would ask the Attorney General to proceed with his determination.

At this point the secretary left the meeting.

The President reminded the Board that he had stated at the November meeting that he would present to the Board at this meeting a plan to reorganize the control over the financial and business operations of the University and the University Hospital. He wished through these changes to secure better supervision, particularly over the financial affairs of the Hospital. The plan was designed also to relieve him of duties connected with the execution of contracts and other legal instruments. After discussion of the matter, the following resolutions were adopted, subject to approval by the Special Counsel for the University as to the legality of the delegations made by the Board, this action to be effective January 1, 1953:

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the chief financial officer of the University of Virginia shall be the Comptroller, who also shall be the Bursar. In addition to his duties as Bursar, he shall administer the financial affairs of the University and the University Hospital, subject to the direction and control of the President and the Board of Visitors.

**AND, BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED** that the Comptroller shall prescribe business policies and procedures, see that the budget is faithfully adhered to by all departments and activities, shall direct all business affairs of the University of Virginia and the University of Virginia Hospital, and shall discharge such other duties as may be assigned him by the President.

**RESOLVED** that Vincent Shea be and he is hereby elected to the position of Comptroller, as created by the above resolutions.

**RESOLVED** that the Rector, the President, and the Comptroller of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia be and each of said officers is hereby given full and complete authority to execute in the name and on behalf of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, any instrument which may hereafter require the name of this corporation to be signed thereto and the secretary of this corporation is hereby authorized to affix the seal of this corporation to any and all such instruments and to deliver any such instrument or instruments to the party or parties entitled to receive the same.

**RESOLVED** that any one of the following officers, namely, The Rector or President or Comptroller, be and is hereby authorized and empowered to sell, assign and transfer any and all stocks, bonds, evidences of interest or indebtedness, rights, and options, to acquire or to sell the same, and all other securities, corporate or otherwise, standing in the name of, or belonging to, this corporation in any capacity, and be it further

**RESOLVED** that The Rector or the President or the Comptroller be and is hereby fully authorized and empowered to give the assent of this corporation to such mergers, consolidations, agreements for deposit of stock, or for re-organization of any corporation in which The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia may have an interest.

The report prepared by the University in compliance with an act of the 1952 General Assembly, requiring each state institution to list in detail all of its expenditures in connection with its athletic program, was exhibited to the Board prior to its transmittal to the State Budget Office.

Mr. Gay, Chairman of the Finance Committee, stated that the Bursar's Current Fund had been growing very rapidly and now approximated $2,000,000. When it was established in 1947, prior to Mr. Carruther's retirement, only about $300,000 of short term securities were held in this fund. Mr. Gay raised the question of whether this amount of money should be kept in this fund.

He was asked what comprised the source of these funds. He stated that he would have to secure that information from the Bursar of the University.

Mr. Gay stated that $800,000 in short term government notes in this fund had fallen due and that the following investment program had been recommended.

* $200,000 of 2-1/8% notes due 12-1-53
* $200,000 of 2% notes due 12-15-54/53
* $200,000 of 2-5/8% Federal Land Bank

In addition, the Peoples National Bank has offered to take $200,000 on certificates of deposit at 2%, payable thirty days after notice. A resolution was adopted, approving the proposed investment program.

Mr. Gay was asked to investigate the source of the funds held in this account and to present the matter at the next meeting of the Board.

On motion the meeting was then adjourned.
