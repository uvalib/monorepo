The Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia met on this date at 10:00 A.M. in the Office of the President of the University, at Charlottesville, with the following present. The Rector, Frank Talbott, Jr., President Edgar F. Shannon, Jr., and Visitors Berkeley, Bryan, Coxe, Fenwick, Greear, Hartfield, Jones, Lantor, Martin, McWane, Montague, Pollock, Smith, and Wheeler. Absent: Visitors Blanton and Paschall. Chancellor Grellet C. Simpson and Bursar Edgar E. Woodward of Mary Washington College were also present.

The minutes of the meeting of 7 October 1959, previously distributed, were approved.

The President presented a proposed meeting schedule for 1960 which, he explained, would depart from the regular "second Saturday" dates in February and June. The meeting date of 20 February 1960, rather than 13 February 1960, was suggested in order to permit President Shannon and Chancellor Simpson to attend the meeting on 13 February 1960 of the Association of Virginia Colleges of which Mr. Simpson is President. The recommendation to change the Annual Meeting date in June from Saturday, 11 June, to Friday, 10 June, was made in order to permit the President to carry out his annual assignments on the Saturday of Finals to speak to the Alumni Association and to preside over the meeting of the General Faculty at noon at which time all degrees are approved.

The following resolution was adopted:

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the dates for the regular meetings of the Board of Visitors during 1960 shall be as follows:\
(1) 20 February 1960,\
(2) 9 April 1960 (Fredericksburg),\
(3) 10 June 1960 (Annual Meeting),\
(4) 8 October 1960, and\
(5) 10 December 1960.

The Rector proposed, and the Board unanimously approved, the extension of an invitation to the three new members of the Board, whose appointments were recently announced by the Governor, to attend the next meeting of the Board on 20 February 1960. The Secretary was instructed to extend such an invitation to the three new members, Messrs. William M. Camp, Hunter Faulconer, and Lawrence Lewis, Jr.

The President read a letter from Visitor Blanton who explained that he had been ill and would therefore be unable to attend the meeting of the Board. He stated that he was improving, however, and hoped to be able to attend the next meeting of the Board. There was a unanimous expression of hope that Mr. Blanton would be able to attend.

The President read a letter from Mrs. Horace A. Gray, expressing her gratification for the resolution adopted by the Board on 14 February 1959 expressing the Board's thanks for the many services to the Board of her late son and former Board member, Mr. Horace A. Gray, Jr.

Mr. John Stacey, Director of the University Hospital, and Mr. Vincent Shea, Comptroller, appeared before the Board and reported on the status of the uncollectible accounts at the University Hospital and the measures that have been and are being taken to assure maximum collection. It was pointed out that the University Hospital serves every city and county in the State and that many of the patients, while medically indigent, are not on the public welfare rolls and therefore do not have outside funds available for payment. Also, those persons available for assistance under the State-Local Hospitalization Program receive services for which, in many cases, compensation is not obtained because of the unwillingness of the counties and cities, or at least many of them, to match State funds. This arises out of the reluctance of a number of cities and counties to assume the full burden of the localities part of the State-Local Hospitalization Program. The discussion concluded with the note that the University as a major medical center needs teaching material which the indigent cases provide.

The following resolution was adopted:

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the Hospital Accounts Committee be and it is hereby authorized to charge off as uncollectible accounts Schedules 879, 880, 883, 884, 886, 889, and 890, aggregating $72,952.50, as recommended by it, consisting of the following.

Mr. Vincent Shea, Comptroller, reported on the status of all projects under construction at the University and the branch colleges as of 11 December 1959. His report covered the aero-mechanical engineering building, atomic reactor, multi-story hospital, medical research building, Garrett Hall, President's House, Life Science Building, Clinch Valley College Gymnasium, George Mason College, and the addition to Clark Hall. Mr. Shea's detailed report was ordered to be filed with the Secretary.

The President reported on the action of the faculty of the College of Arts and Sciences on 28 October 1959 denying an academic degree to Mr. Peter H. Salmon. He explained that Mr. Salmon had admitted last Spring that he had obtained University stationery carrying the imprint of the Housing Director and had signed the Housing Director's name to a letter to the parents of a student asking that a certain debt be paid. The case had been referred to the Honor Committee which, although taking action to clear Mr. Salmon of any violation of the Honor Code, had explained by letter that it did not believe that its action precluded further action by the faculty.

Mr. Vincent Shea, Comptroller, reported on the program of Federal research contracts and grants and the methods by which they were handled. He explained that Federal grants carried a standard 15 percent of the total cost for overhead charges but that the overhead for Federal contracts was determined by a formula which in the case of the University amounted to approximately 39 percent of the payments for salaries and wages. He explained further that colleges and Universities participating in this Program were incurring overhead costs greater than that allowed under either Federal grants or contracts. Mr. Shea's report was ordered to be filed with the Secretary.

The President reported that he had underway a thorough study of the whole admissions program including the organizational structure at the University for the handling of admissions. He added that he hoped to be able to give the Board a full report at its next meeting in February 1960.

The President reported on the current stage of the negotiations with the Garden Club of Virginia for their participation in the restoration of the East Lawn Gardens. He stated that restoring the Gardens according to the original Maverick Plan would make it necessary to relocate the road now running through the middle of the Gardens. He was pleased to be able to report that Governor Almond, in a letter from the Director of the Budget dated 1 December 1959, had approved the expenditure of the necessary amount of money to relocate the road. The sum required, the President explained, would come from the Governor's funds and would not be taken from the capital outlay funds of the University. He concluded his report by stating that the project could now be presented for approval to the appropriate authorities and work could then get underway on the restoration which would result in an expenditure of approximately $125,000 by the Garden Club of Virginia.

The President reported that he had been approached by Remington-Rand Univac, a division of Sperry-Rand Corporation, with a proposal to establish at the University a computer center and training school to serve the Southern Region of Remington-Rand Univac. This would be one of four regional training centers with the others serving the Eastern, Midwestern, and Western Regions. The basic proposal included the installation of a Univac solid-state tape 80 or 90 computing system, together with a complete complement of additional equipment. In return for the space to be used for the training center staff, the University would obtain for its exclusive use a minimum period of 176 daytime hours per month on the computer. In addition to the 1,500 square feet necessary to house the equipment, Remington-Rand Univac would require three large classrooms to accommodate a class of 25 on a 12-hour per day, 6-day a week basis, and office space for 4 instructors and a regional manager. In addition, rooms and meals for approximately 40 male employees, to be paid for by Remington-Rand Univac, would be necessary.

The President explained that the University's efforts to obtain a scientific calculator from the National Science Foundation had been unsuccessful primarily because of lack of experience in computer operation. While the use of the solid-state computer proposed by Remington-Rand Univac would be limited so far as scientific work was concerned, the President stated that some scientific research could be conducted and that, in addition, the computer could be used for training purposes by the Graduate School of Business Administration and the School of Commerce. It could also be employed, he concluded, by the staff of the Comptroller in carrying on accounting work and other types of punch card operations which would lessen the cost of renting equipment from another company.

After considerable discussion, the following resolution was adopted:

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the President be and he is hereby authorized to enter into a contract with Remington-Rand Univac for the establishment at the University of a computer center and training school, subject to final review by the Executive Committee and the General Counsel of the University and the approval of the Governor.

The following resolution was adopted:

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the occupant of the endowed professorship in Biology, which endowment was provided by a distinguished alumnus of this University, shall carry the title of Lewis and Clark Professor of Biology.

The following resolution was adopted:

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the building heretofore referred to as the naval armory is hereby named Halsey Hall in honor of the late Fleet Admiral, William F. Halsey.

The President noted that the Comptroller in his report earlier in the meeting had announced that the Bursar and the Registrar would shortly move into the building now known as the Commons and that it was therefore necessary to select a new name for the building. He proposed that the building should be called Garrett Hall as a tribute to Alexander Garrett, the first person to hold the office of Bursar of the University, an office which he occupied from 1825 to 1850.

The following resolution was adopted:

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the building heretofore referred to as the Commons is hereby named Garrett Hall in honor of the first Bursar of the University, Mr. Alexander Garrett.

The President reported on past practice with respect to the naming of the University buildings for living persons. He noted that, of a total of 50 buildings, 6 were named for living persons. Of these six buildings, only one was named for a living person who was not its donor. Some of the six buildings, however, were named for an ancestor who carried the same name as his descendant. The President concluded his report by noting that there was precedent for naming a building after a living person.

The President reported that the Madison Hall Lease had been signed by him on 28 November 1959 in accordance with the instructions of the Board given at its meeting on 7 October 1959.

The following resolution was adopted:

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the resignation of Miss June Gentry, Instructor in Physical Education, effective as of 1 February 1960, be and it is hereby accepted.

The Chancellor recalled to the attention of the Board the adoption of a resolution on 14 February 1959 authorizing the College to accept the permanent trusteeship of the Gari Melchers Memorial located on the Belmont property from the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts. He stated that the bill which was necessary for the General Assembly to pass had been reviewed by Mr. Fielding L. Williams, Attorney for the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts. The proposed bill had also been reviewed by Mr. C. Venable Minor, General Counsel of the University, who had made certain suggestions for revision which had been adopted. Arrangements were now being made to have the bill introduced in the Legislature. In addition, it will be necessary to file an action in the Circuit Court of the City of Richmond to secure the approval of the transfer after the General Assembly has acted.

The bill and the proposed procedure were approved by the Board.

The Rector reported that he and Visitors Blanton and Fenwick, in accordance with the instructions of the Board at its meeting on 7 October 1959, had called on the Governor with respect to the contract with the Natural Gas Service Company of Fredericksburg and had secured satisfactory action. In the meantime, however, certain difficulties had arisen with respect to the provision of service by the Natural Gas Service Company. Because of these difficulties, the Rector reported that he had asked the Chancellor of Mary Washington College to defer entering into a contract until the situation had been stabilized.

The following resolution was adopted:

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that Mary Washington College be and it is hereby authorized to charge off the account of Camille Merriman Lloyd as uncollectible in the amount of $155.

The Chancellor proposed that the new dormitory which was occupied in September 1959 be named after Mrs. Nina Gookin Bushnell who served as Dean of Women from September 1921 to September 1950. He stated that the naming of the dormitory for Mrs. Bushnell would be a tribute to a person who had contributed immeasurably to the growth and development of the College.

The following resolution was adopted:

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the new dormitory at Mary Washington College, occupied in September 1959, be and it is hereby named Nina Gookin Bushnell Hall.

The President announced the receipt of a letter from Mr. Colgate W. Darden, Jr., dated 7 December 1959, stating that he and Mrs. Darden had deeded to The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia the Bolling property, approximately 80 acres in size, which lies northeast of the existing property at Clinch Valley College.

With the unanimous approval and the grateful thanks of the Visitors present, the following resolution was adopted:

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the unrestricted gift to The Rector and Visitors of the Bolling property adjacent to Clinch Valley College by Mr. and Mrs. Colgate W. Darden, Jr. is hereby accepted, subject to the approval of the Governor.

The following resolution was adopted:

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the Northern Virginia Branch College, heretofore established on a site adjacent to the Town of Fairfax, is hereby named George Mason College of the University of Virginia.

The following resolution was adopted:

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that Mr. Joseph H. Harrison be and he is hereby re-elected Associate Professor of History, for one year, as of 1 September 1959.

The President reported that the architects for the Academic building, Joseph H. Saunders, Jr. and Associates, had informed him that an undeveloped tract of approximately 100 acres adjacent to the George Mason College site was available. The tract might be developed in an undesirable manner if not obtained. Mr. Fenwick stated that he had talked with the officials of the Town of Fairfax about this matter and that the conversations would continue.

The President reported the following gifts and grants:

On motion, the meeting was then adjourned.
