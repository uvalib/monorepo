The Board of Visitors met here this 8th day of August 1890 in pursuance of adjournment on the 28th day of June last.

Present, W. C. N. Randolph, Rector, and Messrs Gordon, Kean, McCormick, Parrish & Patteson of the Visitors.

The Board was called to order by the Rector, who announced that the first business in order was to receive and consider the report of the special Committee appointed at the meeting of the Board on the 28th day of June last, upon the proposed changes in the Law School, whereupon Mr Parrish, the Chairman of the Committee, submitted its report which was read, and of which the following is a copy:

To the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia.

Gentlemen. The undersigned Committee to which was referred the matter of establishing a new chair in the Law Department beg leave to report that after maturely considering the subject and after a full interview with Profr Minor and also with Profr Gilmore they are constrained to believe that the establishment of such a chair at present will not promote the interests of the University but will most probably be detrimental to those interests.

We find that a large number of the law students come to the University in the hope of completing the course in one year, many of them being pecuniarily able to attend one session only.

While the course contemplates two sessions, it is so arranged that diligent students, with fair antecedent preparation, can and do graduate in one session.

If a new chair is added we are satisfied that it will be impossible for a student to complete the course in one session, no matter what his previous preparation may be, and we believe that the denial of such a possibility would tend to diminish seriously the number of law students. We further believe that the elementary principles of Corporation Law, which would be assigned to the new chair if established, are ably and thoroughly treated in the first volume of Mr Minor's Institutes, and that, with this foundation, the lectures of Mr Minor, with references to other text writers, give to students excellent opportunities of becoming well grounded in these principles.

The correspondence between Mr Minor and our chairman is filed herewith.

After consideration of the report Mr Gordon moved that it be accepted and approved which was seconded and a vote was taken by ayes & noes and resulted in favor of the motion by a vote of 5 to one—Mr Patteson voting in the negative, and requested to be so recorded.

The following resolutions were adopted:

Resolved, that the salary of Henry Martin, Janitor, be increased to Twenty five dollars per month dating from August 1st 1890.

Resolved, that the Proctor be authorized to expend not exceeding Two Hundred dollars in the erection at a suitable place of a proper shelter for the fire engine, ladder and other fire apparatus, to replace the shelter now used, to which has been appropriated to use in connection with Profr Thornton's shops.

A communication was received from Dr Dabney upon which the following action was taken=

The Board acknowledges receipt of Dr W. C. Dabney's communication of 6th inst. and the Board keeping in view that, under all circumstances, the professor owes his first and chief duties to the University, doth resolve that leave be granted to Dr W. C. Dabney to engage in the practice of his profession for one year to such an extent only as will not interfere with the duties of his chair.

Resolved, that hereafter, all meetings of the Board of Visitors (unless a different hour be specified) shall be begun at Eleven o'clock on the first day of each meeting.

It having been suggested to the Board of Visitors (not by or on behalf of Profr Mallet) that with the permission of the Board, he may be able to give private instruction in the elements of chemistry to one or more young ladies.

Resolved, that the consent of the Board is hereby given to Profr Mallet, to give private instruction in Chemistry to one or more young ladies, provided such engagement shall in no way interfere with his duties in the University.

Resolved, that the Rector & Mr Gordon be authorized to contract with Mr W. D. Dabney, or some other suitable person, for the codification of the University Laws, provided that the expense incurred shall not exceed Three hundred dollars.

Resolved, that the Executive Committee of this Board is hereby authorized to petition the Legislature of Virginia to give the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia authority to commute the Austin Legacy, on such terms as they deem proper.

Resolved, that the Professor of Applied Mathematics be authorized to charge against the account of students in that school the actual cost of the materials consumed by them in the Engineering Laboratory.

Resolved, that the Proctor be authorized to credit the account of the school of Applied Mathematics with the tuition fees of all students in that school above the number of thirty

Resolved, that the recommendation of the Faculty for the establishment in the School of Historical Science of a course of lectures on English and American History be approved.

Resolved, that the sum of six hundred dollars be appropriated to the payment of police as recommended by the Faculty

Resolved, that the sum of One hundred and fifty dollars be appropriated to the maintenance of the joint water supply of the University and the City of Charlottesville as recommended by the Faculty.

At this point in the proceedings, Judge Watts arrived and occupied his seat as a Visitor.

On motion the question of appointing an assistant to Profr John B. Minor was considered, after which the following was adopted as the action of the Board in the premises by a vote of 6 in favor to one against it viz Mr Patteson, who asked to be so recorded.

The Board having invited Profr Minor, at a time when his health was in precarious condition, to nominate an assistant professor in the School of Common and Statute Law and being of opinion that in as much as Professor Minor's health has been restored, he is not at present in need of the character of assistance contemplated at the time the said invitation was given, and being further of opinion that some relief to Profr Minor in the drudgery of his exacting work would tend to prolong his usefulness, it is resolved that without passing upon the nomination made by Profr Minor, (viz of his son John B. Minor, Jr.) the matter be referred back to him with authority to appoint for the term of one year at a salary of Eight hundred dollars, either John B. Minor, Jr. or such other person as he may select, whose duties shall be to do such clerical and other work as Profr Minor may think will tend most to relieve him.

The Committee on Health etc. submitted its report which is as follows:

To the Hon. Rector and Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia.

Your Committee on health beg to report that they find the sanitary condition of the University of Virginia to be good. We beg to recommend (1st), that all of the boarding houses outside of the University precincts be required to obtain from the Chairman of the Faculty a license to keep students and we would further suggest that said license be granted only upon such sanitary inspection as may be deemed necessary by the Health Committee. (2nd) We recommend that the small pond behind the chapel be draned and filled with earth. As the supply of water is somewhat defective we recommend that the water mains and water pipes be placed at an early date in proper order.

Damm Patteson, Chairman Legh R. Watts.

On motion the report was read and thereafter on motion received—and the following three resolutions in relation to the recommendations of the report were adopted

1\. Resolved, in pursuance of the recommendation of the Faculty, and the report of the Committee on health, that all the boarding houses outside of the limits of the University, be required, as a condition for having any student as a boarder, to obtain from the Chairman of the Faculty, a license to be issued only upon the recommendation after inspection of the premises, of the Health Committee of the Faculty.

2\. Resolved, that the Proctor be instructed to cause the small pond below the Chappel to be drained, and filled with earth, to the proper grade, as soon as the funds of the University will justify it.

3\. Resolved, that the Executive Committee be instructed to cause the failure in the water supply to be investigated and as far as practicable to be corrected at an early day.

A communication was received from the Ladies of the Chapel Aid Society of the University requesting the Board to make provision for paving the approaches to the new Chappel. On motion the petition was ordered to be laid on the table for consideration at the next meeting of the Board.
