**NCAA Orientation**

Board members are athletic boosters as defined by the NCAA. Mr. Jason Baum, Associate Athletics Director for Governance and Regulatory Affairs gave the board a brief tutorial on the obligations of members of the Board. He said the ultimate responsibility for athletics sits with the president of the institution. Boosters retain booster status forever. Boosters cannot make recruiting contact with recruits or prospective student athletes, and they may not provide “extra benefits” to student athletes or their families. Examples of extra benefits are giving a loan or a car to a student athlete. Items that are given to everyone, not just student athletes, are fine. The Rector said if a member has questions about a particular situation, the member should contact the athletics compliance office before acting.

Student athletes who are employed by a booster must perform the work for which they are compensated, and the compensation must be commensurate with the work they perform; “pay for play” is not permitted. Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) opportunities are allowed in Virginia, but again “pay for play” and recruiting inducements are not permitted. UVA itself cannot compensate student athletes for NIL.

\# # #

**ACC Certification**

The ACC requires the board chairs and chancellors/presidents/CEOs of member schools to certify that the board has delegated authority to the chancellor/president/CEO to operate the athletics program. Participation in the ACC conference is contingent on signing and returning the certification. The Rector read the certification to the Board. The certification is attached to these Minutes.

**Remarks by the Rector**

Rector Hardie welcomed the new members to the Board Room and to the annual meeting: Paul Manning; John Nau; Rachel Sheridan; and Paul Harris, as well as Tish Jennings, the faculty representative. Lillian Rojas, student representative, began her service June 1. He said he was pleased to have the new members on the board and hoped and expected that they will work collegially with the returning members as well as leadership to lead this great institution to further its important missions of teaching, research, service, and patient care.

The Rector touched briefly on the letter Jim Ryan, Hamza Aziz, and he issued to the community the week before. He said for the community of trust to survive and thrive, we must have buy-in and participation by all – faculty, staff, students, and members of the Board of Visitors. The Honor Code and system of student self-governance set UVA apart. When UVA graduates go out in the world, they quickly realize that the leadership skills they developed as students prepare them to be critical thinkers and decision makers throughout their lives.

Rector Hardie informed the board there would be no Faculty Senate report at this meeting because of Chair Michael Kennedy’s absence. He will present at the December meeting.

Ms. Lillian Rojas, student representative to the Board, gave the following remarks. She was joined by the chair of the Honor Committee, Hamza Aziz. After their prepared remarks, Visitors had the opportunity to ask questions about the Honor System.

**Remarks by the Student Representative and by the Honor Committee Chair**

Good morning everyone and happy fall! I am delighted to share that the overall atmosphere here on grounds has been extremely positive, as students are very excited for this year and engagements across grounds are beginning to take off. I have had the chance to talk to several first-year students who have expressed to me how welcoming their first month has been in becoming acquainted with the University and adjusting to college life. As well, I would like to quickly say happy first day of Hispanic Heritage Month. 

Now, as many of you know, student self-governance is an essential and unique aspect of the UVA student experience. I am excited to talk to you about the University’s Honor system today, which rests on this foundational value. 

This past spring, students voted to institute a multi-sanction Honor system. An excellent display of student self-governance in action, this referendum enabled students to identify an issue, propose a change, pass it, and work to implement it. When talking to students, it became clear that this Honor referendum empowered them to take a direct role in student self-governance. Many saw themselves as making a meaningful impact here at UVA. Honor again became and remains an active topic of discussion across Grounds, from conversations in classrooms to flyers sent out in GroupeMes. We, as students, are committed to the ideal that is honor, and through this commitment, we voted to reform the system. Honor is UVA. It represents our values as UVA students and sets this University apart. 

To those points, I have invited the Honor Chair, Mr. Hamza Aziz, to speak more on this institution and its impact here at the University.

  
Hamza Aziz: 

Hello, everyone. 

Thank you, Lillian, for sharing your valuable time, and to the Board for having me. As Lillian mentioned, my name is Hamza Aziz, and I'm a fourth-year student in the College of Arts & Sciences. I have the distinct privilege of serving as the Chair of the Honor Committee for its 2023-24 term. 

Firstly, I’d like to recognize the support that Lillian and I feel from this Board, in this room, and outside of it. Your advocacy and dedication – visible or unseen – to our Honor System and the Community of Trust it fosters is sincerely heard and felt by the Honor Committee and students across Grounds. On their behalf, I’d like to thank each of you for your absolute commitment to our remarkable custom and tradition of Honor.

As Rector Hardie and President Ryan shared in our University-wide reminder last week, the University of Virginia Honor System is one of the most defining aspects of a UVA education, instilling an enduring ethos in students that lasts with them far beyond their time on Grounds. It is an 181-year-old tradition that students, faculty, and administrators alike carry on. 

When I spoke to incoming first-year students throughout orientation sessions this summer, I asked them to consider a simple question: How _do_ traditions last? Some traditions have diminished over time, so what is a characteristic of our conventions of Honor and others that have allowed them to persist? What we landed on was simple: the traditions that last have evolved. They’ve evolved to reflect the needs, demands, and aspirations of the generations of UVA students who embrace them. 

We can see this evolution throughout Honor’s history - the need to replace an ad-hoc group of students with a formal Committee, the demands of adjusting what constitutes an Honor offense, and the aspirations to allow students to take accountability within the Honor System. These are just a few _key_ highlights of the System’s continuous evolution, and we are lucky enough to witness and be a part of another this year. 

I'm grateful to be here to provide a birds-eye view of its most recent evolution and share the Honor System's status with you. 

The Spring 2023 multi-sanction referendum to the Honor Constitution replaced a single sanction for committing an Honor offense with multiple sanctions uniquely tailored to the offense and student. To contextualize this reform and its motivation: In the Spring of 2022, students voted to modify Honor’s single-sanction of expulsion to a single-sanction of a two-semester suspension. This reform was far from perfect, as its authors admitted. Instead, it was a stepping stone towards a better and stronger future for the Honor System. 

Only weeks after this modified system was enacted last year, the Honor Committee set its sights and committed to a further necessary reform: implementing a multi-sanction case system. And they were successful. In early Spring, just a few months ago, these students placed a multi-sanction Constitution on the ballot for a University-wide vote. With the momentum from last year’s referendum still present, nearly 89% of the student body voted ‘yes’ on this referendum, and the Honor System underwent its next significant evolution. On July 1st, the multi-sanction system went into effect. 

The Honor System always has and continues to foster our Community of Trust, though now in an expanded way. 

At the heart of a restorative, multi-sanction Honor System lies the fundamental belief that sanctions can be more than merely punitive tools. Rather, they can serve as powerful opportunities to _cultivate_ honor and integrity in students who have broken their commitment to these values – through education and amends while reinstating higher-tier sanctions. I know I can speak for the Honor Committee and other students, and we are excited to have arrived at this realization and capability. 

The Honor Committee has worked hard to implement the system successfully. Unlike usual, we continued to meet regularly over the summer to craft its supporting Bylaws, with the guidance of our Student Affairs advisors, counsel, and community members across Grounds. The Bylaws outline our policies and procedures, which I would be happy to more minutely discuss with any member. We created Sanctioning Guidelines to assist representatives in carrying out the sanctioning phase of the Honor case process. We extensively re-trained our internal support officer pools, who we rely on to implement and actualize the system. We updated our outreach materials and strategies to educate the University community about the reforms. 

And, we are cognizant of the work ahead of us and dedicated to it. Over the next seven months, the Committee will continue to pursue various objectives. We’re diligently monitoring the implementation of the multi-sanction system. We’re exploring and tackling relatively novel subjects for Honor, like generative AI in the classroom and community engagement as a sanction. We’re working to ensure that students, faculty, and other community members – past and present – understand the most recent evolution, and, more importantly, understand what remains the same: our shared commitment to living honorably. 

At times, it seems that Honor is synonymous with its case process; however, as we know, it is so much more. It is a moral aspiration that sets the University and its students apart. 

And as Lillian mentioned, the evolution in Honor proves just how powerful the tool of student self-governance can be. Through this tool, students themselves have taken ownership and reinvigorated a commitment to the same ideal of honor many of you made during your time as a Virginia student. 

Having been involved with the Honor Committee’s work since I stepped onto Grounds about three years ago, it was incredibly, incredibly clear: change was in the air. The perpetual and active conversations that surround our joint project of Honor don’t imperil the system but reflect its enduring vitality and health. To me, reforms of recent years underscore a remarkable truth about our Honor System: It is capable of change and made stronger by them.

We’ve heard alumni say time and time again, and now many more current students will proudly say too: Honor is UVA. 

Thank you.

**Discussion with University Leadership**

At 1:15 p.m., the Board resumed the meeting of the Full Board.

Rector Hardie introduced Dr. Clayton Rose, former president of Bowdoin College and a faculty member at the Harvard Business School, to lead a discussion on best practices in higher education governance.

Dr. Rose offered thoughts based on his experiences as a college president, chair of nonprofit boards, and as a student of board governance.

He said the president’s role is one of the hardest leadership roles in the country, and perhaps in the world. The comment is from Admiral McRaven. This is a time to recognize that at this time talent is not stepping forward for these kinds of leadership roles, but stepping back.

The most successful organizations have strong leaders with strong boards who support the leaders. Board members play an important role, but that role is different from the president’s role. The fiduciary duties Board members have of candor, care, and loyalty, are not about individuals but about a single unit. Best practice is to focus on the University’s interests.

The Board’s most important responsibility is the selection of a president. Next is oversight, which includes asking questions. The Board’s job is to ask questions about strategic priorities and financial management, and to provide advice and engagement in a crisis. Related to that is reputation: the Board has the responsibility of promoting and enhancing reputation and ensuring leadership is protecting the reputation of the university.

Additionally, Boards should provide advice on the president’s priorities, and be cheerleaders externally. Boards don’t manage—they stay out of the weeds. They stay connected consistently over time on the strategic priorities which tend to have a long arc.

Trustees listen well to others, acknowledge different points of view, and then coalesce around a decision when it is made.

Dr. Rose gave examples of challenges facing boards. The first was around tuition setting during the pandemic when students were not on campus. He said at Bowdoin, they considered lowering tuition even though expenses had increased. There was robust discussion among the board members and leadership, the president made a formal recommendation, and then the board made a decision, and everyone got behind the decision.

Second example: question of who the football coach should be is not a board-level decision, but a conversation around what defines excellence in our athletics program is properly a Board-level topic.

Third example: debating and discussing whether the budget is consistent with strategic priorities should be considered by the board, but a line-item review of the budget would not be appropriately within the realm of the board.

Fourth example: granting faculty tenure is ultimately a board decision, but the Board’s role is to ensure the tenure process is laid out and followed. It is not the board’s purview to sit in judgement on the academic credentials of individual faculty.

Dr. Rose engaged in a discussion with members of the Board. He said the strategic direction of the University is fair game for Board consideration. The Board should engage in good faith listening and discussion and when a decision is taken, the Board should stand behind the decision. He said not every individual point of view can or will prevail. If folks are only interested in their own point of view and they are not willing to engage in a thoughtful process with their colleagues, this will result in a dysfunctional board.

A member raised the question of when the president should bring issues to the board—were there guidelines? Dr. Rose said in some situations the trustees and the president may have different views and it can be a gray area—it is not always clear. He said when he was president, he often discussed with the board chair whether the issue was one that should be brought to the board.

Another question was raised about the tension between excellence and affordability. Dr. Rose wondered if there was a false dichotomy between excellence and affordability and maybe there was a way to do both. He said this type of discussion is appropriate for a board to engage in.

In response to a question about university legal counsel and whether the client is the board or the president, Dr. Rose suggested that in his experience counsel has been able in most instances to represent the institution, i.e. both the board and the administration. In unusual circumstances, the board may need its own counsel on an issue, but if that was the case at every meeting, he would consider that the definition of a dysfunctional board.

The Board and Dr. Rose discussed at length the differences between roles of the president/leadership and trustees. Dr. Rose said the president has responsibility for day-to-day management and longer- term operation of the enterprise. Trustees advise, monitor, select the president, and question. There is an ongoing tension because of points of view and performance, and it is never settled ground. Historically, this has been a very successful model of overseeing the long-term health, viability, and reputation of great institutions.

Another topic of discussion was the public mission of UVA and other public institutions and how that adds a layer of complexity to the concept of fiduciary responsibility.

**Final Session**

Mr. Hardie reminded the members of the Board that the action items were presented in committee except as otherwise stated.

President Ryan read the titles of the action items. Mr. Hardie asked for a motion to approve and a second and stated that anyone who wished to abstain from voting on any item, or to vote in the negative, should do so at this time by identifying the item or items.

University of Virginia Compliance Charter

Purpose:
--------

The University of Virginia's compliance function supports the University’s fundamental commitment to the highest standards of ethics, integrity, and lawful conduct by promoting adherence to all applicable federal, state, and local laws, regulations, as well as standards and internal policies and protocols.

Institutional compliance promotes greater coordination of and consistency among individual University compliance programs, covering a wide variety of requirements related to academics, athletics, human resources, research, health care, information technology, and numerous administrative functions. The University established a compliance program to prevent, detect, and respond appropriately to potential violations of law and to foster a corporate culture that promotes integrity and ethical behaviors in all matters relating to compliance.

Authority:
----------

The Assistant Vice President for Compliance, with strict accountability for confidentiality and safeguarding of records and information, is authorized to have full, free, and unrestricted access to any and all of the University’s records, physical properties, and personnel pertinent to carrying out compliance investigations, and to review and monitor compliance issues. All employees are requested to assist the compliance function in fulfilling its roles and responsibilities.

Organization:
-------------

The Assistant Vice President for Compliance oversees institutional compliance activities and programs to confirm they are reasonably designed, implemented, communicated, and enforced. To facilitate effective oversight, the Assistant Vice President for Compliance coordinates and chairs the Compliance Network, a University-wide network of functional compliance officers. The Compliance Network is responsible for developing appropriate compliance policies and procedures, providing education on compliance risks, maintaining related documentation, recommending corrective actions, submitting required reports, keeping the appropriate University constituencies informed of compliance issues, and updating senior management and the University community on recent developments.

The Assistant Vice President for Compliance works closely with the compliance managers at UVA Health and the University’s College at Wise to determine which compliance requirements will be handled jointly and which will be managed separately.

Functional areas reporting to the Assistant Vice President include:

*   Records and Information Management – leads the University's effort to manage, retain, and dispose of university records in compliance with all regulations and policies; delivers training and guidance on responsible records management including the disposal of records eligible for destruction.
*   Privacy - leads the University's effort to safeguard all personally identifiable information (PII) collected, used, disseminated, and stored by the University; develops and maintains privacy policies and procedures, and provides training and consultation on requirements.

The Assistant Vice President for Compliance reports to the Chief Audit Executive. The Chief Audit Executive reports functionally to the ACR Committee chairman, and administratively (day-to-day operations) to the Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.

The Audit, Compliance, and Risk (ACR) Committee will:

*   Approve the Compliance Charter and periodically reassess it for continued relevance.
*   Receive communications from the Assistant Vice President for Compliance regarding compliance strategies, plans, and other relevant matters.
*   Make appropriate inquiries of management and the Assistant Vice President for Compliance to determine whether all compliance efforts have the necessary resources and scope.
*   Support leadership for the compliance program by promoting and supporting a University-wide culture of ethical and lawful conduct.

The Assistant Vice President for Compliance will communicate and interact directly with the Chair of the ACR Committee, including in executive sessions and between committee meetings as appropriate to ensure direct access to the board.

Professional Standards
----------------------

The compliance function’s objective is to establish and promote standards that meet the U.S. Federal Sentencing Guidelines' criteria for an effective compliance program.

1.  Compliance standards and procedures to prevent and detect criminal activity;
2.  Oversight by high-level personnel, with periodic reporting to the board from individuals with operational responsibility;
3.  Due care in delegating substantial discretionary authority;
4.  Effective communication and training to all levels of employees;
5.  Systems for monitoring, auditing and reporting suspected wrong-doing without fear of reprisal and for periodically evaluating the effectiveness of the compliance and ethics programs;
6.  Consistent enforcement of compliance standards including disciplinary mechanisms and appropriate incentives to perform in accordance with the compliance and ethics program; and
7.  Reasonable steps to respond to and prevent further similar offenses upon detection of a violation.

In addition, the Medical Center’s compliance program also follows the program elements defined in the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of the Inspector General’s “Compliance Program Guidance for Hospitals”.

Responsibilities:
-----------------

Members of the University community will:

*   Monitor compliance in their specific functional areas;
*   Adhere to the University’s policies;
*   Implement corrective action as necessary, arising from compliance reviews and/or investigations.
*   Report all violations of law or University policy, without fear of retaliation for reports made in good faith.
*   Cooperate with all investigations into suspected wrongdoing.

The role of the Assistant Vice President for Compliance is to remain well-informed on the content and operation of the institutional compliance and ethics program in order to exercise reasonable oversight of the effectiveness of the program, including:

1.  _Standards of Conduct/Policies and Procedures:_ confirming that the University implements policies, procedures, training programs, and internal control systems that are reasonably capable of reducing misconduct and that comply with relevant regulatory requirements.
2.  _Compliance Roles and Responsibilities_: establishing clear roles and responsibilities across the University.
3.  _Compliance Oversight__:_ exercising reasonable oversight over compliance activities by requesting and receiving updates from compliance officers.
4.  _Reporting and Investigative Mechanisms_: confirming that the University maintains an effective mechanism for stakeholders to report or seek guidance regarding potential or actual wrongdoing.
5.  _Correction and Prevention_: working with the University’s senior leadership to promote and enforce compliance through appropriate incentives and disciplinary measures.
6.  _Culture of Integrity and Compliance_: promoting the University’s culture of integrity and compliance, through communication of compliance standards and policies.

Interaction with Audit and Enterprise Risk Management:
------------------------------------------------------

The Assistant Vice President for Compliance will work closely with colleagues in the Office of Audit and Compliance to assess and prioritize which compliance areas present the greatest risk and need for attention, based on regulatory environment and complexity, overlap with University strategic plans, and consequences of non-compliance. Managers with responsibility for specific areas of compliance will evaluate their individual compliance efforts against a list of criteria necessary to have an effective compliance program.

The Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program is designed to identify and mitigate key institutional risks. For example, one type of risk to be considered is legal and regulatory compliance risk. The regular review of compliance requirements may highlight an emerging institutional risk. Conversely, the identification of key institutional risks may guide the work of the compliance function and initiate a mitigation strategy that the University may use to address a given risk.
