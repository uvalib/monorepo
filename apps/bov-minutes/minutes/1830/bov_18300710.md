Resolved, That the Board perceives with regret that any professor should regard himself at liberty to alter or neglect the hour for the commencement of his lecture, or to direct the bell to be rung at any other time than that prescribed by the Enactments, and indulge the hope that reflection will satisfy every professor that he should prefer submitting to some personal inconvenience, rather than violate the positive provisions of a general law.

The Board met according to adjournment.

Resolved, That it is the duty of the Chairman, from time to time, to lay before the Faculty all such information as, in his opinion, the interests of the University may require, and promptly to bring to their attention all such offences against the laws as he may deem proper for their animadversion; especially all such as he may think deserving major punishments. In the performance of this duty the Chairman will be amenable to the Visitors alone for the exercise of a sound discretion.

The Faculty may, at pleasure call on the Chairman for information touching any subject proper for their deliberations, and it will be his duty to communicate it if in his power, or to assign to them the reasons which induce him to think that the interests of the University require that it should be withheld;- but the Faculty can in no case proceed to punish or to try an offence, not brought before them by the Chairman.

It is the duty of the Professors, and demonstrator, promptly to communicate to the Chairman all offences against the Enactments, which come to their knowledge, and to interpose to prevent any such offences in their presence. Such interposition, however, can never require or justify the language of passion, nor, beyond the limit of the lecture room, can it require any other than that of friendly warning and parental admonition.

Any student resisting or resenting such interposition, his advisors, aiders and abettors shall be deemed insubordinate, and will be liable to any of the minor or major punishments according to the degree of his offence.

The following report was made to the president and Directors of the Literary Fund.

Report.

In obedience to the law requiring the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia to make an annual report to the President and Directors of the Literary Fund to be laid before the Legislature at their next succeeding meeting, embracing a full account of the disbursements, the Funds on hand, and a general statement of the condition of the said University, the Rector and Visitors make the following report.

In conformity to the provisions of the Act of the General Assembly, establishing the University of Virginia, which requires of the Rector and Visitors that they should annually visit the Institution, for the purpose of enquiring into the proceedings and practices thereat, & of examining into the progress of the Students, they held a stated annual meeting commencing on the 14th of July and terminating on the 22d of that month, and embracing in their session the period of the public Summer examination.

During this time the Board were occupied in inspecting the institution, occasionally attending the examination of the Classes, and in discharging the other duties devolved upon them by the Legislature. As the result of inquiries instituted by them into the state and condition of the University, and the progress of the Students, they are gratified in being able to state that the general management and economy of the Institution have been such as to meet the continued approbation of the Board. Where they appeared to be defective such remedies have been applied as were deemed most suitable and adequate. The general habits and proficiency of the young man who resort hither for instruction, bear ample testimony to the zeal and ability of the professors, to their own devotion and ardor in the pursuits of science, and to the fidelity and judgment with which the laws and regulations enacted for the government of the University have been enforced.

The Board have been gratified to find a proof of the increased assiduity and success of the students in the circumstance of a much greater number having been received as graduates in the several schools, than at any former session.

The judicial office conferred on Professor Lomax has withdrawn him from the chair of Law in this Institution. In referring to the event the Board cannot satisfy their feelings without bearing testimony to the high legal attainments, the devotion to his duties and the other attractive merits by which he was characterised.

On the invitation of the Board Mr. John A. G. Davis consented to fill the vacated chair for the term of twelve months; and from the opportunities afforded the members of estimating his fine talents, his legal acquirements, and his appropriate habits, a just confidence is entertained that the trust he has undertaken, will be ably and faithfully discharged.

The Board have deemed it expedient to provide for the employment of a tutor in the School of Modern Languages with a salary of five hundred dollars per annum, and one third of the fees paid in that School. To provide this remuneration it has been necessary to make a corresponding reduction in the emoluments of the Professor, in the discharge of the duties of whose chair he has been appointed to assist. The appointment thus provided for, is to be held during the pleasure of the Visitors. The Tutor is required to conform to all the laws of the Institution, and to reside within the precincts, where convenient accommodations are to be assigned himself and Family within the Dormitories or Hotels and grounds of the University.

Some changes has been also made in the Schools of Moral Philosophy and Antient languages. Instruction in Rhetoric & Belles Lettres, heretofore required to be given in the School of Antient languages has been transferred to that of Moral Philosophy, while, in the latter, the Fee of fifteen dollars for attending the class of political Economy, has been abolished, and the Professor is entitled to receive a full fee from every student attending his school, in which political Economy is included.

Provision has been made enabling those who may be desirous of attending the class of physiology alone in the School of Medicine, to do so on the payment of a fee of fifteen dollars.

The Board have the satisfaction to state that, notwithstanding the continued pressure of pecuniary difficulties experienced in the country, the number of students attending the various schools of the University, during the recent session, has suffered no diminution, but has rather increased when compared with the preceeding one, having been, in that which has just terminated, one hundred and thirty three: The state of the Schools being as follows:

The accounts of the receipts, disbursements, and Funds on hand, as rendered by the Bursar and Proctor, are given with this report, as required by Law.

The following report to the president and Directors of the literary Fund, omitted to be inserted in its proper place, was made at the July Session of the Board of Visitors, 1829.

In obedience to the law requiring the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia to make a report annually to the President and Directors of the Literary Fund (to be laid before the Legislature at their next succeeding meeting) embracing a full account of the disbursements, the Funds on hand, and a general statement of the condition of the University, the Rector and Visitors make the following report.

REPORT

Conformably to adjournment at their regular meeting in July 1828, a special session of the Board of Visitors was held at the University in October following. At this meeting much ordinary business was transacted, but nothing was done of a character rendering its communication necessary. On the 14 of July last, a board of Visitors convened at the University, for the purpose of performing the annual visitation thereof, required by law, and remained in Session until the 21st of that month.

The term for which the Professors first obtained, had been engaged, being about to expire, among the earliest acts of the Board, was the continuance of them, for an indefinite period, on the same salary they have heretofore received. Their ability in their several departments, and their zeal for the prosperity of the Institution, leaving nothing to be hoped for from a change no wish was entertained of looking elsewhere for persons to fill the chairs the duties of which they had so satisfactorily discharged. The Board also appointed Doctor Gessner Harrison, of this state, Professor of Antient languages. This gentleman had graduated under the tuition of Mr. Long, the former incumbent of that chair, and had, from the time of Mr. Long's resignation, given instruction in that school, under a temporary appointment by this Board, to their entire satisfaction. It was also deemed advisable to raise the fee of the Demonstrator of Anatomy and Surgery from fifteen dollars to that allowed the professors, and to constitute him one of the Faculty: a distinction due to his merit and by which his usefullness will be extended. To strengthen the police, it was determined to appoint an assistant proctor, on a moderate salary, to be paid out of that before allowed to the Proctor. The nature of the duties of that officer, and the importance of their complete discharge, rendered some aid indispensable.

It is with great pleasure and confidence that the Board are enabled to repeat the favorable opinion expressed in their last report, in relation to the deportment and progress of the students. The examinations and other exercises, the condition of the Institution, and the information they were otherwise enabled to acquire, all concurred to produce the gratifying assurance, that whilst here every facility is offered for the acquisition of knowledge, and every check opposed to idleness, extravagance, and dissipation, the youth who resorted hither, have generally and largely availed themselves of these advantages, and have been alike distinguished for correctness of conduct, and proficiency in their studies. Here, too, whilst science is taught in its highest state, the expense necessary to its attainment scarcely exceeds that of elementary instruction in respectable schools: and by the vigilance of the Faculty in enforcing the laws enacted for the purpose of preventing wasteful expenditure, added to the good disposition of the students, the actual have, generally, as the Board have reason to beleive, not much exceeded the necessary expenses. With the concurrence of those whose sons and wards are sent hither, a further retrenchment may be anticipated: and as the progress of the students is generally in an inverse ratio of their expenditures, more important objects than the mere saving of money will be affected by this cooperation, & higher motives exist to induce it.

The number of students who matriculated during the session was one hundred and twenty, the state of the schools being as follows:

A larger unmber of students obtained degrees this than had the previous session; there being in the school of antient languages, three; in that of Chemistry, one; in that of Medicine four; in that of Moral Philosophy two; in that of Political Economy one; and in that of law, two graduates. In conferring degrees, it has been and will continue to be, the object of the Authorities of the Institution, to make them the evidence and the reward of merit and attainment, rather than the consequence of having gone thro' any prescribed course of study. Hence, tho' fewer may obtain them, the greater distinction will be conferred on those who do, whilst the character of the Institution will not be exposed to the hazard which would attend the adoption of any other system.

The University having been visited during the preceeding winter by an alarming fever, which attacked many students and others resident within its precincts, the attention of the Board was of course directed to an enquiry as to its probable cause. After the most attentive investigation on this subject, they were unable to ascertain any, to which, with the slightest plausibility it might be attributed. The part of the state in which the University is situated, is known to be peculiarly healthy; and in the locality of the University and the construction of it's buildings, there is certainly nothing calculated to generate disease, so far as experience and reason enable them to judge. On the whole they could not but conclude, that it was one of those attacks to which situations of the most established salubrity are sometimes subject, without apparent or discoverable cause. In this view, however much the recent calamity is to be deplored, it can afford no reasonable ground of apprehension as to the future. The Board intentionally pass over as undeserving particular consideration so far as respects this conclusion, the cases of measles which occurred at the University during the Summer of 1828, as that disease was not confined to the University, but prevailed thro-out Albemarle and the adjacent counties; in some places in a more mortal degree; and all situations being alike exposed to it.

The accounts of the receipts, disbursement, and funds on hand, up to the 10th July 1829 as rendered by the Bursar & Proctor, are given with this report, agreeably to the requisition of the law.
