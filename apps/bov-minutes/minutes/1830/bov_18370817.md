But in order to guard against the abuse of the privilege granted by this proviso, it shall be the duty of every student who appears out of Uniform to declare, when he obtain'd the clothes so worn by him, and on his refusal to do so shall be considered as having violated this enactment; the obligation to answer such enquiries being the condition on which Students may avail themselves of the benefit of this proviso.

Resolved that the addition to pavilion No. 9 occupied by Professor Tucker which was authorised by a former resolution of this Board and has been recently commenced under a contract made by Mr. Tucker be conducted under the direction of the Proctor subject to the control of the Executive Committee.

The Board then adjourned Sine die.
