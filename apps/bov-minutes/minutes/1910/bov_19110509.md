University of Virginia, Board of Visitors

May 9, 1911

At the annual meeting of the Board of Visitors, called for the consideration of the "Financial Budget" for 1911-1912,

Present: The Rector, and Visitors Irvine, Drewry, White, Harmon, and Norton, and President Alderman,

The Rector having called the Board to order at 2:30 P. M., the President proposed promotions and appointments which were unanimously agreed to by resolution, as follows:

Resolved: That Associate Professor H. E. Jordan, in the School of Anatomy, be made Professor of Histology and Embryology, at a salary of $2,500.

Resolved: That Adjunct Professor, Charles Hancock, in the Department of Enginnering, be made Associate Professor of Engineering and Mechanical Drawing.

Resolved: That C. M. Sparrow be made Adjunct Professor of Physics, at a salary of $1,250., for the year 1911-1912.

Resolved: That J. A. Waddell be made Adjunct Professor of Pharmacology and Materia Medica at a salary of $1,500. a year.

Resolved: That a leave of absence for one year, at half salary, be granted to Professor William H. Heck, in consideration of his purpose to more completely prepare himself for service in the promotion of public health and educational hygiene in the State of Virginia.

Owing to advanced age and increasing infirmities, the resignation of William Morris Fontaine, for many years Professor of Natural History and Geology in the University, was received; and it was resolved by the Rector and Visitors that the resignation be accepted with a hearty expression by the Rector and Visitors, of their appreciation of the service of Professor Fontaine as a scholar of international distinction and a teacher of untiring devotion to his work.

The President then presented the resignation of Dr. Bruce R. Payne, as follows,-

I hereby tender to you and through you to the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia, my resignation as Professor of Secondary Education, and as Professor of Psychology, and as Director of the Summer School at the University of Virginia. I should like for this resignation to take effect at the end of the scholastic year, June 14, 1911. I think it advisable to continue my connection with the Summer School until its close, July 29th, and with respect to that phase of my work this resignation should not become operative until July 29th. It may be that I cannot be present every day during the Summer School, but if agreeable I shall be present as often as possible.

In taking this action it is needless for me to say to you and to your honorable Board that it gives me the greatest imaginable sorrow to sever my connection with this University. For six years I have endeavored in so far as God has given me strength and wisdom to serve through the University the youth and the schools of this commonwealth. No man has ever struggled to do his work, who has been buoyed up with the feeling that he had the earnest and heary cooperation of all the adminstrative and executive authorities more than I have in these six years. There has not been one minute in that period when I have not felt that I had the hearty sympathy and support of yourself, the faculty and the Board of Visitors. Without them I should have lost courage and have failed. Will you then let me thank you for this and all kindnesses, and will you be so kind as to express this appreciation to the faculty, and to the Board of Visitors?

With sincere esteem and good will, I beg to remain most

The Board then adopted the following:

Resolved: That the Rector and Visitors accept, with sincere regret, the resignation of Professor Bruce Ryburn Payne. It is their desire to record their sincere appreciation of his value as a teacher and as a constructive force in educational work within and without the University. They wish for him the largest measure of success in the great new field to which he has been called.

Resolved: That the President be authorized to transmit to Sir Moses Ezekiel, the sum of $1,000.00 from the donation of Mr. Thomas, toward the expense of the "Jefferson Statue."

Resolved: That Mr. W. M. Storm of Frederick, Maryland, be awarded the "Valentine Birely Scholarship" for session 1911-1912.

Whereas Dr. R. H. Whitehead has requested that he be allowed to lease certain additional ground from the University for the purpose of a road or driveway connecting his stable with the main road in front of his house, therefore, be it

Resolved: That in compliance with this request of Dr. Whitehead, he be, and he is hereby granted the free and unrestricted use of such lot or parcel of ground as will give him a driveway 16 feet wide, beginning at the main Observatory Road, and lying parallel and adjoining Dr. Hough's lot on the western boundary, and Dr. Whitehead's lot on the eastern boundary, and running back 400 feet to the rear boundary of Dr. Whitehead's said lot. The privileges hereby granted are to remain in force during the present lease of Dr. Whitehead.

Resolved: That this Board approve and confirm the action of the Finance Committee in authorizing the payment of the additional sum of $3,000.00 as a temporary loan from the proceeds of sale of the Norfolk Bank Stocks, belonging to the "James Estate," and necessary to complete the Law Building and equipment, and essential repairs and heating Dawson's Row buildings.

The President having brought to the attention of the Rector and Visitors, the will of the late Judge Lambert Tree of the city of Chicago, wherein by the Eleventh Clause thereof he provides as follows: viz—;

Copy of Article XI Will of Lambert Tree, Deceased

"I give and bequeath to the University of Virginia, situated at or near Charlottesville, Virginia, the sum of five thousand dollars ($5,000.00), to be permanently invested, and the interest or income therefrom to be used in perpetuity for the use and benefit of the library of the University, in the purchase of books or in such other way as may be deemed best for the interests of the library. The condition of this bequest is, that the authorities in charge of the fund shall make and publish an annual report thereof to the proper official of the University, showing what is being done therewith."

—;the said Rector and Visitors hereby express and record their sincere appreciation of the gift of Judge Tree, and accept the same with direction that the said legacy be invested by the Finance Committee, and the income arising therefrom be devoted to the purpose expressed in the said Eleventh Clause of Judge Tree's will.

Resolved, further: That the President transmit copy of this resolution to the family and the Executor of Judge Tree, accompanied with the assurance that this kindness will be borne in considerate memory by the authorities of the University.

Correspondence relative to the above, here follows:-

By the Eleventh Article of his last will and Testament the Hon. Lambert Tree, Deceased, of this city, bequeathed to your institution the sum of $5,000.00 to be invested in perpetuity for the benefit of your library. To be used in the purchase of books, or such other ways as may be deemed best for said library.

He also bequeathed to you certain law books, which have already been delivered.

On these bequeasts the State of Illinois has imposed an Inheritance Tax of 3 percent amounting to $153.04, on which we will receive a discount for prompt payment, leaving the net amount of the tax $145.39.

We accordingly enclose for your information a copy of the Article in question together with our check for $4,854.61 in full settlement of the legacy after deducting the Inheritance Tax.

Will you kindly acknowledge receipt at your convenience on the vouchers enclosed in duplicate for that purpose, and oblige.

I beg to acknowledge receipt of your communication of the 29th, inst., containing a check for $4,854.61, being the bequest of the Hon. Lambert Tree, deceased, to the University of Virginia, less the inheritance tax of the State of Illinois of $145.39. I also acknowledge receipt of the copy of article XI of the will of Lambert Tree, deceased, setting forth the purpose for which this bequest shall be used. The University of Virginia will in due time express proper gratitude through its Rector and Visitors for this bequest.

Resolved:- that the estimates of the Income and the appropriation of the same as recommended in the report of the President, be approved as follows:

On motion, the Board adjourned, subject to the call of the Rector.

I hereby tender to you and through you to the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia, my resignation as Professor of Secondary Education, and as Professor of Psychology, and as Director of the Summer School at the University of Virginia. I should like for this resignation to take effect at the end of the scholastic year, June 14, 1911. I think it advisable to continue my connection with the Summer School until its close, July 29th, and with respect to that phase of my work this resignation should not become operative until July 29th. It may be that I cannot be present every day during the Summer School, but if agreeable I shall be present as often as possible.

In taking this action it is needless for me to say to you and to your honorable Board that it gives me the greatest imaginable sorrow to sever my connection with this University. For six years I have endeavored in so far as God has given me strength and wisdom to serve through the University the youth and the schools of this commonwealth. No man has ever struggled to do his work, who has been buoyed up with the feeling that he had the earnest and heary cooperation of all the adminstrative and executive authorities more than I have in these six years. There has not been one minute in that period when I have not felt that I had the hearty sympathy and support of yourself, the faculty and the Board of Visitors. Without them I should have lost courage and have failed. Will you then let me thank you for this and all kindnesses, and will you be so kind as to express this appreciation to the faculty, and to the Board of Visitors?

With sincere esteem and good will, I beg to remain most

By the Eleventh Article of his last will and Testament the Hon. Lambert Tree, Deceased, of this city, bequeathed to your institution the sum of $5,000.00 to be invested in perpetuity for the benefit of your library. To be used in the purchase of books, or such other ways as may be deemed best for said library.

He also bequeathed to you certain law books, which have already been delivered.

On these bequeasts the State of Illinois has imposed an Inheritance Tax of 3 percent amounting to $153.04, on which we will receive a discount for prompt payment, leaving the net amount of the tax $145.39.

We accordingly enclose for your information a copy of the Article in question together with our check for $4,854.61 in full settlement of the legacy after deducting the Inheritance Tax.

Will you kindly acknowledge receipt at your convenience on the vouchers enclosed in duplicate for that purpose, and oblige.

I beg to acknowledge receipt of your communication of the 29th, inst., containing a check for $4,854.61, being the bequest of the Hon. Lambert Tree, deceased, to the University of Virginia, less the inheritance tax of the State of Illinois of $145.39. I also acknowledge receipt of the copy of article XI of the will of Lambert Tree, deceased, setting forth the purpose for which this bequest shall be used. The University of Virginia will in due time express proper gratitude through its Rector and Visitors for this bequest.
