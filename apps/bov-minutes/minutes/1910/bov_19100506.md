At the annual meeting of the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia, on May 6th, in the President's Office,

Present: The Rector, and Visitors White, Craddock, Harmon, and Shackelford, and President Alderman,

The Rector having called the Board to order, the following was adopted;-

Resolved: That the report of the Rector of the transfer of securities to the "Alumni Board of Trustees of the University Endowment Fund", under the resolution of the Board at its June meeting, 1909, be received, approved and recorded upon the minutes as follows:-

The undersigned respectfully reports that pursuant to the resolution of the Visitors at the June meeting, 1909, providing for the transfer to the Alumni Board of Trustees of the University of Virginia Endowment Fund, as in said resolution set forth, on March 30, 1910, after having had a previous meeting with Mr. Eppa Hunton, Jr., the Treasurer of said Alumni Board of Trustees in Richmond, in order to arrange the various details for the proper transfer of those of said securities which were registered, the undersigned receipted to the Virginia Trust Company for the following named and described bonds, and turned the same over to said Hunton as Treasurer of said Alumni Board of Trustees of the University of Virginia Endowment Fund taking his receipts therefor in the words and figures following: viz.-

Richmond, Va., March 30, 1910.

Received of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, through the Honorable Armistead C. Gordon, Rector, all of the above listed securities with all of the unmatured coupons thereto attached.

Received of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia through the Honorable Armistead C. Gordon, Rector, the bond with all unmatured coupons thereto attached.

Received of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, through the Honorable Armistead C. Gordon, Rector all of the above listed securities with all of the unmatured coupons thereto attached.

The undersigned returns herewith to the Visitors the original receipts of said Hunton, Treasurer, to be filed and preserved by the Bursar; and respectfully requests that this Report may be received and spread upon the minutes of the Visitors.

Respectfully, (signed) Armistead C. Gordon, Rector of the University of Virginia.

Resolved: That James E. Routh, Jr. be elected Adjunct Professor in the Edgar Allen Poe School of English, for such portion of the year 1910-1911, as may be necessary, at a salary on the basis of $1,250 per annum.

Resolved: That Graham Edgar, Instructor in the Department of Chemistry, be promoted to the rank of Adjunct Professor in the same department, at a salary of $1,200.00

Resolved: That D. V. Guthrie, Instructor in the Department of Physics, be promoted to the rank of Adjunct Professor, at a salary of $1,200.00.

Resolved: That W. H. Faulkner, Associate Professor in the Department of Germanic Languages, be promoted to the rank of Full Professor in that department, at a salary of $2,500.00

Resolved: That the "Valentine Birely Scholarship" be awarded to Mr. William M. Storm, for session 1910-1911.

Resolved: That the office of Commissioner of Accounts be abolished after the 30th of June, 1910. This action is taken on account of the creation by the Legislature of a Bureau of Accountancy for State Institutions.

Resolved: That the additional sum of $50.00 be appropriated and paid to "The Debating and Oratorical Union," to assist in defraying the expenses of this organization for session 19091910.

Resolved: That the President and Superintendent of Grounds & Buildings with the assistance of such other members of the faculty as they may request to act with them are requested to investigate the whole question relative to the sewer system of the University, and make report to the next meeting of the Board with recommendations as to what changes, if any, should be made, together with an estimate of the costs thereof.

Resolved: That the petition of certain citizens of the University community with reference to re-opening the entrance to the University grounds from the street-car line, be referred to the Committee on Grounds & Buildings, and the President for consideration and future report to the Board.

Whereas, by deed dated November 13th., 1905, and recorded in the Clerk's Office of Albemarle County, Virginia, in Deed Book 131, p. 341, A. N. Peyton conveyed to D. Harmon and John S. White, Trustees, a certain lot of land, known as the Anderson property, at the University to secure equally and ratably the University of Virginia and the Trustees of the Miller Board in the sums of $3,400.00 and $3,300.00 respectively;

And, whereas, the said Peyton now desires a release of a portion on the lot in the rear of the Anderson house and beginning at a point on the western line of the said property about 210 feet from University Avenue, thence north 60 feet and with a depth of 113 feet, in order that he may effect another loan thereon for the sum of $      for the purpose of erecting a house thereon;

And, whereas, it appears that the University will have still a first lien with the Miller Board on a lot fronting 138 feet on University Avenue, and extending back on the west side about 210 feet and on the east side about 240 feet, and will have still a first lien on a small triangular lot in the rear of the lot proposed to be released, as well as a second lien on the lot released, which will be subordinate to the lien of $       hereinbefore mentioned;

And, whereas, by reason of improvements placed by the said Peyton on the lot upon which the first lien is still retained, it appears that the security for the said loans by the said University and the said Miller Board will be amply sufficient;

Now, therefore, be it resolved by the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, that John B. Moon, as Attorney for the said University of Virginia, be and is hereby authorized and empowered to make such release, or postponement, of the lien of the said University, jointly with the said Miller Board, on the said lot 60 feet by 113 feet in the rear of the said Anderson house, as may be needful in the premises. 

Whereas, the Beta Iota Chapter of the Delta Tau Delta Fraternity request that they be assigned site "A" in the "Fraternity Court," instead of site "B", granted them by resolution of March 6th, 1910; and in submitting such request, they propose to erect ultimately a building to cost about $18,000.00, Therefore, be it

Resolved: That site "A" be substituted for site "B" and assigned to the said Fraternity, subject to the same conditions as required in resolution of March 6th, 1910.

Resolved: That the following petition of the Phi Beta Kappa Fraternity for a room on East Range, be granted;-

The Executive Committee of the local chapter of Phi Beta Kappa requests that, unless you yourself see some reason for not doing so, you will submit to the Board of Visitors, their request that the Chapter be granted the use of one of the rooms of the University, and would suggest as suitable for the purpose, the unoccupied room on East Range in the building in which Dr. B. W. Green now resides. We desire this room to keep in it the records, library, photographs, and other property of the Chapter, and for the use of the officers of the Chapter in the discharge of their duties.

Phi Beta Kappa exists solely to advance sound scholarship at the University. It is in no sense a private fraternity, and has no interest to serve except that of sound scholarship. We feel that it would be a graceful recognition of the disinterested work which our organization is endeavoring to do for the University, if the Board of Visitors would thus provide a home for the chapter in the University buildings. The income of the Chapter is small, being limited to the initiation fees of its members, and barely suffices to meet necessary expenses. Among these expenses, it is proper to recall, is that connected with one of the most important public celebrations of our Final Week, an expense which is borne by the Chapter, although the public exercises are strictly a University function.

If the University will give us the use of a room, the Chapter will undertake to furnish it suitably, keep it in repair, and meet all necessary expenses of heating, lighting, and the like.

I enclose herewith a formal contract prepared by Messrs. Moon and Fife, relative to the removal of the track, &c., by the Street Car Company. It has been executed by the Company, and I have signed it as Chairman of the Executive Committee. When this Company began the work, I was under the impression that the Committee, composed of yourself, Dr. Lambeth, and myself, had power to act in the matter; but it seems that the power was vested in you gentlemen and the Executive Committee. I will be glad if you will have this paper properly executed at the meeting of the Board called for Saturday. I regret to say it will be impossible for me to attend the meeting, as I shall be out of town.

On the 10th day of April 1908, the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia adopted a resolution that the petition of the Charlottesville and Albemarle Railway Company for change of the location of its line be referred to you gentlemen with authority to act.

The said Railway Company desires to make the following changes in the present location of its line through the grounds of the University of Virginia, namely:-

Remove the track further south to a point about half way between its present location and the County turn-pike, and also lower the grade and straighten said track from the C. & O. overhead Bridge to what is known as "Buffum's Crossing." And also to do away with the trestle south of the Electric Light Plant of the University of Virginia, and make a small fill in its place at or about the present location of the trestle.

These changes will necessitate the lowering of the present grades in some places and the raising of it in others, and will also necessitate the removal of two trees on the south of the present track, and near the East Range road.

Of course, if the University should at any time in the future, determine to open the East Range Road so as to connect with the County Turnpike, the said C. & A. Railway will change its tracks as to grades &c. to such an extent as may be necessary to conform with the grade that the University may determine upon.

The said Railway Company is very anxious to make these changes as soon as possible, as it is very important that the work should be done before the opening of the Spring season, and it trusts that your Committee will permit it to go ahead with the work as soon as possible.

Thanking you in advance for your prompt attention to this matter, I am,

I enclose herewith a paper from Mr. L. T. Hanckel, President of the Street Railway Company, making application for permission to change the location and grade of the street-car track as it passes over the lands of the University.

I had a talk a few days ago with Dr. Lambeth and understood him to approve of the general plan proposed by Mr. Hanckel. I likewise approve of it. If you should desire a conference of the committee, I will be glad to come up to the University any time within the next few days. In the meantime, I make the following suggestions:-

That the permission asked for be granted to the Street Car Company upon the condition that the location and grade of the road shall be approved by the Superintendent of Grounds and Buildings, and that the banks of any cuts and fills made necessary by this work shall be put in grass by the Railway Company, and the sod be kept in proper condition and well trimmed by them, and that in granting the permission, all rights heretofore reserved by the University in reference to use of their lands by the Street Car Company, are to be applied to the changed location.

In order to preserve a complete record of the transaction, I think that the formal draft of the action of the committee should be accepted by the Street Car Company, so that the same can be recorded upon the minute books of the Board of Visitors.

The undersigned respectfully requests your honorable body to permit it to change the location of its Street Car Line running through the premises of the University of Virginia. It is desired to change the location of its railway line from its present one to a point lying north of the trestle and south of the light and heating plant of the University of Virginia,- the new line to be located at such point and along such curves and grades as will be agreeable to and approved by your body.

It is respectfully requested that this matter may be referred by your body to your Committee on Grounds and Buildings, and the Superintendent of Grounds and Buildings of the University of Virginia, will full power to act in the premises.

In the opinion of the undersigned the desired change of location will in no way injure or impair the value or the appearance of the grounds of the University of Virginia; but on the contrary, will greatly add to it, by removing the present unsightly trestle, and also enabling the undersigned to locate a station nearer to "Cabell Hall" (if the same is desired) than the present one.
