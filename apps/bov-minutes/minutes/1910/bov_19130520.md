## board of visitors minutes

### University of Virginia, Board of Visitors

### May 20, 1913

At the annual meeting of the Board of Visitors, called for the consideration of the Financial Budget for 1913-1914.

Present: The Rector, Visitors Craddock, Flood, Norton, White, Irvine, Drewry, Michie, Oliver, State Superintendent Stearnes, and Acting President, Dean James M. Page.

The Rector having called the Board to order at 10:30 o'clock, the newly appointed member, (to fill vacancy caused by resignation of Dr. W. M. Randolph), Mr. George R. B. Michie, appeared, and being duly qualified, was accordingly recognized as a member of this Board.

## Report of Committee on Entrance Building

At a meeting of the Committee on Entrance Building at 8:00 P.M., May 9th, 1913, there were present Messrs. Lambeth, Michie, Newcomb, Smith, Forrest. The following was moved by Mr. Newcomb, seconded and carried:-

Resolved that it be the sense of this Committee that the contract for the construction of the Entrance Building for the University be and is herewith awarded to Vandegrift and Fitch, the lowest competitive bidders, subject to the approval by the Rector and Visitors of the University of our resolution asking for $5,000.00 increased loan.

The following was presented by Mr. Forrest and moved and seconded by Mr. Smith and Mr. Michie, and adopted for presentation at next meeting of the Board, together with the preceeding resolution for their information:-

To the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia.

Your Committee on Improvements at the University entrance beg to report that in harmony with your instructions they secured bids on completed plans and specifications for the building approved by you at your meeting February 10, 1913.

The lowest bid, even after making all such changes in the plans as can reduce the cost without injuring the building in appearance, structure or rent-yielding power, shows that the building alone, with the architect's fees, will cost nearly $20,000.00. Your provision for the building being only $15,000.00, it has impossible to sign the contract and proceed with the work.

We therefore ask that you provide a further sum of $5,000.00 making a total of $25,000. for the building and outside improvements, interest upon which at the rate of six per cent per year shall be deducted by the Bursar from the gross revenues of the building paid into his hands. In our judgement the rents will easily care for this annual charge of $1,500.00 and leave a handsome surplus. We also believe it would be a mistake to reduce the size of the building, and that if reduced it would not carry an interest charge of $1,200.00 as safely as the proposed building will carry, $1,500.00.

The Committee on Entrance Building having made the foregoing report, it was

Resolved: That an additional sum of $5,000.00 be appropriated to the building and improvements at the University entrance, making the total appropriation for the purpose $25,000.00 instead of $20,000.00 as provided in the resolution of February 10, 1913.

Relative to the "1908 Alumni Reunion," it was

Resolved: first, That the sum of $200.00 be and is hereby appropriated to pay for the music in connection with the reunion of the 1908 class to be held at the approaching Finals.

Resolved, secondly, That the sum of $150.00 be and is hereby appropriated to be used for the purpose of providing suitable lodging in the University dormitories for the members of the 1908 class and their friends at the reunion during the approaching Finals.

Resolved, that the sum of $1,500. be and is hereby appropriated for the University Summer School for the summer of 1913. Of this sum of $1,500.00, $500.00 is to pay the salary of the Director of the Summer School, $300.00 to pay the salary of the Professor of Advanced Algebra and Trigonometry: the remaining $700.00 to be used for general Summer School purposes.

The Financial Budget for the year 1913-1914 having been submitted to the Rector, and to each member of the Board, some weeks prior to this meeting, and having been thus fully considered and also discussed in this meeting, on motion duly seconded, the same is hereby adopted in the following words and figures:—;

\[See Budget for year 1913-1914 page 284\]

At the annual meeting of the Board of Visitors, called for the consideration of the Financial Budget for 1913-1914.

Present: The Rector, Visitors Craddock, Flood, Norton, White, Irvine, Drewry, Michie, Oliver, State Superintendent Stearnes, and Acting President, Dean James M. Page.

The Rector having called the Board to order at 10:30 o'clock, the newly appointed member, (to fill vacancy caused by resignation of Dr. W. M. Randolph), Mr. George R. B. Michie, appeared, and being duly qualified, was accordingly recognized as a member of this Board.

The adoption of the foregoing Budget, carried with it the following promotions,—;

Instructor James C. Bardin to Adjunct Professor of Spanish and Poruguese.

Adjunct Professor W. S. Rodman, to Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering.

Adjunct Professor J. S. Grasty, to William Barton Rogers Associate Professor of Economic Geology.

Adjunct Professor Wm. A. Kepner to Associate Professor of Biology.

In view of the following letter from the Dean of the Engineering Department, Mr. J. S. Lapham was appointed Instructor in Applied Mechanics.

After the annual report of the Department of Engineering had been made and forwarded to the President, it was learned that Mr. J. S. Lapham, a graduate of this University in Mechanical Engineering, desired an appointment on our teaching staff. Mr. Lapham is a young man of unusual ability; and, if his application had been received earlier, he would undoubtedly have been engaged. It is not often that any school has the opportunity of securing the services of a man so eminently fitted by capacity, training, and character to make a useful and accomplished University teacher. The department is already committed to the young men nominated in our report as instructors for 1913-1914, and cannot in good faith, cancel any one of the nominations. On the other hand, the opportunity is one which cannot be postponed; unless Mr. Lapham comes to us, he will go into business with his father, and such permanent changes will have to be made in the details of that business as will prevent him from accepting a position with us in the future.

I am so greatly impressed by the desirability of engaging Mr. Lapham that I beg to ask through you a small special appropriation for his salary. This appropriation will be for the one year only, after 1913-1914, we shall be able to arrange our teaching force so that Mr. Lapham will receive one of the regular appointments.

I desire therefore to recommend that for the session 1913-1914, Mr. J. S. Lapham be appointed, assistant instructor in Applied Mechanics at a salary of $500.

I have been a professor in this University for thirty-seven years. Men have been appointed in the past to extend the work of the Department of Engineering, but I have never before asked for a man to share my individual work. I should not do this at present, but for the cogent reasons given above. I trust the Rector and Visitors may find it possible, and deem it wise to approve this recommendation.

Resolved, (1) That the action of Professor H. T. Marshall in releasing his assistant, Dr. J. O. Mundy on April 10, 1913, to accept an advantageous position in New York City, be approved.

Resolved, further, that Professor Marshall's employing Miss Lila Thornton as Technical Assistant for the unexpired term of Dr. Mundy, to continue to July 1 at $30.00 a month, be approved.

Resolved: (3) That the Bursar be and is hereby authorized to pay Miss Thornton for her work during the unexpired term of Dr. Mundy out of the amount appropriated for Dr. Mundy's salary for that period; and that the unexpended balance of $96.76, of Dr. Mundy's salary for that period be transferred to the credit of the Pathological Laboratory.

Resolved: That for next session the salary of Mr. A. G. Nochren as Student Assistant in Physcial Education be and is hereby fixed at the sum of $350.00, he to pay the University fee and tuition in the Medical Department.

Resolved: That for the next session, the position of Sanitary Inspector of the University be instituted, and that the same be filled by some medical student recommended by the University Sanitary Committee. The remuneration attached to the position shall be $100.00; and the incumbent shall act under the direction of and report to the Chairman of the University Sanitary Committee.

Resolved, That the sum of $100. be and is hereby appropriated to pay for an Assistant in the office of the Dean of the University from July 1 to September 15th.

Resolved: That a sum not to exceed $200. be and is hereby appropriated for the maintenance of Madison Hall during the fiscal year ending July 1, 1913.

Resolved: That $127.00 be poropriated to send a sample copy of the Alumni News to each of five thousand (5,000) Alumni.

The following letter to the President from Prof. Albert H. Tuttle, was presented by Dean Page,

As you are already aware, I have recently sent to the Trustees of the Carnegie Foundation a formal application for retirement, feeling that after forty years of full professional work and twenty-five years of active service at this University, the time has come when it is wise for me to take advantage of the provisions of the Foundation,

This application still awaits the action of the Board of Trustees at their forthcoming meeting, at which time I hope and expect that it will meet with their approval. Pending their action, however, I feel it my duty to advise the Rector and Visitors of the step that I have taken, and of my wish, subject to this contingency, to retire from active service on September 15th next. I therefore request that these facts be laid before them.

I should like also to ask of the Rector and Visitors of the University that, in case of my retirement at the time indicated, I be permitted for the present to occupy the house I am now living in on the same terms as heretofore, viz., a rental at $25.00 a month. Hoping for favorable action on their part, I remain,

I. We recommend that the sites on Carr's Hill for fraternity houses, be at present restricted to four, and that the northernmost site be located on a line passing through the centre of the president's residence and the centre of the president's stable, and at least as far distant from the president's house as is the location of the "Delta Tau Delta" house.

II. We further recommend that no trees be cut without permission of a Committee appointed to accurately locate these sites.

III. That the earth from the excavations for these fraternity buildings be deposited in the new road under the direction of the Superintendent of Grounds.

Prof. Newcomb who is planning the plants for the sewage purification, as directed by the State Board of Health, indicates that we will have to acquire land to furnish a sufficient fall to carry off the effluent from the filter beds.

It is therefore recommended that the Board appoint a Committee to secure options on property that seems to be required, or take condemnation proceedings, if necessary.

At the annual meeting of the Board of Visitors, called for the consideration of the Financial Budget for 1913-1914.

Present: The Rector, Visitors Craddock, Flood, Norton, White, Irvine, Drewry, Michie, Oliver, State Superintendent Stearnes, and Acting President, Dean James M. Page.

The Rector having called the Board to order at 10:30 o'clock, the newly appointed member, (to fill vacancy caused by resignation of Dr. W. M. Randolph), Mr. George R. B. Michie, appeared, and being duly qualified, was accordingly recognized as a member of this Board.

## Report of Committee on Entrance Building

At a meeting of the Committee on Entrance Building at 8:00 P.M., May 9th, 1913, there were present Messrs. Lambeth, Michie, Newcomb, Smith, Forrest. The following was moved by Mr. Newcomb, seconded and carried:-

Resolved that it be the sense of this Committee that the contract for the construction of the Entrance Building for the University be and is herewith awarded to Vandegrift and Fitch, the lowest competitive bidders, subject to the approval by the Rector and Visitors of the University of our resolution asking for $5,000.00 increased loan.

The following was presented by Mr. Forrest and moved and seconded by Mr. Smith and Mr. Michie, and adopted for presentation at next meeting of the Board, together with the preceeding resolution for their information:-

To the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia.

Your Committee on Improvements at the University entrance beg to report that in harmony with your instructions they secured bids on completed plans and specifications for the building approved by you at your meeting February 10, 1913.

The lowest bid, even after making all such changes in the plans as can reduce the cost without injuring the building in appearance, structure or rent-yielding power, shows that the building alone, with the architect's fees, will cost nearly $20,000.00. Your provision for the building being only $15,000.00, it has impossible to sign the contract and proceed with the work.

We therefore ask that you provide a further sum of $5,000.00 making a total of $25,000. for the building and outside improvements, interest upon which at the rate of six per cent per year shall be deducted by the Bursar from the gross revenues of the building paid into his hands. In our judgement the rents will easily care for this annual charge of $1,500.00 and leave a handsome surplus. We also believe it would be a mistake to reduce the size of the building, and that if reduced it would not carry an interest charge of $1,200.00 as safely as the proposed building will carry, $1,500.00.
