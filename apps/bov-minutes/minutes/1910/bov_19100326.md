University of Virginia, Board of Visitors

March 26, 1910

At a meeting of the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia, at 2:00 P. M. on above date, in the President's Office,

Present: Messrs. Gordon, White, Craddock, Shackelford, and Harmon, and President Alderman,

The Board being called to order, Mr. Gordon stated that, in accordance with Sec. 1544 of the Statute, the election of a Rector was first in order. On motion of Mr. White, Mr. Armistead C. Gordon was nominated; the motion being duly seconded, he was unanimously elected Rector, to serve for the ensuing term of four years.

The election of a Secretary to the Board being next in order, it was

Resolved: That I. K. Moran be re-appointed to serve a term of 4 years.

The following resolutions were then unanimously adopted by the Board:

Resolved: That the resignations of L. L. Holladay, Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering, and E. P. Dargan, Adjunct Professor of Romanic Languages, be accepted with regret and expressions of appreciation of their ability and faithfulness.

Resolved: That the President, upon the recommendation of the Professor of Romanic Languages, be authorized to appoint Messrs. James C. Bardin and Stanley M. Cleveland, Instructors of Romanic Languages, at a salary of $700.00 each.

Resolved: That the Rector and Visitors ratify the action of the Executive Committee in granting leave of absence to Professor Charles W. Kent; and in appointing as locum tenens in his absence in the Chair of English, Dr. George A. Wauchope of the University of South Carolina, correspondence in the matter to be spread upon the minutes of the Board.

The correspondence follows:

In pursuance of our conversation, I have the honor to request that I be granted a leave of absence from the University of Virginia for the remainder of the current session, so that I may spend this period in Europe. I would not make this request if I believed that my absence would be detrimental to the University of Virginia. I have been fortunate in procuring the consent of Dr. George A. Wauchope, of the University of South Carolina, to fill my chair during my absence. Dr. Wauchope is a Virginian, a graduate of Washington and Lee University, and a Doctor of Philosophy of Johns Hopkins University, and aprofessor of most successful experience. He is a man of culture and refinement, an excellent writer, and I am sure will prove an inspiration to the classes I leave in his charge.

For my own part, I can say that having been a teacher now for twenty odd years, without asking for a vacation or losing any time of consequence from my work, I feel that I have earned a holiday, and it seems peculiarly opportune at this time that I take it, as I have just finished some important work under the strain of which I have been laboring for several years.

Begging that you will transmit this letter to the proper authorities with your endorsement, if it seems wise to you, I have the honor to remain,

I beg to acknowledge receipt of your communication of the 13th, inst., requesting a leave of absence from the University for the remainder of the present session, and stating that you have secured the consent of Dr. George A. Wauchope to serve in your stead.

I approve of your desire for the leave of absence, and shall recommend it heartily to the Visitors. I believe the result of your stay in Europe will be for increase of power in your work in the University, and I do not believe that your work will suffer in the hands of Dr. Wauchope. I am this day transmitting your request to the Executive Committee of the Visitors, with my approval, and shall acquaint you with their decision.

I am enclosing a correspondence between Dr. Kent and myself which explains itself. I am sending the correspondence to you with the request that you signify your approval or disapproval of the request contained in Dr. Kent's letter and approved by me, in order that I may inform Dr. Kent and officially inform Dr. Wauchope. There is no question of money involved in the transaction,- - that is to say, Dr. Kent's salary will go on, and he will compensate Dr. Wauchope for his services out of his (Dr. Kent's) salary, the University budget arrangement remaining undisturbed. The essential point, of course, is the essential fitness of Dr. Wauchope. He is, from all accounts, a very valuable and interesting man. His services will be from February until June, and I do not believe any harm will come to the character of our teaching, and some good from the interchange. I believe much good will come to the Department from Dr. Kent's residence in Europe for this period. It is a sort of Sabbatical year arrangement, without cost to the Institution, that I heartily approve of.

I should appreciate as prompt a reply, expressive of your opinion in this matter, as is possible.

Upon application of Dr. Charles W. Kent, I have recommended to the Rector and Visitors of the University that he be given a vacation for the remainder of the session. As you are aware, it is his purpose to spend this vacation abroad. Dr. Kent, in making the application to me, recommended most enthusiastically your name as a suitable incumbent for the Chair for the remainder of the session of 1910.

I have brought the whole matter to the attention of the Visitors, and have likewise given it attention myself. The Visitors have decided to grant such a vacation to Dr. Kent, and are unanimous in their consent that you take charge of his duties here during that period. I, therefore, write to inform you of this in an official way, and to assure you of the pleasure it will give me to welcome you here and to be of service in any way that I can be to you in your work. I beg you to report to me, when you come, at as early a moment as possible, in order that I may have the pleasure of meeting you and knowing your plans immediately.

Whereas, President Alderman has reported that he has raised $3,086.00 in subscription to the fund for the realization of the gift of a bronze statue of Thomas Jefferson by Sir Moses Ezekiel, Therefore be it

Resolved: That the action of President Alderman in forwarding $1,000.00 to Sir Moses Ezekiel for defraying the expenses for casting, pedestal, etc. of the Jefferson statue, be approved by the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia.

Resolved, also, That President Alderman be instructed to express appropriate thanks to the gentlemen who responded to his request by subscriptions for this purpose.

Resolved: That $200.00 be appropriated annually to the Fire Department of the City of Charlottesville, subject to revocation on six month's notice, to aid the City in the maintenance of its Fire Department, and to give protection to University property. (See communication from Superintendent Lambeth, which is as follows:

I have to report that about 12:30 o'clock on the morning of the 8th of February, fire was discovered in the basement of the Chapel.

Professors, students, and the Charlottesville Fire Co. succeeded in saving the building with a loss of $2,221.00, which is covered by insurance.

It is

Resolved, also, That all applications for loans by the University on account of the said building, be made to the Finance Committee of this Board, giving notice 60 days in advance of the time such loans are required to be made.

Resolved: That the Building Committee be authorized, with the concurrence of the Trustees of the University of Virginia Endowment Fund, to go forward in the matter of constructing a modern Dispensary and Out-door Patient Department for the Hospital, in accordance with the ideas of Mr. Charles Steele, as expressed in his gift for that purpose.

Resolved: That the candidates for the degree of Doctor of Medicine who have less than one year's full course to complete may be required to take such additional work and to pass such additional examinations as the Medical Faculty may prescribe. This additional work may be selected from any of the courses given in the Department of Medicine, even when such prescribed courses have previously been taken and passed by the candidates in question.

Resolved: That no course offered by a successful candidate for one of the cultural baccalaureate degrees shall be counted again for the other cultural baccalaureate degree.

Resolved: That Mr. Moon, the attorney for the Board, and the Committee heretofore appointed to consider and act upon the claim of the City authorities for water furnished or pumped to the University, be requested to make a report at as early a date as possible.

Resolved: That the date for the consideration of the Financial Budget of the University of Virginia, be fixed for Friday, May 6th, 1910.

Resolved: That the Finance Committee of this Board be and is hereby authorized and requested to turn over to the Treasurer of the Alumni Board of Trustees of the University Endowment Fund, the Securities now in the custody of the Virginia Trust Company, and representing what was known as the "Alumni Hall Fund," arising from sundry payments by Alumni and friends, to the late Col. Thomas H. Carter, as temporary Treasurer, amounting to $2,750.00 (as per statement filed herewith), and by him invested in 3% Virginia Century Bonds, in the name of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia. It is understood, that by re-investment of the Interest from time to time, the fund is now $3,600 par value in Century Bonds.

On motion, the Board adjourned to meet Friday, May 6th, 1910.
