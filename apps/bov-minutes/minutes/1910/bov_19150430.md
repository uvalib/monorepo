University of Virginia, Board of Visitors

April 30, 1915

Pursuant to call of the Rector, the Board met on this date at 2 o'cl p.m., with the following members present: Armistead C. Gordon, Recto Goodrich Hatton, J. W. Craddock, G.R.B. Michie and Dr. W. F. Drewry. President Alderman was also in attendance. The President announced the following gifts to the University:

$50,000 from Mr. J. B. Cobb for Chemical Laboratory.

$50,000 for Chemical Laboratory.

$10,000 from Mrs. Charles H. Senff.

$ 800 from Mr. Crane for instruments in Engineering Dep't.

$ 500 from the Seven Society for a loan fund to be known as The Loan Fund of the Seven Society.

$ 500 from University Hospital Circle for Children's Ward.

$ 235 for Oil Tank by Mr. Charles R. Crane.

$ 200 from Mr. Fairfax Harrison to be added to loan fund.

Gift of portrait of Professor Francis H. Smith.

Two books from Dr. Thomas Addis Emmett.

Walking cane of President Madison by Judge W. S. Gooch.

(Checks or cash for all of the above gifts, except the amount donate by the University Hospital Circle which has not yet been sent in, have been turned over to the Bursar.)

The following resolution was adopted:

RESOLVED: The Rector and Visitors have heard with gratification the President's announcement of the recent generous gifts to the University, and they extend to Dr. Alderman their congratulations on this accomplishment of one of his plans for the University's development.

The Rector and Visitors wish to give renewed expression to their pleasure at Dr. Alderman's restoration to health, and to reiterate their appreciation of his vital influence as President of the University. They rejoice in his return to the leadership of the University's activities, and look forward with confidence to its increased usefulness under his able guidance.

In connection with the Senff gift, Dr. Alderman presented the following letter which was directed to be entered as of record:

I am writing for my Aunt to enclose her check for Ten Thousand Dollars. She would like this gift to be a continuation of her former gift for the gate to be used for the improvement of the roads, and in memory of Mr. Senff.

We send you our best wishes for complete success in your work.

The following resolution was then offered and unanimously adopted:

RESOLVED: That the Rector and Visitors instruct the President of the University to make appropriate acknowledgment on their behalf, of the gifts above enumerated and to express to each giver the thanks of the Visitors and of the Institution.

In connection with the Cobb gift, the President presented the following correspondence he had had with Mr. Cobb:

I am very, very sorry that you cannot be with me on Founder's Day, but I shall count most confidently on having you in my home as my guest to see this place before many months have gone by. Mr. Langhorne, of course, will want you, but you must be with me for some portion of your time here.

You cannot imagine how much stimulation and gratification your letter gives me, indicating as it does your desire and your intention, unless something intervenes, to make the donation with reference to the chemical laboratory. You cannot imagine what a service it would be to us just at this time. Sometimes you know a gift if given at one moment in the life of an institution is two or three times as effective as the same gift would be at some other moment. Just now this gift would clear up the whole atmosphere in the field of our sciences, like chemistry and biology, by giving chemistry its proper place and enabling us to immediately leap to the front in this big economic subject. I do not think that a delay on your part until our Finals would be a serious thing either to the University or to the department for which the donation is needed. There are certain circumstances connect with getting the work under way which could be cleared up between now and June, and which might be delayed until the fall if the matter waits until June. that occur to me, but they could not be described as either vital or tremendously serious. My heart was set on Founder's Day for your sake rather than our own, because this is an occasion of singular dignity and simplicity, and it is the occasion upon which great services to the University, as yours would be, are usually announced and commented upon; but I await your pleasure and your good will, my dear friend, and this University and I, as its responsible head, will appreciatively await what seems to you a proper decision as to time.

My wife joins me in the warmest regards to you, Mrs. Cobb and your household.

I have just received and read with great happiness and satisfaction your letter of March 23. I feel sure that I can with entire propriety and satisfaction treat the arrangement you suggest as a donation of $50,000, and will be most happy so to do. It would be difficult for me to tell you how much real strength and helpfulness you are giving to the University of Virginia by this gift, supplying, as it will undoubtedly do, a need so urgent and acute that I have been at my wit's end to know what to do to care for it.

I shall have in mind most earnestly the suggestion you make as to your interest in that branch of chemistry which has to do with agriculture and manufacturing, and I am sure I can so order the use of your gift as to turn a considerable portion of its force in that direction. If there are any other notions in your mind about the matter, will you promptly communicate them to me?

You have done a great service to our life here, and we shall always hold it in grateful memory.

I am very glad to learn by your letter of March 27th that my proposition to make the donation of $50,000. in the form of a check for $25,000. and my note for the same amount due and payable on or before January 5th, 1916, is satisfactory to you. About the 7th or 8th of April I will send the check and note on to you. In the meantime I will be glad if you will write me whether the whole of the gift will likely be used for a single building and what part, if any, will be used for laboratory equipment. I am, of course, greatly pleased at the thought of being helpful to the University at a time when its need is urgent.

I note by your letter of March 31st that the whole of my gift to the University will be applied to a laboratory for chemistry. This is entirely agreeable to me and I think now I shall, within two or three days, send you my check for $50,000. instead of a check for $25,000. and a note for the same amount.

I saw Mr. Fuller for about an hour on the afternoon of the day he returned from Georgia and I believe he will be with you on Founder's Day.

In compliance with my recent promise to you I take pleasure in enclosing herewith my check # 66, on Guaranty Trust Co. of New York, to your order, for $50,000. This is a gift outright to the University of Virginia. I understand it is your purpose to use the proceeds of this check towards the erection of a building for a chemical laboratory. In the purpose for which the donation is to be used, in the fact that the donation is to the University of Virginia, in the certainty that a large part of such benefits as will come from the gift will go to the South, my most earnest desires are fully met and under such conditions I feel it a privilege to be able to make the donation. My original plan was to make this gift on the occasion of your return to the University last fall from your long illness but the War interfered with my intentions. Your unselfish spirit will, I know, excuse the delay.

The following resolution was unanimously adopted:

RESOLVED: That the President of the University be instructed to prepare a suitable engrossed expression of thanks to be communicated to Mr. John Blackwell Cobb for his generous gift towards the erection of a Chemical Laboratory at the University.

The President presented to the Board the following communication from the Miller Board of Trustees in re. to appointment of Prof. Ivey F. Lewis:

As Secretary of the Board of Trustees under the deed of the late Samuel Miller I am directed to say that at a meeting of the Board held this morning Mr. Ivey F. Lewis, of the University of Missouri was unanimously nominated to the Board of Visitors to fill the Chair made vacant by the resignation of Professor Albert H. Tuttle in the School established under the provisions of the deed of Samuel Miller. I am directed by the Board to request you to lay this nomination before the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia for their action.

Professor Ivey F. Lewis, of the University of Missouri, having been unanimously nominated to the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia by the Board of Trustees under the Samuel Miller deed as Miller Professor of Biology and Agriculture to succeed Professor A. H. Tuttle, it is hereby RESOLVED: That Professor Ivey F. Lewis is hereby elected Professor of Biology and Agriculture in the University of Virginia at a salary of $3,000, his incumbency to begin September 13, 1915. The Secretary of this Board is instructed to communicate this action to the Secretary of the Miller Board of Trustees.

(The Rector, being a kinsman of Prof. Lewis, declined to vote.)

Judge Duke, Secretary of the Miller Board of Trustees, transmitted to the Board, through the President, the following resolution of said Miller Board:

At a meeting of the Board of Trustees under the deed of Samuel Miller the following resolution was unanimously adopted:

RESOLVED: That this Board will at its June, 1915 meeting make appropriation of the fund at its disposal, and in making the nomination for the Chair made vacant by the resignation of Professor Albert H. Tuttle it is the sense of this Board that the Department of which the newly nominated Professor is to be the head if elected by the Board of Visitors - should be reorganized by the latter Board so as to carry out as far as practicable with the fund available, the purposes of Mr. Miller, and that this Board will hereafter proceed to appropriate the entire net income of the Miller Fund to the support of the department of which the new professor is to be the head.

(A copy from the minutes)

Teste:

The following regulations adopted by the Medical Faculty April 5th, 1915, were presented, and, having received approval of the President, were unanimously approved, as follows: RESOLVED: That the Rector and Visitors approve the following regulation adopted by the Medical Faculty at the meeting of that faculty April 5th, 1915.

Beginning with the session of 1917-18 the entrance requirements of the Department of Medicine will be as follows:

Applicants for admission to the Department of Medicine will be required to furnish evidence of the completion of a four-year course at a recognized public high school, or acceptable certificates which represent work equivalent in amount and character to such a high school course, and, in addition, to present evidence of the completion at an approved institution of collegia rank of two years of work of not less than 15 session-hours each. This college course must include a year's work in each of the following subjects: English (rhetoric, composition and literatur Mathematics (solid geometry and trigonometry), Inorganic (General) Chemistry, Physics, Biology, and either German or French.

A student otherwise qualified may be admitted conditioned upon one of these subjects, the condition to be removed before admission to the second year of the medical course, but no condition may be allowed in Chemistry, English, or Mathematics.

The modern language (German or French) course must be based upon two years of high school work in that language, or its equivalent; but a candidate may absolve the requirement in this subject by demonstrating on examination the possession of a satisfactory reading knowledge thereof.

A year's work in either general biology, zoology or botany will be accepted as satisfying the requirement in biology; but zoology is considered preferable to botany, and it is desirable that the course should include the dissection of a mammal.

The President presented the following communication from Dr. Wm. E. Hopkins, which was read, discussed and referred to a special Committee consisting of the Rector, Mr. Michie, and Dr. Alderman, to consider and determine the best disposition of it.

Some eight years ago, I notified the University that in drafting my will I had inserted a clause bequeathing it the sum of thirty thousand (30,000) dollars; the purpose of the gift being the erection of a teaching building on the grounds of the University; and that I had made this bequest in response to a feeling of deep gratitude to the University for the inestimable service it did for me during my student days of long ago.

Some time later, while on a visit to the University, I mentioned to you that it would give me great satisfaction if the school could be placed in possession of this fund, during my life, and so avoid any possible future complication but I realized my moderate fortune would not permit me to spare the quite considerable income this money would produce; but if the University could see its way clear to guarantee me a moderate return, I would be willing to transfer the sum immediately. I learned, however, that this was not practicable, so, after some delay, I invested the money (at the time a cash bank deposit) in bonds, chiefly railroad bonds, (then in good standing), securing thirty-five thousand, par value, in bonds, for thirty thousand in cash. Since the purchase, owing to financial difficulties in general, railroad finances in particular, the war and other causes, there has been very considerable depreciation in the value of these securities, the loss at one time reaching eight thousand dollars on the purchase price, since the beginning of the year there has been considerable appreciation, I am glad to say, and the loss now stands at less than five thousand dollars.

The income received from these various securities amounts to $1420 a year.

If the University should now be inclined to reconsider its action, I would be perfectly willing to turn over the cash received from the sale of the thirty-five thousand dollars (par value) in bonds, the University crediting me with the actual cost to me, thirty-thousand dollars, and paying me an income equal to four (4) per cent, net on the cost price. Conditional upon such present action, I should require the money to be used in erecting a teaching building, bearing my name, and so placed in the general scheme of the University that it could and would be continued in use for similar teaching purposes should the medical department at any time be removed to another locality.

The building to be attractive in appearance and of such character as to harmonize with the general plan of the University, and the construction to be such as to insure its permanence. I desire the right to pass on the plans before actual construction is begun.

I should also consider it a great privilege to be present and allowed to formally present the complete building to the University.

The transfer of the securities, or the cash received from their sale, to be carried out in a legal way; and the time of transfer to be decided later, so the securities may be disposed of to the best advantage.

I would respectfully state that the above is entirely my own tentative point of view, and it is so submitted for your consideration and discussion.

While I have frankly stated the best I can do at this time, or, as I believe, during my life, I do not wish to influence the present attitude or action of the University in any way. The Governing Board must decide whether it is for the best interest of the institution to await the complete cash bequest or to accept now the reduced amount with conditions attached.

The Board being apprised of the death of Mr. Karl Bitter, due to an accident in New York City, and that it had been his intention to be present at the unveiling of the Jefferson statue, on April 13, unanimously adopted the following resolution:

RESOLVED: That the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia desire to put on record the expression of their sorrow for the recent death of Mr. Karl Bitter, whose genius as a sculptor has contributed to the beauty of the University, and whose interest in the welfare of the institution was evinced in a very generous manner in many instances.

That a copy of this resolution be sent by the Secretary of the Board to Mrs. Bitter.

The following, in appreciation of the services of Mr. Henry Bacon in connection with the plans for the Entrance Gate, was adopted:

RESOLVED: That the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia desire to put on record the expression of their very great appreciation of the generosity of Mr. Henry Bacon in his services rendered in connection with the Memorial Gate, for which he furnished the plans; and that the Secretary of the Board be instructed to send a copy of this resolution to Mr. Bacon, with the sincere thanks of the Rector and Visitors.

The matter of designating the National Bank of Charlottesville as a depository of the University, which was considered at the last meeting of the Board and referred to the Finance Committee, was favorably reported by said committee and disposed of in the following resolution which was adopted:

RESOLVED: That the Bursar be and he is authorized to deposit the current funds and deposits of the University with the three banks in Charlottesville, viz: The Peoples National, the Jefferson National and the National Bank of Charlottesville, upon the same terms and conditions as those now in force with the two banks now used as depositors.

The following report was received and ordered spread:

The Rector of the University having reported to the Board that pursuant to resolution of the Board heretofore adopted, he went to Norfolk, Virginia, and on the 24th day of March 1914, received from and receipted to the Norfolk Bank for Savings and Trusts, as Executor of the late Dr. B. W. Green, the personal estate of said Dr. Green, as listed in the settlement of said Executor by the Commissioner of Accounts of Albemarle County; and then and there turned over said estate to the Bursar of the University, who then and there deposited the said estate, represented by securities and money as stated in said settlement with the said Norfolk Bank for Savings and Trusts, as a duly authorized depository of the University:

RESOLVED: That the Board ratify and approve the action of the Rector and Bursar in the premises.

The Bursar presented to the Board a letter from Mr. Bentley W. Warren, Trustee of the Austin Estate, re disposition of certain real estate belonging to the said estate, as follows:

I have your letter of April 3rd and thank you for the kind expressions, &c.

You may recall that a year ago I had some correspondence with you respecting the two houses 414 and 416 Newbury Street, the title to which came into the estate through foreclosure of mortgages which had been taken by the Trustee predecessor to both Mr. Endicott and myself. When our predecessor took those mortgages, he had reason to believe that the section of the city was one in which values would remain at least stable and would perhaps improve. This has not proved to be the case, and the value of the two houses seems pretty steadily to depreciate. The lots back onto the Boston & Albany Railroad, which makes the location undesirable for a good class of residences At the same time the lots are restricted, so that buildings on them cannot be used for business purposes, and the class of tenants available is very undesirable. The houses are assessed at $8,000 each. They stand the estate; # 414 about $8,175 and # 416 about $9,282. As you will see from the account for the past year, # 416 gave us a net income of only $240.95, while # 414 paid practically nothing and its ownership involved considerable expense. We spent considerable money on # 414 to put it in condition satisfactory to a prospective tenant for a lodging house. Shortly after she took possession it transpired that she was not keeping the proper kind of lodging house, and we had to terminate her tenancy. I think at the present time it might be possible to sell the two houses together for $12,000, or perhaps a little more. While it is always dangerous to predict how future developments may affect real estate values, my impression is that the University would be better off if we sold the houses and invested the proceeds. Securities are relatively low at the present time, as of course you appreciate. I should like to know whether you would approve a sale of this real estate for $12,000, or more, of course, if we can get a better offer, or whether you think we had better hold on to the property.

For your information, I may add that the Legislature has, at its present session, passed an act making it possible to register free from restrictions land which, on the record, is subject to restrictions, if the Court thinks such action is required by the equities of the case or by public interests. While the constitutionality of this act is not free from doubt, it seems to have been carefully drawn in an attempt to meet constitutional objections to its validity. Should you feel that we had better not attempt a sale of the property at $12,000, I think the best course then for us to pursue, and that which we probably should pursue, would be to attempt to have the title to the land registered free from the restrictions.

I enclose the twentieth account of Mr. Endicott and myself for your examination, and a copy of the same for your files.

Pursuant with the foregoing the following resolution was adopted:

RESOLVED: That it is the sense of this Board that the Austin Estate Trustees be authorized to exercise their own discretion in the matter of dealing with the two houses, 414 and 416 Newbury Street, either selling the property, or taking action with reference to removing restriction on the property under the Massachusetts statute, as they may think best.

The Bursar stated to the Board that it was his opinion that better results could be obtained in renting rooms in the Randall Building if the restrictions as to boarding at the Commons was removed, especially in view of the fact that the proprietor of the Commons agrees not to insist upon the carrying out of the contract as now existing in that regard; whereupon the following resolution was adopted:

RESOLVED: That the regulations heretofore existing requiring occupants of rooms in Randall Building to board at the Commons, be rescinded for the session of 1915-16.

Report of the Committee to whom was referred the matter of Roanoke Rapids lot:

By an instrument in writing purporting to be a deed, and dated May 10th, 1912, John Armstrong Chaloner states that thereby he conveys certain real estate situated at Roanoke Rapids, Halifax County, North Carolina, to the University of Virginia, and the University of North Carolina, jointly, reserving to himself a life estate therein; and this instrument is recorded in the Clerk's Office of Albemarle County, Virginia, in Deed Book 150, page 136.

On the 20th of January, 1915, Mr. John L. Patterson, Secretary of the Board of School Trusttes of Roanoke Rapids, addressed a letter to this Board, enclosing therewith copies of several letters with reference to the acquisition by said Board of School Trustees of two lots in Roanoke Rapids, which are parts of the property which Mr. Chaloner refers to in the above names instrument. And in Mr. Patterson's letter of January 20, 1915, he states that Mr. Chaloner was willing to donate the lots for the purposes of the Board of School Trustees, and he asks that this Board take such steps as it may deem necessary for the purpose of conveying to the Board of School Trustees whatever interest the University of Virginia may have in these lots by virtue of Mr. Chaloner's gift.

At a meeting of the Board held on the 9th of March, 1915, —;"The question as to whether or not the University has a right to join in a deed conveying its rights in this property was discussed at length, and, owing to the uncertain position of the University in the premises, the whole matter was referred to the Rector to investigate."

The whole matter was referred by the Rector to Mr. W. Allan Perkins, Attorney for the University, with instructions to investigate the situation thoroughly, and make report thereon.

Mr. Perkins at once took the matter up with Mr. Patterson, and on the 27th of March, 1915, Mr. Patterson stated in a letter to Mr. Perkins that after further consideration, Mr. Chaloner felt that it would be unwise for him to convey the lots in question to the Board of School Trustees, and that in view of this conclusion on his part, he must refuse to unite in a deed for that purpose.

In the mean time, however, the Board of School Trustees of Roanoke Rapids had instituted condemnation proceedings in the Superior Court of Halifax County, North Carolina, for the purpose of obtaining title to the lots in question, and Mr. Patterson now asks that instead of uniting in a deed with Mr. Chaloner, his Board is anxious to have a statement from the Universities of Virginia and North Carolina to the effect that these institutions have no objection to the acquisition of these lots by the Board of School Trustees of Roanoke Rapids, such statements to be used by the Board before the Court in the condemnation proceedings above referred to.

Mr. Patterson has been advised that the situation will be laid before this Board at its present meeting.

Page 15 begins at this point to continue on page 28a.

The regular annual meeting of the Board of Visitors was held on this date with the following present: Armistead C. Gordon, Rector, Goodrich Hatton, R. Tate Irvine, John W. Craddock, Wm. H. White, G. B. R. Michie, Dr. W. F. Drewry, Walter Tansill Oliver and Dr. Frank W. Lewis.

Dr. Lewis, succeeding Judge Jos. W. Chinn, resigned, presented to the Board his qualification as a Visitor of the University of Virginia.

Minutes of the previous meeting were read and approved.

The President announced the following gifts to the University:

$1250 - Adams Research Fellowship from Columbia University - has been given to Professor Mitchell for the second time, a very unusual distinction. The gift is made on the condition that he contribute 4000 hours of work to the advancement of science.

$ 500 - from Smith Fund, National Academy of Sciences - out of compliment to Dr. Olivier, the greatest authority in America on meteors.

$ 250 - Draper Fund, National Academy of Sciences - for part cost of a measuring machine.

The above gifts to the Astronomical work of the University amount to $2000.

I want to donate one thousand dollars to the University because of my loyalty to her, and for what she stands and has done - not that that sum is the measure of my estimate of her worth or my admiration.

It would please me if this sum although so small and of itself inadequate for the purpose might be applied to the first of the needs you spoke of on Founder's day, namely instruction to train the capable youth to perform skillfully, justly, and righteously, the work of this great industrial era and to become capable and right minded business men. I do not make this the condition of donation, however, and if impossible of such application, would place the sum in your hands for such other purpose for the University as you might think most useful.

I should be glad to send my check as soon as I shall be informed that it will be accepted, and should prefer that my name be withheld from general publication in this matter.

I was a student at the University during the four years 1877-1881, and am now an officer of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company and in that corporation's service since graduation.

I hope that you will let me hear from you at your convenience.

Decrease in the total of University fees for Virginians,

$1250.

Increase in the total of Tuition Fees for all students,

$1250.

Net change on the average —; Zero.

I learn from the Bursar that the new schedule of fees in Engineering announced in the catalogue will have to receive your formal approval and be validated by action of the Board of Visitors before it is put into force.

This plan was submitted to you last fall and at that time was accepted. The statement prepared for the catalogue was taken by me to your office. You were absent, and, to save delay, I passed it on to the Catalogue Committee. It came thus to be printed without your definite authorization.

The reason for the change is found in the growing number of students who desire to add some course or fraction of a course in Engineering to their scientific equipment. Such men pay not only the tuition but the $40.00 University Fee. Thus a single course in Electrical Engineering would cost such a man $25. (tuition) plus $5. (laboratory fee) plus $30. (addition to University fee) —; total $60. A single term in the same work would cost $40. The men apply for relief from these charges, which they feel to be exorbitant. Under our laws they have heretofore applied in vain.

The proposed remedy consists of two parts—; First, a reduction of the University fee for Virginians only to $20.00, this seems reasonable because about half the work of all such students is in the College.

Second, an increase of the tuition fees in the technical courses for all students; from $25. to $30. for the lecture courses, and from $10. to $15. for the drafting courses; this seems reasonable because of the large volume of individual instruction given in these technical courses.

These changes just about balance each other. Out of every 100 students in Engineering, 60 to 65 are Virginians. The change in income will then be as follows in an average year for each 100 students:-

If you are reluctant to commend to the Visitors a change figured with so close a margin, the University fee might be reduced from $40. to $25. This would make per 100 students.

Decrease $938:—;Increase $1250:—;Balance $312, in favor of the University.

A special Committee of three appointed by the Executive Committee of the General Alumni Association to consider, with power to act, the question of financing the Secretary of the Alumni Association and his office, begs leave to announce to the Board of Visitors that it has decided to recommend to the Alumni Association that it guarantee the sum of $2500.00 yearly for three years, which with the $1500.00 a year appropriated by the Board of Visitors for the same purpose and which we assume will be continued, will make $4000.00 a year, the sum estimated sufficient to conduct this important work.
