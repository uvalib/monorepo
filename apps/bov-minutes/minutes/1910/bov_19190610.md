At its meeting, June 7th, 1919, the General Faculty of the University of Virginia voted that the following minutes be sent to each member of Base Hospital Unit # 41.

"The President and Faculty of the University of Virginia wish to express to each member of Base Hospital No. 41 their pride in the record made by this representative of the University in France and their satisfaction at your safe return. We watched with interest and growing pleasure the origin, organization, and progress of our Unit; and we envy your your opportunity for immediate service to our soldiers at the front.

"We hope that it will be possible for you to assemble again as a unit at no distant date in this common home of all of us, in order that we may express in a personal manner our appreciation of your work in the cause of human liberty, a service which adds another chapter to the history of the University of Virginia in the service of mankind. Meanwhile we would convey to each and all of your our congratulations upon your record of successful and honorable achievement and our proud appreciation of your organization as a representative of this University in active military service."

The Rector and Visitors of the University, at their meeting on June 10th, passed the following resolution regarding the action of the President and Faculty:

"The Rector and Visitors have heard with pleasure the resolution by the President and Faculty of the University concerning the University of Virginia Base Hospital No. 41, and desire to express their hearty agreement with these resolutions and to order that they be placed as a permanent minute upon the records of the Institution."

(Note): No salary will be attached to this appointment, under rules of the Carnegie Foundation on which Prof. Dunnington has retired.)

The following resolution concerning the resignation of Adjunct Prof. E. F. Shewmake, Jr., was adopted:

RESOLVED: That the Rector and Visitors of the University accept with regret the resignation of Prof. E. F. Shewmake, Jr., Adjunct Professor of English at the University, who goes to accept a full professorship of English at Davidson College. Prof. Shewmake's career here was marked by attention to duty, scholarship, and very high quality of teaching; and the President and Board of Visitors wish for him great usefulness at the old college which is so closely related to Virginia.

The following resolution concerning the resignation of Mr. Howard Winston, Registrar, was adopted:

RESOLVED: That the Rector and Visitors of the University accept with regret the resignation of Mr. Howard Winston, who has for the past sixteen years been Registrar of the University. The Institution is under great obligation to him for his constancy and duty-doing work, and begs him to accept their good wishes upon his retirement.

The question of demolishing the old brick building located on Main Street, just east of the C. & O. bridge and known as the old Dispensary, was referred to the Grounds and Buildings Committee with power to act.

The proposal of the University Shop, Incorporated, to lease the central room in the Entrance Building for a term of five years was referred to the Grounds and Buildings Committee with power to act.

The following resolution designating the Trust Department of the Peoples National Bank of Charlottesville as an additional trustee and depository of the University was adopted:

RESOLVED, That the Trust Department of the Peoples National Bank of Charlottesville be designated as an additional trustee and depository of the University of Virginia; said trustee to hold and invest such funds under the direction of the Finance Committee and to collect the income on said securities and to remit therefor in January and July of each year; and that the Finance Committee examine the securities and funds now held by the Bursar and direct the deposit of such securities and funds as the committee deems desirable with the Trust Department of the Peoples National Bank of Charlottesville as Trustee, upon the terms and conditions set out in the above resolution relative to the creation of said bank as a local trustee.

The following resolution concerning the suspension of the contingent deposit regulation was adopted:

WHEREAS, the establishment of the S.A.T.C. Unit at the University of Virginia for the session 1918-19, made it impracticable to collect from the members of said unit the usual contingent deposit, and

WHEREAS, it has been demonstrated to the officers of the University during said session, that the deposit of $10.00, known as the contingent deposit and heretofore required of each student to cover the cost of breakage and damage to property and library fines, with the option to subscribe from said deposit to the Chapel, Magazine, Law Review, and the Virginia Union, is no longer essential for the recovery of damage to property or to protect the library against loss, or to provide working funds for the other activities as mentioned, therefore be it

RESOLVED, That the regulation with regard to the contingent deposit be suspended until further directions by the Board.

4\. That the recommendation of the Faculty in the case of Mr. Munford Boyd be adopted - i.e., as Mr. Boyd is totally blind, he is allowed to absolve the degree requirements in the Natural Sciences by passing on the lecture courses in four of these Sciences instead of lecture and laboratory courses in two of these Sciences.

5\. That in accordance with the recommendation of the Academic Faculty, three (3) session-hours credit shall be granted until further notice, for German I, provided that the candidate for this credit shall also complete German B-1.

On motion, the leave of absence for Dr. W. Thos. Page, Professor of Economics, was extended for the session 1919-20, that he might continue the services of the United States Tariff Board.

The following offer by Mr. Michie was asopted:

RESOLVED, That Mr. Bryan and the Bursar be requested to examine and report upon the securities of the University of Virginia deposited with the Virginia Trust Company, and that Mr. Hatton and the Bursar be requested to examine and report upon the securities deposited with the Norfolk Trust Company, Norfolk, Virginia.

The Bursar submitted the following report covering the final settlement between the War Department and the University of Virginia in connection with contracts with Sections A and B of the Students' Army Training Corps. The report was received and ordered spread.

I beg to advise that final settlement has been made between the War Department and the University of Virginia covering contracts for Section A and Section B of the Students' Army Training Corps as follows:

Section A. Our final claim for reimbursement of cost was allowed in the sum of $16,928.65.

Section B. Under the final settlement for Section B, we were indebted to the War Department in the sum of $25,281.70, and which represented the excess of payments made by the War Department on monthly vouchers submitted on the basis of the contract over and above the actual costs of conducting said section. The final settlement was made for Section B on the basis outlined to the Board at its last meeting by Professor Newcomb, which was to the effect that the University is to retain the buildings and equipment in lieu of the cost of restoration of the golf links, etc. A certified check payable to the Treasurer of the United States for $8,353.04, the difference between the amounts above stated, has been accepted by the War Department in final settlement.

The following resolution was adopted in connection with a release deed for W. M. Hill, Jr.:

Fife, trustees, and duly recorded in Deed Book 216-A, page 412 in the Clerk's Office of the Corporation Court of the City of Norfolk, has been fully paid it is hereby RESOLVED, That the Rector be and is authorized in the name and on behalf of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia to join with said trustees in a proper release deed and that the seal of this corporation be affixed and attested by the proper officer.

Prof. Chas. G. Maphis presented in person his estimated budget for the summer school for the session 1919 as follows:

The budget was approved as follows:

The following communication was received from Mrs. Kate A. Tuttle, Chairman of the Scholarship Committee, Albemarle Chapter D. A. R., concerning the change in name of the scholarship given by the said chapter, and the same was approved by the Board.

I am requested by the Albemarle Chapter, Daughters of the American Revolution, to advise you that the scholarship now standing in its name was, on June the fifth, named by the Chapter in honor of Lieutenant Robert Hancock Wood, Jr., Aviator U. S. A.

As Mrs. Robert Hancock Wood, Sr., is the only member of this Chapter who has lost a son in this war, it is fitting that this memorial should be named for this soldier, a native of Albemarle County and an alumnus of the University of Virginia.

Upon motion the meeting adjourned.
