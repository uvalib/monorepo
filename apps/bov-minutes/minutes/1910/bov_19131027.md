University of Virginia, Board of Visitors

October 27, 1913

At a called meeting of the Board of Visitors in the office of the President, East Lawn, on above date,

Present: Rector Gordon, Visitors White, Michie, Craddock, Oliver, and Drewry; also Dr. James M. Page, Acting President.

The Rector having called the Board to order at 10:30 a.M., the following was adopted:-

Resolved: That the resolutions adopted by this Board at their meeting of June 16, 1913, be and are hereby approved and re-adopted.

Whereas, Miss Lena Barksdale was employed as Assistant in the library for the year ending September 15, 1913, and Whereas no provision was made in the annual budget adopted by this Board for paying her salary from July 1 to September 15, 1913, be it therefore,

Resolved: That the sum of $41.65, be and is hereby appropriated for the purpose of paying Miss Barksdales' salary for period indicated.

Whereas, Mr. J. O. Beaty, a student in the Department of Graduate Studies of this University, took up at the beginning of the session certain courses in the Department of Law, with a view to broadening his general education, and paid $25.00 tuition for the same; and, whereas, the said Beaty has discovered that he has more work, both as Assistant and as Graduate Student, than he can do, and must drop the classes which he took up in law, be it therefore,

Resolved: That $20.00, of the tuition paid by him in law, be returned to the said Beaty by the Bursar of the University.

Dean Page brought to the attention of the Board the request of Mr. Bernard S. Via for a return of a portion of the University Fee paid by him for the present session. The Board of Visitors agreed to return to Mr. Via the sum of $7.50 on account of his withdrawal to enter the ministry.

The request of Miss Holmes for permission to remove the portrait of her father, the late Professor Holmes, to her own room, was not granted.

Resolved: That Mr. C. T. Steger be and is hereby appointed Instructor in Germanic Languages for the current session at a total salary of $600.00.

Resolved: That the sum of $450.00 or, as much thereof as may prove to be necessary, be and is hereby appropriated for repairs and improvements to the Dispensary Building.

Resolved: That the sum of $292.50 be and is hereby appropriated to pay for five microscopes for the Department of Histology and Embryology.

Resolved, first: That the sum of $2,000.00 be and is hereby appropriated to the School of Practical Astronomy for purchasing apparatus necessary for carrying on the work of that school.

Second: Whereas, the sum of $500.00 was included in the annual budget, adopted June 16th, 1913, for paying the salary of Mr. C. N. Wunder, and, whereas, the election of a full professor to the Chair of Astronomy has removed the necessity of employing Mr. Wunder again, be it therefore Resolved, that the said $500.00 be and is hereby appropriated for the purpose of purchasing apparatus necessary for carrying on the work of the School of Astronomy, making the total appropriation for this purpose $2500.00.

Whereas, there is at present no incumbent of the Miller Professorship of Biology and Agriculture in this University, and, whereas, this fact causes the Trustees of the Miller Fund to hesitate with regard to paying over to the University of Virginia, as is usually done, the whole of $6000.00 annual interest on the endowment, be it therefore,

Resolved: That the following committee of this Board be and is hereby appointed to confer with the Trustees of the Miller Fund, with a view to straightening out this matter—; Mr. G. R. B. Michie and Dean J. M. Page.

Resolved, first, That the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia accept with appreciative thanks, the valuable gift to the University Library, by Dr. James Mercer Garnett, of a copy (probably unique) of a work entitled, "Tables of Comparative Etymology and Analogeous Formations in the Greek, Latin, Spanish, Italian, French, English, and German languages; or, the Student's Manual of Languages, designed to facilitate the study of them, by a connected view of their declensions, methods of comparison, conjugations, interchangeable letters, and similar terminations" by John Lewis. The Greek by G. Long; The German by G. Blaetterman, Professor of Ancient and Modern Languages in the University of Virginia; Philadelphia: Published by Carey, e & Carey—;Chestnut Street, 1828 Quarto.

Second, That a copy of this resolution be transmitted to Dr. Garnett by the Secretary of this Board.

Resolved: That, subject to the approval of the President of the University, the sum of $600.00 be and is hereby appropriated for the purpose of cataloguing the departmental libraries of the University, and the library of the late Dr. B. W. Green. This appropriation is made on the understanding that this money will be returned to the general fund of the University out of the first funds paid into the general library from the estate of the late Dr. B. W. Green.

Resolved: That the sum of $1,000.00 or as much thereof as may be necessary, be and is hereby appropriated for repairs and improvements to the Mallet House.

Resolved, further, that this work be carried out under the supervision of the Superintendent of Buildings and Grounds; and that this appropriation is made subject to the approval of the President of the University.

Resolved: That Dr. James Morris Page be nominated by the Rector and Visitors to the General Assembly for election to membership upon the State Board of Education, for the term beginning March 1915.

The following letter to Dean Page, was presented to the Board for consideration,—;

In accordance with the agreement at the conference between Dr. P. H. Whitehead, Dean of the Medical Department of the University of Virginia, Dr. Stuart McGuire, Dean of the Medical College of Virginia, and myself, in this city on Thursday evening last, the Executive Committee of the Medical College of Virginia yesterday appointed a committee of five to confer with a similar committee to be appointed by the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia to discuss plans looking to the union of the medical schools in this state. The committee consists of—;

L. J. Morris, Chairman,

Eppa Hunton, Jr., Esq.

E. L. Bemis,

John W. Williams, Esq.

S. C. Mitchell.

If it is the pleasure of the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia to appoint a similar committee, our committee will be glad to meet with them at some time that may be agreeable to you.

Trusting sincerely that the joint committee will be able to find a basis of agreement, I am,

In view of the foregoing, it was,—;

Resolved: That, at the invitation of the Medical College of Virginia, the following committee be appointed to meet with a similar committee, already appointed, from the Medical College of Virginia to discuss and report for the consideration of this Board, tentative plans for consolidating the two Medical colleges in the State, under the control of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia.

| Mr. White, (The committee continued) |  |

The following letter from Mr. J. L. Newcomb, Chairman with reference to the Dining-hall contract, was read and approved;-

On September 1, 1913, I, as Chairman of the Commons Committee, entered into a contract with Charles Jaimes Leasing the University Commons for the period of one year. The terms of this agreement are exactly the same as authorized by the Rector and Board of Visitors in the spring of 1912, except that in lieu of a surety bond guaranteeing the safe return of the University's property, I accepted a $50.00 a month deposit with the Bursar of the University. It was impossible for Mr. Jaimes to secure the bond required, and I substituted this cash deposit because I believed that the University's interests were amply safeguarded thereby, and on account of the limited time, it was impossible for me to wait for authority from the Board.

Hoping that you will present this matter to the Board, and that it will meet with their approval, I am,

Resolved: That the sum of $260.45 be and is hereby appropriated to purchase new linen and crockery for the Dining-Hall.

Resolved, first, That the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, desire to enter a minute expressive of their keen appreciation of the loyalty and benevolence of the late Edward J. Folkes, of Lynchburg, Virginia, in founding two scholarships in the institution in memory of the late William C. Folkes. It is difficult to estimate the great good which will be accomplished through all future years by these scholarships, or to measure the increase of the University in reaching out to young men who otherwise could not come within the sphere of her influence.

Second, That a copy of this resolution be transmitted to the members of Mr. Folkes family.

Resolved, first, That the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia desire to enter this minute expressive of their deep appreciation of the noble bequest which comes to the University under the will of that worthy and affectionate son of Alma Mater, Dr. Bennett Wood Green. It is difficult to estimate the great good which will accrue to the Institution through future years from this foundation. In particular, the General Library, which will receive the benefit of the bulk of the bequest, will, as the "heart" of the University, pulse ever hereafter with new vigor, sending generous and powerful streams of vitality to all members of the institutional body.

Second, That a copy of this resolution be transmitted to the members of Dr. Green's family.

Whereas, it recently became emergent to make repairs to the Rotunda and rectangle appurtenant thereto, and to expend the sum of Four Thousand ($4,000.00) Dollars for that purpose; therefore be it—;

Resolved: That this fact be brought to the attention of the General Assembly with the request that the University be re-imbursed the above sum.

Resolved: That it is the sense of the Board that President Alderman be requested to delay his return to his official duties at the University until his medical advisers shall state that he can do so with perfect safety to his health, and that the Rector be requested to communicate this resolution to President Alderman with the greetings and kind regards of the Rector and Visitors, and an expression of their sincere pleasure at the news of his progress towards recovery.

Resolved: That Dean Page be continued in his duties as heretofore performed, in connection with the administration of the University, at the same rate of compensation, until President Alderman's return.

The Bursar brought to the attention of the Board, the question of insurance on the "Colonnade Club Annex", stating that he had paid the premium on a policy of $4,000 on said annex, and that another for a like sum would be written when the building is complete, and asked for instructions in charging the said premiums. A letter from the President of the Club was read, stating that the Club did not feel that it should be called upon to pay the insurance, as the annex is distinctly University property; and especially in view of the fact that the Club has contributed the sum of $4,000 towards its erection.

The Board instructed the Bursar to treat the insurance on said annex in the same manner as that on other University property.

Complying with request of Dean W. M. Thornton of the Engineering Department for a special appropriation to cover cost of additional lockers for his department, it was

Resolved: That the sum of $100.00 be appropriated for this purpose.

The request of Dr. R. H. Whitehead, Dean of the Medical Department, for a special appropriation of $100.00 to cover cost of additional assistance in the School of Anatomy, was granted.

On motion the Board adjourned subject to call of the Rector.

In accordance with the agreement at the conference between Dr. P. H. Whitehead, Dean of the Medical Department of the University of Virginia, Dr. Stuart McGuire, Dean of the Medical College of Virginia, and myself, in this city on Thursday evening last, the Executive Committee of the Medical College of Virginia yesterday appointed a committee of five to confer with a similar committee to be appointed by the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia to discuss plans looking to the union of the medical schools in this state.
