The Chairman of the Finance Committee, Mr. McWane, submitted for the Board's consideration the proposed 1961-1962 University Budget, copies of which had previously been mailed to each member of the Board. Mr. McWane reported that the Finance Committee had met with the President and the Comptroller on 12 May 1961 for a detailed review of the proposed Budget and that the Finance Committee, at the conclusion of its meeting, had unanimously approved the Budget as recommended. Accordingly, Mr. McWane proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution:

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the proposed 1961-1962 University Budget as recommended by the President and as approved by the Finance Committee be and it is hereby approved.

The President presented to each member of the Board a copy of his progress report on the long-range plans for the University. He summarized the contents of his progress report which dealt with the mission of the University, faculty, financial support, the University of Virginia Press, and capital outlay requests for the forthcoming six-year period. He explained that he had prepared the progress report to bring the Board up to date on the progress that had been made by the University Long-Range Planning Committee and that his progress report had been based upon information he had received from the Committee. He explained that a further report would be made, on the basis of which he hoped the Board could take action in setting forth the goals which the University should look forward to achieving in the next 15 years.

In concluding his remarks, the President stated that he had established two priority items for the forthcoming year of 1961-1962. One of these was the concentration of his efforts on building the faculty and particularly increasing the emphasis on graduate work in arts and sciences at the University. He also pointed out that the forthcoming year was a biennial budget year and that a large amount of his time would have to be spent on budget preparation and appearances before the General Assembly next January and February. In order to do this it would be necessary, he informed the Board, to reduce his outside activities including appearances before alumni chapters and other groups. He stressed his belief that in electing him the Board had expected him to develop the academic strength of the University and that since he assumed office in August 1959, a major portion of his time had had to be spent on other matters. He hoped to bring his work back into balance in the forthcoming year.

The President proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution:

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that Mr. William M. Griffin be and he is hereby elected Assistant Secretary of the Board of Visitors for the period 1 August 1961 to 31 July 1962, to serve during the leave of absence of Mr. Francis L. Berkeley, Jr.

The President proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution:

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that, effective 1 September 1961, each person applying for admission to a degree program in any college or school of the University shall pay an application fee of $10 which shall be non-refundable, provided, however, that the effective date of this resolution for students applying for admission to the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences shall be set by the President.

The President presented a detailed report on the requests for admissions to the College and the several schools of the University. He noted that there had been a sharp increase in applications for admission to the College of Arts and Sciences and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and commented in detail on the implications of this increase.

The President proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution:

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the Hospital Accounts Committee be and it is hereby authorized to charge off as uncollectible accounts Schedules 994, 995, 998, and 999, aggregating $61,275.80, as recommended by it, consisting of the following:

The President announced the gift of a mace to the University by The Seven Society on last Founder's Day. He stated that the mace had been placed on display in the President's Office and hoped that each member would see it during the meeting of the Board.

The President reported on his conversations with the committee formed in the Covington-Clifton Forge area looking to the establishment of a community college in that area to be affiliated with the University of Virginia. He stated that the committee had done an excellent piece of work and there was every indication of strong support in the area for a community college. He pointed out, however, that population studies had shown a rather stabilized population growth and that there was a serious question as to whether the proposed college would be able to attract enough students to make the venture economically feasible and worthwhile in terms of taking care of the expected increase in applications for college admission by Virginia students. He stated his intention to continue the negotiations and to report further to the Board as developments warranted.

The President stated further that he would confer with a committee from the Lynchburg area which likewise was interested in establishing a community college to be affiliated with the University of Virginia.

The President reported on the administrative arrangements he had made for certain students who would be unable to be present, for personal reasons, on the day assigned for registration in September 1961. While these students would still be liable for the non-remittable portion ($5.00) of the late registration fee of $15.00 as required by the Board resolution of 11 December 1953, the President stated that he had been able to make arrangements by which the students involved would not suffer a penalty in terms of choice of courses and sections because of late registration.

The President reported that he had been in consultation with Mr. Lewis in connection with the proposals made by Mr. Lewis at the meeting of the Board on 8 April 1961 looking to a closer relationship of Board members through the President with the faculty of the University. The President stated that he plans to call in from time to time the deans of the several schools for direct reports to the Board. In this connection he asked for the Board's views on a Friday meeting prior to the regular meeting in October of 1961, at which time one or more of the deans could be brought in to report to the Board and afterwards there could be a social gathering with other members of the faculty.

After discussion, it was decided that specific proposals for an additional Friday meeting in October should be prepared by the President and should be acted upon by the Executive Committee in ample time for the scheduling of such a meeting.

The President proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution:

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the plan of compensation for the Clinical Faculty of the School of Medicine adopted by resolution of the Board on 9 March 1957 (Minute Book, University of Virginia, No. 12, 9 March 1957, pp. 7-8) be amended to increase, for the fiscal year 1960-1961, the limit of earnings from $22,500 to $25,000.

The President proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution:

WHEREAS the field house-auditorium-gymnasium building to be constructed at Copeley Hill will meet many vital needs of the University of Virginia, such as providing adequate space and facilities for indoor intercollegiate athletics, an auditorium with proper acoustics, seating, and equipment for concerts, dramatic productions, and other cultural programs, sufficient seating for lectures, convocations, or other major academic events, suitable accommodations for large meetings of local, statewide, and regional groups having an appropriate call upon the educational facilities of the University, and

WHEREAS such a building serving many functions of the University of Virginia important to the life of the University and to the Commonwealth should be fittingly named,

NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the building be and it is hereby named University Hall.

The President reported that the Finance Committee of the Board, at its meeting on 12 May 1961, had adopted a resolution recommending to the Board the purchase of the University Gardens from University Manor Corporation, subject to the recommendation of the Buildings and Grounds Committee as to the desirability of acquiring the property, and that, subsequently, the Buildings and Grounds Committee had also recommended the purchase of the property.

The President stated that negotiations had been conducted with University Manor Corporation, owner of the University Gardens property, for its purchase and a price of $530,000.00 had been tentatively agreed upon, subject to the approval of the Board, terms of payment to be as follows:

Since the University, in the opinion of Mr. Minor, its Special Counsel, was not authorized, under the provisions of Section 23-65 of the Code of Virginia, 1950, to assume payment of any indebtedness secured as a lien on the property, the University would take title to the property subject to, but would not assume payment of, the amount due at date of settlement of the transaction upon an existing indebtedness held by New York Life Insurance Company secured by deed of trust constituting a first lien on the property. As of 31 May 1961, the principal balance on said indebtedness amounted to $419,941.66. The balance of the purchase price, subject to adjustments, would be payable in cash at date of settlement of the transaction.

The loan made by New York Life Insurance Company is F. H. A. insured and the consent of the Federal Housing Commissioner is necessary to the acquisition of the property by the University. This will involve the execution by the University of certain regulatory agreements with the Federal Housing Commissioner.

The President then presented a tentative draft of a contract of sale and purchase of the property to be executed by the University and University Manor Corporation, which draft was examined by the members of the Board.

After full discussion and careful consideration, upon motion duly made and seconded, it was unanimously,

RESOLVED, that the President be and he is hereby authorized and empowered to execute in the name and on behalf of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia (hereinafter referred to as The Rector and Visitors), a contract, substantially in the form submitted to this meeting, for the purchase of the property of University Manor Corporation, known as University Garden Apartments, situated on the east side of U. S. Highway No. 29, in the City of Charlottesville, Virginia, together with certain tangible personalty situated therein or thereon, the consideration for such purchase to be the sum of $530,000.00, terms of payment to be as follows:

Title to said real and personal property is to be conveyed to The Rector and Visitors subject to, but said The Rector and Visitors shall not assume payment of, the amount due at date of settlement of the transaction upon an existing indebtedness held by New York Life Insurance Company secured by record deed of trust constituting a first lien on the property to be conveyed, and the balance of the purchase price, subject to adjustments, is to be payable in cash at date of settlement of the transaction, and that the Secretary of the Board be and he is hereby authorized and empowered to affix the corporate seal of The Rector and Visitors to such contract and attest the same.

RESOLVED, FURTHER, that the President, Comptroller and Secretary of the Board be and they hereby are authorized and empowered to execute in the name and on behalf of The Rector and Visitors such regulatory or other agreements not contrary to law, as may be necessary or required, with the Federal Housing Commissioner, and/or Federal Housing Administration, in order to secure approval of the purchase by The Rector and Visitors of said property, real and personal.

RESOLVED, FURTHER, that the President, Comptroller and Secretary of the Board be and they are hereby authorized and empowered to execute all other necessary documents, and, to do all things and perform all other acts necessary and proper as may be needful or advisable to consummate the purchase of said property, real and personal.

Provided, however, that no contract, agreement or other document shall be executed unless and until it has been approved as to form and substance by C. Venable Minor, Special Counsel for The Rector and Visitors.

The Chancellor reported that he had been informed by Mr. James B. Ashby, Jr., Attorney for Mary Washington Hospital and a member of the Governing Board of the Hospital, that the Hospital has agreed to sell a parcel of the land to the College which is located between the Fine Arts Center and the Dining Hall for $5,000. Mr. Ashby had also stated that he wanted the Sunshine Laundry to join in the deed with the Hospital. The need for this had arisen because the Sunshine Laundry gave the property to the Hospital during a fund raising campaign. As soon as the deed is received, it will be forwarded to the Special Counsel of the University for review and approval before it is recorded.

The Chancellor proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution:

The Chancellor presented the proposed 1961-1962 budget for Mary Washington College which had received the previous approval of the Finance Committee and the Mary Washington College Committee. Mrs. Jones and Mr. McWane proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution:

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the proposed 1961-1962 budget for Mary Washington College, which has previously been approved by the Finance Committee and the Mary Washington College Committee, be and it is hereby approved.

In compliance with the Board's request at the last meeting on 8 April 1961, the President and the Chancellor distributed to the Board members copies of their written report on a request for a review of admissions policy at Mary Washington College made by Mr. Harrison Mann, Jr. in his letter to the Rector dated 5 April 1961 in which Mr. Mann alleged that Mary Washington College had deliberately restricted its requests for capital outlays in order to limit enrollment to those students who are the most highly qualified. The report stated that there had been no effort to limit enrollment by curtailing requests for capital outlays. The report took issue with Mr. Mann's letter by pointing out that Mary Washington College was charged by statute to maintain the same standards for admission and graduation as the college at Charlottesville. Also, the College is already the largest State-supported women's college in Virginia and is, in fact, the largest devoted entirely to undergraduate education in the country. The report further showed that qualified Virginia students who had applied before 1 February, the date specified in the catalogue, in both 1960 and 1961, had been admitted.

After a lengthy discussion, the following resolution was adopted:

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the report of the President and the Chancellor on the letter of Mr. Harrison Mann, Jr. to the Rector dated 5 April 1961 be filed by the Secretary with the records of the Board, and that the President be and he is hereby directed to reply to Mr. Mann on behalf of the Board, using the joint report as the basis for his reply.
