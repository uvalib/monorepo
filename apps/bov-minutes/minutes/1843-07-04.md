Resolved, as the sense of the Board of Visitors that such purchase should be declined by the Visitors, inasmuch as it is not necessary to the Chemical apparatus of the University, and in the present state of the Funds, no purchase of apparatus would be admissible which is not called for by the necessities of the Institution.
