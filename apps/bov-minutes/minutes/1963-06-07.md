From the Rector, the President, and the individual Visitors there were expressions of the affection and esteem in which Mr. Gwathmey was held, and the Secretary was directed to convey to Mrs. Gwathmey and to record in the permanent minutes of the Board the deep sense of loss felt by the Board and the gratitude of the Visitors, both as a body and as individuals, for Mr. Gwathmey's distinguished and devoted services to the University.

The Chairman of the Finance Committee, Mr. Blanton, submitted for the Board's consideration the proposed 1963-1964 University Budget, copies of which had previously been mailed to each member of the Board. Mr. Blanton reported that the Finance Committee had met with the President and the Comptroller on 24 May 1963 for a detailed review of the proposed budget and that the Finance Committee, at the conclusion of its meeting, had unanimously approved the budget as recommended. Accordingly, the President proposed on behalf of the Finance Committee and the Board adopted the following resolution

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the proposed 1963-1964 University Budget as recommended by the President and as approved by the Finance Committee be and it is hereby approved.

The President reported on the current status of admissions for the academic year 1963-1964.

The President presented a proposal for the establishment of the faculty positions of Research Professor and Research Associate Professor. The proposal is based on a recommendation in a report dated 29 March 1963 by a special committee appointed by the President to consider the matter. This committee was composed of Acting Dean Rowland A. Egger, Chairman, and Acting Dean Kenneth R. Crispell, Dean Frank L. Hereford, Dean Lawrence R. Quarles, and Mr. Vincent Shea. The report proposed that the positions would be concerned almost exclusively with programmed research and any teaching duties would be restricted to the guidance of graduate students whose research is directly related to the research of the Research Professor or Research Associate Professor.

The President proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that, effective 1 September 1963, the positions of Research Professor and Research Associate Professor be and they are hereby created as faculty positions at the University, the duties of which are to be prescribed by the President.

The President reminded the Board that the resolution governing student eligibility to operate motor vehicles, which was adopted on 11 April 1959 (Minutes, Board of Visitors, University of Virginia, No. 12, 11 April 1959, p. 147), provided for a review of the regulations four years thereafter.

Accordingly, the Student Council this spring reviewed the regulations and made recommendations to the University Committee on Students, which in turn met with representatives of the Student Council to discuss their proposals and then made a report to the President.

The President, as a result of these studies, proposed one change in the regulations, namely, that the existing requirement that a student in the first or second semester of his third year be required to maintain a 2.50 grade-point average in the preceding semester in order to be eligible to maintain or operate a motor vehicle be reduced to a 2.40 grade-point average. The President stated his desire for a review of the results of this change in 1965, by which time he hopes that an intensive study can be made of the academic performance of students operating motor vehicles.

The President, therefore, proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the changes in the regulations governing student eligibility for the operation of motor vehicles be and they are hereby adopted as set forth below.

With certain exceptions, hereinafter set forth, the following are to become effective with the entering class of 1963-1964. These regulations apply to the regular academic session, including all special occasions, and are intended to remain in effect until the spring of 1965, at which time they may be reviewed

1. No first-year student in the undergraduate schools of the University shall be permitted to maintain or operate a motor vehicle at any time except as indicated in paragraph 5

2. No student in the undergraduate schools of the University in the first semester of his second year may maintain or operate a motor vehicle unless he has at least a 3.00 grade-point average for the preceding semester of his residence in the University. No student in the undergraduate schools of the University in the second semester of his second year may maintain or operate a motor vehicle unless he has at least a 2.80 grade-point average for the preceding semester of his residence in the University.

3. No student in the undergraduate schools of the University in the first or second semester of his third year may maintain or operate a motor vehicle unless he has at least a 2.40 grade-point average for the preceding semester of his residence in the University

4. No student in the undergraduate schools of the University in the first or second semester of his fourth year may maintain or operate a motor vehicle unless he has at least a 2.20 grade-point average for the preceding semester of his residence in the University.

5. A first-year man may operate a motor vehicle at Midwinters and Easters provided he had a 2.50 average for the first semester. All other undergraduates may operate a motor vehicle at Openings, Midwinters, and Easters provided they have a 2.00 grade-point average for the preceding semester.

6. No undergraduate student on probation or warning of any kind shall be permitted to maintain or operate a motor vehicle at any time

7. To determine eligibility to operate a motor vehicle, all transfer students will be considered as first-year students for the first semester of their residence. Their grades during that semester and the number of semester-hours that they transfer and earn here will determine their eligibility to operate a motor vehicle during their second semester of residence.

8. The Deans of the undergraduate schools of the University will determine the criteria for the classification of students above the first year of residence

9. Exceptions to these recommendations above shall be made for due cause, such as physical disability, essential domestic use, occupational need, or distance of residence from the University. As in the past, the Dean of the University shall be empowered to make exceptions at his discretion.

The following resolution was adopted

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the Hospital Accounts Committee be and it is hereby authorized to charge off as uncollectible accounts Schedules 1156, 1157, 1160, and 1161, aggregating $72,509.71, as recommended by it, consisting of the following

The President proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that effective 1 July 1963, eligibility for membership in the General Faculty of the University is hereby conferred on persons occupying library positions, upon nomination by the President,

RESOLVED FURTHER that the equivalent academic rank of librarians in the General Faculty be determined by individual election by the Board upon nomination by the President,

RESOLVED FURTHER that the Secretary of the Board shall inform the Secretary of the General Faculty and the several Deans of the University of the names of librarians elected to the General Faculty,

RESOLVED FURTHER that no librarian elected to the General Faculty may accept membership in more than one of the faculties of the several Schools of the University, that membership of a librarian in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences or in the Faculty of any other School of the University may be conferred only by invitation of the Dean of the School concerned, and that nothing in this Resolution shall be construed as depriving the several faculties of their right to withhold or to confer voice and vote in a particular faculty upon persons elected by the Board to the General Faculty.

The President proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the following members of the library staffs of the University be and they are hereby elected to the General Faculty, without change in salary or benefits, to be listed in appropriate faculty sections of University catalogues by the title of the library position only

Heretofore the distribution of the Alumni News has been limited to members of the Alumni Association and graduates of the University for the first five years after graduation, this latter distribution being made possible through an endowment contributed to the University for this special purpose by an anonymous donor. The University of Virginia Topics, financed by the Alumni Fund and the Alumni Board of Trustees, is a newsletter published eight times a year, which under the new plan would be combined with the Alumni News to provide one publication reaching all alumni. The Alumni Association proposes that all funds now going into the two publications be applied to the expanded distribution. Mr. Saunier stated that through the fine spirit of cooperation on the part of all concerned, there were very good prospects that the plan would be realized, provided that funds previously allocated to distribution of certain Alumni Fund reports can also be utilized to insert these reports appropriately in the expanded Alumni News.
