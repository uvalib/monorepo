The Committee on Finance offer the following report.

1\. After consideration of the communication of Mr. Thomas D. Ranson respecting the legacy bequeathed to the University by the late Thomas Johnson of the County of Augusta we recommend the passage of the following resolution.

That the Rector is authorised and requested forthwith to employ counsel for prosecution of the rights of the University-in the estate of Thomas Johnson decd. and that the counsel employed be instructed to take energetic measures for realising the fund so soon as may be, with due regard to the interests of the University.

The Rector is visited with full authority to contract with counsel for their compensation, but the Board expresses a preference that such compensation shall be contingent on, and be paid only out of the collections from this account.

2\. We recommend the following resolution-

Resolved, that the resolution in reference to Room rent, passed 28th of June 1873, and found at page 348 of the Minutes, \[p. 396 in typed copy\] shall not be continued so as to require payment of room rent by students residing with their parents or relatives.

We recommend the following appropriations for the ensuing year.

The Committee make this partial report and will hereafter make a further report.

On motion the Rector was added to the Finance Committee.

The Committee on Finance made an additional report which was submitted through its Chairman and after being read and considered was on motion adopted and reads as follows:

We recommend that a deed of trust be executed under the authority of the act of the General Assembly of Virginia passed on the 25th day of March 1875, to secure the bonds of the University to the amount of $95,000.00, and we return herewith a draft of such deed which recites the form of the bonds to be secured thereby- We recommend that the bonds be signed by the Rector and the Secretary of the Board and countersigned by the Proctor; with instructions that he shall in no case sell the same at an amount less than par, and that the proceeds of all bonds shall be exclusively used in paying the present debts of the University. That the Proctor be further instructed to exchange said bonds as he may be able to do so, for the outstanding bonds of the University, but that he shall in all cases require that the bonds so issued be taken at par. The bonds which may be so taken in shall be cancelled and shall be preserved with the papers in the office of the Proctor.

We further recommend that the Proctor be instructed forthwith to have lithographed 190 bonds for $500 each, for issue under the deed aforesaid in the form therein set out, and that the sum of $       be appropriated to pay the cost of said bonds. We further recommend that the Proctor shall make monthly reports to the Rector of the progress made in the sale and exchange of said bonds and submit the following resolutions

That the salary of the Janitor be Forty dollars per month for the year following the present meeting of the Board.

Isaac H. Carrington Chairman

which resolution and report were adopted.

On motion the Board adjourned to meet tomorrow at 10 A.M.

Jas. D. Jones Secretary

R. G. H. Kean Rector

University Va. June 30th 1875

The Board met pursuant to adjournment on yesterday.

Present the same members as on yesterday and in addition Col. Campbell.

Mr. Woods Chairman of the Library Committee submitted the report of said Committee which reads as follows:

The undersigned as Committee on the Library respectfully reports that he has made a careful inspection of the Library-assisted by Mr. Wertenbaker, and he found its condition all that could be desired under the circumstances. The Management and arrangement of this department reflects the highest credit on the venerable and efficient Librarian.

In the opinion of your Committee it is highly important that the regulation of the Board requiring all books to be returned to the Library five days before the annual meeting of the Board should be enforced. Non compliance with this law whether by professors or students, results in serious trouble and inconvenience to the Librarian in the discharge of his duties and renders the proper preservation of the library almost impossible. This enactment has been long in force. The reasons for it are apparent and the excuse for failure to comply with it should be of the strongest character- to induce the Board to remit the penalties in any case. The Report of the Librarian on this point is before the Board: also the letter of Professor Gildersleeve explaining the retention by him of certain books- Your Committee deems this letter entirely satisfactory and recommends that the Librarian be authorized to remit the fine which the law imposes for the non-return of the books in the case of Mr. Gildersleeve.

In the case of Professor Boeck, Your Committee reports that he had a comference with this gentleman on yesterday the 29th inst. and Mr. Boeck requested your committee to verbally report to the Board his reasons for failure to return the very large number of volumes in his hands. Your Committee requested a written statement which was made by him and forwarded to the Board.

Your Committee sees no reason why the law should not be enforeed in the case of Mr. Boeck and recommends that the fines imposed by the laws of the University be collected of him.

Your Committee further recommends that the $90 collected for fines, as reported by the Librarian be specially appropriated for binding.

The foregoing report was read and considered whereupon on motion Resolved, that the same be approved and adopted with this modification: That Prof. Boeck be allowed ten days from the final exercises of the University in which to comply with the Library regulations in regard to the books mentioned in the report of the Librarian and in case he shall comply with such regulations within the said ten days, in view of the circumstances mentioned in his communication to the Board that he be excused from the penalties which have accrued by his failure to comply strictly therewith.

The Committee on Grounds & Buildings through its Chairman submitted its report which upon being read and considered, the same was received and the recommendations therein approved and adopted and ordered to be enforced. The report reads as follows:

Your Committee respectfully report that in the performance of their duties they have made such an inspection of the grounds & public buildings as their opportunities have made practicable and they are gratified to be able to state that both are in as good condition as could be expected or required under the circumstances. The Grounds exhibit evidence of careful attention and the Buildings show that every effort within the means of the Proctor has been made to preserve them, and to prevent as far as possible the decay inevitable from the want of the necessary repairs. In this connection Your Committee will inform the Board that they have called upon the Proctor to furnish them an estimate of the amount necessary to put the Buildings & Grounds in perfect order with a view to such action by the Board as will secure this sum, and they respectfully suggest that the General Assembly should be called for an appropriation for this purpose. Your Committee are aware of the consequences involved in any appearance of the University before the Legislature as an applicant for assistance, but they can but think that this body would recognize the necessity for preserving from loss the investment which the state has made here, and would accordingly provide the requisite funds. Your Committee therefore recommends that the executive Committee should be authorized to apply to the Legislature for an appropriation for this purpose, should they upon inquiry deem it judicious to do so.

Your Committee with the light of the Faculty's interesting and elaborate report in reference to the sanitary condition of the University desire to say that they are satisfied that already everything expedient to promote it, and to remove the causes which have heretofore endangered it, has been accomplished, The sewers have been extended so as to make their discharge outside of the precincts of the University sufficiently far off to render impossible any infection of the air or water in and about the University and such other provisions made for the proper action of these sewers as will insure their cleanliness and efficiency. Your Committee further state that they together with a Committee of the Miller Board, and accompanied by the Proctor, examined the land belonging to the University and adjacent to it, which the Miller Board desire to be assigned to them for their experimental farm and they are satisfied that it would be judicious to comply with the request of the Miller Board and they accordingly recommend that the area of this tract not now used by the professors as gardens, and not including the mountain be turned over to the Miller Board for such use as they see fit to apply it to during the pleasure of the Board of Visitors. It is estimated that about 40 acres, will be included in the boundaries agreed upon and pointed out by the Proctor.

It seems but just, as well as clear to the interest of the University that the parsonage should be preserved, and as the University has received this property as a donation Your Committee conceives that it is under obligation to keep it in such order as its finances will allow and therefore it is submitted that the Proctor should be advised that the property is as much under his charge as any building on the grounds, and that he shall make the repairs necessary to make it agreeably tenantable.

Your Committee it will be observed omitted to suggest any action as to the proposition of the Faculty to assign the vacant hotel at the South end of the Eastern Range to the Messing system with a view to its extension and placing it within the reach of a larger number of students than is practicable under the present facilities not being sufficiently apprised on the subject to enable them to act advisedly. Upon reflection your Committee deem it wise that any encouragement should be affected for the largest success of the Messing system, and they therefore recommend that the Hotel in question shall be placed at the disposal of the Faculty to be used for the system under such restrictions and safeguards as the Faculty may prescribe. Your Committee however suggest that a moderate revenue should be derived from this hotel, and in as much as the students who mess are obliged to provide themselves accommodations Your Committee deem it proper that a reasonable rent should be paid therefor to the University.

Thomas Smith

W. R. Berkeley

Resolved, That the medical professors be and they are hereby authorized in the event of a vacancy in the office of Matron of the Infirmary to make such arrangements for the supplying of a suitable Matron as in their discretion may seem best- provided the appropriation for the salary of the Matron be not exceeded.

Resolved, That the Faculty be and they are hereby authorized to employ a suitable assistant to the Librarian whose compensation shall not exceed $200.

Resolved, That the appropriations made or to be made, by the Trustees of the Miller Fund for the ensuing fiscal year be adopted and the fund applied according thereto.

Resolved, That the Committee of the faculty heretofore appointed to submit to the Board a revision of the enactments of the University, be requested to pursue that work, and report to the next annual meeting.

Resolved, That a Committee of three be appointed to inquire into various reports which have reached the Board in reference to Professor Boeck and report upon the same as soon as practicable. Whereupon the Rector appointed as said Committee Messrs Smith, Walton and Campbell.

On motion the Board adjourned to meet tomorrow at 9 Oclock.

Jas. D. Jones Secretary

R. G. H. Kean Rector

The Board met pursuant to adjournment on yesterday. Present the same members as on yesterday with the exception of Mr. Carrington, absent.

On motion the Board adjourned to give the members the opportunity of attending the exercises of the public day to meet tomorrow at 9 Oclock.

University of Va.

July 2d 1875

The Board met pursuant to adjournment in yesterday. Present the same members as on yesterday.

Dr. James F. Harrison was elected Chairman of the Faculty for the ensuing year.

The Report of the Executive Committee for the interval since the last annual meeting was read received and approved.

Resolved, That as recommended in the resolution of the Faculty of the 29th of June the following students of the present session who were candidates for graduation in their respective schools and prevented from standing the regular examinations by sickness are permitted to attend special examinations in the early part of the next session without again matriculating as students. Mr. A. C. Hill in the school of law- Messrs A. M. West, Joseph Field, Jr., Wm. O. McDowell, R. B. Lemmon, In the Department of Medicine.

Resolved, That the claim of Professors Minor and so much of the Proctor's report as relates thereto, be passed by to stand as unfinished business for the next meeting of the Board, in order that Professor Minor may have an opportunity to present his views thereon to the Board.

The Chairman of the Committee on Apparatus submitted the following report which upon being read and considered, on motion was received and adopted and ordered to be spread upon the Minutes.

Your Committee on Apparatus respectfully report, that the inventories required by law from Professors Mallet and Smith have been returned and no appropriations asked for.

Resolved, That Richard H. Baker Esqr a member of this Board having failed to attend the meetings of the Board for the time specified by law without communicating the reasons of such nonattendance- under the obligations imposed by the Statute the Board declare his membership forfeited- and the Rector is instructed to inform the Governor of Virginia of the vacancy.

Col. Thomas Jefferson Randolph having presented to the University the "Polygraph" used by Mr. Jefferson-

Resolved, That the letter of Col. Randolph accompanying the same be spread on the record and that the thanks of the Board are tendered to Col. Randolph for this interesting relic, associated as it is with the labours of the father of the University and that the case containing the "Polygraph" be taken charge of by the Librarian and be properly catalogued and preserved. That a copy of the foregoing resolution be transmitted to Col. Randolph by the Secretary.

Allow me through your body to present to the University the polygraph used by Mr. Jefferson for the last twenty years of his life. In reserving for publication many thousand of these letters, they were found accurate facsimiles of his hand writing: no error except where the record pen was caught by some irregularity in the paper. When extricating itself with a spring it missed a few letters leaving space for them.

Resolved, That this Board, with a full sense of the justice of the encomium passed upon the adjunct professor in the Department of Analytical and Agricultural Chemistry and of his merit do not deem it expedient to adopt the recommendation of the Faculty in regard to the erection of Mr. Dunnington's appointment into a full professorship, different in its terms and principles of compensation from other professorships in the University.

In pursuance of the recommendation made in the first of the resolutions of the Faculty passed on the 1st of April 1875 and communicated in their report to the present meeting, it is ordered-

That the requirements for the degree of Batchelor of Arts be modified so as to be hereafter as follows:

The said degree shall be conferred on students who have made satisfactory attainments in the senior classes in Latin and Greek, the Intermediate Classes in Pure Mathematics and Moral Philosophy, obtained Certificates of Proficiency in Physics and History or Literature, and graduated in Chemistry and in French or German.

Resolved, That the whole subject referred to in the Report of the Faculty looking to flushing the sewers be submitted to the Executive Committee who are authorized, should occasion arise to make it expedient, take the steps they may deem necessary to secure the flushing of the sewers.

Resolved, That the medical Professors and the professor of Chemistry be and the same are hereby constituted and appointed a Board of Health with the power to recommend to the Executive Committee such changes as said Board may deem the sanitary condition of the University may from time to time require or to remonstrate through said Executive against any changes proposed by the Proctor or other executive officers of the University.

The Committee in the case of Professor Boeck submitted their report and on motion the same was received and the Board, in view of the fact that only six members were present adjourned for its further consideration to the 28th day of the present month

On motion ordered that the report in the case of Prof. Boeck be spread upon the minutes.

To the Rector & Board of Visitors.

Your Committee report that after much inquiry they have reached the conclusion that the continuance of Professor Boeck in his position as Professor of Applied Mathematics would be prejudicial to the interest of the University,-and they recommend that the said chair be declared vacant from this date.

Thomas Smith

Joseph Campbell July 2d 1875

On motion the Board then adjourned to meet on the 28th day of the present month.
