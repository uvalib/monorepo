The Board met pursuant to adjournment on the 23d of September last.

Present- R. G. H. Kean, Rector, E. B. Montague, Moses Walton, Thomas Smith, & Micajah Woods.

The Rector appointed the following Committees. Finance Com. Mr. Walton, Col. Campbell, & Maj. Carrington Committee on Grounds & Buildings Judge Smith, Col. Berkeley Committee on Apparatus Col. Montague, Mr. Baker Committee on Library Mr. Woods, Mr. Baker.

The Rector laid before the Board the following communications,

1\. The Report of the Faculty

2\. The Report of the Librarian,

3\. The Report of the Proctor and Superintendent, all of which were reserved for future consideration.

Resolved that B. Johnson Barbour Esq. be requested to prepare the proceedings on the occasion of the inauguration of the Jefferson Statue, and to have the same and the address of Hugh Blair Grigsby at the time, published, for the use of the University provided the cost shall not exceed the unexpended balance of the appropriation for the erection of said statue.

The Chairman of the Executive Committee made a verbal report of the transaction of said Comee since the last meeting of the Board, - as follows-

1\. That the General Assembly had been applied to, for, and had passed an act authorizing the appointment of a Conservator of the Peace at the University- Acts 1872-3 Ch. 11.

2\. That in consequence of the movement made by the Society of Alumni, the Comee regarding it as injudicious to have two competing agencies in the field, have taken no action under the resolution of the last meeting in respect to the appointment of an agent to solicit endowments.

3\. That the General Assembly has passed the profered Act to encourage donations to the University. See Acts 1872-3 ch 121

4\. That the Comee had found it necessary to authorize the appropriation for Gas, to be exceeded by a sum not exceeding $75.

5\. That application had been made to the Genl. Assembly for the passage of an act looking to a connection between the University and the Public Free School System as indicated on page 364 of this Record, \[p. 319 typed copy\], but in consequence of the development of very unlooked-for opposition in the House of Delegates the proposition was withdrawn.

6\. That the Comee had at the instance of the Faculty, authorized the expenditure of $150 in advertizing during the months of May & June, as authorized by the Board.

7\. That the illness & death of Dr. Wm. H. McGuffey had rendered necessary some arrangements for completing the term of instruction, and conducting the Examinations in the School of Moral Philosophy for the remainder of the session, and this had been done, by the Faculty with the approval of the Comee through an arrangement between the family of Dr. McGuffey and D.T.D. Witherspoon in a manner reported to be highly satisdactory.

8\. That Prof. L. Boeck having been appointed a Commissioner to the Vienna Exposition by the U. S. Government, the Comee had given him leave to absent himself after the 7th June, 1873, for the residue of the present session, the examinations in his class having been completed and arrangments made for continuting the instruction of the class, to the end of the session.

At a regular annual meeting of the Board of Visitors of the University of Va held at their office in the said University on the 25th day of June in the year Eighteen hundred & seventy-three.

The Rector laid before the Board the correspondence between him & the Hon. Hamilton Fish, Secretary of State of the United States in respect to the gift to the Library of this University by the Government of Great Britain of certain publications of the Record Office consisting of Two hundred and fifty-eight volumes transmitted by the British Government to this Universty through the American Minister to Great Britain and the State Department at Washington, from which correspondence and the papers therewith as well as from the report of the Librarian it appears that the intrinsic value of the said gift, is enhanced by the marked courtesy with which it was made. Whereupon it was resolved

That the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia hereby record their grateful thanks to the Government of Her Majesty the Queen of Great Britain for the very valuable contribution to the Library of the University made in November last consisting of Tow Hundred & fifty-eight volumes of the Publications of the Record Commission.

That this Board desires at the same time, to put on record their high appreciation of the very courteous manner in which they are informed the said gift was made.

That the Librarian of the University cause the said volumes to be placed together in a separate alcove in the Library conspicuously marked with the words "Donation by the Government of Great Britain", and that he cause each of the said volumes to be marked with a label bearing the same words.

That the Secretary of State of the United States be respectfully requested to cause a copy of these proceedings to be communicated to the proper Department of her Majesty's Government in token of the sentiments of this Board- and to that end that a copy thereof duly attested under the seal of the University be transmitted by the Rector to the said Secretary of State.

Resolved further That the thanks of this Board are due, and are hereby tendered to the Hon. Hamilton Fish, Secretary of State of the United States and to the American Legation at the Court of Great Britain for the kind interest, efficient aid and courtesy extended to this University in connection with the said donation. The Board adjourned to meet tomorrow at 10 A. M.

University of Virginia

June 26th 1873

The Board met pursuant to adjournment yesterday.

In addition to the members present yesterday Col. W. R. Berkeley reported. Major Isaac H. Carrington appointed to fill the vacancy occasioned by the resignation of B. Johnson Barbour Esq. presented his credentials. Major Carrington was added to the Finance Committee.

On motion all papers pertaining to Finance were referred to Com. on Finance.

On motion the Board proceeded to elect a Chairman - Col. Venable was elected on motion of Mr. Woods.

Dr. Page's Report was received.

The Board adjourned to meet tomorrow at 10 A. M.

The Board met pursuant to adjournment on yesterday.

Present, the Rector and the same members as on yesterday and in addition, Col. Campbell.

The Rector laid before the Board a letter from Prof. Charles S. Venable expressing his thanks for the kind manner in which the Board expressed their confidence in him as the Chief Executive Officer of the University and asking for reasons stated in the letter to be permitted to decline the office- which letter was ordered to be filed.

The Finance Committee submitted its report, which being considered was adopted as follows:

Resolved-

1\. That in view of the continued embarrassment of the finances of the University and the difficulties arising out of this fact- it is deemed best to avoid the adoption of any general rules of action in relation to salaries, at the present session of the Board.

2\. That without intending to establish any precedent for future action, the Board with a view to provide for the present emergency deem it expedient to fix the salaries of the Professors for the ensuing year as follows: viz-

Ordered

1\. That until the further order of the Board, the following be the stated salaries paid to the respective Professors, viz-

2\. That each professor be paid the full amount of fees of tuition paid on account of his chair.

3\. That if in any school or chair the aggregate emoluments from salary and fees be less than $2000 there shall be paid to the professors, from the general fund, for instruction of state students, and other non paying students such a sum as shall make his aggregate pecuniary emoluments up to the sum of $2000.

4\. That if the aggregate number of paying students shall decline below the number of the present session (1872-3) then in each school or chair affected by such decline, to an extent greater than if such decline were uniform in all the schools or chairs, there shall be paid to the professors thereof out of the general fund for instruction to state students and other non-paying students, such a sum as will make his emoluments equal to what they would be, if such decline were uniform in all the schools or chairs.

5\. No professor shall under any circumstances whatever, receive less than the sum of $1000 a year. And if by reason of any general disaster, such as the dispersion of the students early in any session by the breaking out of an epidemic, or other extraordinary misfortune to the University, the foregoing scheme of compensation is rendered inequitable, the Board reserves to itself the authority to make such special provision in such case as to it may seem just and right, and will be consistent with the general laws.

On motion the further consideration of the Report of the Finance Committee was postponed until tomorrow.

The Board then proceeded to consider the letter of Prof. Venable noted as filed, in a previous part of today's proceedings. It was thereupon

Resolved That the Board of Visitors recognize the sufficiency of the reasons given by Professor Venable for declining the office of Chairman of the Faculty.

The Board desires to express upon its records its earnest appreciation of the zeal, ability and success with which Professor Venable has administered the office.

On motion the Board adjouened to meet tomorrow at 10 A.M.
