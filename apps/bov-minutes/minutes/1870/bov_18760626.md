At a regular meeting of the Board of Visitors held this day at the Infirmary- Present, Hon. A. H. H. Stuart, Rector, and Messrs Conrad, Gilmore, Hart, Marye, Randolph and Whitehead Messrs John L. Marye and Paul Whitehead having been commissioned by His Excellency Gov. James L. Kemper since the last meeting of the Board.

The Executive Committee submitted its report which upon being read and considered on motion was received and adopted and ordered to be spread upon the Minutes of the Board.

As chairman of the Executive Committee I have the honor to make the following report.

The Committee met Professor Ward at the University May 12th who stated that he was ready to enter into a contract to furnish the Cabinet; the donation for which was accepted by you at your last meeting. The Committee of the Faculty appointed by the Board was requested to confer with Mr. Ward and furnish us the outline of the contents of such a Cabinet as he was willing to furnish and such as in their opinion we were entitled to receive for the sum donated. Their report having been approved a contract which is transmitted herewith was drawn and signed-Deeming it desirable both to ensure the safety of bonds donated and to have them in a position to be readily converted into money the Chairman was requested to communicate with Riggs & Co. Bankers, Washington, D. C. and ascertain if it would not be best to make that house the depository and principal Agents of the fund.

At a subsequent meeting they were made the principal Agents and the bonds sent to them. The Committee thinking that it would be wise to avail themselves of Prof. Ward's experience and knowledge of such buildings requested him to have drawn under his supervision such a plan for the Museum Building as he would advise selecting a Rochester Architect if there was one in whom he had confidence and directing him not to exceed the sum specified in the donation.

To save time and avail ourselves of this building season-the Proctor was directed to proceed to make the brick and prepare to furnish lime and sand as rapidly as it should be needed He has now one hundred and fifty thousand brick in his yard ready for the fires. On the 25th of May the Committee met Prof. Ward to examine elevation and ground plans of the Museum Building as furnished by the Architect, Mr. J. P. Thomas.

The plans having been approved and Mr. Wards bargain with Mr. Thomas, namely, two per cent on cost of building and seventy five dollars for visit to this place having been sanctioned he was requested to direct Mr. Thomas to prepare specifications, working, drawings &c and as soon as practicable to forward them and be present in person when bids were opened. His presence was deemed necessary as it was feared that his design could not be completed for the money donated and he alone could properly revise it. To prevent loss of time eight or nine of the most reliable contractors in the state were written to and requested to be prepared to bid on the work.

June 9th Mr. Thomas being present the bids from some seven or eight firms were opened and were found to exceed the sum donated by varying amounts all exceeding it by several thousand dollars.

The plan was returned to Mr. Thomas, Architect, and he was requested to thoroughly inform himself as to the itemized prices of building in this part of the country and revise his plan so as to bring it within the sum donated for the purpose. To save time the Proctor was directed to proceed to have the foundation excavated. On consultation with the Architect the majority of the Committee selected a point between the Washington Hall and the Staunton Turnpike, near the latter, as the site for the building.

Dr. Mallet, Prof. of Chemistry submitted a proposition that was made him by the authorities of the Hopkins University that he should deliver twenty lectures under their auspicies in the City of Baltimore. The Committee having perfect confidence in Prof. Mallet's conscientious discharge of every duty to his class and the University left it to him to decide whether it would be detrimental to his class if not we would assent to his absence.

It having been ascertained that it was necessary for the Board to take further action to legalize the transfer of bonds donated, the Committee urge immediate action as the money will now be made at once.

The Board met pursuant to adjournment on yesterday.

Present the same members as on yesterday and in addition Hon. John Goode Jr. who was commissioned as a Visitor of the University by his Excellency Gov. James L. Kemper, Governor of Va.

On motion the Board proceeded with the reading and consideration of the Report of the Faculty resulting in the following resolutions:

Resolved, That that part of the report of the Faculty in regard to arrangements for messing be referred to a special Committee of three.

The Rector appointed on this Committee Messrs Hart, Gilmore and Goode.

Resolved, That the letter of proposal of N. Francis Cabell Esq. in respect to the originals of the correspondence of Jefferson & Cabell be referred to the Library Committee.

Resolved, That so much of the report of the Faculty as has reference to the defective sewage of the University grounds be referred to the Committee on Grounds & Buildings.

Resolved, That so much of the Report of the Faculty as relates to the kind and extent of examinations of Va. students required under the recent Act of the General Assembly providing for free tuition be referred to a Committee of three who will consider and make Report to this Board as to the mode of carrying that Act into operation.

Committee under the foregoing resolution: Messrs. Conrad, Whitehead & Goode.

Resolved, That a standing Committee of three be appointed to be called a Committee on the "Miller Fund" with instructions to take into consideration the relative rights of the two Boards, and report.

Committee appointed under the foregoing resolutionâ€”;Messrs. Conrad, Goode & Gilmore.

Resolved, That so much of the reports of the Faculty as relates to the compensation of Professors be referred to the Finance Committee.

Resolved, that so much of the report of the Faculty as relates to the portrait of the late Genl. J. E. B. Stuart recently sent to the University by Mr. Elden the Artist as a gift by Mr. W. A. Stuart be referred to John L. Marye, Esq. with directions to prepare a letter to be addressed to that gentleman expressing the thanks of this Board.

Resolved, That the Board a prove the order of the Board of Visitors made June 27th 1872 (found in its minutes page 340, page 303 typed copy) requiring that all appropriations both regular and special should be made specific and in detail and that appropriations thus prescribed be not transcended as to the limits, nor diverted from the objects prescribed to other objects. And that the Proctor shew in his annual accounts the respective amounts which were appropriated for each object, and how much has been disbursed under each head. And this Board declares that the said order shall continue in force, until specifically modified.

But it is not intended, that this resolution shall restrict the discretionary authority of the Executive Committee when the latter shall see cause to allow in express terms a departure from the prescription of the order.

The Board having considered the proposition made by N. Francis Cabell, Esq. to sell to the University the original MSS of the correspondence between Mr. Jefferson and Joseph C. Cabell in reference to the establishment of the University, regret to feel compelled to decline the offer because of the very limited pecuniary means of the Institution- and the Chairman of the Faculty is requested to communicate this conclusion of the Board to Mr. Cabell.

On motion the Board adjourned till tomorrow morning at 9 Oclock.

2\. That the Secretary furnish Prof. Gildersleeve a copy of this resolution.

The Committee on the Miller Fund submitted the following as its report which was received & adopted and ordered to be spread upon the minutes of the Board.

The Committee on the Miller Fund report that after some delay, occasioned by the want of a quorum of the Miller Board. They were invited by the Miller Board to a conference on the subject of the relative power of the two Boards over the distribution of the endowment fund. And upon an interchange of views, it was finally considered by the Miller Board, in view of the absence of several of its members that no definitive action could be taken by them at this time, Upon the subject- but that the usual appropriation would be made by them for the ensuing year, and that such action as might be found necessary in regard to determining the rights and powers of the two Boards be deferred for the present.

The appropriations made by the Miller Board for the ensuing year are herewith returned marked (A).

They recommend that Dr. John R. Page be authorized to return in the name of this Board, to the donors of such articles as may be contributed for the use of his school an appropriate expression of thanks.

The following appropriations were made for the year 1876-7 by the Miller Board. viz

Resolved that the unexpended balance of $380.09 of the appropriation for the session of 1875-6 now in the hands of the Proctor be applied to the salary of Prof. Page for the session of 1875-6; but this appropriation is made with the distinct declaration of this Board that it is not to be regarded as incumbent upon the Miller Board to provide for the whole of Prof. Page's salary. This Board adheres to the views heretofore expressed that Prof. Page is entitled to receive from the Board of Visitors like compensation with other Professors and that the Miller Board will contribute only such sum as it deems proper, to aid the Board of Visitors in paying such salary.

Resolved, That the Miller Board be requested to appoint a special committee to confer with the committee appointed by the Board of Visitors to consider and report upon the relative rights and powers of the two Boards over the income arising from the Miller endowment.

Ordered-

1\. That the present arrangement made Sept. 15th 1875 by which an adjunct Professor of Mathematics takes the place of the Professor of Applied Mathematics & Civil Engineering be continued until otherwise ordered.

2\. That the appointment of Professor Wm. M. Thornton as Adjunct Professor of Mathematics is hereby renewed.

The Committee on Apparatus submitted the following report which upon being read was ordered to be received and adopted.

The standing Committee on Apparatus report that they have not made a personal examination of the Apparatus of the School of General and Applied Chemistry, They however make the following extract from Prof. Mallet's report to the Miller Board.

"The Apparatus and collections of the School are in good and efficient condition with the exception of an air pump formerly reported as found in the Laboratory broken, and one Torsin Electromiter by giving way of cement on collar during warm weather. Prof. Smith reports the Apparatus in his school in a fair state of efficiency and that no material additions thereto have been made during the past summer. It is greatly to be regretted that the finances do not admit very desirable additions to the Apparatus in Light Heat & Electricity.

The Board met pursuant to adjournment on yesterday. Present the Rector & Messrs Conrad, Hart, Marye & Randolph.

Resolved, that the Board regret to be unable to grant the request of Mr. Wertenbaker for an extra allowance of $100 for his services during the past year, in view of the very strqitened financial condition of the University, and the uncertain operation of the recent changes as to its yearly income.

Ordered, that the Secretary address a note to Rev. Charles H. Ryland of Richmond explaining that in view of all the circumstances of the case and particularly in view of the fact that this Board has prescribed conditions of admission of Virginia Students under the late Act of Legislature which it hopes will be satisfactory to all, the Board declines to send representatives of the University to the proposed Convention of Colleges in the City of Richmond in connection with the next meeting of the Educational Association of Va.

Ordered, the Trustees having appropriated three hundred and Eighty Dollars to the deficit in Dr. Page's salary the Proctor is directed to pay the balance of ninety-five dollars out of the Contingent fund.

On motion the Board adjourned to meet on the 26th day of June next.
