The Board met pursuant to adjournment on yesterday and was called to order by the Rector.

Present the same members as on yesterday

Resolved That the appropriations recommended by the Report of the Faculty for the several Schools and for repairs and play grounds for the Students are hereby allowed as specified, and that the appropriation for Books for the Law department is allowed to the extent of two hundred dollars.

The following Report of the Committee on Finance for 1871 was received, adopted and ordered to be recorded.

Your Committee on Finance respectfully report as follows.

The debt of the University which existed at the time of the appointment of the present Board of Visitors was $38,600 made up as follows-

On the advice of the Faculty and to prevent the occupation of the grounds by objectionable tenants, the present Board in the year     , directed the purchase of the property adjacent to the University, known as Carr's Hill. Since then other debts, looking to the advancement of the University, have been created. The following are purposes for which these debts have been created.

The aggregate of previously existing debt and of expenditures on permanent objects for the advancement of the University, amounts, therefore, to the sum of $98,200.

Partly from the proceeds of the Miller fund, and partly from current receipts, a portion of this expenditure has been paid off; leaving the present indebtedness of the University as of the 1st June 1871, according to the Report of the Proctor & Superintendent, at $82,913, as follows

Eight per cent bonds, to the amount of $30,000, as the Board is aware, have been placed on the market, and it is expected that they will produce a fund adequate to pay off the matured debt of the University, and to extinguish the floating debt; thus placing the entire debt of the institution on a stable footing.

The financial policy of the Board should, of course, be, to provide for the gradual liquidation of this debt. The practice of a rigid economy by the Board of Visitors and the limitations of the salaries of the Professors, to a maximum of $3000 have placed the finances of the University on such a footing as to encourage the Proctor & Superintendent to believe that, by the year 1880, with the practice of an enlightened economy, he may be able to pay off the new issue of 8 per cent bonds for $30,000. This seems to us quite practicable. The receipts of the University for the year ending June 1st 1871, from ordinary sources, including $8,800 from the Miller Fund, were $48,427.33, and we see no reason to apprehend any other falling off in these receipts, than a reduction of the income from the Miller Fund to about $6,500 The ordinary expenditures of the institution may be reduced within $38,000 as is proved by the fact, that those for the year ending with the beginning of the present month, including interest paid, were $38,184.

The Excess of ordinary receipts over ordinary expenditures during the year just ended were nearly five thousand dollars. Your Committee believe that this excess, during the year now commenced, can be brought up to seven or eight thousand dollars; the amount depending of course very much upon the policy of the Board in authorizing extraordinary outlays of money.

You Committee recommend a rigid policy in this regard; by adopting and pursuing which, a surplus of five thousand dollars or more may be carried each year to the credit of the debt

All of which is respectfully submitted.

The Board met and was called to order by the Rector. Present B. Johnson Barbour, Bector, Samuel Watts, Thomas J. Pretlow, T. L. Preston, W. E. M. Word, R. W. Hughes, and J. R. Woods.

A letter was reported and read from Wm. Wertenbaker tendering his resignation as Secretary of the Board to take effect after the present session. On motion the consideration thereof was passed by for the present.
