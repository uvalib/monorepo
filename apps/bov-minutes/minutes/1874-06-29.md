At a meeting of the Trustees of the Miller Fund held at the University of Virginia on the 30th day of June and 1st of July 1874 the following proceedings were had: On consideration of the communication of the Rector covering an extract from the Report of the Faculty asking that authority be given them to withdraw the Miller Scholarship from the scholar, whenever in their opinion he is not making proper use of its benefits; it is resolved that in the opinion of this Board it is expedient that the authority asked for by the Faculty be given them.

It is respectfully suggested to the Board of Visitors that the payments to the scholar be made quarterly in advance so that in the event of the withdrawal of the Scholarship the unpaid portion of the annual appropriation shall remain to the credit of the Miller Fund.

In the opinion of the Trustees of the Miller Board it is a matter of prime necessity that the school of Agriculture should be fully equipped with proper machinery, anatomical specimens and buildings, and that all of the funds which can be safely withdrawn from other purposes should be applied to the development of the school of Experimental and Practical Agriculture in that direction; Therefore it is resolved that this Board reserves the right at its next annual meeting to suspend any appropriation to the Miller Scholarship, from and after the session ending June 1875 and they respectfully request the Board of Visitors to cause the candidates for said Scholarships to be informed of this resolution.

Resolved, that the following appropriations be made for the next fiscal year:

And that the balance of any funds collected during the year, shall be applied, First to the payment of the balance of $596.41 due the University, and the residue, if any, shall be applied under the direction of Prof. Page to the equipment of his school.

The Committee of finance appointed by the Rector on the 29th of June 1874 submit the following report:

I. We have considered the suggestions, made in the report of the Faculty, which refer to appropriations and recommend as follows in respect thereto: We recommend the appropriation of fifty dollars ($50) to be expended in repairs to Lithographic press belonging to the University, provided the faculty shall determine that its use during the next session is expedient.

We also recommend the following appropriations which are suggested in said report, viz

We are not prepared to Act on the recommendation of the Faculty that the next Catalogue include the names of all students who have matriculated since the foundation of the University- We are not informed whether the material is attainable for this object. We suggest that this subject be referred to the Executive Committee, with authority to make an appropriation therefor not exceeding the sum of two hundred and fifty dollars ($250).

We do not recommend the publication with the Catalogue of selections from the examinations of the students.

The Committee concur fully with the Faculty as to the expediency and propriety of promoting the celebration of the semi-centennial of the University. We have fully considered the suggestions of the Faculty on this subject, but we think it inexpedient that the Board of Visitors make any appropriation for this object. We think that the Board should provide only for the usual order of exercises and that the arrangements for this celebration may with propriety be left to the action of the Society of Alumni. We therefore recommend that the Executive Committee be authorized to confer with any Committee appointed by the Alumni, to make arrangements for the celebration and that said Ex. Committee have authority to grant such proper use of the grounds & buildings as may be necessary.

2. The Committee approve the suggestions made by the proctor as to advances made to Boarding House-Keepers and recommend that hereafter no advance be made for a period exceeding one month and then only on such security as is now required.

3. The Committee recommend that the stated salaries of the Professors as fixed by resolutions of the Board on the 27th day of June 1873, be continued until otherwise ordered. They also recommend that the regulations in relation to the fees of their tuition to be paid to professors & in relation to emoluments, as fixed by the resolutions aforesaid of the 27th of June 1873 numbered from 1 to 5 inclusive be continued in force.

4. The Committee have considered the question in relation to the salary of Professor Minor, which is set forth in his letter to the Rector dated     day of     1874 and herewith returned.

We have examined the records of the Board from the earliest date to the present time and find that there is some confusion. as to the date at which the salaries of Professors are due, and also as to the periods of time of service for which the salaries are paid. This confusion seems to result from looseness of expression in some of the resolves of the Board- which seem to give countenance to almost any construction which may be contended for. There are however certain fixed points from which a decided conclusion seems deducible.

The services of a professor are due to the University for and during the session of 9 months and for no other period. It would therefore appear that his salary is paid for this period. It would therefore appear that his salary is paid for this period, and for no other. The word year is used, but may mean scholastic year and not calendar year. By one resolution of the Board, the salary is to commence from the date of acceptance of the office. Still it will scarcely be contended, that if a professor is elected 1st of July and accepts, and dies or declines the office on the 1st of October that he would be entitled to 3 months pay for these three vacation months.

We find that the stated salaries have been paid in equal instalments, on the 1st October & 1st of April of each year. If a professor be selected on July 1st or in August or in September he would receive his semiannual salary at the commencement of the next session viz 1 Oct. and a similar amount on the 1st of April following. No difference has ever been made because of differences in date of election. From this it seems fairly deducible that the salary was considered as commencing from the beginning of the session, and that one half of it was then paid in advance. The other half being paid on April 1 following. The whole salary for the scholastic year was paid during the session. This seems to have been the view taken by this Board in the Resolutions passed June 27th 1874. The salaries were fixed "for the ensuing year" Again, in the resolution directing payment of the salary of the late Dr. McGuffey after reciting that his duties had been satisfactorily performed by Dr. Withersppon, under arrangement made with the family of Dr. McGuffey payment is directed to be made of the stated salary "for the session of 1872-3" in full. We therefore think that, by the payment made to the several professors of one half of their salaries on 1st October 1872 and one half on 1 April 1873, they had received their stated salaries in full for that scholastic year, which terminated on 1 July 1873. We further are of opinion that no salaries thereafter accrued or commenced running until the 1st of October 1873.

5. We recommend that the Rector correspond with Col. Charles Marshall, of Baltimore, in reference to the legacy left the University of Va. by Wm. H. Reed, and take such steps, in regard thereto as may be necessary to protect the interests of the University.

The Committee will be unable to report what appropriations should be made for the next year until the reports of other Committees have been made and acted on by the Board.

The undersigned respectfully reports that he has personally examined the Library and he has found everything connected therewith in excellent condition and it gives him pleasure to hear testimony to the evidences of faithful discharge of duty on the part of the Librarian.

The recommendation of the Librarian in his Report that Public Palls shall be hereafter prohibited in the Library, has received careful consideration and after investigation, the undersigned while recognizing and appreciating the conscientious motives of the Librarian in making his suggestions on this point, has arrived at a totally different conclusion. The main objection urged that the Insurance on the Building will be greatly increased if the Annual Ball is held in the Library Hall seems not to be founded on the facts of the case. The Proctor and Superintendent informs the undersigned that the Insurance Companies have raised no objection on this point and are not likely to do so. The danger arising from the use of candles has been obviated by the laying of gas pipes around the galleries and the jets are so arranged that the lights will project from the galleries and be entirely out of reach of parties on the main floor. In fact, in the opinion of the undersigned, the danger of fire in the Library on such occasions is as small as in any Hall of a similar character in the Country.

As far as the visiting public and the young men are concerned, the Annual Ball is one of the chief items of attraction of the session- and it is peculiarly proper that the handsomest Hall at our command should be used for the occasion. Therefore the undersigned recommends that this whole question should be left to the discretion of the Chairman and Faculty as has been the case heretofore.

The undersigned would advise the appropriation of at least $50 for the structure of new cases for the books and for the purchase of new books for the present cases. In the event that financial status of the University is such as not to justify this appropriation out of the general fund the undersigned would suggest that as much as $50 be appropriated for the purpose above indicated, out of the $83, collected for fines.

Your Committee respectfully report that they have inspected the grounds & public buildings and are gratified to state they are in improved condition generally. The grounds are no longer disfigured by paths but present the appearance of a well-kept lawn. And the buildings are in a fair state of preservation. The committee with pleasure say that everything practicable seems to have been done to make the best show in and about the University.

The University Farm has improved in appearance, and the crops indicate that the tillage has been industrious, and in view of the unusual thinness of the land, encouragingly successful.

The Committee have had their attention directed to the decayed condition of the porch to the rear of Col. Peters Pavilion and the dampness of Prof. Minor's basement. And they recommend the appropriation of $40.00 for the repair of the former and $125 for the drainage and reflooring of the latter.

The Committee being satisfied that Prof. Minor absolutely needs increased accommodation for his family, recommend that the dormitory next to the room now used by him as his office be assigned to him until the necessary addition can be made to his residence.

The Committee find the floor of the basement of the Infirmary rotten and in need of repair and they deem it advisable to have it replaced, and provisions made to make the basement less damp and more comfortable; they therefore recommend the appropriation of $150 towards said improvement.

The Committee in response to the application of Prof. Minor to the Board of Visitors, recommend he be allowed one dormitory for students who may board with him, provided that the said dormitory shall not be on the lawn, and shall be selected so as not to interfere with the assignment to the Hotel Keepers if practicable.

Upon the several applications of Prof. Smith, Boeck, and Dunnington the Committee recommend that no action shall be taken at present.

The Committee recommend that dormitory No. 6 reserved for the Board of Visitors on the lawn, in which the records of the Board are now kept, be no longer used for such purpose, and that the records be removed to the Library for safe keeping and the said dormitory be turned over to the Proctor for the use of students.

Your Committee respectfully reports, that they made a full and particular examination so far as they were competent, thereof, of the Laboratory of the University and of the Philosophic Apparatus in charge of Prof. Smith, and that the inventory required by law from Professors Mallet and Smith are herewith returned and adopted as a part of the report of the Committee.
