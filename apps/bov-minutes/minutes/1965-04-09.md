The President reminded the Board of the adoption of the resolution at its meeting on 6 February 1965 establishing the Tayloe Murphy Institute. After consultation with the anonymous donors, the President stated that the donors have asked that the size of the Council be increased in membership from 11 to not to exceed 23 members, thereby giving greater flexibility. Also, the President noted the need to make a correction by changing the figure of $600,000 in the first paragraph to a value in excess of $1,000,000.

Accordingly, the resolution was amended and reenacted as follows:

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the Tayloe Murphy Institute be and it is hereby established at the University of Virginia in recognition and appreciation of the great public service and of the unfaltering support of the Graduate School of Business Administration of the late W.

RESOLVED FURTHER that the Institute shall not become operative until matching gifts in the amount of at least $600,000 be received and added to the special endowment fund held for the University of Virginia for the Tayloe Murphy Institute by the Virginia National Bank in Norfolk, the income from which is to be used for the same purpose as the income from the gift of the anonymous donors, with the operative date of the Institute to be certified by the President when the additional matching gifts in the amount of $600,000 have been received,

RESOLVED FURTHER that the Dean of the Graduate School of Business Administration shall be the Director of the Tayloe Murphy Institute and shall be assisted by a council composed of not more than 23 members, 2 of whom shall be the Rector and the President of the University, serving as ex officio members, to be appointed by the Board of Visitors on the nomination of the President and the Dean of the Graduate School of Business Administration for three-year terms so arranged as to provide for the termination of one-third of the members' terms each year, and no appointive member shall be eligible for more than two consecutive terms, and,

PROVIDED FURTHER that, as Director of the Institute, the Dean of the Graduate School of Business Administration shall make on behalf of the Council an annual report to the President of the University upon the work of the Institute, including a summary of the income and expenditures of the Institute for the year and the proposed budget for the ensuing year, and that the income of the Institute shall not be obligated to support ordinary operating expenses of the Graduate School of Business Administration.

The President reported that residents of the area of the University Airport, on State Route 729 near Milton, are desirous of having the State Highway Department improve the road, specifically to take out a dangerous curve on a stretch of road that runs between the University of Virginia Airport tract and a tract under private ownership. The State Highway Department has informally indicated to the President's Office that most of the work probably would be done on the side of the road that is privately owned, and that a very small portion of the University property would be involved, possibly requiring no more than a drainage easement.

The following resolution was adopted:

The President noted that some time ago the Board of Visitors instructed the appropriate University authorities not to institute court action to collect delinquent student loans. The President reported, however, that under the Federal loan program, which consists of 10 percent University funds and 90 percent Federal funds, the Federal regulations provide a very strict procedure for collection. He stated that the University would have to institute court action if required by these regulations but he hoped that this would not be necessary.
