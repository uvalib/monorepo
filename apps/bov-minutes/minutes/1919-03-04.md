A called meeting of the Pector and Visitors was held on this date at 8 o'clock in the evening. There were present the Rector, R. Tate Irvine, and Visitors Goodrich Hatton, C. Harding Walker, John Stewart Bryan, George R. B. Michie, and Alexander F. Robertson. The minutes of the previous meeting, copies of which had been mailed to the several Visitors, were approved.

The President announced to the Board the death of Professor William H. Heck on January 4, 1919, and on motion it was

**RESOLVED:** That the President prepare suitable resolutions touching the death of Professor Heck to be spread upon the minutes of this meeting.

The President asked for instructions as to continuing the salary of Professor Heck to his widow as has been customary in similar cases, and on motion it was

**RESOLVED:** That the salary heretofore paid to Professor Heck be paid to his widow until September 15, 1919, and that she be given the privilege of retaining the use of Pavilion 2, East Lawn until that date under the arrangement as to rent now existing.

The President announced the following gifts and stated that he had made due acknowledgments of the same on behalf of the Board:

* Ferrell D. Minor, $10,000 Liberty Bonds for Law Library Endowment.
* Bequest of Elizabeth B. White, $4750.
* Samuel Sachs, $1000 for Art Study.
* Peabody Bust, J. P. Morgan, Jr., $600.
* Cobb Portrait.
* Andrew Courtney Campbell Tablet.

The President brought to the attention of the Board some new developments in connection with the bequest of $200,000 to the University of Virginia by Col. Oliver H. Payne, stating that since the last meeting a paper containing a schedule of the bequests in Col. Payne's will had been found in his desk and the item of $200,000 for the University of Virginia had been changed in pencil to read $250,000, and across this was marked the word "paid"; that this paper had been examined by him in company with Mr. W. W. Fuller, who was familiar with the handwriting of Col. Payne, and that he, Mr. Fuller, was of the opinion that the writing was that of Col. Payne. Mr. Hatton then asked President Alderman what action the executors wished the Board to take in the matter, and he replied that it was their wish for the Board to renounce the bequest. After some discussion the matter was disposed of in the following resolution offered by Mr. Hatton:

**RESOLVED:** That the opinion in writing of Dean Lile in relation to the bequest of Col. Oliver H. Payne to the University be referred to Dean Lile with the request that he reconsider the same in the light of the facts which have developed since that opinion was written, and which have been reported by the President, and with the request that Dean Lile after such reconsideration, give a further opinion.

Professor J. L. Newcomb, Chairman of the Special Committee on Establishment of R. O. T. C. Units at the University of Virginia, personally presented the following report of his committee:

At a meeting of the General Faculty held February 8, 1919, the following resolution was unanimously adopted:
**(Resolved, That the General Faculty recommends to the Rector and Board of Visitors that one or more units of the R. O. T. C. be established at the University of Virginia.)**

The President then appointed the undersigned committee to study the tentative R.O.T.C. programs for the various branches of the service and make recommendations in regard to the most effective R.O.T.C. service that the University of Virginia might be able to render.

The War Department Committee on Education submitted programs for the following units:

* Infantry
* Cavalry
* Field Artillery
* Coast (heavy) Artillery
* Engineering Corps
* Signal Corps

The members of the committee unanimously join in recommending the establishment of a Coast (heavy) Artillery unit for these reasons:

1. Such a unit would in no manner interfere with the normal course of student life and study at the University of Virginia because neither uniforms nor drill would be required during the regular session, all practical military work being done in summer camps. Moreover, the equipment which the Government furnishes for a Coast (heavy) Artillery unit can be readily housed and cared for by the University.

2. The instruction of the volunteer student members of a Coast (heavy) Artillery unit is of genuine scientific character, maintained and carried on in accordance with the University's regular standard of learning and scholarship. This course would seem to be a peculiarly appropriate educational as well as patriotic duty for the University to undertake.

The establishment of an Infantry, Cavalry, or Field Artillery unit would not possess the advantages mentioned above.

The work of the Engineering Corps and Signal Corps unit would be of the same scientific character as the training for Coast (heavy) Artillery, but would seem (from the tentative programs of study) to involve serious readjustment of courses in the Department of Engineering, and the enlargement of the Engineering Faculty. Moreover, in the case of an Engineering Corps unit such military features as uniforms, drill and marching to class would be required. It should be understood, however, that these conditions laid down in the programs submitted are only tentative and may well be changed after conference between the University authorities and proper representatives of the War Department.

In view of these facts the committee again unanimously recommends that the President of the University be authorized to invite proper representatives of the Engineering and Signal Corps to confer with the Engineering Faculty in regard to the removal of objectional requirements, and also with regard to the feasibility of the Government's furnishing the number of additional instructors needed. Provided this conference should safeguard and prove satisfactory to the University's best interests, the Committee recommends the the President be given discretionary power for the establishment of either an Engineering Corps unit, or Signal Corps unit, or both.

### COPY OF PROGRAM SUGGESTED FOR AFFILIATION BETWEEN THE TUBERCULOSIS SANATORIUM OF THE STATE BOARD OF HEALTH AND THE MEDICAL SCHOOL OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA.

If the State Board of Health will establish and maintain a Tuberculosis Sanatorium sufficiently close to the Medical School of the University of Virginia for effective cooperation, and if the State Board of Health will permit the Medical Director of the Sanatorium to teach the problems of tuberculosis to the students and nurses of the medical department of the University, and for this purpose use such patients in the sanatorium as may seem suitable to the Medical Director; the Medical School of the University will on its part affiliate with the sanatorium, and promote the work of the sanatorium in so far as such promotion and affiliation is compatible with the other objects and duties of the Medical School and the University Hospital.

It is the judgment of the President that the Visitors of the University will be glad to make the Medical Director, and if necessary his assistant, members of the Faculty of the Medical School, provided these officers show the proper qualifications for such positions; the Hospital authorities will undertake to take such measures as are customary for hospital authorities in order to provide the Tuberculosis Sanatorium with internes or other medical officers; the fourth year students in suitable groups will be available for ward work in the Tuberculosis Sanatorium, as they are in the University Hospital, and similarly the third year students will be available as in the University Hospital; the Training School for Nurses will provide in rotation groups of nurses for the Tuberculosis Sanatorium who shall receive special instruction in the Sanatorium and round out their complete training in the University Hospital; the wards of the University Hospital and the staff of the Hospital will be available for the treatment of such complicating diseases as the patients in the Sanatorium may present and on the same basis as other Virginia state patients presenting at this hospital; the X-ray out-fit at the Hospital will be placed at the disposal of the medical authorities of the Sanatorium.

The above propositions are to be understood as applying in so far as compliance with them will not interfere with the proper development and conduct of the Medical School and Nurses Training School, and will not interfere with the proper development and conduct of the University Hospital. Moreover, expenses attached to the carrying out of this program, (for example, the expenses incidental to the use of the X-ray apparatus), must either be borne by the Sanatorium, or adequate arrangements must be made outside of this outlined program between the State Board of Health authorities and those of the University of Virginia.

The Sanatorium will undertake to board and lodge doctors, students and nurses while they are acting as workers in the sanatorium.

In addition to the above it is also the judgment of the President that the Rector and Visitors of the University will be willing to contribute annually towards the support of the Medical Director, or his assistant, provided the State Board of Health shall consider it wise to accept such contribution. The amount of this contribution, which shall be between one thousand dollars and three thousand dollars a year, remains to be determined by conference between the Commissioner of Health and the President of the University of Virginia.

The President of the University is indeed anxious that this affiliation shall be established, and any further propositions not contemplated in the above program will be considered in the most cooperative spirit compatible with the other interests of the University of Virginia.
