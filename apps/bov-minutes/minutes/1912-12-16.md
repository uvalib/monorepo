Alderman, acting herein as President of the University of Virginia, party of the second part, Thomas Smith of Warrenton, State of Virginia, party of the third part, and Frederick Waugh Smith, of Cape Town, South Africa, party of the fourth part; the said Thomas Smith and Frederick Waugh Smith being the sole heirs at law and next of kin of the said Mary Amelia Smith;

Whereas, Mary Amelia Smith, late of Warrenton, State of Virginia, departed this life on or about the 20th day of September, 1911, leaving a last will and testament bearing date the 3rd day of January, 1911, in words and figures as follows, to-wit;

"I, Mary Amelia Smith of the County of Fauquier, State of Virginia, do write and announce, on this third day of January, nineteen hundred and eleven my last will and testament, feeling a comfortable assurance that my parents would have approved this disposition of my property.

1. I hereby place my estate in the hands of the Fidelity and Trust Company of Baltimore, which, with the concurrence of my hereby appointed Executor, Hon. Eppa Hunton will proceed at once to make the most profitable investment of this Trust, paying to my brothers Thomas Smith and Frederick Waugh Smith, equal shares of the interest of such Trust, or to their authorized agents.

2. At the close of life of either, or both, of these Legatees, each share becomes the absolute property of the University of Virginia under the supervision of the President of the University, to be expended in a permanent tribute to my father Maj. Gen. and Ex. Gov. Wm. Smith—;—;easily recognized, not obscured by a multiplcity of others.

3. I leave to my brother Thomas for his life and use only, the diamond ring I inherited from my brother Austin. At the death of my brother Thomas this ring must be at once exacted by the Trust Co. before mentioned, and my Executor, and sold to advantage to add to the fund for the University.

4. My jewels and furniture, except the pieces hereinafter mentioned are to be sold and the proceeds placed to the credit of the fund above mentioned. A list of these will be appended to this paper—;and likewise a list of my real estate.

And whereas Frederick Waugh Smith, party hereto of the fourth part, has notified the others parties interested in said will that he would contest the admission of the will to probate and record and would also contest the carrying into effect of the provisions thereof by reason of the uncertainty of the trust mentioned therein:

And whereas Thomas Smith, the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia and Edwin A. Alderman, as President of the University of Virginia, the other parties hereto, are desirious of avoiding any litigation over the probate of the will or the construction thereof; and whereas it appears that Eppa Hunton, Jr., the party named as Executor under said will, has renounced his right to qualify,

And whereas the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, in pursuance of an offer of settlement submitted by Thomas Smith and Frederick Waugh Smith, parties hereto of the third and fourth parts, did on the 12th day of November, 1912, at a meeting of the Board of Visitors unanimously adopt the following resolutions to-wit:

Smith, one of the devisees and legatees under the will of Miss Mary Amelia Smith, viz: that he will refrain from his proposed attack upon said will, upon condition that the Rector and Visitors of the University surrender in absolute right the one-half of the estate passing under said will to said Frederick W. Smith, and that John B. Moon, the attorney for the University, be authorized to carry this agreement into effect. By agreement of the parties interested, however, the provisions of said will may be modified or set aside in whole or in part, with a view to carrying out the proposed settlement.

Resolved: That this action of the Board is taken through their respect and esteem for Colonel Thomas Smith, another legatee and devisee under said will, and their regard for his wishes in the premises."

And whereas the parties hereto, desiring to settle all matters in controversy between them, have agreed, and do hereby agree, in consideration of the premises and the sum of One Dollar, by each of the parties hereto to the other paid, the receipt of which, before the signing and sealing of these presents is hereby acknowledged, to the following terms of settlement, to-wit:

3. That the entire estate of the said Mary Amelia Smith shall, after the payment of all debts due by the decedent and all charges and expenses incident to the administration thereof, be divided into two parts or shares.

4. That one of such parts or shares shall be transferred, conveyed and paid over to Frederick Waugh Smith, absolutely and in fee simple.

5. That the other part or share thereof shall be held by the said Thomas Smith in trust, the income thereof to be used by him for and during his life, and at his death the principal thereof shall become the property of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, absolutely and in fee simple, but subject to such future agreement as may be entered into between the said Thomas Smith and the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia in respect thereto.

6. That any and all real estate which was owned by the decedent, Mary Amelia Smith, at the time of her death, wheresoever situate, is to be sold by Thomas Smith, and the same conveyed, without any liability upon the purchaser to see to the application of the purchase money, and the proceeds thereof shall be treated and distributed as part of her personal estate along with the remainder of her estate.

The committee appointed at the last meeting of the Board, to prepare resolutions in respect to the death of Dr. John W. Mallet, through the chairman, Dean Page (acting for the president) presented the following, which were adopted:

The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, in session assembled, desiring to record a memorial of their esteem for the character, attainments and achievements of the late Dr. John William Mallet, emeritus professor of chemistry in the University of Virginia have adopted the following minute:

Dr. Mallet was born in Dublin, Ireland, October 10, 1832. He was the son of Robert and Cordelia Watson, and was educated at Trinity College, Dublin, from which he graduated in 1853, with the academic degree of bachelor of arts. He was afterwards a student at the University of Gottingen, from which he received the degree of doctor of philosophy in the summer of 1853, and coming to America in the same year, became in the following year assistant professor in Amherst College, Massachusetts. In 1854 Dr. J. L. M. Curry, subsequently distinguished as the agent of the Peabody Fund, and as United States Minister to Spain, procured the enactment of the legislature of Alabama of a Statute establishing a Geological Survey; and Dr. Mallet became chemist to the Survey organized under that act. He held this office from 1855 to 1856; and from 1855 to 1860 he was also professor of chemistry in the University of Alabama. Upon the breaking out of the War between the States he entered the service of the Confederate States, and was an officer on the staff of General Rodes. In 1862 he was transferred to the artillery, and was placed in general charge of the ordnance laboratories of the Confederate States government. The duties of this position were discharged by him with an ability and fidelity which gave him a fame inferior only to that which he achieved as teacher, scholar and chemist in the subsequent years of peace. He was paroled at the close of the war in 1865, while holding the office of lieutenant colonel of artillery; and his loyalty to the memories of the cause he served so faithfully and conspicuously from 1861-1865 continued unabated to his death. No one of the friends of the University of Virginia contributed more unselfishly of his interest and energies to make successful the recent happy re-union at the University of the survivors of her sons who went forth to battle in 1861, and none entered more eagerly or with a finer spirit into the beautiful ceremonies of that occasion.

In 1865 he became professor of chemistry in the medical department of the University of Louisiana, pursuing meanwhile a full course of medical lectures as a student of the institution, and obtaining its degree of Doctor of Medicine in 1868. From 1868 to 1872 he filled the chair of analytical, industrial and agricultural chemistry in the University of Virginia, and that of general and industrial chemistry from 1872 to 1883, while during the session of 1877-1878, he also delivered a course of lectures at Johns Hopkins. In 1883 he was called to the chair of chemistry and physics in the then newly organized University of Texas, where he continued until the following year, filling meanwhile the office of Chairman of the Faculty of that institution. From Texas he went in 1884 to the Jefferson Medical College of Philadelphia, and served there for one session as professor of chemistry.

But his heart was always with the University of Virginia from the time of his first association with it, and in 1885 he came back to his old chair in the University, and thenceforth occupied it with ever increasing ability and distinction until his retirement as emeritus professor in 1908.

Dr. Mallet's work went outside of the routine that characterises the laboratory and the lecture room. He wrote articles and papers covering a great variety of subjects connected with his profession; and he delivered many addresses not only of a technical, but also of a literary character; while his reputation as a toxicologist caused him to be sought as an expert in a number of important criminal and quasi-criminal trials.

His achievements and consequent fame brought him many honors. He was a doctor of laws of the College of William and Mary, of the University of Mississippi, of Princeton, of Johns Hopkins, and of the University of Pennsylvania; he served three times as a member of the United States Assay Commission; he was a fellow of the Medical Society of Virginia, of the Chemical Society of London, and of the Royal Society of Great Britain; and was an associate fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was a member of the New York Academy of Sciences, of the Medical and Surgical Faculty of Maryland, of the American Philosophical Society, and of the American Chemical Society, of which last named association he filled the office of President; and he also held membership in a number of scientific societies of foreign countries. His scholarship was catholic and far-reaching; and his facility of expression in his mother-language, whether by tongue or pen, was unexcelled.

Imbued with an eager love of knowledge, he remained a student to the end; and his interest in the affairs of life continued with undiminished zest as long as life lasted. He loved the University of Virginia, to which he gave so much of value and distinction, with a passionate and unrestrained devotion; and he was unfailing in his loyalty to its traditions and in his desire for its welfare.

To his influence here in all that made for dignity of character, breadth of view, freedom from narrowness, and a lofty intellectual courage, those who sat at his feet, as at the feet of a Gamaliel, must bear testimony with a ready acclaim.

Full of cheerfulness and a kindly interest in his surroundings that stayed with him to the last, having filled to overflowing the years of the Psalmist with good and noble works, he passed on the day of November, 1912, from the sphere of his activities and illustrious achievements, in the comfort of a reasonable, religious and holy hope, "to where beyond these voices there is peace."

Resolved: That the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia accept, with sincere appreciation and thanks, the gift of Mr. Arthur Curtiss James, of $400.00 which is to be used to complete a bibliography of all important printed matter on the negro question.

Resolved: That the Rector and Visitors approve of the resolutions adopted by the Miller Board, at their meeting of June 1912, and that Professors Tuttle and Dunnington be and are hereby requested by this Board to carry out as far as practicable the requests of the Miller Board.

The resolutions of the Miller Board are as follows:

Resolved; That Professor Tuttle be requested to begin the preparation of a catalogue of the weeds and grasses that grow or may be grown in the County of Albemarle, with suggestions for the control or eradication of such as may be noxious, and the culture and development of such as may be beneficial or profitable to practical farmers, said catalogue to be extended, as the opportunity may arise, to embrace the flora of the county.

Resolved: That Professors Tuttle and Dunnington be requested to prepare for publication at least one annual bulletin from each School, dealing with one or more subjects of practical agricultural interest for dissemination amongst the farmers of Virginia.

A copy from the minutes.

R. T. W. Duke, Jr. Secretary & Treasurer.

Resolved: That the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia approve the donation of $25.00 from the contingent fund of the University, to the alumni of Washington, D. C., as a contribution towards paying for placing the seal of the University of Virginia on the University Club House now being erected in that city.

Resolved: That the sum of $140.00, be and is hereby appropriated for the Phelps-Stokes Fellowship in order to bring the amount of the emolument of said fellowship up to $500.00.

Whereas, Mr. L. L. Hamner registered in this University during the session of 1909-'10 and 1910-'11 as a non-Virginia student, although he was entitled to be registered as a Virginia student; and whereas, the said Hamner paid in fees for the sessions mentioned the sum of $255.00, although he should have paid only $20.00, be it therefore,

Resolved: That the sum of $235.00, be refunded to Mr. Hamner as follows: $150.00 to be credited on his account as a student in the Law School for the present session; and the remaining $85.00 to be paid to him in cash.

The following application for the house formerly occupied by Dr. J. W. Mallet, was received; whereupon it was

Resolved: That this application be granted, provided the President has made no other disposition of the house.

The letter follows:

Were hereby make application through you to the Rector and Visitors of the University, that the house formerly occupied by Professor J. W. Mallet be assigned to us, jointly, when it shall be given up by Mrs. Mallet.

If this request be granted, it is our intention to occupy this house as a home.

Resolved: That the Assistant in School of Germanic Languages be paid $300.00 for the session 1912-'13, instead of $150.00 on account of additional work to be done by him in that School.

Resolved: That Mr. Sterling H. Diggs be and he is hereby appointed Instructor in the School of Philosophy for the current session at a salary of $600.00.

Resolved: That a sum, not to exceed $500.00 be and is hereby appropriated for carrying forward the work of the University Extension Scheme.

Resolved: That the President of the University after due warning to the holder, may declare any scholarship or fellowship vacant at any time if in the judgment of the President and Faculty the holder fails to give satisfactory evidence of diligence or the faithful performance of his duties.

Resolved: That the vocational degree of "Bachelor of Science in Medicine" be conferred upon the candidate who completes the following courses: B1 German, B1 French; A1 Mathematics; A1 English, B1 Chemistry; B1 Botany or B1 Zoology; B1 Physics,—;and the whole of the first two years work in the Department of Medicine.

Resolved: That the Dean of the University be and he is hereby authorized to expend a sum, from the general funds of the University, not to exceed $300.00 to pay for assistance in his teaching work during the absence of the President of the University.

Resolved: 1st, That the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia accept the offer of Mrs. Charles M. Blackford to establish in the University an annual prize of $50.00, to be called the Charles Minor Blackford Memorial Prize, for the best essay on some theme from the field of Law or Sociology, submitted by regularly matriculated students from the Department of Law.

Resolved: 2nd, That they recognize in this prize appropriate tribute to the memory of an honored alumnus of this University, who was distinguished not less for the grace and power of his writings than for the sagacity and force of his legal arguments, and that they offer to Mrs. Blackford the assurance of their appreciation and their thanks.

Resolved: 3rd, That they request the Faculty of the Department of Law to prepare, in conference with Mrs. Blackford, or her representative, suitable rules governing the competition for this prize, and to make public announcement of them.

Resolved: That the rules governing the rental and occupancy of University dormitories are as follows:

The rates given below are for the session of nine months.

The rooms in the dormitories are unfurnished. The minimum cost of furniture for a single room may be placed at $15.00 for the session and can be secured from the local furniture dealers,

Resolved: That the Building Committee having charge of the matter of recommending plans for a building to take the place of the old Temperance Hall be continued; that they obtain bids on the building and grading as proposed, in general accordance with the plans submitted at this meeting of the Board of Visitors; and that the matter of financing the construction and grading be referred to the Finance Committee of this Board for consideration and report to this Board at their next meeting,—;it being the opinion of the Board that, if the Finance Committee concurs, such funds belonging to the University endowment as may be necessary for the purpose and advantageously so invested, be invested in the said construction.

The reports of the Committee on Religious Exercises, and of the Building Committee are as follows:

1. The Committee on Religious Exercises approves of the general plan for the rebuilding of the Temperance Hall and the changing of its surroundings, as prepared by architect, Mr. Eugene Bradbury, and recommends that the work be done in accordance with the general scheme therein set forth....(carried)

2. The Chairman of the Religious Exercise Committee and the committeeman in charge of Temperance Hall shall represent the Committee in co-operation with the University authorities, or any Committee that they shall appoint, in deciding upon, and carrying into effect all details of the plans, construction of the building, and financing the same....(carried.)

### Report of Building Committee

Resolved: That this Committee approves, in a general way, the plans offered by the religious exercise committee for the improvement of the Old Temperance Hall and gateway and entrance to the University. We feel, however, that the plan should, if possible, diminish the conspicuous character of the central architectural feature.

We suggest that a committee be appointed to act in conjunction with the landscape architect to decide upon the architectural character of the improvements.

It is our opinion that the University could make a safe investment for this improvement to the amount of $20,000.

signed: J. M. Page, of the Committee.

W. M. Randolph, of the Committee.

W. A. Lambeth, of the Committee.

C. G. Maphis. of the Committee.

The committee having in charge the erection of the Educational Building reported progress, and was continued.

The petition of the Kappa Alpha Fraternity for a location for a fraternity house on the proposed boulevard on Carr's Hill was received and filed.

Resolved: That the Rector and Visitors grant to President Alderman a leave of absence from his duties as President of the University, until September 1st, 1913; and that they express their sincere sympathy with him in his present condition of health and the hope for his early recovery.

That Dean J. M. Page be authorized and requested to discharge the presidential duties in the absence of President Alderman, and that he be paid for his services in that connection at the rate of $1500.00 per annum, beginning from the date of Dr. Alderman's departure until the first of September 1913, or Dr. Alderman's earlier return.

The recommendations offered in the following letter from the Superintendent of Buildings and Grounds, were approved.

I beg to recommend that we carry out the suggestion made by Messrs. Coolidge and Bacon at their recent visit to the University. I have only by a slow process reached this conclusion. It was made to us some four years ago by Mr. Brown, the landscape man for the Government grounds and buildings at Washington.

The suggestion is that we remove five trees in order to open up a vista to the University and Rotunda dome from the Post-Office. If this is done it should be effected during the winter.

On motion, the Board adjourned, subject to the call of the Rector.
