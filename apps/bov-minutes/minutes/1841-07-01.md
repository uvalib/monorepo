Board of Visitors' minutes, Accession # RG-1/1/, Special Collections Dept., University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Va.

Minutes of meetings of the university's governing body which is the legal owner and operator of the institution.

On Thursday July the 1st 1841 Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia assembled at the University in annual meeting: Present Chapman Johnson, (Rector), Joseph C. Cabell, John H. Cocke, Ths. J. Randolph, James M. Mason, & Samuel Taylor-

The Board were occupied during nearly the whole of the three first days of their meeting in examining the numerous testimonials accompanying the applications of the respective candidates for the vacant professorships of Law, Mathematics & Modern Languages. On the first day no other business was done.

Friday July 2d 1841. Present all the members of the Board except Mr. Rives.

The following resolutions were passed

1. It is represented to the Board that Messrs. Caskie & Shanklin, students at the University have graduated in all the schools necessary to entitle them to the Degree of A. M. except in Modern Languages, in which school they have both received degrees in the French Language at the last session; That at the commencement of the present session, it was recommended to them by the Chairman because of the uncertain condition of the school of Modern Languages, to refrain from entering it, in consequence of which, by the same recommendation, they each entered, in lieu, the class of political Economy in which they received certificates of proficiency, & the fact being that the chair of Modern Languages having become soon after vacant, thus justifying the doubt that was entertained:- It is resolved, under the special circumstances above detailed, the Faculty be authorised to confer the degree of A.M. on each of those gentlemen- But that a special endorsement be made on the Diploma of each, noting the absence of one degree in the school of Modern Languages, because of the condition of the school at the present session-

2. Resolved, that Henry St. George Tucker be appointed professor of Law at the University of Virginia from and after the present session.

3. Resolved that Henry St. George Tucker be appointed Chairman of the Faculty for the ensuing year; and that the Rector communicate the above resolutions to Mr. Tucker.

### Saturday July 3d 1841.

Present as on yesterday.

1. Resolved, that while the Board entertain a very favorable opinion of the proposition submitted by the Society of Alumni, respecting the establishment of a professorship of general History and English Literature, they deem it inexpedient, in the present state of the Funds of the University, to make an appropriation to that object at this time; and that a copy of this resolution be communicated to the Society thro' the Secretary of this Board.

The Board then took a recess to attend the proceedings of the public day. After these were concluded the Board again assembled, and passed the following resolutions Resolved,

2. That professor J. J. Sylvester of the University College London be, and he is hereby appointed Professor of Mathematics at the University of Virginia for one year from and after the termination of the present session: and that the Rector communicate to Mr. Sylvester his appointment.

3. Resolved that Doct: Charles Kraitser be and he is hereby appointed professor of Modern Languages at the University of Virginia for one year from and after the termination of the present session: And that the Rector do communicate to Doct: Kraitser his appointment.

The Board then adjourned till Monday morning.

It is ordered, that the Visitors do not feel themselves at liberty to make any disposition of the pavilion & its appurtenances which might interfere with its occupancy by another professor preparatory to the ensuing session; but that the Proctor, under the control of the Faculty be, and he is hereby authorised to grant to Mrs. Bonnycastle any other accommodation for her furniture \&c which may not interfere with the necessary appropriation of the buildings or rooms at the University.

2. Resolved that the thanks of the board of Visitors be unanimously tendered to Mr. Pike Powers for the very able and satisfactory manner in which he discharged the duties of professor of Mathematics ad interim in this University for the unexpired portion of the session ensuing the death of Professor Bonnycastle;- a manner which, in the opinion of the board, evinces high mathematical talent & attainment, and a happy power as a lecturer and instructor, and that the Secretary do communicate the foregoing resolution to Mr. Powers.

3. The application of Messrs. Lay & Jenkins to be permitted to occupy the vacant rooms in pavilion No. 7 (the Old Library) being considered by the board - Resolved that it is inexpedient to permit the occupancy of said rooms by the Students.

4. Nathaniel P.

5. Resolved that the Proctor be authorised to pay to Professor Tucker the Interest upon the money advanced by him under the authority of the resolutions of July 1829 & 1837 for certain alterations in pavilion No.9 as the same was stipulated in said resolutions, from the time of its expenditure until it was reimbursed.

6. Resolved that the Secretary be authorised to return the testimonials of those offering for appointments to the vacant professorships, who have not been appointed, to the persons who presented the same or their agent.

7. Resolved that when any vacancy may exist in the office of Chairman during the recess of the Board of Visitors the Faculty shall have power to appoint a Chairman pro tempore who shall be invested with all the powers of Chairman and shall hold his office 'till a successor be appointed by the board of Visitors.

8. Resolved that the proctor account with Mrs. Bonnycastle as administratrix of her husband and with Mr. Pike Powers for the sum of one thousand dollars which would have been due to Mr. Bonnycastle if he had lived, for that proportion of his salary which would have accrued from the period of his death to the end of the session, paying to Mr. Powers five hundred dollars of that sum, and accounting with Mrs. Bonnycastle for the other five hundred dollars, provided that Mr. Powers shall accept the sum so to be paid to him in addition to another sum of five hundred dollars which he has already received thro' the hands of the Proctor out of the fees of the school of Mathematics in full satisfaction for the services he has rendered in that school during the past session.

It appearing that the roofs which have recently been erected over the halls at the former gymnasia obstruct the view and are injurious to the aspect of the buildings of the University, and it having been ascertained that they may be reduced without injury to the apartments beneath:

9. That the proctor be instructed to cause the upper portions of the aforesaid roofs to a perpendicular depth of thirty inches to be removed and substituted by flat roofs covered with copper or zinc, and that he proceed, as soon as practicable, to procure the proper materials for the change hereby required.

10. Resolved, that the apartment which is now in a course of execution in place of the Eastern gymnasium be fitted up and appropriated to the general meetings of the University & as a place of religious worship for the professors, officers & their families and of the Students of the University, & that it be placed under the directions of the Faculty.

11. Resolved that the opposite or western hall be fitted up & appropriated as a Lecture room for the professor of Natural Philosophy & for the reception of the philosophical apparatus and of the objects of natural History \&c bequeathed to the University by Mr. Jefferson.

12. Resolved that the two apartments in the first story of the Rotunda, now occupied by the philosophical Apparatus, & by the objects constituting the aforesaid donation of Mr. Jefferson, so soon as the apparatus and those objects shall have been removed shall be used as additional lecture rooms, under the directions of the faculty.

13. It being represented to the Visitors that the present lecture room of the professor of Chemistry in the basement story of the Rotunda is not as well adapted for the purposes of a lecture room as the opposite apartment in the same story, now used as a chemical laboratory.

14. Resolved that the Proctor, under the directions of the professor of Chemistry, be instructed to cause those apartments to be altered in their interior arrangements so as that the Eastern apartment be used as a chemical lecture room & the western apartment as a chemical Laboratory.

Mr. Randolph & Mr. Mason were appointed a committee of finance.

The petition of Doct: Blaetterman for further compensation on account of repairs done to the pavilion which he formerly occupied & for the payment of a balance which he claims as due for a part of his salary, having been considered, and it appearing to the Board that so much of his claim for repairs as was deemed admissible was allowed by a former board, & has been paid, and that so much of the salary claimed by him as was not necessary to defray the expense of repairs to his pavilion which he was bound to make & left undone has been paid him by the proctor, so that there now seems to be nothing justly due to him.

15. Resolved therefore that his petition be not granted.

16. Resolved, that the Proctor be authorised to renew the porch in the rear of pavilion no. 2 and enlarge the size thereof equal to that of no. 4: provided in the opinion of the Executive Committee the funds of the University for the present year would permit it without detriment to the other appropriations.

The petitions of J. W. Norris & James R. Orr two students of the Law School who left the University last fall after the death of Professor Davis, have been carefully considered.

Mr. Orr, who left the University without leave on account of Mr. Davis' death, not being content to continue a student under his successor, asks that the board should return to him a due proportion of the money which he had paid for dormitory rent, for the use of the public buildings and library, & for professors' fees;- and Mr. Norris who left the University by leave of the Chairman of the Faculty on account of ill health, and has had returned to him under an enactment of the University a due proportion of the fees paid for the rent of his dormitory, and the use of the public buildings, now asks that a like proportion of the Professors' fees which he had paid should be returned to him.

By the laws of the University, with which every student is required to make himself acquainted before he matriculates no student is allowed to enter the Institution for any shorter period than for the whole of the session, or for so much thereof as shall remain after his matriculation, and he is required to pay in advance the professors fees to be immediately paid over to them, and to pay in advance the Dormitory rent, & compensation for the use of the public rooms and library, for the whole session. He is not at liberty to leave the University till the end of the session without permission from the proper authority, and even when he leaves it with permission, the University stipulates for the return only of a due proportion of the monies paid for dormitory rent and for the use of the public buildings not interfering with the fees which have been paid to the professors and have thereby become their private property. The University does not stipulate to furnish individual professors; but it is the duty of the Visitors, to remove the unworthy & to supply all vacancies with reasonable diligence. In the case of Mr. Davis' death the vacancy was promptly supplied by the appointment of a gentleman of fine talents & acquirements, & who tho' then without experience has proved himself an excellent lecturer, & discharged his duties to the entire satisfaction of his class.

Under these circumstances the board is of opinion that the students have no just claim upon the University for refunding any part of the sums claimed & that it would be of pernicious influence to set an example of refunding in such cases:

17. Resolved therefore that the petitions of Mr. Norris & Mr. Orr, be rejected, and that the Secretary transmit to each of the petitioners a copy of this resolution.

The Committee of Finance made a report accompanied by the following resolutions which were adopted:

18. Resolved that the proctor be authorised to use temporarily the Legacy of Mr. Madison of $1500 now in the Bank if the exigencies of the University should require it for the expenditures of the present year.

19. Resolved that the appropriations of the present year be in conformity with the accompanying estimate of the proctor and the specific resolutions of this body.

20. Resolved that the chairman of the Faculty cause the papers and manuscripts deposited in the library by the Representatives of the late Richard Henry Lee decd. to be examined and classified by some competent hand on terms that he may deem reasonable & that they, together with a brief descriptive list of such as may appear to be of general interest or value be carefully lodged in such cases in the library as will best ensure their safety & preservation, the expense of this work to be paid by the proctor upon the order of the Chairman.

The Visitors having frequent occasions at their sittings for conference with the professors- It is ordered, that the professors be requested not to leave the University earlier the seventh day (exclusive) after the day of the annual meeting of the Visitors unless the Board of Visitors should have earlier adjourned.

The Proctor reported to the Board that he had appointed Thomas L. Swann Hotelkeeper in place of Christian Grimme resigned.

21. Resolved that said appointment be approved.

22. Resolved that the Proctor be allowed, under the superintendance of the Executive Committee to make such additions or alterations in the House occupied by him as he may suggest, and as may be approved by said committee provided the same do not exceed the sum of six hundred dollars; and provided also that should the funds of the University for the current year be inadequate to this charge that the same shall be advanced by the Proctor to be repaid to him with Interest thereon when the funds of the University may admit.

23. Resolved that the petition of the Jefferson Society for leave to alter Hotel C. be referred to the executive committee with power to allow the alterations to be made under the direction of the Proctor, so far as they may think it can be done without material injury to the building.

The petition of Mrs. M. C. Ward setting forth that in consequence of the death of professor Davis during the past session she had lost sixteen of the boarders assigned to her and praying that the rent of the Hotel occupied by her & which had been paid for the session should be refunded in consequence, was considered by the Board - whereupon it was:

24. Resolved that the prayer of the petition be not allowed.

25. Resolved that in conformity with a request made by Mrs. Davis widow of the late professor Davis, a portion of ground in the burying ground of the University, contiguous to the grave of her deceased husband be set apart & reserved by the Proctor under the directions of the Executive Committee as a future place of interment for the family.

The Board then adjourned sine die.
