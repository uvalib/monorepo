The following resolution was adopted.

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the Hospital Accounts Committee be and it is hereby authorized to charge off as uncollectible accounts schedules 200, 201, 202 and 203, aggregating $9,491.00, recommended by them for cancellation.

President Darden read to the Board a letter which he had recently sent the Governor about the policy of charging off uncollectible accounts at the Hospital. This letter and the Governor's reply are set forth below.

This will confirm the information given you in reference to the Hospital during our conversation several days ago.

The Board of Visitors has been disturbed by the large charge-offs on account of bad debts and wishes you to understand that these arise not as a result of credit improvidently extended but from the treatment of the large number of indigents whose inability to pay is known at the time they enter the Hospital.

The auditor of Public Accounts has advised us that it is preferable to set up charges involving each individual who is accepted for treatment and later make the charge-offs required. We are exerting every effort to collect charges made for hospital service. If indigents were admitted as such at the outset, the sums charged off would be substantially less since they would represent only bad debts.

I believe the practice recommended by the Auditor of Public Accounts is sound, and that adherence to the present system of accounting is wise.

I have your favor of March fourth explaining the policy which has been adopted by the Board of Visitors relative to charge offs in the Hospital.

I agree with you that this system is entirely proper, and I understand the reason for the large number of charge offs on this account.

Thanking you for writing me and with my personal regards, I am.

The President presented to the Board a form of trust agreement which had been prepared for the establishment of the "Peters Rushton Seminars Fund." The agreement was approved by the Board in the form presented and the President was authorized to sign it in the name of the University. The following resolution was adopted in acceptance of the funds which have been contributed thus far to the Rushton Seminars Fund.

In consideration of the fact that there has been or is about to be deposited in the Consolidated Endowment Funds of the University of Virginia the sum of $7,188.77, which represents the contributions made during the past year by students, faculty members, alumni, members of the Rushton family, and others to the Peters Rushton Fund, whose eventual purpose is to provide an annual income sufficient to maintain the Peters Rushton Seminars in Contemporary Prose and Poetry.

BE IT RESOLVED that these gifts toward the establishment of this foundation and the provisions agreed upon for their use be accepted, and that the President be authorized to sign the agreement containing these provisions in the name of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia.

AND BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Secretary be requested to express to the representatives of the contributors the pleasure of the President, the Rector, and the Visitors in accepting these gifts, both because they will help to make possible the continuance of the seminars in contemporary prose and poetry, which are a valuable part of the cultural life of the University; and because the change of name from McGregor Room Seminars to Peters Rushton Seminars and the partial endowment of this lecture series do honor to Peters Rushton, a young teacher and administrator whose untimely death was and continues to be mourned by this academic community.

President Darden read a resolution adopted by the City Council on April 2, 1951, as follows:

BE IT RESOLVED by the Council of the City of Charlottesville that the attention of the University of Virginia be directed to the need of a sidewalk along its property on the east side of Route #29, north, and they be requested to join with the City in bearing one-half the cost of this project.

No resolution was adopted by the Board of Visitors, but it was the sense of the Board that the University should not contribute to a sidewalk on the east side of Route #29 as proposed. The President was directed to explore with the City the possibility of the University's joining in the construction of a sidewalk on the west side of Route #29, which would serve the residents of Copeley Hill.

The Rector reported that Mr. Perkins, Attorney for the University, had investigated the possible sale of this property as directed by the Board. He received a private bid for the property of $40,000, which he considered too low. His recommendation was that the property be sold by public auction as soon as possible, as this is the season when farm land in that area of the State customarily brings the highest price. Before an auction could take place a survey of the property was necessary, which Mr. Black authorized. Whereupon the following resolution was adopted.

BE IT RESOLVED that the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia hereby approves and endorses the action of the Rector, Barron F. Black, in authorizing a survey of the Lizzie B. Miller property, and the action of the Executive Committee in authorizing the sale of this property at public auction, at a starting figure of $40,000.

Mr. Black reported that President Combs of Mary Washington College had telephoned him stating that he had an opportunity to travel to Europe and Africa and requesting leave of absence for this purpose. Mr. Black in turn telephoned the members of the Executive Committee, who approved President Combs' trip.

The Board of Visitors approved the action taken by the Executive Committee.

Mrs. Wailes, speaking for the Mary Washington Committee, made the following report.

At its last meeting the Board referred to the Mary Washington Committee the question of granting credit at Mary Washington College for a summer Classical Backgrounds Tour. The committee members present met with President Darden immediately after the Board adjourned on March 9, 1951.

While we very much liked the proposed plan and think that the experience of such a study tour will be most profitable to the participating students, the committee feels that the granting of academic credit for it would not be to the best interests of Mary Washington College, and recommends that no such credit be given.

At its February meeting the Board referred to the Mary Washington Committee the question of deciding the order of priority in which buildings should be constructed at Mary Washington since the bid on the Student Activities Building was rejected on February 9th. However, it is not likely that conditional funds appropriated for a Science Building will be released in the near future, and since the situation and needs may change, the committee is not at this time making any recommendation concerning priority construction.

The recommendations of the Committee were approved in both matters.

A report on the distribution of academic grades for the first semester of 1950-51 was received and filed with the Secretary.

On motion the meeting was then adjourned.
