**Board of Visitors' minutes, Accession # RG-1/1/, Special Collections Dept., University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Va.**

Minutes of meetings of the university's governing body which is the legal owner and operator of the institution. Recorded in the minutes are appointments and other personnel decisions concerning faculty, decisions about construction of facilities, gifts to the university, and all other board actions, decisions and resolutions.

At a called meeting of the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia held at the University, Monday the 14th September 1840: Present Chapman Johnson, Rector, Joseph C. Cabell, John H. Cocke, Thomas J. Randolph and Samuel Taylor.

1. Resolved, that the Board will proceed this Evening at 4 O. Clock to the consideration of the conduct of Professor Blaettermann, in relation to the violence said to have been recently and publicly inflicted by him on the person of Mrs. Blaettermann:- And that a copy of this resolution be forthwith delivered to Dr. Blaettermann by the Secretary.

The Board having proceeded to the consideration of the subject of the preceeding resolution, testimony having been examined, and Doct: Blaettermann having been heard in his defence;-

2. Resolved, unanimously that he be henceforth removed from his office of professor of modern languages, in the University of Virginia, and that a copy of this resolution be communicated to him by the Secretary.

Professor Davis, the Chairman of the Faculty, having informed the Board that serious doubts have been suggested whether he was in the line of his duty, in communicating to the Rector the alledged misconduct of Professor Blaetterman, and having asked the opinion of the Board on this question-

3. Resolved, as the opinion of the Board, that while the enactments prescribing the duties of the Chairman do not enjoin upon him the duty of reporting either to the Rector or to the Board any alledged misconduct in the professors, yet it is the privilege and the duty of every professor, and other officer of the Institution, and especially of the Chairman, to communicate to the Rector or other Visitor in the recess of the Board, any occurrence which may have come to his knowledge, and which, in his opinion so seriously affects the interests of the Institution as to require the convocation of the Visitors; and that on the present occasion, professor Davis was in the meritorious performance of his duty.

4. Resolved, that the application of professor Howard, be referred to the Executive Committee to be acted upon as they may deem expedient.

5. Resolved that the applications of Mr. Powers & others, former Students of the University for the use of the books of the Library be rejected the Board deeming such use of the books as not within the purposes for which the Library was established.

6. Resolved that the Faculty be authorised to employ a tutor or tutors for the remainder of the session in the school of Modern Languages, allowing them such fees & salary as they may deem proper, provided that such fees do not exceed those heretofore allowed the professor of Modern Languages and that the whole amount of Salary to be paid to each tutor or tutors shall not exceed the rate of one thousand dollars per annum.

7. Resolved that the vacancy in the office of professor of Modern Languages be duly advertised under the direction of the chairman to the end that it may be filled at the next session of the Board.

The Board then adjourned sine die.
