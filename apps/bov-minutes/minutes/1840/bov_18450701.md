University of Virginia, Board of Visitors  

July 1, 1845  

On this the day, appointed by the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia for their stated annual meeting, Thomas J. Randolph and Andrew Stevenson only appeared; and the Board was not organized till Wednesday July 2d, when John H. Cocke, James M. Mason, Wm. C. Rives, & R. M. T. Hunter who was appointed to supply the vacancy in the Visitation occasioned by the resignation of Chapman Johnson, by the appointment of John H. Cocke to the vacant Rectorship, who, having declined the appointment, was made rector, pro temp:, and Joseph C. Cabell was elected Rector in his place.

The following Committees were appointed.

On the Departments of Natural Philosophy & Chemistry: Messrs. Mason, Randolph & Cocke.

On the Library:]Messrs. Stevenson & Hunter.

Of Inspection: Messrs. Cocke & Randolph.

Of Finance: Messrs. Mason & Hunter.

The Committee on the department of Natural Philosophy & Chemistry made their reports.

The Board adjourned till tomorrow.

Thursday July 3d 1845: The Board met. Present as on yesterday with the addition of Joseph C. Cobell, who appeared at the Board and took his seat as Rector-

The following proceedings were had.

1\. Resolved, that the application of Mr. Charles Morris, a Student of the University made to the Faculty under date of July 3d 1845, asking to be permitted to take the Degree of Master of Arts, which application has been referred to the Board of Visitors, is deemed reasonable, and that the Faculty be authorised to confer the said Degree on Mr. Morris, he having complied with all the requirements of the Enactments, but having unfortunately lost the thesis which he had prepared in obedience to those enactments.

2\. A letter from the Chairman of the Faculty containing a statement of Facts in relation to the application of Mr. Matthew Harrison for the Degree of Master of Arts of the University, was laid before the Board by the Rector.

It appears that Mr. Harrison had obtained Diplomas on Antient Languages, Mathematics, Chemistry, Natural Philosophy, Moral Philosophy, French Law & Political Economy, but fail'd in obtaining a degree in Modern Languages. After a full examination of the circumstances connected with Mr. Harrison's case, the Board came to the opinion that the omission to graduate in the school of Modern Languages, ought not to be a bar in this case to his receiving the degree of M.A. but that under the peculiar circumstances of his case the application of Mr. Harrison be deemed reasonable, & that the Faculty be advised of it.

3\. Resolved that the Executive Committee be substituted in lieu of that appointed by the resolution of the 5th July 1843 to confer with Mrs. Madison upon the subject of the Books devised by her husband to the University & that the said committee have power to adopt suitable measures to carry into effect the wishes of the illustrious individual towards the Institution as expressed in his last will & testament.
