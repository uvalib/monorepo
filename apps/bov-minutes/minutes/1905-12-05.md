At a called meeting of the Board of Visitors, held at the University on above date,

Present: The Rector, and Visitors Buchanan, Moore, Wallace, Hunton, and Harmon,

The Board was called to order by the Rector at 3:00 P.M., and the following resolutions were adopted:

Resolved: That Dr. William Mann Randolph be chosen Adjunct Professor of Operative Surgery for the period between January 1st, and June 14th, 1906, at a salary of Eight Hundred dollars, ($800.00).

Upon recommendation of the Medical Faculty and General Faculty, the following was adopted,-

Resolved: That on and after September, 1907, there shall be required for admission to the Department of Medicine, in addition to the General Entrance Requirements of the University, the College Courses in Physics, General Chemistry, and Biology of this University, or equivalent courses from other Collegiate institutions which are accepted by the Professors in charge of these courses, in accordance with the requirements for advanced standing now existing in the College.

Resolved: That the Faculty of the University be empowered to shorten the final exercises of the University by one day, if in their wisdom it would seem wise for the best interests of the University.

Resolved: That the Bursar be empowered to pay $50.00 on the salary of Mr. Paul Micou, instructor in Economics.

Resolved: The the Secretary be instructed to ascertain from the University of North Carolina, on what conditions that institution has permitted Professors to lease and build residences on lands belonging to the University; and report same to next meeting of the Board.

A statement of the Virginia Trust Company, giving a full account of the matter of the sale of the Virginia Century bonds sold for the payment of the "Old Mortgage Debt" was this day laid before the Board, from which said statement it appears that after applying the proceeds of said Century bonds to the payment of the old mortgage debt, there will still be due on account of said debt, a portion of the bonds due to the Library (Gordon fund) the sum of $2074.38 which bears six per cent interest, and a balance of $100.00 on the Brown Scholarship bondâ€” whereupon it is ordered that said statement be entered of record.

It is also entered of record that all of the bonds evidencing the old debt have been duly cancelled by the Finance Committee, except to the extent of the balances above specified, and a bond for $2,500.00 owned by D. W. Owen, Denniston P. O., Virginia, who, although specially notified to present the same for payment, and that interest would stop after Oct. 15, 1905, has failed to present the same for payment.

When the bonds secured by the said deed of trust shall have been paid in full, the Finance Committee is directed to have prepared and recorded a proper release deed.

Statement of the Virginia Trust Company follows:-

\[See the following two pages for this statement.\]

It is ordered that the Finance Committee do sell before May the first 1906, the three per cent bonds of the State of Virginia, deposited by the Bursar with the Virginia Trust Co.

\[Statement referred to on Page 116.\]

To redemption of Bonds, due Oct. 15, 1905, as follows:-

of Richmond, held as a sinking fund for the new debt of the University of Virginia, of Two Hundred Thousand Dollars, which said debt was created pursuant to an act of the General Assembly approved on the 23 day of January 1896; and with the proceeds of said sinking fund bonds pay off, to the extent of said proceeds, the five per cent bonds issued under said Act of the General Assembly; selecting the bonds to be so paid by lot, and giving notice of such payment as required in the body of said bonds, by advertisement for four successive weeks in one of the newspapers printed in the City of Charlottesville, and for thirty days a newspaper printed in the City of Richmond.

And it is further ordered that the Finance Committee be authorized to consider and formulate a definite scheme, if practicable, to issue a sufficient amount of four per cent bonds; the proceeds of which shall be devoted to the payment of the remaining four per cent bonds issued pursuant to said Act of Assembly approved in the 23rd day of January 1896; and to obtain the necessary legislation therefor.

On motion, the Board adjourned, subject to the call of the Rector.
