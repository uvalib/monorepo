Mr. Perkins presented the following matter to the Board, the resolution being adopted:

Mr. Perkins stated to the Board that in view of the provisions of Paragraphs 2, 6, and 7 of Chapter 197 of the Acts of Assembly of 1946, approved March 23, 1946, as amended by Acts of Extra Session of 1947, page 72, relating to the hospitalization, care, and treatment of indigent persons and the use and allocation of funds provided for such purpose, it is probably necessary for the existing contract between the University of Virginia Hospital and the City of Charlottesville and County of Albemarle, which is dated July 1, 1940, be materially amended or possibly be terminated in accordance with the provisions contained therein that said contract may be terminated by any one of the contracting parties giving the other two parties notice of such termination in writing ninety days prior to the first day of July of any year.

The whole question of the University's responsibility under this contract and of the advantages that may accrue to it by termination thereof and substitution therefor of a uniform contract in the form promulgated by the State Health Board is one which requires careful and expert study and consideration. It is therefore suggested that this Board appoint a Committee composed of Dr. H. E. Jordan, Dean of the Medical School, Dr. C. S. Lentz, Superintendent of University Hospital, and W. Allan Perkins, Attorney for the University, to make such study and if necessary to confer with similar committees from the Board of Supervisors of Albemarle County and Council of the City of Charlottesville and report back to this Board, making such recommendations as this Committee may deem wise.

It was, thereupon,

RESOLVED that a Committee composed of Dr. H. E. Jordan, Dr. C. S. Lentz, and W. Allan Perkins be and is hereby appointed for the purposes set out in the preamble to this resolution.

Mr. E. I. Carruthers, Secretary and Bursar, presented his resignation effective July 15, 1947 and the Rector designated Christopher B. Garnett to prepare an appropriate resolution for the purpose. In response thereto, Mr. Garnett prepared the following resolution which was adopted:

RESOLVED, that the resignation of E. I. Carruthers as Bursar and Secretary is hereby accepted with regret and it is thought proper to make, as a part of the record, a reference to the services rendered by Mr. Carruthers, as well as to incorporate a short history of his career.

Elmer Irving Carruthers was born April 22, 1874, the son of Joel and Sarah Frances (Thomas) Carruthers. He early began his business career, first at Haymarket, Virginia, and then with Charles King & Son, wholesale grocers, Charlottesville, Virginia, where he remained for ten years until in 1906 he accepted a position as Teller of the Bank of Albemarle. October 1, 1912 he resigned this position to accept the position of Bursar of the University of Virginia, and Secretary of the Board of Visitors of that institution. In these two capacities he served the University faithfully and well, and devoted all of his mind and body to the service of that institution. As a member of the Vestry of the Episcopal Church in Charlottesville, and Superintendent of its Sunday School, he devoted himself to the religious life of Charlottesville and became the leader of the Men's Bible Club.

From 1918 to 1924 he was instructor in Accounting at the University. He was a charter member of the Kiwanis Club of Charlottesville and was the third president of that Club.

He was one of the founders of St. Anne's School for Girls and served continuously on its Board of Directors.

He married Ellie Raphael Jordan of Haymarket, Virginia, and three sons were born to that union.

He leaves this position with the best wishes of the Board of Visitors of the University.

Upon the presentation and adoption of the foregoing resignation and resolution with respect to E. I. Carruthers, Secretary of the Board of Visitors and Bursar of the University of Virginia, the name of Mr. Vincent Shea was suggested by President Darden to fill these positions. A Committee, consisting of the Rector, Mr. Black and Mr. Gay, was thereupon appointed. The Committee retired and interviewed Mr. Shea at some length, and returned to the meeting with the suggestion that President Darden's recommendation be approved and that Mr. Shea be elected to serve as Secretary of the Board of Visitors and Bursar of the University.

Upon nomination by Mr. Black, which was seconded by Mr. Gay, the following resolution was adopted:

RESOLVED, that Vincent Shea be and he hereby is elected Bursar of the University of Virginia and Secretary of the Board of Visitors, effective July 16, 1947.

Mr. Thomas B. Gay, Chairman of a Special Committee, presented a tentative draft of a manual defining the powers and duties of the Board of Visitors, of the President, of the Executive Committee, and of certain standing and special committees. This manual was ordered received and distributed to members of the Board for consideration and action at a future meeting.

A resolution was adopted authorizing the establishment of a House Maintenance Fund for the President's House of $5,000 per year to be paid out of the unrestricted endowment income of the University, provided that upon investigation of the Finance Committee it was found legally permissible for such a fund to be established from the unrestricted endowment income of the University.

President Darden presented the Hermitage Foundation matter, which was discussed at some length and the following committee appointed to meet with Mrs. Sloan in the matter: Messrs. Black and Gay and Mrs. Calcott.

President Darden discussed at some length with the Board the question of a one-year limitation in connection with fraternities. After some discussion, the Board expressed its desire to reaffirm its prior action in the matter, which was in agreement with that outlined by President Darden.

President Darden discussed with the Board at some length the matter of the division of the College of Arts and Sciences into classes by years, and his suggestion met with the approval of the Board.

Dr. Trout, Chairman of the Committee on the Medical Department, discussed the medical situation and filed a report with President Darden.

The rule for the admission of women students to the University of Virginia which had been in operation during the war years was continued for one year.

The usual August meeting of the Board of Visitors was, on motion, omitted.

### The following scholarships, recommended by Dr. Ivey F. Lewis, Chairman of the Scholarship Committee, were approved:

Dr. M. L. Combs of Mary Washington College presented the following recommendations, which were adopted:

* Dr. Zoe Wells Carroll Black as Assistant Professor of Biology at a salary of $3,344 for the session of nine months, tenure one year, incumbency to begin September 15, 1947. This appointment is to fill the vacancy created by the resignation of Dr. Grady Britt.
* Dr. Harry Clark as Professor of Physics at a salary of $4,100 for the session of nine months, tenure one year, incumbency to begin September 15, 1947.
* Dr. H. Logan Cobb as Assistant Professor of Spanish at a salary of $3,450 for the session of nine months, tenure one year, incumbency to begin September 15, 1947.
* Dr. James Henry Croushore as Associate Professor of English, at a salary of $3,600 for the session of nine months, tenure one year, incumbency to begin September 15, 1947.
* Walter Butler Kelly as Assistant Professor of English at a salary of $3,400 for the session of nine months, tenure one year, incumbency to begin September 15, 1947.
* Mary Annette Klinesmith as Instructor in Psychology at a salary of $2,300 for the session of nine months, incumbency to begin September 15, 1947.

Dr. Combs reported with regret the death of Dr. Charlotte Klein, Instructor in Organ, who died on July 3. She was a loyal, devoted, and effective teacher, and the college has sustained in her death an irreparable loss.

Dr. Combs reported that Dr. A. Stephen Stephan, recently elected Associate Professor of Sociology and who had accepted the position effective September 15, 1947, has declined the appointment because of unsatisfactory living conditions in Fredericksburg and the offer of a larger salary.

Dr. Combs presented a contract with the Federal Government for the training of certain G.I. students during the forthcoming session, which was approved.

Dr. Combs was requested to present to the Board of Visitors an annual budget for Mary Washington College and a financial report for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1947.

There being no further business to come before the Board, the meeting was adjourned.
