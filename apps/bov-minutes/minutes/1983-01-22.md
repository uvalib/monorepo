C. To the extent that such person has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to above, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith. Furthermore, such expenses may be advanced by the University upon:

D. The University may make to any such person any other or further indemnity that may be authorized by law, or by any provision of the Manual of the Board of Visitors adopted before or after the event. The right of indemnification granted herein shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which any such person may be entitled by law or agreement.
