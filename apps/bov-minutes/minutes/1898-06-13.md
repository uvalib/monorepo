At a regular annual meeting of the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia held at the University on the 13th of June 1898.

Present, Charles P. Jones, Rector and Visitors Harmon, Bryan, Miles, Glass, Irvine, and Downing.

The Chairman of the Faculty submitted the following annual reports:

The Faculty's report, Proctor's report, Commr of Account's report, Librarian's report and the several school reports.

The Rector made the following appointments of Standing Committees:

Finance:

Messrs Harmon, Downing and Glass.

Library & Apparatus:

Messrs Bryan, McIlwaine & Miles.

Conduct of Schools and examination students:

Messrs Miles, Irvine & Chandler.

Buildings & Grounds:

Messrs Glass, Bryan & Downing.

Health, Infirmary, Sewerage & Drainage:

Messrs Irvine, McIlwaine & Chandler.

Miller Board:

Messrs McIlwaine, Harman & Glass.

The following was enacted:

The Executive Committee having reported that Ross F. Tucker, Esq. Contractor has failed to lay before them any evidence on which they could act on the three items of his account referred to them, and the Board having maturely considered said items; and the representation of Mr Tucker, he having stated that the settlement proposed at the last meeting of the Board is declined by him, on motion

Resolved: That the three items aforesaid, to wit, $745.- 45 claimed for concrete steps, $125.34 claimed for work on Physical Building and $34.67 claimed for work on the Mechanical Building, be rejected.

Resolved: That the appropriation for Mechanical Appara- tus be increased by the sum of $350.00

Resolved: That Mr Joseph Bryan of the Board, be appointed a Committee to investigate the condition of the investments made by the trustees under the will of Arthur W. Austin of Milton, Mass. decd, and report to the Board the character of said investments, their value, solvency etc. Said Bryan is authorized, if he shall deem it necessary to do so, to employ Counsel to assist him in such investigation and to draw on the Proctor for such expenses as he incurs in the premises.

The death of Mr R. G. H. Kean, a former member of the Board of Visitors and for a time Rector, having been suggested, On motion, Mr Glass was requested to prepare memorial resolutions of Mr Kean for the action of the Board in regard thereto.

Resolved, that the Rector be authorized to execute the authority to sell the tract of land of the Austin estate referred to in the letter of Mr Bentley W. Warren to the Proctor, which letter is in the following words and figures, to wit:

You may recall that last summer a part of the piece of real estate owned by the trustees under Mr Austin's will was taken by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for park purposes. This left a small piece of the estate, containing about 5000 square feet, with restrictions against building on a part of it, thus rendering the lot really unavailable. We have now received an offer of $800.00 for this piece of land, which we consider it would be advantageous for the estate to accept. We have therefore prepared a petition to the probate court for leave to sell the remainder of the estate. If this meets with your approval will you kindly sign the assent to the enclosed petition, and as the purchaser is in something of a hurry, I would ask you to return the petition at your earliest convenience.

On motion the Board adjourned to meet at 9 1/2 A. M. tomorrow.

I enclose to you herewith cheque for $20,000.00 being a gift from the J. W. and Belinda Randall Charities Corporation, which was voted to you by the trustees on June 10th, 1898. With this gift goes a copy of the vote under which you must receive this gift or return it to me as trea- surer.

The Trustees are very glad to be able to send you this sum of money from this old lady (Miss Randall) both as a proof of their high appreciation of the University of Virginia and also as a mark of sentiment towards your great institution of learning.

On June 10th, 1898 it was

Voted that the sum of twenty thousand dollars be given to the University of Virginia, on condition that it shall either be used for the erection of a building to be known as the "John W. and Belinda Randall Building", or be invested by the said University and held as a permanent fund, to be known as the "John W. and Belinda Randall Fund", the income only to be used either for Randall scholarships or for other needs of said University.

On June 10th, 1898 it was voted further that the gifts to the Massachusetts General Hospital, the Massachusetts Charitable Eye and Ear Infirmary, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology shall be subject to the further conditions that in case of assistance being called for by the Executors or Administrators of said Belinda Randall for any of the five contingent beneficiaries named in the second codicil to her will, the same, but not to exceed in any one year the income of the fund received (or in case of the investment of the fund as permitted by the conditions of the gift in building or the like, what would be the income of such fund if invested at four per cent per annum) shall be furnished by said institutions proportionately to the capital sum received by them respectively, provided, however, that any further amounts heretofore given from the Randall Fund to the same or other institutions upon similar conditions shall bear their like share. But in the event of the inability of any of these donees to respond, the others shall, subject to the limitations aforesaid, furnish the whole of such assistance.

Which being read and considered, the following resolutions were unanimously adopted

Resolved, That the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia acknowledge the receipt of $20,000. from Henry L. Higginson, Treasurer of J. W. and Belinda Randall Charities Corporation subject to the stipulations and conditions contained in the accompanying resolutions passed by the Trustees of said Corporation the 10th day of June 1898 which are hereby accepted by the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia.

2d Resolved further: That the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia in acknowledging this benefaction desire to express to the Trustees of the J. W. and Belinda Randall Charities Corporation not only their gratitude for this important contribution to the resources of the University which is just rising from the ashes of a great disaster but their cordial appreciation of the sentiments of good will and encouragement with which the gift was conveyed. From no source would such evidences of fraternal interest be more acceptable to the University of Virginia than from the people of a sister Commonwealth which was so conspicuously associated with Virginia in establishing the Republic, and which has done so much for the cause of education.

Resolved: That the Faculty be requested to report to the next meeting of this Board to be held about Oct. 1st what disposition they would recommend of the Randall donation.

Resolved: That the salary of Profr Echols be fixed at $3000., and that Profr Page be elected an associate professor in the School of Mathematics at a salary of $1600.

K. Moran, be allowed to occupy said building for the ensuing year free of rent.

The Board having declined to renew the appropriation of $500. for the expense of publishing the Annals of Mathematics, Prof. Echols appeared before the Board and stated that if the Board would permit the continuance of the publication for another year it should be done without cost to the University provided the Board would resume the cost of publication not to exceed $500. next year, if the funds of the University would, in the judgment of the Board permit the appropriation, whereup it was

Resolved: that the Board accepts the proposition of Prof. Echols and will renew the appropriation of $500. next year - 1898-99 for the Annals of Mathematics provided the funds of the University will permit the appropriation.

"Mr Bryan submitted the following paper to the Board and moved the adoption of the resolution: Mr Bryan stated that at the request of Mr Samuel B. Woods he desired to call the attention of the Board to the letter which was addressed to the late Board by Profr James H. Gilmore to which Profr Gilmore thinks he should have received a reply. Mr Woods also requested the Board to examine sundry letters now in the possession of Mr Miles which Prof. Gilmore received from a number of his students testifying to his merit as a teacher. This examination to be made with a view to some communication from the Board to Profr Gilmore relieving him of the current imputation that his instruction was inefficient."

"Mr Bryan moved that Profr Gilmore's letter and the other letters be referred to a Committee composed of the Rector and Messrs Chandler and Downing with the request that they examine the subject and make report to a subsequent meeting of this Board what action if any the Board should take in the premises."

Upon considering which the following resolution was adopted:

Resolved: That the communication of Mr Bryan with reference to Mr James H. Gilmore be spread upon the records of the Board, but this Board, as now constituted, does not deem it desirable or proper to re-open the matter referred to or to attempt to review the action of the Board as formerly constituted, and in taking this action the Board does not think it amiss to repeat to Mr Woods in behalf of Mr Gilmore the expression of the greatest respect for Mr Gilmore personally and for his attainments as a lawyer contained in the resolution of the Board adopted June 17th 1896.

Resolved further, that the Secretary of the Board communicate a copy of this action to Mr Woods for Mr Gilmore.

The Finance Committee submitted its report which is in the following words and figures, to wit:-

The following being an estimate of the income for the year 1898-99:

The following appropriations are recommended for the year 1898-99:

You may recall that last summer a part of the piece of real estate owned by the trustees under Mr Austin's will was taken by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for park purposes. This left a small piece of the estate, containing about 5000 square feet, with restrictions against building on a part of it, thus rendering the lot really unavailable. We have now received an offer of $800.00 for this piece of land, which we consider it would be advantageous for the estate to accept. We have therefore prepared a petition to the probate court for leave to sell the remainder of the estate. If this meets with your approval will you kindly sign the assent to the enclosed petition, and as the purchaser is in something of a hurry, I would ask you to return the petition at your earliest convenience.
