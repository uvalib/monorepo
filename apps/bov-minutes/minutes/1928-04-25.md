The request of Mr. Robert C. Taylor, donor of the Timing System now being installed in the University buildings, that said system be named the "Francis H. Smith Timing System," after the "Grand Old Man of the University," was unanimously approved.

The President submitted a report on the request of the faculty for change in payment of salaries. The same was read, and the following resolutions relating thereto were adopted:

For a number of years it has been the policy of the University to pay the salaries of its administrative officers and members of the teaching staff, above the grade of instructor, on a yearly basis in monthly installments on the first of each month. This practice arose from the payment of salaries to its professors in large part from the fees from their respective students, being made in quarterly payments. Later this was changed to five payments per session and, finally, to monthly payments in advance when students' fees were no longer allocated to professors' stipends. This policy of payments in advance was also justified by reason of the fact that the State's appropriation to the University was received in monthly allotments on the first of each month for the current month.

When the Reorganization Act became effective on March 1, 1928, the State authorities declined to continue the practice of payments of personal service in advance, basing their course on the law which prohibits the State Treasurer from making payments to persons for services rendered until the services have been actually rendered.

Upon learning of this ruling, the General Faculty, feeling that they would be seriously inconvenienced by the change in policy, met and discussed the situation, and passed a resolution requesting the President of the University to change the plan of salary payments to nine for the session instead of twelve for the fiscal year, basing their request on the grounds that they were employed for a session of nine months and that they were entitled to their pay in nine installments.

This plan was presented to the Governor and his administrative heads and was agreed to for the future. As to the remainder of the present session, an agreement was reached whereby the State Treasurer would pay four-ninths of their salaries; one-ninth on the first of March, April, May and June, respectively. And, beginning with the session of 1928-29, to pay the salaries in nine installments beginning with October 15th and continuing to June 15, 1928. The State Treasurer stated that he was prohibited from making salary payments in advance; but, that for the present session, in view of the fact that the faculty had covered, to March 1, 5-1/2 ninths of the session's work but had received only 5-1/2 twelfths of their pay, it would be agreeable to pay from the State Treasury four- ninths of said pay.

To accomplish this change in policy and, at the same time, not to exceed the State's appropriation for salaries for the fiscal year beginning March 1, 1928, the University will be required to pay from its funds to its teaching staff, for the two and one-half months from July 1, to September 15, the remainder due them for the session of 1927-28. The amount due each member of the faculty, above the grade of instructor, is 7/72nds of his salary for the session, amounting to the sum of $27,000.

As the University has no surplus funds out of which to meet this emergency expenditure, the amount will have to be carried as an addition to the existing deficit until such time as the State can be induced to make an appropriation to clear it from our books, or until it can be cared for by some other means.

I beg to submit the accompanying resolutions to dispose of the several matters referred to.
