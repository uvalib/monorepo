The following resolutions were unanimously adopted:

* RESOLVED, by the Board of Visitors of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that J. L. Newcomb, President, be and he is hereby authorized and directed to sign the contract on behalf of this Board between the United States of America acting through the War Department, Ord. Dept., and the University of Virginia, for the construction of a machine determining the principal axis of inertia of small arms bullets, in the sum of $5,000.00 provided by the United States of America; and

* RESOLVED, FURTHER, that E. I. Carruthers, Secretary, be and he is hereby authorized and directed to attest the signature, affix the seal, and certify that this Resolution was passed within the scope of its corporate powers.

* RESOLVED, by the Board of Visitors of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that J. L. Newcomb, President, be and he is hereby authorized and directed to sign for this Board a contract between the United States of America, represented by the Executive Secretary, Office of Scientific Research and Development in the Office for Emergency Management, Executive Office of the President, and the University of Virginia, in an amount not to exceed $8,650 provided by the United States of America, for the detection of carbon monoxide when present in extremely low concentrations, under the direction of Dr. J. H. Yoe, of the Department of Chemistry in the University of Virginia.

* RESOLVED, FURTHER, that E. I. Carruthers, Secretary of this Board, be and he is hereby authorized and directed to attest the signature, affix the seal, and certify that this Resolution was passed by authority of the Governing Body of the University and is within the scope of its corporate powers.

* RESOLVED, by the Board of Visitors of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, that J. L. Newcomb, President, be and he is hereby authorized and directed to sign, and the Secretary to affix the Seal of the University, to the Receipt for Law Books bequeathed to the University of Virginia by the Last Will and Testament of Charles B. Samuels.

* RESOLVED, by the Board of Visitors of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, that J. L. Newcomb, President, be and he is hereby authorized and directed to execute a lease on the room in the Corner Building occupied by the University Branch of the Peoples National Bank of Charlottesville, for a period of five years beginning September 1, 1941, at a rental of $1200 per year, payable monthly.

* RESOLVED, by the Board of Visitors of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, that J. L. Newcomb, President, be and he is hereby authorized and directed to sign a release to the State Highway Department, acknowledging that the Department of Highways has satisfactorily completed the work in connection with widening the Right-of-Way along the property of the Blandy Experimental Farm, with the distinct reservation that if at any time in the future the Highway Department shall deem it wise to remove, change, or otherwise alter the existing stone fence along this Right-of-Way, that one of like material and character shall be constructed at the expense of the Highway Department on the land of the University of Virginia adjoining the Highway Right-of-Way.

The President reminded the Board that in the deed made by My Own Development Corporation conveying the property known as "West Cairns" to the University for use as a home for convalescent children, the University was given the right to one connection with the 3/4 inch water pipe through which this property has previously been served with water from the Charlottesville-Farmington water main. As said My Own Development Corporation has the right to serve four other properties through this same 3/4 inch pipe, it was apparent that this source of supply would be entirely inadequate for the purposes of the children's home. Arrangements have been made with the City of Charlottesville whereby a new 6-inch water main will be laid from the present city mains out to serve this property. When this main is laid an ample supply of city water will, of course, be available. Under the rules of the city, however, this line will not be the exclusive property of the University but the city will allow other water users to make connection therewith. My own Development Corporation owns other land which it is now selling and which will be benefitted by this new water line, and that Corporation has agreed to contribute $550.00 toward the cost of purchase and installation of this new 6-inch main. As part of the consideration for this contribution it is proposed that the University surrender to My Own Development Corporation its right to take water from the 3/4 inch pipe above referred to.

After a discussion of the situation, it was-

* RESOLVED, that the offer of said My Own Development Corporation to contribute $550.00 toward the cost of purchase and installation of said new 6-inch water main be and is hereby accepted. And the President is requested and hereby authorized to execute a deed by which the University's interest in said 3/4 inch water connection is transferred, set over and surrendered to My Own Development Corporation as a part of the consideration for said contribution of $550.00 by it.

* RESOLVED, by the Board of Visitors of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the following certificates of stock registered in the name of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, and deposited with the Peoples National Bank of Charlottesville, Va., a depository of the University of Virginia, be transferred to WABY AND COMPANY, the Nominee of said Bank; and that the President of the University be and he is hereby authorized to execute the certificates on behalf of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, for transfer:

  * 50 shares American Smelting & Refining. 7% Cum. Pfd. stock
  * 50 shares American Telephone & Telegraph, common stock
  * 200 shares Commonwealth Edison Co. Capital stock
  * 4 shares First National Bank of the City of New York Capital stock
  * 40 shares International Harvester Co. 7% Cum. Pfd. stock
  * 50 shares Liggett & Myers Tobacco Co. common "B" stock
  * 40 shares Montgomery Ward and Co. Inc. $7 Class "A" stock
  * 39 shares National Biscuit Co. 7% Cum. Pfd. stock

The President reported that an offer had been received from E. A. Sims of $250.00 cash for a small lot, located in Anniston, Ala., which came to the University in the bequest of Miss Mary Amelia Smith, of Warrenton, Va., in 1921, which offer had been accepted, and suggested the following resolution which was adopted:

* RESOLVED, by the Board of Visitors of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, that sale of lot 14, Block 134, in the City of Anniston, Alabama, to Z. A. Sims, for $250 cash, be and the same is hereby approved; and J. L. Newcomb, President, be and he is hereby authorized and directed to sign the deed conveying this lot to Z. A. Sims, and

* RESOLVED, FURTHER, that E. I. Carruthers, Secretary, be and he is hereby authorized and directed to attest the signature, affix the seal, and certify that this Resolution was passed by authority of the Governing Body of the University, and is within the scope of its corporate powers.

The President submitted to the meeting a form of agreement under date of September 2, 1941, between the University and E. H. Copenhaver, F. D. G. Ribble, and Lyttleton Waddell, Trustees for Zeta Chapter of Kappa Sigma Fraternity, in which recitals appear to the effect that in September, 1911, the University rented to Bologna Society of the University a lot described as Site C, on plat of Warren H. Manning, of the eastern slope of Carr's Hill, upon which lot the Fraternity had been erected, that the University had made said Bologna Society a loan of $10,000; that said Bologna Society went out of existence several years ago, forfeited its charter, and default has been made by it in the payment of installments due upon said loan, and that the balance of said loan is now $6,500.00, all principal; that an additional sum of $3,500.00 is now needed for improvements and repairs to said Fraternity House, and it is proposed that the University make a new loan for $10,000 to said Zeta Chapter of Kappa Sigma Fraternity, which amount shall bear interest at the rate of 5% per annum and be paid in installments of $88.00 beginning on the first day of October, 1941, such payments to continue thereafter on the first days of each month from October to June, inclusive of each year until the whole sum of $10,000, principal and interest, has been fully paid, said indebtedness to be evidenced by the bond of said Zeta Chapter of Kappa Sigma Fraternity executed on behalf of said Chapter by its Grand Master, without personal liability to him.

By said form of agreement the lot upon which said Chapter House is located is leased to said Fraternity for a term of ninety-nine years from the 2nd day of September, 1941, with privilege of renewal as therein set out, and the loan of $10,000 is made a charge against all the rights and interests of said Fraternity under said lease.

After a discussion of the situation, it was

* RESOLVED, that the loan of the additional sum of $3,500 to Zeta Chapter of Kappa Sigma Fraternity, upon the terms as set out in said proposed agreement, be and is hereby approved and ordered made, and said lease of Site C on Carr's Hill to said E. H. Copenhaver, F. D. G. Ribble, and Lyttleton Waddell, and their successors as Trustees for said Zeta Chapter of Kappa Sigma Fraternity is hereby approved, and the Rector is hereby requested to execute and deliver said lease in the form presented to this meeting, E. I. Carruthers, Secretary, being hereby authorized and directed to affix the corporate seal thereto and attest the same.

Furthermore, said E. I. Carruthers, Bursar of the University, shall accept the bond of said Zeta Chapter of Kappa Sigma Fraternity for $10,000.00 after the same has been properly executed on behalf of said Fraternity, and shall pay over the additional sum of $3,500.00 to said Trustees, E. H. Copenhaver, F. D. G. Ribble, and Lyttleton Waddell, to be used by them for improvements and repairs to said Fraternity House.

Said lease, when properly executed and acknowledged on behalf of the University and of said Zeta Chapter of Kappa Sigma Fraternity, shall be recorded in the Clerk's Office of the Circuit Court of Albemarle County, and the lease to Bologna Society hereinbefore referred to, if it has any free at the present time, is hereby cancelled.

Mr. Perkins presented to the Board the application of Mr. Seth Burnley, City Manager of the City of Charlottesville, for a loan of $6,000 to be evidenced by his bond bearing interest at 4½% payable 10 years after date, to be secured by deed of trust constituting a first lien on Mr. Burnley's residence located on Lots Nos. 11 and 12, Block 20, Preston Heights.

Appraisal of said property by George T. Starnes and R. H. Perry is attached to the application from which it appears that, in the opinion of these two gentlemen, the property has a fair market value of $12,000.

After due consideration the question of the advisability of this loan was referred to the Finance Committee with power to act, provided the interest rate shall not be less than 5%.

Mr. R. Gray Williams, Chairman of the Finance Committee, submitted, for information and recordation, report of the securities purchased for the Consolidated Endowment Funds during the past fiscal year, as follows:

The President presented to the Board a revised estimate of income from student fees and rents for the Session 1941-42. This estimate shows a decrease of $37,916.50 below the estimated receipts from these sources set up in the tentative Budget, approved by the Board in June, 1941.

The estimated decrease of $1,485 in the Student Health Service; $1,457.50 in Athletic Fees, and $198 in College Topics receipts, will be cared for by a corresponding reduction in expenditures under these three items, which total $3,140.50.

This leaves a net decrease to be cared for in the total sum of $34,776.

The President further explained that the substitutions for employees who have been granted leaves of absence for government service, or who have died since June, 1941, represented a decrease in our proposed expenditures of $26,000. This sum, together with the estimated surplus on the Budget adopted in June, leaves the Budget in a balanced condition. It was thereupon

* RESOLVED, by the Board of Visitors of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the tentative Budget approved in June be declared to be the Budget of the University for the Session 1941-42, after making the decreases in expenditures in the Student Health Service, Intercollegiate Athletics, and College Topics, referred to in the Preamble to this Resolution.

* RESOLVED, FURTHER, that the President be and he is authorized and directed to re-cast the fiscal situation of the University as of January 1, 1942, and if at that time he finds that the University will have a deficit in Operating Expenses for the current year, he is authorized and directed to request the Legislature of Virginia to make a deficit appropriation to cover this item.

The Board desires to record a statement on its minutes to the effect that in the employment of substitutes for employees who have left for government service, or who have died, there was no desire on its part to make these substitutions in order to save money. In every case the best available person was employed as a substitute, and every effort has been made to guarantee the standards of scholarship and teaching, unimpaired.

The Rector presented a letter he had received from the National Bank of Norfolk, Trustee under the will of Lomax Gwathmey, submitting a copy of an agreement entered into in 1928 between the said parties, in which the University of Virginia is the remainderman, and a copy of a supplemental agreement giving the Trustee the power to sell, convey, rent, lease, assign, transfer, or exchange any asset of the trust estate, real or personal, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, etc. The communication called attention to the absence in the original agreement of any authority to handle real estate and, that as several pieces have since been given the trustee, it should be amended to take care of the situation, and incidentally of some other difficulties. The amended agreement was referred to the attorney for the University for examination and, if approved by him, the President and Secretary were authorized to execute same on behalf of the University.

The President stated to the Board that an offer had been received through our attorney in Lawrenceville, Virginia, for the purchase of the property located there known as the Lawrenceville Furniture Company storeroom. Among the securities coming to the University under the will of Dr. Walter M. Seward was a bond of the said company secured by a mortgage on the property. The bond and interest being in default, the mortgage was foreclosed and the property bid in by the University. Mr. Corbitt, who, at the request of the President, had visited the property with a view of determining its sale value, reported that following his inspection of the property and inquiry as to the local realty market, he was of the opinion that it should bring not less than $6,500.00 net cash. The recommendation of Mr. Corbitt was agreed to, and the Secretary instructed to so advise our attorney in Lawrenceville. If sale be made, President and Secretary authorized to execute deed.

The President stated that of the members of the faculty on leave without salary for Federal services there were four for whom the University had been contributing a total of $835.00 per year, which was matched by them, toward the purchase of retirement annuity contracts, and suggested that the contributions by the University be continued, provided the respective members matched the payments. This was approved.

The meeting then adjourned.
