**NCAA Orientation**

Because Visitors are athletics boosters as defined by the NCAA, they receive an annual orientation session on the NCAA and ACC rules and regulations affecting them as members of the Board. Mr. Eric M. Baumgartner, Athletics Compliance Officer, provided the orientation.

**ACC Certification**

The ACC requires the Board chairs and presidents of member schools to certify that the Board has delegated authority to the President to operate the athletics program. Rector Clement read the certification and he and President Ryan signed it. A copy of the certification is attached to these Minutes – Attachment A.

\_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_

**Leadership Discussion**

President Ryan led the leadership session. He told the Board that instead of a “laundry list” of updates, he wanted to try something new by providing a piece of great news that they may not have heard, a challenge they are currently facing, and an idea about which he would like feedback.

The “great news” is that UVA recently opened a new Veterans Student Center in Newcomb Hall. He said this was a plan a long time in the making which helps fulfill a commitment to the U.S. Department of Education’s “8 Keys to Veterans’ Success”, a pledge signed by President Sullivan in 2014. It is made possible by a grant from the Jefferson Trust, an organization whose trustees are UVA alumni, parents, and friends that provides grants for innovative ideas across Grounds. This is the first ever veterans’ center at the University and a place to build community, host educational and social programming, both virtual and in-person. He expects it to be a place that feels like a home for some of the veteran students and can help them transition to civilian life as well as remind them that they belong at UVA and are part of what makes the University among the most vibrant university communities in the world.

The Center will serve both undergraduate and graduate active duty and veteran students, including 30 Posse Scholar veterans and more than 60 students who have declared veteran status. The Posse program is a nationwide program that identifies, trains, and supports students with outstanding leadership potential who might not otherwise be recognized by elite universities. The program places students at colleges and universities across the country in groups of 10 students, or ”posses.” They receive pre-matriculation training, mentoring while they are enrolled, and guaranteed full tuition scholarships. The program has been quite successful in helping students graduate at very high rates and in developing leadership talent. UVA accepted the first Veterans Posse in 2018, and UVA is the first college or university in the nation to accept both traditional Posses and Veterans Posses, and one of only three colleges and universities who currently accept Veterans Posses. UVA was ranked #9 this year by _U.S. News and World Report_ for Best Colleges for Veterans. Mr. Ryan said he was grateful to those from across the University who have worked long and hard to make this a reality including veteran and advocate Assistant Professor Jeff Lovelace of the McIntire School.

One challenge UVA is facing: safety off-Grounds. There is an uptick in community alerts and warnings about criminal activity. Since mid-August, there have been nine community alerts issued, six of which were related to shots fired. The alerts include an incident where a student was struck inadvertently at Boylan Heights. The student is recovering well and has returned to class, and an arrest was made in that case. Chief Longo and the police are committed to issuing community alerts about incidents close to where students live so they are informed and can make decisions accordingly, but the frequency and nature of the alerts has been disconcerting.

In early September, University police increased their patrols in the areas that are jointly patrolled by the University and the City and increased the number of ambassadors on and off Grounds. Ambassadors are not law enforcement officers; they augment police services by monitoring areas that require additional attention and communicating with police. They also provide the University with a detailed accounting of the observations made and actions taken during the course of their shift.

Safety services available to students include escorts after dark, Safe Ride, and the Charge-a-Ride service where the University will reimburse a taxi home, no questions asked. There is also an app. that students may download that enables them to invite friends on a "virtual walk" and set a timer for arrival, call 911, locate University safety resources, send a concern or tip to UVA police, and be connected by phone to resources like Safe Ride, Blue Ridge Poison Control, and the Dean-on-Call (through UPD).

Mr. Ryan asked for feedback on his priorities for the year and he showed two slides of his priorities. He said that while we haven’t quite reached the end of the pandemic, UVA has returned to much more normal operations in day-to-day life and so he is returning to focusing on making progress on the Strategic Plan, the Campaign, and re-connecting with the community.

Health and safety remain important, because ultimately they underpin all that UVA does, and are reflected in his priorities. The list also reflects his intention to rebuild relationships, open lines of communication, and connect with those who make the University special. Working collaboratively, transparently, and efficiently on shared goals can help to build community, trust, and energy. He said he uses the list as a way to focus his time and as a way to hold himself accountable. He will revisit the list with the Board to report progress at future meetings. The list of priorities can be found in these minutes as Attachment B.

**Remarks/Reports**

**Remarks by the Rector**

Rector Clement said Visitors were very excited to be back in person in the Rotunda. He said although there is still a way to go with COVID-19, the university has managed the public health crisis well. He thanked senior leaders and the advising medical professionals who have spent so much time working their way through all the issues. He also thanked the employees who have sacrificed time and energy, especially nurses and other health care professionals, to stay on top of the pandemic.

He spoke about a reception the Board held for Lawn residents in mid-September. His impression was that the students are happy to be back on Grounds and they appreciate having been selected to live on the Lawn.

Mr. Clement spoke about the Honor System. He said he understood that there would be a student referendum on some aspects of the Honor System this year. Mr. Clement and Mr. Ryan met with the chair of the Honor Committee, Andrew Chambers, in the spring and over the summer, along with others including Vice President for Student Affairs Robyn Hadley. He said they have no intention of trying to influence the outcome of a referendum, but the Board and president have a responsibility to make sure the process is effective. A healthy, robust discussion and debate among students and faculty are critical. The critical question is, what kind of community of trust do students want to have at UVA? He said it is important to find the balance of respecting student self-government and at the same time inculcating the values that produce student leaders.

Mr. Clement called on the student representative, Sarita Mehta, to give remarks.

**Remarks by the Student Representative**

Ms. Mehta offered thanks for the dedication and efforts of administrators, health care workers, faculty, and students to make possible the return to Grounds. There is a momentum among students where even the littlest things cause excitement. This appreciation for the University community is evident.

She spoke about the lessons her tennis coach has imparted that she thought were insightful. The first is that fundamentals should not be a choice, but a given. For UVA students, do we ensure fundamentals are a given, or are they left up to choice or variation? Fundamentals such as academic growth, community engagement, and social development, are often determined by and left up to decisions of student choice, and perhaps there is room to reconsider certain dimensions that are left to choice. She used as examples tutoring and career services. Students may seek them out, but maybe it would be better to bake them into the student experience. By realigning the services, relationships, and activities crucial to the student experience in a way that decreases the amount of time and proactivity – making them a default – the university can better serve more students, and also more efficiently utilize resources, allowing for more productive students and communities. In the wake of the pandemic, reconsidering the channels of academic support and mental health support to serve the most students are of great importance.

The second piece of advice from her tennis coach is that without your mental game,

you are already down a set. Therefore, mental health issues should be foremost, and she urged the Board to think about ways to increase the scaling of mental health resources and the effort required of students to get help. The past two years have pushed the mental health of many students to critical states.

Ms. Mehta also spoke about the importance of physical safety for students. The recent rise in crime and violence proximate to the University has created strong feelings of fear and danger among both undergraduate and graduate students, and this trend has roots in UVA’s broader relationship with the Charlottesville community.

The final piece of advice from the tennis coach is that with the right habits and practice you can play and win throughout your life. Students have enormous passion, diversity of interests, and incredible creativity on how to fix problems. Ultimately, students

graduate, and when they leave, the question is whether someone can pick up where they left off. Same with administrators and faculty. There has been a great deal of change at UVA in recent years, and the University must maintain consistent institutional knowledge and support across years. Student self-governance and institutional knowledge and support together are important for shaping students. Part of this is reflecting on where we are doing great; that is often lost. There is no upper constraint on the progress and potential of UVA.

**Remarks by the Faculty Senate Chair**

For the sake of the new Board members, Dr. Kirk spoke about the make-up of the faculty senate and its role in faculty governance at UVA, and Senate interface with the administration. She also listed the issues the faculty were concerned about last year, which were all centered around the coronavirus pandemic. She said the faculty have not been particularly concerned about free speech and free expression, which have consumed much alumni and administrative time and energy. Dr. Kirk served on the Committee on Free Speech and Free Expression with members on opposite ends of the ideologic spectrum who were able to collaborate to develop the final document. She said it was great to see people coming together to do the right thing.

Dr. Kirk said this year the faculty are concerned about how the University financial model is structured, which they feel has disadvantaged some faculty members. Also, the loss of faculty during the pandemic, especially women and faculty of color.
