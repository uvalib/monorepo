Board of Visitors' minutes, Accession # RG-1/1/, Special Collections Dept., University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Va.

Minutes of meetings of the university's governing body which is the legal owner and operator of the institution. Recorded in the minutes are appointments and other personnel decisions concerning faculty, decisions about construction of facilities, gifts to the university, and all other board actions, decisions, and resolutions.

A special meeting of the Board of Visitors was held on this date at 10 o'clock to consider the question of the inclusion of the University grounds in the corporate limits of the City of Charlottesville, and such other matters as may be presented.

There were present, the Rector, Fred. W. Scott, Visitors Corbitt, Garnett, Hall Lewis C. Williams and R. Gray Williams, and President Newcomb.

The President reported that he had signed contracts for construction of the Neuro-Psychiatric Addition to the Hospital, whereupon the following resolution was adopted:

**RESOLVED**, by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the signing of the contracts on behalf of this Board with John C. Senter, The Williams Company, and The Salem Foundry and Machinery Works, on PWA Project Va. 1101-F by J. L. Newcomb, President, be and the same is hereby ratified and confirmed in all respects.

The President reported to the Board that he has just learned that the Special Court now sitting in the matter of the proposed annexation of additional territory to the City of Charlottesville has of its own motion decided to consider the advisability of embracing within the corporate limits of the City of Charlottesville the grounds and buildings of the University of Virginia.

The Petition of the City of Charlottesville on the subject of annexation of territory does not include a request that the University's property be included within the boundaries of the City. In the previous annexation proceeding whereby the City extended its corporate limits in 1916, a similar proposal was made and on June 15, 1914, the following resolution was adopted by this Board:

**RESOLVED**; That this Board has learned with great regret and disapprobation that the City of Charlottesville has instituted legal proceedings to enlarge the boundaries of the said city so as to include within its corporate limits, the grounds and buildings of the University of Virginia; and that this Board regards with grave apprehension, and as seriously jeopardizing the welfare and best interests of this institution, the consummation of this proposed scheme.

**RESOLVED**: That the Executive Committee of this Board, be and they are authorized to retain the services of a competent attorney to be associated with the Hon. John B. Moon, attorney for the Board, to resist in court the efforts of the said City of Charlottesville to take the grounds and buildings of the University of Virginia into the corporation limits of said city, said assistant attorney to be employed at a compensation not to exceed $500.

The order of annexation entered at that time expressly excluded the grounds and buildings of the University of Virginia from the territory then annexed, and these grounds and buildings have always been within the political jurisdiction of the County of Albemarle and not within the political jurisdiction of the City of Charlottesville.

A full discussion of the whole situation was had by the Board and the following resolution was adopted:

**RESOLVED** that this Board regards with grave apprehension and as seriously jeopardizing the welfare and best interests of this Institution the proposal that its grounds and buildings be included within the corporate limits of the City of Charlottesville and within the political jurisdiction of said City; and be it further

**RESOLVED**, that the Rector and President, for the Board, with the Attorney for the University, be and they are hereby requested to report the situation at once to the Attorney General, requesting him to proceed at once to present the University's protest to the Court and do all things that may be necessary to prevent the inclusion of the grounds and buildings of the University of Virginia within the corporate limits of the City of Charlottesville.

Mr. Gray Williams brought up the question of making needed repairs to the Miller property, located at Elkton, Va., and stated that Mr. Bowen, the life tenant of the property, was willing to have the necessary lumber cut and sawed from timber on the property, and make the needed repairs if the University would agree to permitting the timber to be cut. After some discussion, a special committee was appointed, with power to act, composed of the President and R. Gray Williams, to either grant permission to cut the timber, or to purchase the necessary lumber to make the needed repairs.

The following resolution was adopted:

**RESOLVED** by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the Rector and President be and they are hereby authorized and empowered to employ special counsel in the annexation proceedings now pending before a Court in Charlottesville if, after conferring with the Attorney General, they deem the employment of special counsel to be necessary in order to protect the best interest of the University.

Upon motion the meeting then adjourned.
