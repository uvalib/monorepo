THE PRESIDENT REPORTTHE UNIVERSITY ORIGINAL LABOR FORCEGIFTS AND GRANTS REPORT
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Rector asked the President to make his customary report.

The President told the Board that the John Paul Jones Arena has been named Best New Concert Venue of the Year by Pollstar; this naming took place in Los Angeles on the evening of February 8th. It is a prestigious award and the President complimented the staff who made this possible.

At an earlier meeting of the Board, the President noted, he had informed Members of plans to commemorate the University original labor force. These plans have advanced with the appointment of two committees, both chaired by Brian Hogg, Senior Preservation Planner in the Office of the University Architect. The first of these committees has completed its work, which was to design a marker to honor the efforts of these anonymous workers, and to devise the wording and placement of the marker. The committee has proposed a slate memorial, to be placed in the brick pavement of the passage under the south terrace of the Rotunda, the passage which leads to the principal entrance of the building.

The second committee is charged with conducting research to identify the enslaved workers and other persons of color who participated in building the University original buildings and grounds. It is proposed that the names of these people and information about their roles be incorporated into a commemorative and interpretive site that will be part of Phase II of the South Lawn Project.

The President said the Buildings and Grounds Committee has approved the wording of the commemorative marker; the Committee resolution, which will be brought to the full Board for approval later in the meeting, and which includes the proposed wording, is as follows:

WHEREAS, the Board of Visitors wishes to acknowledge the contributions of the mostly anonymous women and men, free and enslaved, who constructed the first buildings of the University between 1817 and 1826;

RESOLVED, the Board directs the placement of a stone tablet, to be set in the pavement on the south side of the Rotunda at the point where the main passage into the Rotunda joins the walkway under the West Lawn colonnades. The memorial tablet is to be inscribed as follows:

"In honor of the several hundred women and men, both free and enslaved, whose labor between 1817 and 1826 helped realize Thomas Jefferson design for the University of Virginia.

The President told the Board that philanthropic giving to the University and its related foundations was $180.9million for the first six months of the fiscal year, which represents an increase of 40% over the amount given in the same period last year.

Among the significant gifts received since the last meeting of the Board are $9million in pledge payments for the Cancer Center, Women Oncology Research, and salary support; $7,866,283.82 in gifts and pledge payments from Paul Tudor Jones, II and Mrs. Sonia Klein Jones to the Virginia Athletics Foundation, the College of Arts & Sciences, the Jefferson Scholars Foundation, and the University of Virginia Fund; and a $6,530,000 pledge payment from Daniel M. Meyers to the Curry School. Other gifts include a $3,080,000 gift in kind from Albert H. Small to the University Library.

Significant pledges received since the last Board meeting include an anonymous pledge of $10,000,000 to the Darden School Foundation, $5million from Dr. Sheila C. Johnson to the Curry School, and $2,500,000 from Frederic W. Scott, Jr. for a memorial to his grandfather and for program support of the Miller Center and the Sorenson Institute.

On motion, the Board approved the Gifts and Grants Report:

RESOLVED, the Gifts and Grants Report for the period September 1, 2006 - December 31, 2006, is approved.

For all purposes of this Resolution, in computing the aggregate principal amount of Notes outstanding on any date, there shall be excluded the amount of any Original Issue Discount on any Note.

(b) The initial Program was established as of June 15, 2006, with the Notes issued at that time. From time to time, the University may establish a new Program hereunder as set forth in Section 2.10 hereof.

The Notes shall be substantially in the form set forth in Appendix A hereto and made a part hereof with such insertions, omissions or variations as may be deemed necessary or appropriate by the Authorized Officers of the University executing the same and as shall be permitted by the Act. The University hereby adopts the form of Note set forth in Appendix A hereto, and all of the covenants and conditions set forth therein, as and for the form of obligation to be incurred by the University. The covenants and conditions set forth in the form of Note are incorporated in this Resolution by reference and shall be binding upon the University as though set forth in full herein. The Notes may contain, or have endorsed thereon, any notations, legends or endorsements not inconsistent with the provisions of this Resolution that are necessary or desirable to meet any law, stock exchange rule or usage if approved by an Authorized Officer of the University prior to the authentication and delivery thereof. The execution and delivery of the Notes by the University in accordance with this Resolution shall be conclusive evidence of the approval of the form of the Notes by the University, including any insertions, omissions, variations, notations, legends or endorsements authorized by this Resolution.

The Notes shall be numbered in the manner determined by the Issuing and Paying Agent. Before authenticating and delivering any Note, the Issuing and Paying Agent shall complete the form of such Note.

Notes shall be issuable in denominations of $100,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess of $100,000 and may be issued in registered or bearer form. Each Note shall be dated the date of its issuance.

Each Note shall mature on a Business Day determined by the Dealer in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph that is not later than the latest date that is not more than 270 days after the date of issuance of such Note; provided that no Note shall mature on a date which is after the Final Maturity Date.

On or before each date on which Notes are issued in accordance with Section 2.3, the Dealer shall determine the maturity date and interest rate for such Notes in accordance with this Section. The Dealer shall determine the maturity date of each Note on the date of issuance of such Note to be the date that, in the judgment of the Dealer as of the date of determination, when considered together with the maturity dates of other Notes, produces the greatest likelihood of the lowest net interest cost on the Notes to the University during each year.

It is recognized that (a) the Dealer may, in the exercise of its judgment, determine maturities for Notes that result in interest rates on Notes that are higher than those that would be borne by Notes with other maturity dates in order to increase the likelihood of achieving the lowest overall debt service cost on the Notes to the University and (b) in view of the uncertainties involved in forecasting interest rates, the Dealer may establish different maturities for Notes on the same date in order to achieve an average of maturities that, in its judgment, is most likely to achieve the lowest debt service on the Notes. The determination of maturity dates for Notes by the Dealer as herein provided shall be based upon the market for and the relative yields of the Notes and other securities that bear interest at a variable rate or at fixed rates that, in the judgment of the Dealer, are otherwise comparable to the Notes, or any fact or circumstance

Relating to the Notes or affecting the market therefor or affecting such other comparable securities in a manner that, in the judgment of the Dealer, will affect the market for the Notes.

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section, upon receipt of notice from the University of the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be retired on any date, the Dealer shall determine maturity dates for Notes in a manner that shall permit the retirement of Notes on such date to the extent possible, taking into account the maturity dates of Commercial Paper Notes then Outstanding.

Each Note shall bear interest at the rate determined by the Dealer on or before the date of issuance thereof to be the minimum rate that, in the judgment of the Dealer, would enable the Dealer to sell such Commercial Paper Note on the date of issuance at a price equal to its fair market value considering similar securities. It is understood that different interest rates may be determined for Notes maturing on the same date. Interest on Series A (Tax-Exempt) Notes shall be calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in a year containing 365 or 366 days (as the case may be). Such interest shall be payable on the maturity date of such Notes. Series A (Tax-Exempt) Notes may only be sold at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof.

Interest on Series B (Taxable) Notes shall be calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in a year containing twelve 30-day months. Such interest shall be payable on the maturity date of such Notes. Series B (Taxable) Notes may be sold at a price equal to the principal amount thereof less any original issue discount or premium thereon.

The Dealer shall give written notice of each interest rate and maturity date determined for any Note in any month to the University and the Issuing and Paying Agent in accordance with the terms of the Dealer Agreement. The Dealer and the Issuing and Paying Agent shall keep a record of each interest rate and maturity date determined in accordance with this Section and shall provide written confirmation thereof upon the request of the University from time to time.

The determination of the interest rates and maturity dates for Notes by the Dealer as provided in this Section shall be conclusive and binding on the Holders of such Notes, the University and the Issuing and Paying Agent.

Subject to the provisions of Section 2.3, from time to time upon receipt of written, facsimile, telecopy or telex instructions or notice transmitted directly to the Issuing and Paying Agent's computers or in such other manner as the Issuing and Paying Agent then employs as its normal business practice ("Issuance Instructions") on a Business Day from the University or the Dealer, the Issuing and Paying Agent shall complete, authenticate and deliver Note certificates to or upon the order of the Dealer in accordance therewith or, if the Book-Entry System is then in effect, give instructions for the issuance of Notes to DTC in the manner set forth in, and take such other actions as are required by, the Letter of Representations; provided that such Issuance Instructions are received by the Issuing and Paying Agent not later than 12:30 p.m., New York, New York time in the case of Notes to be issued in certificated form, or 1:00 p.m., New York, New York time if the Book-Entry System is then in effect (or, in either case such later time as shall be acceptable to the Issuing and Paying Agent) on the date on which such Notes are to be issued.

The Dealer shall comply with any procedures established by a Note Order in the determination of interest rates and maturity dates for Notes in accordance with this Section.

The principal of and interest on the Notes will be payable in any money of the United States of America that at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts or by check payable in such money only upon presentation and surrender of such Notes at the Designated Office at the Issuing and Paying Agent.

If the University issues temporary Notes it will execute and deliver definitive Notes as promptly thereafter as practicable, and thereupon the temporary Notes may be surrendered, for cancellation, in exchange therefor at the office of the Issuing and Paying Agent and the Issuing and Paying Agent shall authenticate and deliver in exchange for such temporary Notes an equal aggregate principal amount of definitive Notes of authorized denominations of the same maturity or maturities and interest rate. Until so exchanged, the temporary Notes shall be entitled to the same benefits under this Resolution as definitive Notes authenticated and delivered hereunder.

If any Note shall become mutilated, the University, at the expense of the owner of such Note, shall execute, and the Issuing and Paying Agent shall thereupon authenticate and deliver, a new Note of like tenor bearing a different number in exchange and substitution for the Note so mutilated, but only upon surrender to the Issuing and Paying Agent of the Note so mutilated. Every mutilated Note so surrendered to the Issuing and Paying Agent shall be canceled by it and shall be delivered to, or upon the order of, the University. If any Note shall be lost, destroyed or stolen, evidence of the ownership thereof and of such loss, destruction or theft may be submitted to the University and the Issuing and Paying Agent and, if such evidence be satisfactory to them and indemnity satisfactory to them shall be given, the University, at the expense of the owner, shall execute, and the Issuing and Paying Agent shall thereupon authenticate and deliver, a new Note of like tenor bearing a different number in lieu of and in substitution for the Note so lost, destroyed or stolen (or if any such Note shall have matured or shall be about to mature, instead of issuing a substitute Note, the Issuing and Paying Agent may pay the same without surrender thereof). The University may require payment of a sum not exceeding the actual cost of preparing each new Note issued under this Section and of the related expenses which may be incurred by the University and the Issuing and Paying Agent. Any Note issued under the provisions of this Section in lieu of any Note alleged to be lost, destroyed or stolen shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation on the part of the University whether or not the Note so alleged to be lost, destroyed or stolen be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to the benefits of this Resolution with all other Notes secured by this Resolution.

(a) A new Program may be established hereunder for Series A (Tax-Exempt) Notes, from time to time, by the completion and execution by an Authorized Officer of the University, and the Notice to the Issuing and Paying Agent and the Dealer, of a New Program Order in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit C, and compliance with the provisions of Section 2.10(c) hereof. No further action shall be required to be taken by the Board or the Executive Committee in order to establish a new Program hereunder, other than as set forth in this Section 2.10. The establishment of a new Program, in and of itself, shall not require the consent of the holders of any Notes.

(b) A Program may be established from time to time to succeed another Program. On and after the date a new Program is established hereunder, no Notes may be issued under a prior Program; however, Notes may be issued to refund Notes under the prior Program and Outstanding Notes issued under a prior Program shall continue to be subject to the terms and provisions of this Resolution until their maturity date. It is the intention of the University that all Series 2003A Notes issued under a Program, as a part of one or more Series, for a period not greater than the 18-month period beginning on the date of the first issuance of Series A (Tax-Exempt) Notes under such Program (such period, the "New Money Issuance Period") shall constitute a single issue under the Code. Under each Program, Series A (Tax-Exempt) Notes may be issued during the New Money Issuance Period to finance or refinance (i) Costs of the Projects, (ii) certain costs of issuance of the Series A (Tax-Exempt) Notes or (iii) Series A (Tax-Exempt) Notes issued under such Program or a prior Program. After the New Money Issuance Period, Series A (Tax-Exempt) Notes may be issued under a Program only to refinance Notes previously issued under that Program.

(c) The establishment and effectiveness of a new Program shall be conditioned upon the delivery to the Issuing and Paying Agent of each of the following:

The provisions of this Section 2.11 shall apply to the Notes so long as all of the Notes shall be maintained in book-entry form with Depository Trust Company ("DTC") or any other Securities Depository, any other provisions of this Resolution to the contrary notwithstanding.

On the date of the initial delivery of the Notes hereunder, the Issuing and Paying Agent shall authenticate a Master Note registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of DTC, and deliver such Master Note to DTC.

The principal of and interest on the Notes shall be payable to the Securities Depository, or registered assigns, as the registered owner of the Notes, on each date on which the principal of or interest on the Notes becomes due in accordance with the Letter of Representation. Such payments shall be made to the offices of the Securities Depository specified by the Securities Depository to the University and Issuing and Paying Agent in writing. Without notice to or the consent of the Beneficial Owners of the Notes, the University and the Securities Depository may agree in writing to make payments in a manner different from that set out herein. In such event, the University shall give the Issuing and Paying Agent notice thereof, and the Issuing and Paying Agent shall make payments with respect to the Notes in the manner specified in such notice as if set forth herein. Neither the University nor the Issuing and Paying Agent shall have any obligation with respect to the transfer or crediting of the appropriate payments to any participant of any Securities Depository (a "Participant") or the Beneficial Owners of the Notes or their nominees.

So long as the Securities Depository or its nominee is the registered owner of the Notes, the University and the Issuing and Paying Agent will recognize the Securities Depository or its nominee, respectively, as the holder of all of the Notes for all purposes, including (without limitation) the payment of the principal of and interest on the Notes, the giving of notices and any consent or direction required or permitted to be given to, or on behalf of, the holders of the Notes under this Resolution.

The University, in its discretion, at any time may replace any Securities Depository as the depository for the Notes with another qualified securities depository or discontinue the maintenance of the Notes under a Book-Entry System upon 30 days notice to the Securities Depository (or such fewer number of days as shall be acceptable to such Securities Depository). A copy of any such notice shall be delivered promptly to the Issuing and Paying Agent.

If the University discontinues the maintenance of the Notes under the Book-Entry System, the University will issue Notes directly to the Participants or, to the extent requested by any Participant, to the Beneficial Owners of Notes as further described in this Section. The University shall make provisions to notify Participants and the Beneficial Owners of the Notes, by mailing an appropriate notice to the Securities Depository, or by other means deemed appropriate by the University in this discretion, that it will issue Notes directly to the Participants or, to the extent requested by any Participant, to Beneficial Owners of Notes as of a date set forth in such notice, which shall be a date at least 10 days after the date of mailing of such notice (or such fewer number of days as shall be acceptable to the Securities Depository).

In the event that Notes are to be issued to Participants or to Beneficial Owners of the Notes, the University shall promptly have prepared Notes in certificated form registered in the names of the Participants as shown on the records of the Securities Depository provided to the Issuing and Paying Agent or, to the extent requested by any Participant, in the names of the Beneficial Owners of Notes shown on the records of such Participant provided to the Issuing and Paying Agent, as of the date set forth in the notice delivered in accordance with this paragraph.

If the University replaces any Securities Depository as the depository for the Notes with another qualified Securities Depository, the University will issue to the replacement Securities Depository Notes registered in the name of such replacement Securities Depository.

Each Securities Depository and the Participants and the Beneficial Owners of the Notes by their acceptance of the Notes, agree that the University and the Issuing and Paying Agent shall have no liability for the failure of any Securities Depository or to perform its obligations to any Participant or any Beneficial Owner of any Notes, nor shall the University or the Issuing and Paying Agent be liable for the failure of any Participant or other nominee of any Beneficial Owner of any Notes to perform any obligation that such Participant or other nominee may incur to any Beneficial Owner of the Notes.

Each Securities Depository and the Participants thereof and the Beneficial Owners of the Notes, by their acceptance of the Notes, agree that the University and the Issuing and Paying Agent shall have no liability or responsibility with respect to (1) the accuracy of any records maintained by such Securities Depository or any Securities Depository participant; (2) the payment by such Securities Depository to any Securities Depository participant or by any Securities Depository participant to any beneficial owner of any amount due in respect of the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on the Notes; (3) the delivery or timeliness of delivery by such Securities Depository to any Securities Depository participant or by any Securities Depository participant to any beneficial owner of any notice which is given to Noteholders; (4) the selection of the beneficial owners to receive payment in the event of any partial redemption of the Notes; or (5) any consent given or other action taken by such Securities Depository or any nominee of such Securities Depository, as Noteholder.

(a) At any time the University may provide for the delivery to the Issuing and Paying Agent of a Liquidity Facility or alternate Liquidity Facility in an amount equal to the principal amount of the Notes then Outstanding plus such additional amount as is necessary to cause such Notes to be assigned the highest short term rating of each Rating Agency, as evidenced by a written confirmation of rating delivered by each such Rating Agency, provided the University shall cause the notice described below to be given to the Noteholders. Such Liquidity Facility or alternate Liquidity Facility shall have such terms as may be agreed upon by the University and the issuer of such Liquidity Facility. On or prior to the date of the delivery of a Liquidity Facility or alternate Liquidity Facility and in such time to provide for the notice to Noteholders provided below, the University shall furnish to the Issuing and Paying Agent (x) if any Series A (Tax-Exempt) Notes are outstanding, a Favorable Opinion of Bond Counsel and (y) written confirmation from each Rating Agency to the effect that such Rating Agency has reviewed the proposed Liquidity Facility or alternate Liquidity Facility and that the issuance of the Liquidity Facility or substitution of the proposed alternate Liquidity Facility for the existing Liquidity Facility will not, by itself, result in a reduction or withdrawal of the then-applicable rating(s) assigned by each Rating Agency to Notes. If a Liquidity Facility is in effect, the University may allow it to terminate or expire without providing an alternate Liquidity Facility, if on or prior to its termination date in such time to provide the notice to Noteholders provided below, the University shall furnish to the Issuing and Paying Agent (xx) if any Series A (Tax-Exempt) Notes are outstanding, a Favorable Opinion of Bond Counsel and (yy) written confirmation from each Rating Agency to the effect that such termination without an alternate Liquidity Facility will not, by itself, result in a reduction or withdrawal of the then-applicable rating(s) assigned by each Rating Agency to the Notes. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the University may provide for the delivery of a Liquidity Facility or an alternate Liquidity Facility or the termination of an existing Liquidity Facility without an alternate Liquidity Facility , without the above notice to the Noteholders and without providing the Issuing and Paying Agent with the confirmation from each Rating Agency described above, provided such Liquidity Facility delivery or termination occurs on a date when all the Notes mature or when there are no Notes outstanding.

(b) At the written direction of the University, and subject to Section 5.7 hereof, the Issuing and Paying Agent shall execute and deliver (i) any instrument that, upon such execution and delivery by the Issuing and Paying Agent, would constitute a Liquidity Facility or an alternate Liquidity Facility and/or (ii) any related or required documentation. The University may authorize such supplemental resolutions to this Resolution as may be necessary to facilitate the delivery, use or expiration of any Liquidity Facility.

(c) The University shall give the Issuing and Paying Agent, the Dealer and the issuer of any existing Liquidity Facility, if any, written notice, indicating the proposed effective date of a Liquidity Facility or any alternate Liquidity Facility, or the termination or expiration date of any existing Liquidity Facility, not less than forty (40) calendar days prior to the proposed effective date of any Liquidity Facility or expiration date of any Liquidity Facility. The University and the Issuing and Paying Agent shall mail to the Noteholders, at least twenty (20) calendar days prior to the proposed effective date of any Liquidity Facility or expiration date of any Liquidity Facility, a notice of such change in Liquidity Facility, stating the terms of such Liquidity Facility, information about the issuer of such Liquidity Facility, a description of any revisions to this Resolution or the Notes to facilitate the delivery, use or expiration of such Liquidity Facility, and that the University expects to receive confirmation from each Rating Agency to the effect that such Rating Agency has reviewed the proposed Liquidity Facility or alternate Liquidity Facility, if applicable, and that the issuance of the Liquidity Facility or substitution of the proposed alternate Liquidity Facility for the existing Liquidity Facility or termination of the Liquidity Facility without provision of an alternate Liquidity Facility will not, by itself, result in a reduction or withdrawal of the then-applicable rating(s) assigned by each Rating Agency to the Notes.

(a) The Dealer shall notify the Issuing and Paying Agent and the University not later than 11:00 a.m. (Eastern Time) on the date any Notes mature of the amount of such Notes that were successfully remarketed or reissued and the registration instructions (i.e., the names, addresses and taxpayer identification numbers of the purchasers, any account number for payment of principal and interest furnished by a purchaser to the Dealer) with respect thereto. The Dealer shall at or before 2:30 p.m. (Eastern Time) on such maturity date transfer of the purchase price of such remarketed or reissued Notes to the Issuing and Paying Agent in immediately available funds for deposit in the Remarketing Account created in Section 5.1.

(b) The Dealer shall notify the Issuing and Paying Agent, the University and any Liquidity Facility Issuer by 11:00 a.m. (Eastern Time), to the extent that Notes maturing that day are not remarketed, of the amount of all Notes maturing that day less the aggregate amount of the proceeds of any remarketing or reissuance proceeds to be transferred to the Issuing and Paying Agent by Dealer pursuant to the proceeding subsection. On such date, the University shall provide to the Issuing and Paying Agent such amounts by 2:30 p.m. (Eastern Time) or, if a Liquidity Facility is in effect, by 12:30 p.m. (Eastern Time). If a Liquidity Facility is in effect, in the event the Issuing and Paying Agent receives any notice of insufficient remarketing or reissuance proceeds from the Dealer by 11:30 a.m. (Eastern Time), the Issuing and Paying Agent shall draw on any such Liquidity Facility to be drawn upon, by 12:30 p.m. (Eastern Time) on such date in such amount as may be necessary to pay all Notes maturing that day, but only to the extent the University has not provided other funds sufficient to make such payments.

(c) The Issuing and Paying Agent shall make provision for the payment to DTC of any amounts due on the Notes maturing no later than 3:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) on the date of their maturity. Funds for the payment of Notes maturing on any date shall be derived solely from the following sources in the order of priority indicated and neither the University, the Issuing and Paying Agent nor the Dealer shall be obligated to provide funds from any other source: (i) first from immediately available funds on deposit in the Remarketing Proceeds Account and (ii) then from immediately available funds on deposit in the Purchase Account.

The proceeds of the Notes shall be delivered to and deposited by the Custodian:

A special fund is hereby created in the office of the Custodian as the Construction Fund, to the credit of which there shall be deposited a portion of the proceeds of the Notes. There may also be deposited to the credit of the Construction Fund any moneys received from any other source for paying the Cost of the Projects (herein defined), provided if Series A (Tax-Exempt) Notes are outstanding, only if the University shall have received a Favorable Opinion of Bond Counsel with respect to such deposit. The moneys in the Construction Fund shall be held in trust and applied to the payment of the Cost of the Projects, as defined in Section 4.3, and, pending such application, shall be subject to a lien and charge in favor of the holders of the Notes and for the future security of such holders until paid out or transferred as herein provided.

For the purposes of this Resolution the Cost of the Projects shall include, without intending thereby to limit or restrict or to extend any proper definition of such costs under the Act or this Resolution, any or all of the following:

(a) obligations incurred for labor and materials and to contractors, builders and materialmen in connection with the Projects;

(b) the cost of acquiring by purchase, if such purchase shall be deemed expedient, and the amount of any award or final judgment in or any settlement or compromise of any proceeding to acquire by condemnation, such lands, property, rights, rights of way, franchises, easements and other interests as may be deemed necessary or convenient by the Board for the construction and operation of the Projects, options and partial payments thereon, and the amount of any damages incident to or consequent upon such construction and operation;

(c) the cost of furnishing and equipping the Projects;

(d) interest on the Notes, prior to and during construction of each component of the Projects and for up to one (1) year thereafter;

(e) taxes or other municipal or governmental charges lawfully levied or assessed during construction upon the Projects or any property acquired therefor, and premiums on insurance, if any, in connection with the Projects during construction; fees and expenses of engineers and architects for surveys and estimates and other preliminary investigations, preparation of plans, drawings and specifications and supervising construction, as well as for the performance of all other duties of engineers and architects in relation to the planning and construction of the Projects or the issuance of Notes therefor;

(f) expenses of administration properly chargeable to the Projects, legal expense and fees, fees and expenses of consultants, financing charges, cost of audits and of preparing and issuing the Notes, and all other items of expense not elsewhere in this Section specified incident to the planning, construction, development and equipping of the Projects and the placing of the Projects in operation; and

(g) any obligation or expenses heretofore or hereafter incurred by the University, any agent of the University or by any other agency of the Commonwealth of Virginia in connection with the Projects for any of the foregoing purposes.

Payment of the Cost of the Projects shall be made from the appropriate account of the Construction Fund and other available funds, all as provided by law. All payments from the Construction Fund shall be subject to the provisions and restrictions set forth in this Article, and the Board covenants that it will not cause or permit to be paid from the Construction Fund any sums except in accordance with such provisions and restrictions.

Moneys in the Construction Fund shall be paid out by the Custodian to be issued on vouchers of the University, all in accordance with the Act, the amounts stated in such vouchers to be certified by the University to be necessary for paying items of Cost of the Projects.

The vouchers shall be in substantially the form of Exhibit B hereto (or in such other form required by the Custodian) and shall state each amount to be paid, the appropriate account from which funds should be used, the name of the person, firm or corporation to whom each such payment is due and the purpose for which the obligation to be paid was incurred, and shall certify that the goods or services specified have been received, or performed, payment therefor has not been previously authorized and that the expenditure is a proper charge to the appropriation for the Construction Fund.

The University shall keep accounts of the Costs of the Projects which have been, and are expected to be, spent for each component of the Projects to ensure that such Costs of the Project shall not exceed the maximum authorized amount for each such component.

When the Projects shall have been completed and placed in operation, as evidenced by a certificate signed by the Chief Financial Officer and filed with the Secretary of the Board and the Custodian, any balance in the Construction Fund not deemed by the Board to be necessary to be reserved for the payment of any remaining part of the Cost of the Projects shall be deposited to the credit of the Debt Service Funds for the Notes, and used to pay interest on the Notes on their next interest payment date.

(a) A special fund is hereby created in the office of the Issuing and Paying Agent and designated "The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia Commercial Paper General Revenue Pledge Notes Debt Service Fund" (the "Debt Service Fund"). On or before each date on which payments of interest, premium or principal shall be due and payable on the Notes (a "Payment Date"), the University shall transfer or cause to be transferred to the Issuing and Paying Agent for deposit in the Debt Service Fund an amount of money sufficient to cause the amount held in the Debt Service Fund to be equal to the interest, premium and principal due on the Notes on such Payment Date.

(b) The Issuing and Paying Agent shall further establish separate trust accounts within the Debt Service Fund to be known as the "Purchase Account" and the "Remarketing Proceeds Account" to be used as follows:

The Issuing and Paying Agent shall at times appropriate to make payment on each Payment Date (as defined in Section 5.1), withdraw from the appropriate accounts of the Debt Service Fund the amounts needed on such date to pay the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on the Notes and shall pay or cause the same to be paid to the Noteholders as such principal, premium and interest become due and payable.

The moneys in the Debt Service Fund shall be held in trust and applied as herein provided and, pending such application, shall be pledged to, and subject to a lien and charge in favor, of the holders of the Notes issued and outstanding under this Resolution and for the further security of such holders until paid out or transferred as herein provided.

All moneys from the funds of the University or from any other source and set aside, or deposited with the Issuing and Paying Agent, for the purpose of paying any of the Notes hereby secured, either at the maturity thereof or upon call for redemption, shall be held in trust for the respective holders of such Notes. Any moneys which shall be so set aside or deposited and which shall remain unclaimed by the holders of such Notes for the period of five (5) years after the date on which such Notes shall have become due and payable shall be disposed of by the University and the Issuing and Paying Agent in accordance with The Uniform Disposition of Unclaimed Property Act, Chapter 11.1, Title 55, Code of Virginia of 1950, as amended.

All Notes paid, redeemed or purchased by the University, either at or before maturity, shall be canceled upon the payment, redemption or purchase of such Notes and shall be delivered to the University when such payment, redemption or purchase is made. All Notes canceled under any of the provisions of this Resolution may be cremated or otherwise destroyed by the University or its designee.

Moneys in the Debt Service Fund established pursuant to this Resolution shall be invested by the University or by the Issuing and Paying Agent as shall be directed by the University, but only in Investment Obligations maturing or redeemable at the option of the holder in such amounts and on such dates as may be necessary to provide moneys to meet the payments from such funds and accounts.

Interest earned, profits realized and losses suffered by reason of any investment of the funds and accounts established hereunder shall be credited or charged, as the case may be, to the fund or account for which such investment shall have been made.

The University or the Issuing and Paying Agent may sell or redeem any obligations in which moneys shall have been invested as in this Section provided to the extent necessary to provide cash in the respective funds or accounts to make any payments required to be made therefrom or to facilitate the transfers of money between various funds and accounts as may be required or permitted from time to time pursuant to the provisions of this Article.

In computing the value of the assets of any fund or account established hereunder, investments and accrued interest thereon shall be deemed a part thereof. Such investments shall be valued at the current market value thereof.

Neither the University nor the Issuing and Paying Agent shall be liable for any depreciation in the value of any obligations or securities in which moneys of the funds or accounts created by this Resolution shall be invested as aforesaid, or for any loss arising from any investment permitted hereby. The investments authorized by this Section shall at all times be subject to the provisions of applicable law, as amended from time to time.

No provision herein shall require the Issuing and Paying Agent to expend its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers unless the Issuing and Paying Agent shall have reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is reasonably insured to it.

The University covenants that it will promptly pay or cause to be paid from the sources described herein the principal of and the interest on every Note issued under the provisions of this Resolution at the place or places, on the dates and in the manner provided herein and in such Notes, and any premium required for the retirement of such Notes by purchase or redemption, according to the true intent and meaning thereof. Except as otherwise provided in this Resolution, such principal, interest and premium are payable solely from Pledged Revenues, which Pledged Revenues are hereby pledged to the payment thereof and to the payment of any Parity Credit Obligations issued by the University in the future, which may include any interest rate swaps or other hedge mechanisms related to the Notes and any dedicated line of credit, standby bond purchase agreement or other liquidity facility related to the Notes, including any Liquidity Facility.

THE UNIVERSITY SHALL NOT BE OBLIGATED TO PAY THE PRINCIPAL OF OR INTEREST ON THE NOTES EXCEPT FROM THE SOURCES NOTED HEREIN AS PLEDGED THEREFOR. THE NOTES AND THE INTEREST THEREON SHALL NOT BE DEEMED TO CONSTITUTE A DEBT OR LIABILITY OF THE COMMONWEALTH, LEGAL, MORAL OR OTHERWISE. NEITHER THE COMMONWEALTH NOR THE UNIVERSITY SHALL BE OBLIGATED TO PAY THE PRINCIPAL OF OR INTEREST ON THE NOTES OR OTHER COSTS INCIDENT THERETO EXCEPT FROM THE SOURCES NOTED HEREIN AS PLEDGED THEREFOR, AND NEITHER THE FAITH AND CREDIT NOR THE TAXING POWER OF THE COMMONWEALTH ARE PLEDGED TO THE PAYMENT OF THE PRINCIPAL OF OR INTEREST ON THE NOTES OR OTHER COSTS INCIDENT THERETO.

Except as otherwise provided in this Section, nothing in this Resolution shall be construed as prohibiting or limiting in any way the right of the University to incur other Credit Obligations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, the University may only incur the following types of Credit Obligations in the event the conditions set forth below are met in each instance:

(a) Limitation on Parity Credit Obligations. The University may incur, assume, guarantee or otherwise become liable on any Parity Credit Obligation, but only if, prior to the incurrence of each such Parity Credit Obligation, an Authorized Officer of the University certifies in writing that (1) taking into account the incurrence of such proposed Parity Credit Obligation (i) the University will have sufficient funds to meet all of its financial obligations, including its obligations to pay principal of and interest on all Credit Obligations, for all Fiscal Years to and including the second full Fiscal Year after the later of (A) the issuance of such Parity Credit Obligation and (B) the completion of any facility financed with the proceeds of such Parity Credit Obligation, and (ii) such Authorized Officer has no reason to believe that the University will not have sufficient funds to pay all amounts due under all indebtedness of the University during the term of such proposed Parity Credit Obligation, and (2) to the best of his or her knowledge, the University is not in default in the performance and observance of any of the provisions of this Resolution. Any such Parity Credit Obligation shall be secured by a pledge of Pledged Revenues on a parity with the pledge of Pledged Revenues herein, unless expressly subordinated to the pledge hereof.

(b) Limitation on Section 9(c) Credit Obligations. The University may incur, assume, guarantee or otherwise become liable on any Credit Obligation pursuant to the provisions of Article X, Section 9(c) of the Constitution of Virginia, as such section may be amended from time to time, and may pledge and apply such portion of the Pledged Revenues as may be necessary to provide for the payment of any such Credit Obligation, the funding of reasonable reserves therefor, or the payment of operating and other reasonable expenses of the facilities financed in whole or in part with the proceeds of such Credit Obligation or facilities reasonably related to such facilities, and such pledge shall be senior and superior in all respects to the pledge of Pledged Revenues securing the Notes and any other Parity Credit Obligations, but only if, prior to the incurrence of each such Credit Obligation, an Authorized Officer of the University certifies in writing that (1) taking into account the incurrence of such proposed Credit Obligation (i) the University will have sufficient funds to meet all of its financial obligations, including its obligations to pay principal of and interest on all Credit Obligations, all Fiscal Years to and including the second full Fiscal Year after the later of (A) the issuance of such proposed Credit Obligation and (B) the completion of any facility financed with the proceeds of such proposed Credit Obligation, and (ii) such Authorized Officer has no reason to believe that the University will not have sufficient funds to pay all amounts due under all indebtedness of the University during the term of such proposed Credit Obligation, (2) to the best of his or her knowledge, the University is not in default in the performance and observance of any of the provisions of this Resolution, and (3) in connection with the issuance of such proposed Credit Obligation, the University has received an opinion of Bond Counsel to the effect that such proposed Credit Obligation has been validly issued under Article X, Section 9(c) of the Constitution of Virginia.

(c) Limitation on Other Credit Obligations, Including Section 9(d) Credit Obligations. The University may incur, assume, guarantee or otherwise become liable on any Credit Obligation not described elsewhere in this Section 6.3, including any Credit Obligation incurred pursuant to the provisions of Article X, Section 9(d) of the Constitution of Virginia, as such section may be amended from time to time, and may pledge and apply such portion of the Pledged Revenues as may be necessary for the payment of any such Credit Obligation, the funding of reasonable reserves therefor, or the payment of operating and other reasonable expenses of the facilities financed in whole or in part with the proceeds of such Credit Obligation or facilities reasonably related to such facilities and such pledge shall be senior and superior in all respects to the pledge of Pledged Revenues securing the Notes and any other Parity Credit Obligations, but only if, prior to the incurrence of each such Credit Obligation, an Authorized Officer of the University certifies in writing that (1) taking into account the incurrence of such proposed Credit Obligation (i) the University will have sufficient funds to meet all of its financial obligations, including its obligations to pay principal of and interest on all Credit Obligations, for all Fiscal Years to and including the second full Fiscal Year after the later of (A) the issuance of such proposed Credit Obligation and (B) the completion of any facility financed with the proceeds of such proposed Credit Obligation, and (ii) such Authorized Officer has no reason to believe that the University will not have sufficient funds to pay all amounts due under all indebtedness of the University during the term of such proposed Credit Obligation, (2) to the best of his or her knowledge, the University is not in default in the performance and observance of any of the provisions of this Resolution, and (3) the University has received an opinion of Bond Counsel to the effect that such proposed Credit Obligation has been validly issued under the relevant provisions of the Constitution of Virginia.

(d) Limitation on Issuance of Indebtedness on a Parity with Qualifying Senior Obligations. Except for Credit Obligations issued pursuant to subsections (b) or (c) above or to refund any Qualifying Senior Obligation as described in subsection (e) below, no additional bonds or other obligations may be issued or incurred by the University on a parity with any Qualifying Senior Obligation.

(e) Limitation on Additional Encumbrances. The University shall not encumber the Pledged Revenues in any manner (except as permitted in connection with Credit Obligations issued pursuant to subsections (a), (b) or (c) above or to refund any Qualifying Senior Obligation as described below), unless any such encumbrance is made junior and subordinate in all respects to the liens, pledges, covenants and agreements of this Resolution. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, however, the University may issue bonds to refund any Qualifying Senior Obligation and to secure such refunding bonds with the same source of revenues securing the Qualifying Senior Obligation being refunded. Upon the defeasance of the refunded Qualifying Senior Obligation pursuant to any such refunding, the refunding bonds will be considered Qualifying Senior Obligations for all purposes.

The University may convey, sell or otherwise dispose of any property of the University as long as (1) such conveyance, sale or encumbrance is in the ordinary course of business, or (2) an Authorized Officer certifies in writing that, taking into account the conveyance, sale or other disposition of such property (i) the University will have sufficient funds to meet all of its financial obligations, including its obligations to pay principal of and interest on all Credit Obligations for all Fiscal Years to and including the second full Fiscal Year after such conveyance, sale or other disposition and (ii) such Authorized Officer has no reason to believe that the University will not have sufficient funds to pay all amounts due under all indebtedness of the University then outstanding.

The University covenants that it will at all times carry or cause to be carried with a responsible insurance company or companies, qualified to assume the risks thereof, or that it will maintain an adequate program of self-insurance, in either case sufficient to provide the University such insurance in such amount and covering such risks as the University shall deem to be reasonable and desirable.

Except as otherwise set forth herein, the University covenants that no contract or contracts will be entered into or any action taken which might impair or diminish the rights of the Noteholders.

The University covenants that it will, from time to time, execute and deliver such further instruments and take such further action as may be required to carry out the purposes of this Resolution.

The University covenants that it will keep accurate records and accounts of all items of cost and of all expenditures relating to Pledged Revenues collected and the application of such Pledged Revenues.

The University further covenants that it will cause to be filed not later than the end of the ninth month following the close of each Fiscal Year mailed to all Noteholders who shall have filed their names and addresses with the Secretary of the Board for such purpose a report, signed by the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the University and by the Virginia Auditor of Public Accounts or by an independent certified public accountant or firm of certified public accountants to be approved by the Virginia Auditor of Public Accounts, setting forth for the preceding Fiscal Year, in reasonable detail, the financial condition of the University, including its statement of net assets as of the end of the preceding Fiscal Year and the related statements of revenues, expenses and changes in net assets and statement of cash flows for the preceding Fiscal Year.

The University covenants that all of the accounts and records of the University will be kept according to generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied.

(a) The University shall not use or permit the use of any proceeds of Notes or any other funds of the University, directly or indirectly, to acquire any securities or obligation, and shall not use or permit the use of any amounts received by the University, the Custodian, any trustee or the Issuing and Paying Agent with respect to the Series A (Tax-Exempt) Notes in any manner, and shall not take or permit to be taken any other action or actions, which would cause any Series A (Tax-Exempt) Note to be an "arbitrage bond" within the meaning of Section 148 of the Code. If at any time the University is of the opinion that for purposes of this subsection it is necessary to restrict or limit the yield on the investment of any moneys held under this Resolution the University shall so instruct the Custodian, any trustee or the Issuing and Paying Agent in writing, and such shall take such action as may be necessary in accordance with such issuance.

(b) The University shall not use or permit the use of any proceeds of Notes or any other funds of the University, directly or indirectly, in any manner, and shall not take or permit to be taken any other action or actions, which would result in any of the Series A (Tax-Exempt) Notes being treated as an obligation not described in Section 103(a) of the Code by reason of classification of such Series A (Tax-Exempt) Note as a "private activity bond," an "arbitrage bond" or "bond not in registered form" within the meaning of Section 103(b) of the Code.

(c) The University shall at all times do and perform all acts and things permitted by law and this Resolution which are necessary or desirable in order to assure that interest paid on the Series A (Tax-Exempt) Notes or any of them will be excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes and shall take no action that would result in such interest not being excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes.

(d) The University covenants that it shall file the information report with respect to the Series A (Tax-Exempt) Notes required by Section 149(e) of the Code (currently Form 8038-G) within the time period provided in such Section.

Each of the following events is hereby declared to be an "Event of Default" under this Resolution:

(a) due and punctual payment of the principal, purchase price or redemption premium, if any, of any of the Notes is not made when the same become due and payable, either at maturity or by proceedings for redemption or otherwise;

(b) due and punctual payment of any interest on any of the Notes is not made when the same become due and payable;

(c) the University, for any reason, is rendered incapable of fulfilling its obligations hereunder;

(d) an order or decree is entered, with the consent or acquiescence of the University, appointing a receiver or receivers of the University or any part thereof or of the revenues thereof, or if such order or decree, having been entered without the consent or acquiescence of the University, is not vacated or discharged or stayed on appeal within sixty (60) days after the entry thereof;

(e) any proceeding is instituted, with the consent or acquiescence of the University, for the purpose of effecting a composition between the University and its creditors or for the purpose of adjusting the claims of such creditors pursuant to any federal or state statute now or hereafter enacted; or

(f) the University defaults in the due and punctual performance of any other of the covenants, conditions, agreements and provisions contained in the Notes or in this Resolution on the part of the University to be performed, and such default continues for thirty (30) days after written notice specifying such default and requiring same to be remedied is given to the Board by any Noteholder, provided that if such default is such that it can be corrected but cannot be corrected within such thirty (30) day period, it shall not constitute an Event of Default if corrective action is instituted by the University within such period and is diligently pursued until the default is corrected.

(a) Upon the happening and continuance of an Event of Default hereunder, the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes, by instrument or instruments filed with the University and proved or acknowledged in the same manner as a deed to be recorded, may appoint a trustee to represent the holders of the Notes for the purposes herein and in the Act provided, which trustee may be the State Treasurer and shall be the same trustee so appointed with respect to all other outstanding Parity Credit Obligations. Such trustee may, and upon written request of the holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding shall, in its own name:

(b) Any such trustee, whether or not all such Notes have been declared due and payable, shall be entitled as of right to the appointment of a receiver who may enter and take possession of any property of the University any of the revenues from which are pledged for the security of the Notes and operate and maintain the same and collect and receive all fees, rents, charges and other revenues thereafter arising therefrom in the same manner as the University itself might do and shall deposit all such moneys in a separate account and apply the same in such manner as the court appointing such receiver shall direct. In any suit, action or proceeding by the trustee the fees, counsel fees and expenses of the trustee and of the receiver, if any, shall constitute taxable costs and disbursements and all costs and disbursements allowed by the court shall be a first charge on any fees, rents, charges and other revenues of the University pledged for the security of the Notes.

Such trustee shall, in addition to the foregoing, have and process all of the powers necessary or appropriate for the exercise of any functions specifically set forth herein or incident to the general representation of the holders of the Notes in the enforcement and protection of their rights.

(c) To the extent permitted by law, upon the happening and continuance of any Event of Default, then and in every such case any Noteholder may proceed, subject to the provisions of Section 7.5, to protect and enforce the rights of the Noteholders by a suit, action or special proceeding in equity or at law, either for the specific performance of any covenant or agreement contained herein or in aid or execution of any power herein granted or for the enforcement of any proper legal or equitable remedy as such Noteholder shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce such rights.

Anything in this Resolution to the contrary notwithstanding, if at any time the moneys available in the Debt Service Fund shall not be sufficient to pay the interest on or the principal of the Notes as the same shall become due and payable, such moneys, together with any moneys then available or thereafter becoming available for such purpose, whether through the exercise of the remedies provided for in this Article or otherwise, shall be applied as follows:

(a) If the principal of all the Notes shall not have become due and payable, all such moneys shall be applied:

(b) If the principal of all the Notes shall have become due and payable, all such moneys shall be applied to the payment of the principal and interest then due and unpaid on the Notes, without preference or priority of principal over interest or interest over principal, or of any installment of interest over any other installment of interest, or of any Note over any other Note, ratably, according to the amounts due, respectively, for principal and interest, to the persons entitled thereto, without any discrimination or preference.

Whenever moneys are to be applied by the trustee pursuant to the provisions of this Section, such moneys shall be applied by the trustee at such times, and from time to time, as the trustee in his or her sole discretion shall determine, having due regard to the amount of such moneys available for application and the likelihood of additional moneys becoming available for such application in the future; the deposit of such moneys with any Issuing and Paying Agent, or otherwise setting aside such moneys, in trust for the proper purpose shall constitute proper application by the trustee; and the trustee shall incur no liability whatsoever to the Board, to any Noteholder or to any other person for any delay in applying any such moneys, so long as the trustee acts with reasonable diligence, having due regard to the circumstances, and ultimately applies the same in accordance with such provisions of this Resolution as may be applicable at the time of application by the trustee. Whenever the trustee shall exercise such discretion in applying such moneys, he or she shall fix the date (which shall be an interest payment date unless the trustee shall deem another date more suitable) upon which such application is to be made and upon such date interest on the amounts of principal to be paid on such date shall cease to accrue. The trustee shall give such notice (or shall cause the Issuing and Paying Agent to give such notice) as he or she may deem appropriate of the fixing of any such date and shall not be required to make payment to the holder of any Note until such Note shall be surrendered to the trustee or any Issuing and Paying Agent for appropriate endorsement, or for cancellation if fully paid.

Notwithstanding anything in this Resolution to the contrary, this Section 7.3 shall be interpreted so that term "Notes" or "Bonds" shall include the Notes and any Parity Credit Obligations. In each resolution authorizing the issuance of any Parity Credit Obligation, the University agrees to provide for the trustee thereunder to be the same as the trustee under this Resolution, and further agrees to include provisions substantially identical to those contained in this Section 7.3.

In case any proceeding taken by any Noteholder on account of any Event of Default shall have been discontinued or abandoned for any reason, then and in every such case the University and the Noteholders shall be restored to their former positions and rights hereunder, respectively, and all rights and remedies of the Noteholders shall continue as though no such proceeding had been taken.

No Noteholder shall have any right in any manner whatever to affect, disturb or prejudice the security of this Resolution or to enforce any right hereunder, except in the manner herein provided, and all proceedings at law or in equity shall be instituted, had and maintained for the equal benefit of all Noteholders.

No remedy herein conferred on the Noteholders is intended to be exclusive of any other remedy or remedies, and each and every remedy conferred shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to every other remedy given hereunder and under the Act or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute.

No delay or omission of any Noteholder to exercise any right or power accruing upon any Event of Default occurring and continuing as aforesaid shall impair any such right or power or shall be construed to be a waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence therein; and every power and remedy given by this Article to the Noteholders may be exercised from time to time and as often as may be deemed expedient.

Any request, direction, consent or other instrument in writing required or permitted by this Resolution to be signed or executed by Noteholders may be in any number of concurrent instruments of similar tenor and may be signed or executed by such Noteholders or their attorneys or legal representatives. Proof of the execution of any such instrument and of the ownership of the Notes shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Resolution and shall be conclusive in favor of the University and the Issuing and Paying Agent with regard to any action taken by them under such instrument if made in the following manner:

(a) The fact and date of the execution by any person of any such instrument may be proved by the verification of any officer in any jurisdiction who, by the laws thereof, has power to take affidavits within such jurisdiction, to the effect that such instrument was subscribed and sworn to before him or her, or by an affidavit of a witness to such execution. Where such execution is by an officer of a corporation or association or a member of a partnership on behalf of such corporation, association or partnership such verification or affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of his or her authority.

(b) The fact of the holding of the Notes hereunder by any Noteholder and the amount and the numbers of such Notes and the date of its holding the same shall be proved by the registration books kept under the provisions of Section 2.7.

The University may, from time to time and at any time, but without the consent of any holders of the Notes, adopt such resolutions supplemental hereto as shall not be inconsistent with the terms and provisions hereof (which Supplemental Resolutions shall thereafter form a part hereof), as follows:

At least thirty (30) days prior to the adoption of any Supplemental Resolution for any of the purposes of this Section, the Secretary of the Board shall cause a notice of the proposed adoption of such Supplemental Resolution to be mailed, postage prepaid, to all registered owners of Notes affected by such Supplemental Resolution at their addresses as they appear on the registration books. Such notice shall briefly set forth the nature of the proposed Supplemental Resolution and shall state that copies thereof are on file at the office of the Secretary of the Board for inspection by all Noteholders. A failure on the part of the Secretary of the Board to mail the notice required by this Section shall not affect the validity of such Supplemental Resolution.

Subject to the terms and provisions contained in this Section, and not otherwise, the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Notes then outstanding shall have the right, from time to time, anything contained in this Resolution to the contrary notwithstanding, to consent to and approve the adoption of such resolution or resolutions supplemental hereto as shall be deemed necessary or desirable by the Board for the purpose of modifying, altering, amending, adding to or rescinding, in any particular, any of the terms or provisions contained in this Resolution or in any Supplemental Resolution; provided, however, that nothing herein contained shall permit, or be construed as permitting, (a) without the approval of all of the Noteholders, (i) an extension of the maturity of the principal of or the interest on any Note, (ii) a reduction in the principal amount of any Note or the redemption premium or the rate of interest thereon, (iii) except as otherwise provided herein, a preference or priority of any Note or Notes over any other Note or Notes, or (iv) except as otherwise provided herein, the release of the lien created by this Resolution or the Resolution with respect to any Pledged Revenues, or (b) without the approval of all of the Noteholders, a reduction in the aggregate principal amount of the Notes required for consent to such Supplemental Resolution. Nothing herein contained, however, shall be construed as making necessary the approval by Noteholders of the adoption of any Supplemental Resolution as authorized in Section 9.1 of this Article.

If at any time the Board shall determine that it is necessary or desirable to adopt any Supplemental Resolution for any of the purposes of this Section, the Secretary of the Board shall cause notice of the proposed adoption of such Supplemental Resolution to be mailed, not less than thirty (30) nor more than sixty (60) days prior to the date of such adoption, postage prepaid, to all registered owners of the Notes at their addresses as they appear on the registration books held by the Issuing and Paying Agent. Such notice shall briefly set forth the nature of the proposed Supplemental Resolution and shall state that copies thereof are on file at the office of the Secretary of the Board for inspection by all Noteholders. The Board shall not, however, be subject to any liability to any Noteholder by reason of its failure to cause the notice required by this Section to be mailed and any such failure shall not affect the validity of such Supplemental Resolution when consented to and approved as provided in this Section.

Whenever, at any time within one year after the date of such notice, the Board shall deliver to the Issuing and Paying Agent an instrument or instruments in writing purporting to be executed by the holders of not less than a majority or all, as appropriate, in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, which instrument or instruments shall refer to the proposed Supplemental Resolution described in such notice and shall specifically consent to and approve the adoption thereof in substantially the form of the copy thereof referred to in such notice, thereupon, but not otherwise, the Board may adopt such Supplemental Resolution in substantially such form, without liability or responsibility to any holder of any Note, whether or not such holder shall have consented thereto.

If the holders of not less than a majority or all, as appropriate, in aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding at the time of the adoption of such Supplemental Resolution shall have consented to and approved the adoption thereof as herein provided, no Noteholder shall have any right to object to the adoption of such Supplemental Resolution, or to object to any of the terms and provisions contained therein or the operation thereof, or in any manner to question the propriety of the adoption thereof, or to enjoin or restrain the Board from adopting the same or from taking any action pursuant to the provisions thereof.

Upon the adoption of any Supplemental Resolution pursuant to the provisions of this Section, this Resolution shall be and be deemed to be modified and amended in accordance therewith, and the respective rights, duties and obligations under this Resolution of the University, the Board, and all holders of Notes then outstanding shall thereafter be determined, exercised and enforced in all respects under the provisions of this Resolution as so modified and amended.

Any Supplemental Resolution adopted in accordance with the provisions of this Article shall thereafter form a part of this Resolution, and all of the terms and conditions contained in any such Supplemental Resolution as to any provision authorized to be contained therein shall be and shall be deemed to be part of the terms and conditions of this Resolution for any and all purposes. In case of the adoption and approval of any Supplemental Resolution, express reference may be made thereto in the text of any Notes issued thereafter, if deemed necessary or desirable by the Board.

If the University shall pay or provide for the payment of the entire indebtedness on all Notes outstanding in any one or more of the following ways:

and if the University shall pay or cause to be paid all other sums payable hereunder by the University, and, if any of the Notes are to be redeemed before their maturity, notice of such redemption shall have been given as in Section 3.2 provided or provisions satisfactory to the Issuing and Paying Agent shall have been made for the giving of such notice, this Resolution and the estate and rights granted hereunder shall cease, determine, and become null and void, and thereupon the Issuing and Paying Agent shall, upon written request of the University, and upon receipt by the Issuing and Paying Agent of a Certificate of the Chief Operating Officer, each stating that in the opinion of the signers all conditions precedent to the satisfaction and discharge of this Resolution have been complied with, forthwith execute proper instruments acknowledging satisfaction of and discharging this Resolution and the lien hereof.

The University may at any time surrender to the Issuing and Paying Agent for cancellation by it any Notes previously authenticated and delivered, which the University may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and such Notes, upon such surrender and cancellation, shall be deemed to be paid and retired.

Upon the deposit with the Issuing and Paying Agent, in trust, at or before maturity, of money or Government Obligations in the necessary amount to pay or redeem all Notes outstanding (whether upon or before their maturity or the redemption date of such Notes) and compliance with the other payment requirements of Section 10.1, provided that if such Notes are to be redeemed before their maturity, notice of such redemption shall have been given as in Section 3.2 provided, or provisions satisfactory to the Issuing and Paying Agent shall have been made for the giving of such notice, this Resolution may be discharged in accordance with the provisions hereof but the University's liability in respect of the Notes shall continue provided that the owners thereof shall thereafter be entitled to payment only out of the moneys or the Government Obligations deposited with the Issuing and Paying Agent as aforesaid.

If the University shall pay or provide for the payment of the entire indebtedness on particular Notes in any one or more of the following ways:

and if the University shall also pay or cause to be paid all other sums payable hereunder by the University with respect to such Notes, and, if such Notes are to be redeemed before their maturity, notice of such redemption shall have been given as in Section 3.2 provided or provisions satisfactory to the Issuing and Paying Agent shall have been made for the giving of such notice, such Notes shall cease to be entitled to any lien, benefit or security under this Series A (Tax- Exempt) Resolution. The University's liability in respect of such Notes, if any, shall continue but the owners thereof shall thereafter be entitled to payment (to the exclusion of all other Noteholders) only out of the moneys, Government Obligations deposited with the Issuing and Paying Agent as aforesaid.

All covenants, stipulations, obligations and agreements of the University and the Board contained in this Resolution shall be deemed to be covenants, stipulations, obligations and agreements of the University and the Board to the full extent authorized by the Act or permitted by the Constitution of Virginia. All such covenants, stipulations, obligations and agreements shall be binding upon the successor or successors thereof from time to time and upon any officer, board, body or commission to whom or to which any power or duty affecting such covenants, stipulations, obligations and agreements shall be transferred by or in accordance with law.

No covenant, stipulation, obligation or agreement herein contained shall be deemed to be a covenant, stipulation, obligation or agreement of any present or future director, member, agent or employee of the University or the Board in his or her individual capacity, and neither any agency of the Commonwealth nor any officer thereof or of the University, present or future, executing the Notes shall be liable personally on the Notes or be subject to any personal liability or accountability by reason of the issuance thereof.

(a) The Issuing and Paying Agent and any successor Issuing and Paying Agent shall perform the duties and obligations imposed on it hereunder and under the Issuing and Paying Agency Agreement. The Issuing and Paying Agent may be removed by the University at any time by notice to the Issuing and Paying Agent and the Dealer or may resign in accordance with the terms of the Issuing and Paying Agency Agreement. Upon the resignation or removal of the Issuing and Paying Agent, the University shall appoint a substitute Issuing and Paying Agent.

(b) The Dealer and any successor Dealer shall perform the duties and obligations imposed on it hereunder and under the Dealer Agreement. The Dealer may be removed at any time by the University by notice to the Dealer and the Issuing and Paying Agent or may resign in accordance with the terms of the Dealer Agreement. Upon the resignation or removal of the Dealer, the University shall appoint a substitute Dealer.

(c) Within 15 days of the resignation or removal of the Dealer or the Issuing and Paying Agent or the appointment of a successor Dealer or Issuing and Paying Agent, the University shall mail notice thereof to the Noteholders and to each of the Rating Agencies.

Any notice, demand, direction, request or other instrument authorized or required by this Resolution to be given to or filed with the University, the Issuing and Paying Agent, or the Custodian shall be deemed to have been sufficiently given or filed for all purposes of this Resolution if and when sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested:

If, because of the temporary or permanent suspension of publication of any newspaper or financial journal or suspension of the mails or for any other reason, the University, the Board or the Custodian shall be unable to give any notice required to be published or mailed by the provisions of this Resolution, the University, the Board or the Custodian, as the case may be, shall give such notice in such other manner as in the judgment of the Board or the Custodian shall most effectively approximate such publication thereof, and the giving of such notice in such manner shall for all purposes of this Resolution be deemed to be compliance with the requirement for the publication thereof.

In case any one or more of the provisions of this Resolution or of the Notes issued hereunder shall for any reason be held to be illegal or invalid, such illegality or invalidity shall not affect any other provision of this Resolution or of the Notes, but this Resolution and the Notes shall be construed and enforced as if such illegal or invalid provision had not been contained therein. In case any covenant, stipulation, obligation or agreement contained in the Notes or in this Resolution shall for any reason be held to be in violation of law, then such covenant, stipulation, obligation or agreement shall be deemed to be the covenant, stipulation, obligation or agreement of the University to the full extent permitted by law.

This Resolution is adopted with the intent that the laws of the Commonwealth shall govern its construction.

(a) The Executive Committee of the Board is authorized to make any amendments or supplements hereto.

(b) The University's Chief Operating Officer may authorize any revisions to this Resolution which are not in conflict with the Board of Visitors resolutions adopted on January 31, 2003, June 11, 2005, and February \_\_, 2007, or any future resolutions by the Board of Visitors with respect to the Notes or the commercial paper program, as shall be necessary to accurately reflect negotiations among the University, the Issuing and Paying Agent, Moody's, S&P, Fitch and the Dealer, with respect to the Notes and the financing of the Projects, to facilitate a new Program and/or new Program Issuance Date, and to make other changes to the form, terms and provisions of the Programs and the Notes; provided, however, that no such change shall increase the principal amount of any outstanding Notes beyond the Maximum Authorized Principal Amount. The University's Chief Operating Officer is also authorized to negotiate, execute and deliver, in necessary and appropriate form, Offering Memoranda or Memorandums relating to the offering of the Notes for sale, and such other documents and instruments as he deems necessary or appropriate in connection with the issuance of the Notes, including without limitation any interest rate swaps or other hedge mechanisms and any dedicated line of credit, standby bond purchase agreement or other liquidity facility related to the Notes, including any Liquidity Facility, so long as such documents and instruments do not conflict with the intent of this Resolution.

All directors, officers and employees of the University are hereby authorized to take all actions necessary to accomplish the delivery of the Notes to purchasers thereof.

Any prior resolutions or provisions of resolutions of the Board inconsistent with any provisions of this Resolution are hereby repealed.

In the absence of negligence or willful misconduct on its part, the Issuing and Paying Agent may conclusively rely, as to the truth and correctness of the statements and the correctness of opinions expressed therein, upon any written or electronically transmitted communication, notice, direction or other documents furnished to the Issuing and Paying Agent pursuant to the Resolution that it reasonably believes to be genuine and correct and to have been signed or sent by the proper person or, when determined necessary in its reasonable discretion, upon the written opinion of any attorney or opinion or certification of an expert believed by it to be qualified in relation to the subject matter, and the Issuing and Paying Agent shall not be under any duty to make any investigation or inquiry as to statements contained in or matters referred to in any such instrument.
