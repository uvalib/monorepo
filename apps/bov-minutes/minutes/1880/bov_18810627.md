The Board of Visitors met in annual session at the University this day. Present: Alex. H. H. Stuart, Rector, John Goode, Jr., W. C. N. Randolph, Jno. L. Marye & John F. Lay:

Jas. D. Jones, the Secretary of the Board, being too unwell to attend, C. D. Fishburne was appointed Secretary, pro tem and a quorum being present, on motion it was resolved that the Secretary shall notify the Faculty that the Board is in session and ready to consider any communication from the Chn. of the Faculty.

Pursuant to the last resolution, Dr. Jas. F. Harrison Chairman of the Faculty, being notified appeared in person and presented reports. He presented also a petition from a committee of Students requesting the use of the Library for the morning "Germans" during the Commencement week, whereupon, on motion of Mr. Lay:

Resolved that the action of the Board in June 1880 denying to the students the use of the Library for the "German" during the Commencement week (see page 70) be rescinded and Dr. Harrison, being present, was requested to inform the students of this action.

The Rector read to the Board the following letter which on motion was ordered to be spread on the Records and is as follows:

I have regretted that I was not able to attend the late meeting of the Mining Engineers in Staunton, as besides the interest of the occasion to which you kindly lent your aid, and the opportunity of seeing you, one of the very few survivors of my old Wm. & Mary Comrades & friends, I should have had the pleasure of speaking to you of University affairs & especially about the work which Prof. Fontaine is doing for the credit of his Department.

Until my visit to the Univy last April I had not known Prof. Fontaine personally, though somewhat cognizant of his scientific work, through his published papers & my correspondence with him, all of which had impressed me most favorably. From my intercourse with him on that occasion & the exhibition he made to me of the results of his more recent scientific labours, I was more than confirmed in the high opinion I had previously formed of his solid abilities as a scientific worker & I became more than ever assured of the benefits which his labours would confer upon his Department & upon the community.

Prof. Fontaine's extreme modesty & retiring habits might perhaps lead a stranger to a false impression as to his merits; but no one interested in his pursuits could hold conversation with him, without recognizing the quiet enthusiasm & the true spirit of the Naturalist.

In examining the extensive work on the fossil plants &c of the Virginia Mesozoic Rock (the middle & upper Secondary of My Reports) which he kindly submitted to my inspection, I was greatly impressed by the critical nicety of his observations and the beauty & faithfulness of his drawings of the objects, described, a large number of which are of his own discovery. I am sure that this forthcoming memoir while adding to the reputation he already acquired in this Department of Geology will reflect credit on the University.

From all that I have seen I feel persuaded that with due encouragement his department is destined to secure increasing favour with the students & with the public, & to vindicate more & more the wisdom of its establishment in the University.

With Kindest remembrances, believe me dear Sir.

To Honl. A. H. H. Stuart

A letter was read from Prof. F. H. Smith requesting permission to extend his absence from the Uy. on a visit to Europe till the 20 Octo. next: whereupon, on motion:

The Board cordially extends to Prof. Smith a leave of absence till 20 October 1881.

The Report of the Chm of Faculty is as follows:

Herewith I respectfully transmit reports &c as follows, viz:

1. Faculty Report.

2. Proctor's Reports.

3. Report of Commissioner of accounts.

4. Report of Prof. of the School of Geology &c.

5. Report of the Infirmary Board.

Tables of salaries.

It is gratifying to report that the discipline of the University has been good. The students, as a rule, have been studious: and an excellent condition of health has prevailed among them: Some dissatisfaction has been expressed by a large number of them on the ground of their not being able to enjoy the privileges of changing, at least at the end of a quarter, from one boarding house to another, owing to the fact that such change renders it necessary for them to make an entire removal of their furniture, etc. after having gone to some expence, and having taken in many cases, a good deal of pains to make their rooms neat and comfortable for the session: and further they say that inasmuch as all the rooms are occupied and most of them have been fitted up as stated above, for the term, they are virtually deprived of the privilege to change their place of boarding under the existing rule. I would respectfully ask if the Secretary to the Faculty, a position now held by the Asst Librarian - is entitled to compensation? There was an allowance of four hundred Dollars, some years since, for the duties of the position.

The Report of the Infirmary Board dated 22 June 1881 signed by Drs. Cabell, Davis, & Harrison, shows receipts for fiscal year ending 31 May 1881 $2881.95 and expenditures $2164.55 leaving Bal. in hand $717.40 and contains the following suggestion, viz. "Of the balance of funds on hand it will be desirable to expend about one hundred or one hundred & fifty dollars for new furniture. It is proposed to invest the surplus in interest bearing securities to be approved by the Executive Committee, in accordance with an order of the Board."

On motion of Mr. Lay this was received and approved.

On motion of Mr. Goode- resolved that:

The subjects attended to in the Report of the Chairman of the Faculty be referred to their appropriate standing Committees for investigation & consideration.

On motion of Dr. Randolph-

Resolved that the Finance Committee be directed to examine and verify the bonds bought by the Proctor with the sinking Fund and that they are hereby authorized to destroy the same if found correct.

Mr. Conrad appeared and reputed [reported?] before adjournment.

On motion the Board adjourned to meet tomorrow, the 28th, at 9 O'clock A.M.

Alex. H. H. Stuart Rector

C. D. Fishburne Secy pro tem.

28 June 1881.

Board met pursuant to the adjourning order of yesterday. Present: Alex. H. H. Stuart, Rector: & Messrs. Goode, Marye, Conrad, Lay & Randolph.

On motion - resolved:

That the Proctor be directed to purchase for the rooms in the Infirmary used by members of the Board, suitable drining [drinking?] glasses.

On motion

Resolved that the Board approve the recommendation of Prof. Fontaine contained in his communication bearing date June 28 1881 and that, in addition to the unexpended balance heretofore appropriated to defray the expences of his Geological examinations, a sum not exceeding $400. (Four Hundred Dollars) is hereby appropriated for the purchase of a wagon, tents and for other necessary expence incurred by surveying parties in the field. also- Resolved that permission is hereby given to Prof. Fontaine to use the basement end-room in the Museum next to the Rotunda for the exhibition of Mineral specimens: and that the same shall be fitted up by the Proctor (under the supervision of Prof. Fontaine) with cases to hold these specimens as they may be accumulated.

On motion, resolved:

That the Finance Committee, be directed to appropriate Four Thousand Dollars ($4000) to the sinking fund- in pursuance of the recommendation made by the Proctor in his Report.

On motion, resolved:

That the Faculty is requested to appoint a committee of the Faculty to confer with the Board of Visitors on Wednesday at 10 A.M. in regard to the matter of determining what shall be the relations of the School of Nat. Hist: & Geology to the Master's Degree- also:

In reference to the recommendation of the Faculty in reference to instruction in Botany- and a change in the name of the School of Zoology, Agricultural Botany, & Agriculture: and as to assistance in the Schools of Greek & Mathematics.

Board then adjourned, in order to give time to the Committees to prepare their reports- till tomorrow morning at 9 O'clock.

Alex. H. H. Stuart Rector

C. D. Fishburne Secy pro tem.

29 June 1881

Board met pursuant to adjournment of yesterday. Present: Mr. Stuart, Rector and Messrs Conrad, Lay, Randolph, Whitehead & Marye.

On motion:

Resolved that the recommendation of the Faculty that, for the present, the graduates in Geology & Mineralogy, subjects taught in the School of Natural History and Geology, not studying Botany - be entitled to diplomas as Graduates in Geology & Mineralogy, is approved and that they be authorized to issue the same as recommended.

On motion:

Resolved (pursuant to the recommendation of the Faculty) that the School heretofore known as the School of Zoology, Agricultural Botany and Agriculture, be hereafter known as the "School of Agriculture, Zoology and Agricultural Botany: and as each of the subjects herein named is taught in a separate course, a certificate of Proficiency shall be granted to successful students in each.

The Board having had in consideration the relation which the School of Natural History & Geology should bear to the attainment of the degree of Master of Arts and a Committee of the Faculty, having by invitation of the Board, expressed its views on this subject in the following recommendation, presented by Professors Mallet, Price & Page - to wit:

"Resolved that we recommend,

1st That the Degree of Bot. as at present organized be made necessary to the attainment of the degree of M.A.

"2nd That, in order to bring the School of Nat: Hist: & Geology within the range of the Master's degree, graduation in that school be admitted as a substitute for graduation in Hist. & Lit. or in Chemistry, or in Natural Philosophy or in Moral Philosophy.

"In respect of the 1st recommendation, the action of the Committee is without definite instructions from the Faculty and we would therefore ask to have an opinion, if approved by the Board, referred back to the Faculty.

Whereupon, & on motion:

The Board do order,

1st That, in order to bring the School of Natural History and Geology within the range of the Master's degree, graduation in that School be admitted as a substitute for graduation in History & Literature, or in Natural Philosophy or in Moral Philosophy and,

2nd That the attainment of the degree of Bachelor of Arts as at present organized, be made necessary to the Degree of Master of Arts.

The "Miller Board", through a Committee, presented to the Board a Report of Messes Minor & Barbour and a Supplement by Mr. B. J. Barbour, which gave the results of their visit to Agricultural Colleges in some of the Northern States and in Canada- which Reports were read by the Board.

The society of Alumni, through a committee, of which Col. C. S. Venable was Chairman, presented to the Board the following communication.

The Society of the Alumni of the University of Virginia, to the Rector & Board of Visitors, Greeting:

We have the honour to turn over to the Board of Visitors the funds collected for the endowment of the Professorship and Working fund of the Leander McCormick Observatory with the following conditions:

1st That the Rector and Board of Visitors shall pay out of the funds of the University the sum of Two thousand Dollars ($2000) to the expense fund of the collection.

2nd That the Rector & Board of Visitors of the University shall provide a house for the Director of the Observatory (Professor of Astronomy).

3rd That Mr. Leander J. McCormick shall have the privilege of nominating the first Professor (Director) for the consideration of the Board.

We beg leave to make the following statement of the whole matter:

Through the kindness of Mr. W. H. Vanderbilt who has consented that his munificent gift of twenty five thousand dollars may be applied as is thought best for the interests of the University. The fund for the endowment will stand thus:

Mr. Leander J. McCormick in addition to his splendid gift of the Great Telescope has pledged himself to build the Observatory at a cost not exceeding Eighteen thousand dollars ($18,000.)

The Society of the Alumni propose that as an appropriate and graceful recognition of Mr. McCormick's generous munificence the Observatory shall always be styled the "Leander McCormick Observatory" and that this be carved in marble over its entrance.

The Society proposed also that the noble contribution of Mr. Wm. H. Vanderbilt be kept as a distinctive and separate working fund, known as the "W. H. Vanderbilt endowment."

We would request also that the Rector & Board of Visitors shall have prepared a handsomely embossed roll of the names of the contributors of the larger amounts to the $50,000 fund to be hung in a suitable place in the Library.

Another condition is imposed upon the gift in accordance with the earnest desire of Mr. McCormick to promote active astronomival work by his foundation- and that is, that the Director of the Observatory (Professor of Astronomy) shall have no teaching to do in the University, except in Practical & Theoretical Astronomy.
