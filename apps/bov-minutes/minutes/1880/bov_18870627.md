The Executive Committee, through its chairman, Dr Randolph, submitted its annual report which reads as follows.

"University June 27th 1887

Report of Executive Committee to the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia

Gentlemen.

On the 15 of October 1886 the Executive Committee met at University.

In accordance with a resolution of the Board of Visitors, the faculty reported to the Executive Committee a plan for the establishment of a School of Pharmacy in the University which the Committee approved and adopted. The School has been established. Owing to the fact that it was begun after the session opened the attendance on it has been small. As it is one of the professional courses, the Committee fixed the fees to be paid by all students who pursue the course. The total fees in the school, if the whole course is taken in one year are $135.

The Faculty also submitted a plan for the establishment of a dispensary in Charlottesville, The plan met the approbation of the Committee and the dispensary has been established and proved a decided success both in the good results to the community and the students of medicine. The plan of work of both the School of Pharmacy and the dispensary are fully recorded in the proceedings of the Committee, to which the Board of Visitors are referred for any further information desired. At the suggestion of the Committee the Proctor has funded into 6% bonds payable at the option of the University the 8% bonds of the Corporation whose payment was at the pleasure of the University authorities.

The Proctor was also directed, if possible, to retire and cancel the bonds of the University held by the Miller Board for the sum of $10,000. advanced by that Board in construction of cases for the specimens in the Brooks Museum. This action was taken because the University does not justly owe this debt as it has been paid to the Miller Board, who in view of the advance to the University, paid this Corporation a lessened revenue yearly until the sum advanced was equalled.

The Committee desiring to prevent the presentation of Mills to the Board of Visitors for unauthorized expenditures by members of the Faculty and officers of the University, ordered that no expenditures of money be made on account of the University except such as shall be made by the Proctor upon the order of the Board of Visitors and that no individual shall be allowed to make any changes in property belonging to the Corporation except under the authority of the Proctor & with the approval of the Board of Visitors.

At the meeting of the Committee on the 13th of May, the bond of the Proctor, Major G. Peyton, in the sum of $20,000 was received examined and accepted. His surities are S. V. Southall & R. F. Mason. The bond of the Bank of Albemarle for the sum of $60,000 to protect the deposits of the University was received, examined and accepted, the surities in the bond are Messrs R. F. Mason, C. D. Fishburn, W. E. Norris, Jas B. Wood, R. H. Wood, L. T. Hanckel, S. V. Southall, G. Peyton, N. M. Page & Jas D. Jones, whose combined wealth is represented to be about $150,000. This bond is in due form & was authorized by the Stockholders of the Bank of Albemarle in regular meeting." (These two bonds are copied in the minute book of the Executive Committee)

"Dr Randolph Chairman of this Committee has with the consent of the Committee and upon the advice of the Rector Hon. A. H. H. Stuart and Professors Minor and Venable, given permission to Hon James W. Austin, who was the first Executor under the will of the late Arthur W. Austin to resume the executorship without security.

The Committee present with this report the letters of Hon. A. H. H. Stuart, Prof. Venable and copy of letter of Mr Austin.

In view of the fact that the law of the Board of Visitors stipulates that the professors shall be elected for one year when first elected, the committee suggest that Professors Towles and Dabney be now elected permanent professors of their respective schools, their terms of service to be at the pleasure of the Board.

The Committee suggest that the bond of the Bank of Albemarle for the security of the deposits of the funds of the University be kept by the Chairman of the Faculty.

The Executive Committee met pursuant to law at the University on 24th of June 1887.

They have received and examined the reports of the Faculty and Proctor which are to be commended for their clear and concise statement of the condition of the University.

The Committee call the especial attention of the Board to the information given in the Report of the Faculty concerning the number of students attending lectures in the University during the present and past sessions.

It is very apparent that the equipment here is greatly in excess of number of students, and that the usefulness of the University would be much promoted if the Board of Visitors, in its wisdom, is able to adopt any means of making known the merits of the institution to the large number of young men in the section of country tributary to the University. The Committee commend to the Board the suggestions of the Faculty with regard to renewed efforts for patronage from the States of Kentucky and West Virginia.

The Committee refer the Board to the reports of the Faculty and Proctor with regard to loss by fire of part of our Medical Hall.

The Committee has heard of no unusual occurrences of any kind during the past session worthy of report to the Board.

With a view to diminishing the work of the Board in its full meeting the committee have carefully read the Faculty report and submit herewith resolutions drawn to cover suggestions made by the Faculty about which there was no difference of opinion among the members of the Committee.

The recommendations of the Proctor are for the most part general in their character and are left to the consideration of the full Board.

Since the last meeting of the Board of Visitors Prof. Page has resigned the Professorship of the School of Agriculture etc and Professor Wheeler has resigned the Professorship of the School of Greek. The Committee regret to state that Professor Wheeler was forced to take this step owing to a failure of his health."

W. C. N. Randolph, Chairman Ex. Comee

Edwd C. Venable.

This report of the Executive Committee was read to the Board and after consideration of the same on motion.

Resolved, that the report of the Executive Committee dated June 27th 1887, is received, approved and adopted together with its recommendations.

Resolved, that the Secretary of this Board be requested to procure an official copy of the last will and testament of Arthur W. Austin decd, the expense thereof to be paid by the Proctor.

Resolved, that the Executive Committee be instructed to inquire into and ascertain through counsel, or otherwise, the best terms upon which the legacy bequeathed to the University by the late Arthur W. Austin may be commuted into money and reduced into possession, and that they report the same to the Board as early as possible.

Resolved, that the action of the Executive Committee in assenting to the resumption of the Trustee-ship of the Austin Estate by J. W. Austin, Esq without security is hereby confirmed, Mr Austin having been the trustee appointed by the will of the testator, his brother, and he having only surrendered it on account of bad health.

On motion the Board adjourned to meet tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock.

The Committee on Conduct of Schools and Examination of Students submitted the following report, which upon being read was on motion received, approved & adopted:

To the Rector & Board of Visitors of the University of Va

Gentlemen

Your Commee on Schools and the Conduct of Examinations of Students respectfully reports as follows.

We have carefully examined the written Statements of Eighteen (18) Professors as to the management of their respective chairs, the course of instruction afforded the students under their charge, the examinations had, the attendance of the Professors etc. and find, from this evidence, that the duties of the several Professors have been faithfully discharged, the work of the students satisfactorily done in the main, and the general success of the year encouraging.

The Report of Prof. Stone, Director of the Leander McCormick Observatory is an elaborate account of observations made by him, and contains a statement of publications emanating from his chair which are, doubtless, of great value to the scientific world.

In accordance with the request of Prof. Page, Your Committee suggests that some one be appointed to whom the property on the Experimental Farm may be delivered.

In order that the Board may form an intelligent idea of the proficiency of the students, and the scope and character of the instruction afforded by the several chairs, it is suggested that the members of the Faculty be requested to furnish to the Board hereafter at the annual meeting copies of the Final Examinations held by them said copies to be delivered in sealed envelopes, and, after inspection to be returned sealed-up, to the Several Professors.

We herewith return the several reports submitted to us.

Respectfully

W. C. N. Randolph Chairman

A written communication to the Board was received from Prof. James M. Garnett of this date relating to the conduct of the School of the English Language and Literature, whereupon,

On motion of Dr W. C. N. Randolph it was ordered that said communication be referred to a special committee to be appointed by the Rector.

The Rector appointed Messers Parrish, Randolph and Stuart as members of said committee.

The Special Committee raised to consider and report upon the communication of Professor Garnett made the following report.

University of Virginia

June 30th 1887

To the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia:

The Committee to which was referred the letter of Prof. James M. Garnett of this date in the following words and figures, to wit:

Having understood that your Hon. body is still unsatisfied as to the reconsideration of the resolution adopted with respect to the School of English, which reconsideration I requested in my statement already submitted, I have the honor to request that the matter be laid over until the next annual meeting of the Board, Within that time your Hon. body can examine more carefully into the objections made as to the conduct of the School, & I can have the opportunity of removing any that in your judgment, may really exist. In the mean time, I should be obliged for any suggestions as to change in the course of instruction, which I shall endeavor to carry out. I have in my statement indicated certain changes in the position of this school with respect to the degrees which would greatly benefit the school, if adopted by your Hon. body. I feel confident, that under such circumstances all objections would be satisfactorily removed.

I desire to say further that if, at the close of that time, these objections on the part of your Hon body still continue, & I am so officially informed, I shall place my resignation at your disposal, for I do not desire to hold a chair in any institution where, the authorities are dissatisfied with my conduct of it.
