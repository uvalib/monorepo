Chairman's Report.

"University of Va

June 26, 1884

To the Rector and Board of Visitors University of Virginia. Gentlemen:

Herewith I respectfully transmit the following:

1\. Report of the Faculty

2\. Report of the Proctor

3\. Report of the Librarian

4\. Report of Prof Fontaine

5\. Application of the Librarian

6\. Letter of Prof Schele

7\. Report of the Infirmary Board.

8\. Report of Prof J.R. Page with Inventory

9\. Report of Prof F.H. Smith

10\. Report of Prof O. Stone.

I have pleasure in saying that good discipline has been maintained during the session.

It is with regret that I state that two deaths have occurred among the students since October last, namely: Mr A.S. Doswell, of Virginia, a medical student, who died of peritonitis, and Mr. L.A. Antrim, of Virginia, an academic student, who died of fever. No death among the students here has taken place prior to these cases for a period of three years. This indicates a most healthy condition prevailing in and around the University.

I am, with great respect, James F. Harrison, Chairman of the Faculty."

The Reports etc. referred to in the above communication were respectively referred to their appropriate committees.

Resolved that the Committee on Finance be requested to ascertain the exact condition of the McCormick fund, showing the amount of money received and the whole amount expended, and for what purposes, and the Committee aforesaid is requested to report to this Board at the earliest practicable moment during its present session; and that the Rector of the University be requested to send a copy of the report of said Committee to L.J.

F. S. Blair

Hugh M. Taylor

Which said Report is hereby approved and adopted.

Resolved, That John W. Mallet, Professor of Chemistry, and Francis H.

Resolved that the Proctor be directed to have repairs to pavilion, No 9, recommended in Faculty Report, done by hiring workmen by the day and furnishing material for same.

Wm A. Winston, Secretary, is allowed to occupy Parker's Old house.

The following report is adopted;

The committee on Grounds and Buildings, to which was referred the selection of a site for the building of a Chapel on the University Grounds, beg leave to submit this as a supplemental report on the same subject. When the Committee was enlarged by the appointment of Colo Barbee, they again viewed the said grounds in company with Revd Mr. Glazebrook, Chaplain, and they have fixed on the site north of the Garth boarding-house, and near the pond in the lawn, as the most suitable and acceptable location on which to erect said Chapel. They are advised that this site is preferred by a large majority of those most deeply interested as the one most agreeable to the citizens, students and Faculty. It is of easy access to all, and with ordinary care can be built without injury to any of the University property. Your Committee, however, earnestly recommend that a watchful supervision to this end should be observed by the Chairman of the Faculty, the Proctor and the authorities of the University generally.

John W. Bell, for the

Chairman, himself etc

Adjourned till tomorrow.

Resolved that Jeff Randolph Taylor be declared the Commissioner of Accounts for the University of Va at a salary of $100, per annum, from July 1, 1884.

Resolved that the action of the Executive Committee of April 4, 1884, in suspending the order of the Board of Visitors of September 6, 1882, authorizing the Proctor and the Bursar to make deposits in the banks of Charlottesville with the written assent of their sureties is approved, and that said enactment of September 6, 1882, be hereby repealed.

Resolved that the action of the Executive Committee in putting the survey for an additional water supply in charge of E.W. Bowditch, Esqur, is hereby ratified.

Resolved that Prof Stone, and the Proctor, J.K. Campbell, are hereby appointed to examine Mount Jefferson, and determine and designate the land embracing the Leander McCormick Observatory, which it may be expedient to set aside for the perpetual and exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid Observatory.

Resolved that the Board of Health, with the concurrence of the Executive Committee, be authorized to have the proper gutters and spouts put on the University buildings.

Resolved that the estimated receipts having been made on the basis of 300 students, and the appropriations made on these estimates, it is hereby enacted that in case there be a deficit resulting from a less number of students, that this deficit shall be divided equally among the 17 professors receiving each $3000 salary.

The following report was adopted:

"The Committee on Grounds and Buildings, to which was referred that part of the Faculty Report, releting to the condition of the walls and roofs of the Chapel and the reading-room, beg leave to report that on examination of said structures, they find the same in very bad condition especially as to the roofs and walls. But in consequence of the low condition of our funds at this time, Your Committee feel constrained to be satisfied with the simple recommendation that the roof of both buildings be repaired with new shingles, that rops and braces be placed against the walls of both if required; and that such other cheap repairs, as are necessary, be promptly done under the superintendence of the proctor. Your Committee further recommends that the cost of these repairs be defrayed out of the appropriations for repairs and improvements the current year.

Respy Submitted,

John W. Bell

W. R. Ruffin Commee".

G. T. Barbee

Your Committee, to whom was referred that part of the Faculty Peport relating to the boarding of students, have had said matter under Consideration, and beg leave to recommend that the boarding of students be hereafter thrown open to general competition amongst all persons residing on the University grounds, or in its immelate vicinity, who may be able and willing to take boarders. But in no case shall students be permitted to board in any hotel in Charlottesville, o in any house unlicensed by the Faculty: That the present at the University be rented but by the Executive Committee, That each student may provide his own furniture and employ his own servant, and may board where he prefers, and at what price he may agree upon: That the business of the University shall extend only to the assignment to the Student of his room, and to such general supervision of the boarding-houses as is implied in licensing them. We further recommend that all persons who shall board any student or students occupying the dormitories of the University shall pay the following sum to wit: fifty-five and a half cents, per student, per month, and that the dormitories heretofore assigned to students in the mess and hotels be left to stand as they are, but the students may at the end of any month change their place of boarding without changing their rooms.
