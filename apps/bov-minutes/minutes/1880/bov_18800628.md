On motion the Board adjourned until tomorrow morning at 9 Oclock.

The Board met pursuant to adjournment on yesterday. Present all of the members of the Board, Messrs Bocock & Conrad having arrived since the adjournment on yesterday.

The annual Report of the Faculty was on motion taken from the table and read by the Secretary to the Board, whereupon Resolved, that the General Report of the Faculty be distributed among the several Committees of the Board according as the subjects therein contained fall more appropriately within the province of one or the other of said Committees, except that the recommendations in said report on the subject of the establishment of new degrees, and the modification of those now existing be referred to a special Committee of three to be appointed by the Rector, & that said special Committee be directed to make their report to the Board on tomorrow not later than four Oclock.

On motion the Board adjourned until tomorrow morning at 9 Oclock.

The Board met in pursuance of adjournment on yesterday. Present, all the members of the Board.

The Committee on Boarding Houses, to whom was referred on yesterday the Petition of Miss Ross' Boarders, submitted their Report as follows:

The Committee to whom was referred the questions arising under the Petition of Students with reference to a change of Boarding Houses, without a change of rooms, as was required by law- beg relave \[sic, probably leave, to report that they have given the subject careful advisement and consideration. They are satisfied that an evil exists, needing redressâ€”;but the mode of redress is surrounded with many difficulties. In the past a similar change has been made and not attended with good result. This Petition is too respectable in point of numbers and in names to be deemed captious, or without foundation in fact. The complete remedy seems to be to grant the prayer of the Petition, but at the same time to guard against the one evil, which also seems to be the difficulty. They recommend the passage of the following resolutions, viz-

Resolved, That the petition of the Students applying for leave to change their Boarding Houses, without change of Rooms appearing to be just, & without reasonable objection- the request of the same be accorded; and that the existing laws as to Boarding Houses, be so far modified, as hereafter to permit this change, without change of rooms. Provided, 1st That in each Boarding House the Students themselves shall select a President of the Mess, with two Vice Presidents, whose duty it shall be to receive complaints, &, in their discretion, notify the Boarding House Keeper; or forward the same to the Faculty fully empowered to preserve order and decorum, & who will obligate themselves, in cases of refusal to recognize their authority, to report the offending parties to the Authorities of the University, &

Resolved 2d That it be left in the discretion of the Faculty, at any time during the Session, if satisfied that this obligation of the Students is not carried out in good faith, to take such action as they may deem advisable, to the extent of reestablishing the present system.

Resolved, (3) As the opinion of this Board that the Boarding House Keepers shall, themselves in person, or by some proper representative, preside at each meal, & bring to the notice of these selected officers of the Mess any infractions or violations of order & decorum in their dining rooms. And in this connection the Board do not hesitate to avow their belief, & express the earnest hope, that no young Gentleman will so far forget the courtesies & proprieties of the Table, as to render the presence of a Lady at her Table, an unpleasant position, to her dignity, or to her modesty.

The Committee of Buildings & Grounds recommend that the Proctor be authorized to enlarge the Reservoir. That the slatted walk on the terraces be removed and a close plank walk put in its place.

The Buildings seem to be in good repair and the Grounds well kept, we would advise that the Proctor be requested to suggest some better and more sightly approach to the University than the present one.

The Committee on the Library report that they find the books well preserved, and the cases and furniture in good condition.

The removal of the partition which cut off one of the alcoves for an office, and the filling up of the space, has increased the accomodations for books, and imposed no practical inconvenience on the Librarian. No suggestions are made by the Report of the Librarian or the Faculty calling for any action of the Board at this time as to the Library. The lists furnished of the annual additions made to the Library for each of the four past years, through the means afforded by the Corcoran fund, show how timely and wise was this special gift of Mr. Corcoran among his other munificent provisions for the University

For two or three years past the young ladies & gentlemen attending the commencement exercises have occupied the Library during some hours of each day as a dancing hall. This use of the Room, during the daytime of Commencement week, is disapproved by many of the earnest and influential friends of the University, as incongruous & unseemly, and in the opinion of your Committee tends to create injurious misconceptions as to the judgment and aims of the Authorities controlling the Institution. The Committee, while making no suggestion of objection to the grant of the use of the Room for the dance and festival on the night of the final day of Commencement, deem it proper to ask the attention of the Board as to the use of the room for dancing or other social diversions at any other time.

The Committee on the Conduct of the Schools beg leave to make the following report-

In the school of Latin we recommend the appointment of an Assistant Instructor and approve the Professor's request to be allowed to establish a class for graduates and recommend that he be authorized to confer certificates on such students as have satisfactorily accomplished such work. In the report of the School of Modern Languages, Dr. Schele deplores the utter insufficient preparation in English of the Students of his class. The Prof. Hist. & Lit. says "The preparation of Students, especially in the Elementary studies of grammar, spelling, expression, geography & general information and capacity for thought seems to become more every year."

Your Committee have urged the necessity of the establishing a Chair of English in a previous report; they be leave to call attention to it again and have quoted from the two reports of modern Languages & Hist. & Lit. as evidence of the growing need of such a chair.

The Prof. of Natural Philosophy reports no students in the Class of practical physics and states the cause to be probably the makeshift character of the arrangements of room and fixtures, the inconveniences of which he deems a great bar to its usefulness and popularity. We recommend a thorough equipment for this school as soon as the finances of the University will permit.

We advise that in accordance with the recommendation of the Faculty the Janitor be ordered to attend the Natural Philosophy room on Tuesdays, thursdays & Saturdays from 10 to 11 A.M.

The form of class report forwarded by the Faculty we think should be adopted, as it furnishes fully the information needed.

We advise that Mr. Charles I. Bonner whose application to be authorized to stand his examination for his degree in the Department of law be permitted to stand such examination after the termination of the session.

We recommend that the fee in the class of Practical Physics be fixed at $50 with a charge of $5 for outfit of apparatus. As advised by the Faculty we recommend that the privilege be extended to any student of the University of attending the class of surveying under the Instruction of Prof. Thornton (established by the Faculty during the last Session for Students in the School of pure Mathematics) on the payment of three dollars for use of instruments, provided Prof. Thornton be not required to form a class unless a sufficient number of applicants present themselves to justify it.

We approve of the establishment of the Degree of Bachelor of Scientific Agriculture and advise such action by the Board. And also advise the establishment of the Degrees in the School of Nat. Hist. & Geology proposed by the Faculty. Resolutions confirming the expulsions of Messrs John S. Spencer of Gallipoli, Ohio, and A. N. Towle of Mobile Ala. are herewith forwarded. We advise the confirmation of the action of the Executive Committee in approving the plan as adopted by the Faculty of so arranging the curriculum for the Medical School as to cover two full sessions. The Committee attach much importance to the suggestion and recommendation of the Faculty referring to the tendency to idleness extravigance and dissipation from the unlimited supply of pocket money to Students & the failure on the part of parents or guardians to note and act upon the information given in the monthly reports and they authorize the Faculty with the Express Sanction of this Board to issue a Circular setting forth these Acts in emphatic terms & urging the cooperation of parents & guardians in the effort to suppress them.

At a meeting of the Board of Trustees of the Miller Fund of the University of Va., the following resolution was adopted-

Resolved, That this Board feels itself constrained to declare its conviction that, so far, the Agricultural School of the University of Virginia has fallen far short of the purposes of its beneficent Donor, and of the legitimate hopes and expectations of its friends, and that without some marked change, within the next twelve months, both in the material results, and in the number of Students attending the said School this Board will feel itself obliged (to the extent of its legitimate authority) and in cooperation with the Board of Visitors of the University of Va.) to make a radical change in the whole management to the end that the original purpose of the School may be accomplished.

Resolved, that the Secretary be instructed to send a copy of the above Resolution to the Board of Visitors of the University of Va.

The Board met pursuant to adjournment on yesterday. Present, all the members of the board, with the exception of Mr. Gilmore who had left for home.

Whereas the Miller Board of Trustees have agreed to depart from their own construction of the Scholarship rule in the Agricultural School as laid down by them, and under the peculiar circumstances attending the case of Mr. Frank Hampton of the University of Va. who had applied for a Scholarship and had successfully passed the required examination.

Resolved, That the Board of Visitors, without committing themselves to the construction as claimed, but consenting that this case shall not be used as a precedent, do order (that Miller Board consenting as they have done) that Mr. Hampton shall take the scholarship- he having passed the necessary examination.

Resolved, that the Faculty be directed, in carrying out the action of this Board respecting the "Miller Scholarship" had on yesterday, to subject applicants to the ordinary examination required of all students desiring to matriculate in the Schools of the University, and that in advertising for such competitive examination, the exact language of the resolution of the Miller Trustees shall be followed.

Resolved, that the Hon. T. L. Bocock be requested and authorized to prepare and forward letters of thanks to Mr. Corcoran, Mr. Vanderbilt & other persons, contributors. to the University and to furnish copies of the same to the Secretary of this Board for record.

Major Green Peyton laid before the Board his Official Bond as Proctor &c, on motion Resolved, That the official Bond tendered by Green Peyton with S. V. Southall as surety be approved and accepted and spread upon the record which Bond reads as follows:

Know all men by these presents that, we, Green Peyton and S. V. Southall are held and firmly bound unto the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia and their successors in office, in the sum of Twenty Thousand Dollars, lawful money of the United States, to be paid to the said Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia and their successors in office; for the payment whereof well and truly to be made, we bind ourselves jointly and severally, firmly by these presents. Sealed with our seals and dated the 29th day of June in the year One thousand Eight hundred and Eighty. The condition of the above Obligation is such that, whereas the above bound Green Peyton has been duly elected Proctor and Superintendent of Grounds and Buildings of the University of Virginia: Now therefore if the above bound Green Peyton shall well and truly and faithfully discharge and perform all the duties devolved upon him as such officer, then the foregoing obligation shall be void, otherwise to remain in full force and virtue.
