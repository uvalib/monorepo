The Board of Visitors met this the 11th of July 1888 pursuant to adjournment on the 27th inst.

Present. Hon. J. L. Marye, Rector, Randolph, Stuart, Bolling, Gordon, McCabe and Watts.

The Rector called the Board to order.

The subject of employing an Instructor in gymnastics was considered, whereupon on motion it was

Resolved, that the present financial condition of the University renders it inexpedient for the Board of Visitors to guarantee any salary to an Instructor of Gymnastics or to make any further appropriation to the Gymnasium.

Resolved, that, the Committee on finance be requested to visit the Proctor and examine and report to the Board what bonds and other evidences of debt due the University are in his hands and what indebtedness has been discharged by him in the last year and cancel all such evidences of indebtedness so paid off.

The Rector announced that the Miller Board was in session for the purpose of considering the nomination to this Board of a Professor of Biology and Agriculture in the Department of Experimental and Practical Agriculture and suggested the appointment of a Committee to wait upon that Board and inform them of the readiness of this Board to receive any communication from them they may wish to submit, whereupon on motion, Judge Bolling was appointed a Committee of one to convey this information to the Miller Board, who thereupon retired for that purpose and soon returned after having reported to the Miller Board as requested, and stated that he was requested by that Board to announce, that they would, in a very short time, report the result of their deliberations to this Board.

In a few minutes a Committee of the Miller Board appeared and announced the nomination of Profr Albert H. Tuttle of the State University of Ohio, for said professorship, by said Board, and submitted for the consideration of this Board, along with their nomination, the testimonials of the qualifications of Profr Tuttle which had been carefully read and weighed by them, before arriving at their decision.

The Committee then retired, and on motion, the Board proceeded to consider the nomination of Profr Tuttle and after reading the testimonials submitted by the Committee, it was moved and seconded, that the Board proceed to a vote on the nomination which was ordered and resulted unanimously in favor of the nominee, Profr Albert H. Tuttle.

On motion, the Secretary was instructed to notify Profr Tuttle of his election, and to request him to attend here, on the 25th inst. to be present at the meetings of the Miller Board, and of the Executive Committee of this Board, as agreed upon

On motion the Board adjourned to meet to-morrow at 9 1/2 A. M.

The Board met in pursuance of adjournment on yesterday.

Present. The same members as on yesterday, and Major Conrad in addition.

The Committee on Library, & Apparatus submitted its report of which the following is a copy:

To the Rector & Visitors,

Your Committee appointed to examine the condition of the Library etc., report that they have made the examination. A large and convenient space in the Library is now filled with books very rarely, if ever called for, â€”;Such as Congressional Reports, old magazines etc., to the exclusion of books of general interest which are much more frequently used, and which should, in the opinion of Your Committee be given the room now occupied by the vast amount of books which nobody ever reads. It seems to Your Committee to be advisable to remove these unused books to one of the unoccupied rooms of the University, so that the space now filled with them can be made available for the Austin Library, one of the most attractive collections in the Library, and for other books of general interest which may be added from year to year.

Your Committee are of opinion that the arrangement of the books is not convenient and would suggest, that they should be arranged according to subjects, which has not been done, except to a very limited extent, by such a rearrangement and the removal of the Congressional records, which merely cumber the shelves, much valuable space could be saved, which is very important because of the very limited unoccupied space. They therefore recommend that these books be removed from the Library, and if it is impracticable to provide shelves for them in one of the unoccupied rooms, then the [they?] recommend that they be bosed up and catalogued and the boxes proper [ly?] labeled.

In reply to the request of various parties to open a thoroughfare from the Lynchburg road through the grounds of the University of Va, I beg leave to recommend that the East Range Road be extended to said Lynchburg road for public use temporarily. Such road to be closed at any period when it may be deemed by the Board or the Superintendent of Grounds & Buildings to be detrimental to the interests of the University.
