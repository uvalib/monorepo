The Committee on "Conduct of Schools" made the following report: To the Rector and Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia. The Committee on "Conduct of Schools" report.

1. Each Professor furnished a full annual special School Report showing number of students in his class, attendance, lectures, examinations, and the results thereof; and we congratulate the faculty and the board on the showing for the session just terminated. The health, the orderly conduct, and studious habits and high grade of attainment are unsurpassed by any former session.

2. The Professor of History, Literature and Rhetoric, Mr. Holmes, however reports "The preparation continues to be unsatisfactory. There is ignorance of Grammar, Spelling, Geography, and matters of ordinary information." Your Committee think that whilst much of this condition is due to the nature of this Institution in allowing free selection of schools by the student, and the consequent absence of a regular curriculum of studies, and cannot be wholly remedied; yet the proposed establishment of a Chair of English must require and encourage, not only in the University itself, but in the numerous Common Schools which feed the University such a study of English as will very greatly mitigate the condition complained of by the professor.

3. Prof. Holmes needs Wall Maps, Chronological Charts and Synoptical Tables; and a specially appropriated Lecture Room. Prof. Schele de Vere desires re-arrangement of the schedule of Lectures so as to give to him longer time for his classes. Prof. Dunnington reports that the special courses given for Medical Students should be at $15.00 instead of $20.00 by reason of their brevity. Dr. Peters recommends the creation of "Jefferson Fellowships" of $350.00 or $400.00, each, as encouragement of work in the Post Graduate courses. Dr. Cabell calls attention to the New Rule made two years ago, by which a graded course for Medical Students was substituted for the previous rule, which, he says, has operated disadvantageously for the numerical prosperity of the School without any compensating beneift, and recommends its suspension. The Rule having been adopted on the recommendation of the Faculty in the hope that Medical Students would be induced to attend two sessions in succession. Prof. Smith complains that the roof of his room for Practical Physics leaks, and should be repaired at once. Prof. Page of the School of Agriculture, Zoology and Botany reports only Five (5) as the number of his class in Agriculture and Zoology, and Sixteen (16) in Botany; and two graduates as B.A.A. Your Committee recommend that sufficient appropriations be made to supply the demands aforesaid, but is assured that the usual appropriations made to the Schools above-named will suffice to answer the purpose. Your committee also recommend that the New Rule be suspended till further order.

4. Previous Committees on "Conduct of Schools" have reported in favor of the establishment of a School of English; and attention is especially called to the Report of the Committee on "The Conduct of Schools," made in June, 1878, which makes a strong recommendation for the establishment of such School.

5. Appropriate resolutions are recommended to carry into effect the propositions hereinbefore made.

On recommendation of said committee the following resolution was adopted:

1. Resolved, That the same appropriations which were made by this Board for the year 1881-82 be repeated and made again for the year 1882-83, or so much of said amount as may be necessary for the purchase of necessary apparatus and furniture for the department of Prof. Holmes; and for repairs to the roof of Prof. Smith's lecture-room.

2. Resolved, That in accordance with the recommendation of Prof. Dunnington the Fee for Special Courses given for Medical Students should be only $15.00, and not $20.00 as heretofore required, on account of the brevity of said courses.

3. Resolved on the recommendation of Prof. Cabell that the New Rule made two years ago (whereby a graded course for Medical Students was substituted for the previous Rule) be suspended, the New Rule having been, in the opinion of Dr. Cabell, of disadvantageous operation without any compensating benefit.

Resolved, That A. H. Cleaveland be allowed the sum of $25.00 for his services as Secretary, pro tem. to the Board of Visitors at this session, June 26, 1882, and that the same be paid to him by the Proctor.

A Report from the Committee appointed to consider the expediency of establishing a School of English was made, received and approved, and is as follows:

To the Rector and Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia: The undersigned Committee, appointed to consider the expediency of establishing a School of English in this University and the ways and means of so doing, respectfully report: It is too late now to say a word as to the desirability, the advantage and the necessity of establishing said School. In fact this Board and the Faculty have repeatedly expressed themselves in favor of the establishment of such school; and the Rector of the University in the last report emphatically recommended it. It only remains that practical action be taken at once in the premises. There are sufficient means at the command of this Board to establish and defray the expenses of this School; and if there be not, this Board cannot doubt that the General Assembly of Virginia will promptly appropriate any needed sum for this purpose, as all over the State from every reliable source there has come up to this Committee strong expressions of the will and desire of the people that such School be established and that it be adequately supported.

This Committee recommend that in the course prescribed for the degree of Master of Arts of this Institution, a diploma as graduate in the School of English be regarded and taken as one of the two Modern Languages, graduation in which is essential to the said degree. Respectfully but urgently recommending the said Chair of English - the course of instruction therein to be prescribed by the Faculty - the committee submit the foregoing.
