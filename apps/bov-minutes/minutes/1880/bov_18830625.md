They take great pleasure in reporting to the Board their high appreciation of the manner in which all things seem to be done, and the general conduct of the Librarian, officially and personally.

To the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia.

The Committee on conduct of Schools report:

1\. Each Professor furnished a full annual Report showing number of students in his class, attendance, lectures, examinations and the results thereof, and we congratulate the Faculty and the Visitors on the manifest for the session just ended. The sanitary condition, the demeanor, the proper habits, and the elevated status of attainment are unexcelled by any former session.

2\. Mr:Holmes, Professor of History, Literature and Rhetoric reports that the classes in his department are more intelligent and better prepared than heretofore in consequence of the withdrawal of nearly half the usual number to the study of English in the recently established School of Professor Garnett. He desires a special Lecture Room for the suspension of his Maps and Chronological Tables. He needs many additions to the Library for the recent innovations and expansions of Political Economy and Science of Society.

Professor Schele de Vere, of the School of Modern Languages, reports that matters in his department are prospering and improving. He occupies his Lecture Room on official business from 4 to 7 hours daily, and thinks that room should be specially dedicated to his School; and that a separate room should be given to Prof. Garnett, to whom as the Head of the School of English, no room has been specially assigned.

Professor Dunnington, of the School of Analytical and Agricultural Chemistry reports considerable improvement in the state of preparation on the part of students for the work of his several classes as compared with previous sessions.

Professor Peters, of the School of Latin, reports favorably.

Professor Cabell reports some improvement in the condition of the preparation of Students for the work of his class.

Professor Smith.

Professor Page, of the School of Zoology and Botany, reports an increase of interest in the subjects taught in his classes, but complains of the conflict of Lectures.

Professor Fontaine, of the School of Natural History and Geology, reports faithful attendance and study in his classes.

Professor J.S. Davis, of the School of Anatomy, has nothing special to report.

Professor Thornton, of the School of Applied Mathematics, reports on the part of students

Professor Venable, of the School of Mathematics, reports fully as to the matters pertaining to his school, and requests a leave of absence, made necessary by the state of his health; and if proper provisions are made to supply his performance of duties in his absence, this committee recommends that leave be granted Prof: Venable to absent himself from his professorship in this University for the period of one year.

This Committee feels especial interest in the Report of Professor Garnett, of the Chair of English, which was established one year ago under the Auspices of this Board as mainly now constituted. That Report shows that the design of the School is fully appreciated, and will grow to be an indispensable factor in the usefulness of the University. He needs additional books which are not particularized.

3\. Previous Committees on the Conduct of Schools have reported in favor of the establishment of a School of English.

This Committee recommended the establishment of the same - and it has been established - and the results have demonstrated the wisdom of the recommendation.

4\. We believe that no appropriations are necessary in order to carry out the recommendations of this Report, beyond the usual Library recommendations.

Present: Wyatt M. Elliott, Rector, and Mess: Ruggles, Fuffin, Bell and Lamb.

Whereas, the proposed ceremonies of the unveiling of the monument to Thomas Jefferson on 4" of July next, has been postponed:

Resolved, That the Executive Committee be requested to present to the Rector and Visitors at their meeting in September a programme for a National dedication of the Jefferson Monument at Monticello on the 4" of July, 1884.

Resolved, That the resolution of this Board with regard to printing and advertising, passed September 6, 1882, be and is hereby repealed so far as relates to the advertising, and that the advertising be done as prior to the passage of said resolution of September 6, 1882

Resolved, That the management and assignment of Lecture Rooms be controlled by the Faculty; and all enactments in conflict with this resolution are hereby repealed.

Resolved, That the Rector and Visitors hereby appoint the Chairman of the Faculty and Dr Cabell and Prof Venable a Committee to take such measures as they may deem advisable in order to give the widest publicity to the election of Professor of Chemistry in the University of Virginia on the 11" of next September; and to correspond extensively with the Scientists of this country and Europe on the subject - the object of the Board being to secure for the Chair of Chemistry the best and completest teacher to be found.

Resolved, That the eligibility of the Candidate for the Miller Post-Graduate Scholarship be hereafter left to the judgement of the Faculty.

Your Committee on apparatus have the honor to report, upon inspection of the same, and consideration of the report of Mr Stone, Prof of Astronomy and Director of the Leander McCormick Observatory, that the apparatus so far as obtained and in position at the Observatory is satisfactory.

Prof Smith, of the Chair of Natural Philosophy, reports that the apparatus for the proper teaching of the subjects of his School is wholly insufficient, and that the necessities of the school in that regard are pressing and great.

The apparatus in the Department of Chemistry is sufficient and in good order

It is recommended that such of Prof Mallet's chemical materials be bought as is suggested by Mr Dunnington.

The Faculty Report recommends the usual annual appropriation for the purchase and repair of apparatus Etc. in the Schools of Chemistry, Natural Philosophy and Astronomy.
