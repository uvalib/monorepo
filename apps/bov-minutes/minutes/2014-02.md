**Remembrance of Ernest Campbell “Boots” Mead**

**The Rector took a moment to remember Ernest Campbell “Boots” Mead, who passed away on February 13th at the age of 95. Mr. Mead was a professor of music, and best remembered for his devotion to university students. He was a valued mentor to many students over the more than four decades that he taught at the University. Grateful students established the Mead Endowment to honor Boots and to cultivate faculty-student engagement.**

**Mr. Mead retired in 1996, but continued to be active in the University community, teaching a seminar up until a year ago. He won the Thomas Jefferson Award in 1989, and many other university accolades and awards. He was a true University treasure, and he will be sorely missed.**

**Reporting Relationship and Supervisory Structure**

**Mr. Simon said it was the University’s practice to report on a supervisory relationship between spouses and University officers when both are employed by the University. He presented a resolution to the Board for Dr. Brandy Patterson who is the spouse of the Executive Vice President for Health Affairs Richard P. Shannon, M.D. He said this reporting structure would assure the absence of any, real or perceived, conflict of interest.**

**On motion, the Board adopted the following resolution approving the reporting relationship and supervisory structure for Brandy Patterson, M.D.:**

**Comments by the Rector**

**Rector Martin began his remarks by recognizing the impending retirement of Alexander “Sandy” Gilliam, who served as the secretary to this board for 18 years. He said Sandy now serves as the University’s History and Protocol Officer. Sandy’s knowledge of the University is unparalleled, and he is the go-to person for all questions about University history.**

**From a long line of U.Va. alumni, Sandy took his undergraduate degree from the College of Arts & Sciences in 1955, and returned to the University to work in 1975, following a career in the foreign service and in state government. At the University, he served as a special assistant to three presidents and as the protocol officer, most notably organizing the visit of Queen Elizabeth in 1976. Mr. Martin said he had no doubt Sandy will continue to stay involved in the life of the University after his retirement this spring.**

**Rector Martin reminded the Board of a mailing from the Association of Governing Boards about the annual meeting for trustees in April. He told Board members they could find the full agenda on the AGB website (www.agb.org/nct). He also encouraged them to contact Susan Harris if they wanted to attend.**

**Mr. Martin reminded the Board members of events in April, May, and June. In April, the University will celebrate Founder’s Day, Thomas Jefferson’s birthday, and every year there is a tree planting ceremony, lunch in the Dome Room, and conferring of the Thomas Jefferson medals. Because it falls on a Sunday this year, the events will be held on Friday, April 11th. Board members should receive an invitation in the mail in early March.**

**On April 22nd, The University of Virginia’s College at Wise will inaugurate Donna Price Henry as their chancellor. He said he knew many Board members have made plans to attend, and the Board Office is arranging transportation and lodging. There will also be a tuition meeting on the morning of the 23rd of April in Abingdon.**

**The annual retiring faculty dinner, hosted by the Board and the President, is scheduled for April 30th. Every year we honor our distinguished retiring faculty. Rector Martin said it is always a pleasure to converse with them and hoped many would be able to attend.**

**Final exercises are May 18th — he said we are pleased to have Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus as the keynote speaker. This is a special day for our graduating students and their families. Board members process down the lawn and sit on the dais with the president, vice presidents, deans, the chair of the Alumni Association Board of Managers, and the keynote speaker. The preceding day is valediction, and Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning will be the speaker for that event.**

**Mr. Martin said the spring regular board meeting this year will be June 5 and 6.**

**Comments by the Student Board Member**

**Mr. Blaze said it was nice to see ads around Grounds for student elections. He mentioned a publication that represents a synergy between faculty and students, the Seriatim Journal of American Politics.**

**Mr. Blaze said there was a sustained dialogue session called “Unpacking Privilege” encouraging students to be self-aware about their backgrounds as compared to others.**

**\- - - - - - - - -**

**Comments by the President**

**President Sullivan said Ray Mabus will be the commissioning officer for the ROTC cadets at Final Exercise weekend.**

**The President brought to the attention of the Board members a few reports that had been delivered both on February 20 and February 21. She said these reports touch on a variety of topics, but they all have a common denominator.**

**President Sullivan said the Special Committee on Strategic Planning heard from Don Brown, the director of our new Data Science Institute, which is already making significant progress. The Educational Policy Committee reviewed a resolution to establish the new M.S. in Data Science program within the Institute. Students are as eager as faculty and administrators to see the program launched; almost 90 applicants are already lined up. The Institute has developed research proposals for NIH and the Navy, and Mr. Brown’s team is discussing corporate collaborations with IBM, Amazon, Capital One, and other domestic and international partners.**

**The Special Committee on Strategic Planning also heard from Vice President for Human Resources Susan Carkeek about a new effort to promote staff excellence through the creation of a Center for Leadership Excellence. The goal is to foster a culture of leadership that permeates every level of the University. Career development, career-path planning, and succession development are key elements of this initiative.**

**She said the Student Affairs & Athletics Committee heard about efforts to improve U.Va.’s career services; this is one element of the Total Advising concept. Everette Fortner, who serves as the Darden School’s Executive Director for Professional Development, is “on loan” from Darden for one year to lead this effort. He is working with a newly formed Career Services Council made up of faculty, staff, students, alumni, parents, and employers who will help envision the next generation of career services at U.Va.**

**On a related note, the Educational Policy Committee heard from Vice Provost for Global Affairs Jeff Legro about a new Global Internships initiative. In this program, students will be placed in internships overseas or in globally-oriented companies in the U.S. that will give students the global awareness and cross-cultural skills they need for careers in the global economy. The Global Internships program held its first “interest meeting” to present internship opportunities to students this week.**

**In another session, the Advancement and Communications Committee heard from Alumni Association President Tom Faulders and Associate Vice President for Engagement Cindy Fredrick about efforts to boost alumni and parent engagement. One way to do this is through intellectual engagement that entails academic and professional-development programs that make the University the “lifelong university” for our alumni.**

**President Sullivan asked the question, “What do all these new programs and initiatives have in common?” She said each one is either the direct result of, or closely aligned with, the strategic plan — the Cornerstone Plan. She said at the November meeting, the Board voted to endorse the plan’s strategic drivers, or “pillars”. Riding that momentum, over the last few months the University has begun to flesh out strategies and put in place the structures that will bring the plan to life.**

**President Sullivan said to be successful, a strategic plan requires investment. The University recently announced a major gift from the private foundation of Jaffray Woodriff to support the Data Science Institute, and a challenge grant from Board member John Griffin to establish a new scholarship program. This program is for incoming students who have both exceptional promise and significant financial need, and this gift aligns with the strategy to make a University education affordable for the very best and brightest students, regardless of their financial situation.**

**She said a vision for the future, a plan of action, investment in our strategies - all of these pieces are falling into place just as we approach a significant moment in the University’s history. As we begin 2014, we are only three years from the start of the bicentennial celebration, which will span from October 2017 (bicentennial of the laying of U.Va.’s cornerstone) through 2019 (bicentennial of the General Assembly’s charter to establish UVa) to 2026, bicentennial of the ending of the first academic year. As we pass these milestones, we will embark on U.Va.’s third century of existence. In one sense, strategic planning is a business exercise, but in another sense, it’s a leap of the imagination. This planning effort has been a prolonged, collective effort by the entire community to envision the University’s future, as we stand on the cusp of its third century.**

**President Sullivan said the Cornerstone Plan has given the University a blueprint for U.Va.’s future; and now we are beginning to build that future. The President was pleased to report the significant progress the University is making. On a somewhat related note, she told the Board members about a conference that was held at the University last week. The purpose of this conference was to launch a national discussion about sexual misconduct on America’s college campuses. President Sullivan said she was pleased that Board member Allison Cryor DiNardo was able to attend the conference.**

**More than 250 student-affairs professionals, sexual violence experts, and students came together to share information and ideas on the complex issues related to sexual misconduct on America’s campuses. The presidents of UCLA, University of Montana, UNC-Chapel Hill, Dartmouth College, and Amherst College, participated in a two-hour Panel of Presidents, and the group heard from many students activists as well.**

**By addressing issues related to education, adjudication, and prevention, she said the hope is to develop solutions to counteract sexual misconduct among college students. Dartmouth is planning a follow-up conference to take place this July, so the conversation will continue.**

**President Sullivan said to notice that this conference also aligns with the strategic plan. She said leadership is a pervasive and over-arching theme in the Cornerstone Plan. This means individual leadership by students and by faculty and staff members in their respective fields, and it also means institutional leadership by the University on the national stage.**

**By virtue of last week’s conference, the University has now taken an assertive leadership role in addressing the troubling issue of sexual misconduct among college students. The University will be looking for similar opportunities to lead the national discourse on issues that matter to us, to our students, and to society generally.**

**The President informed the Board about an announcement the University made this week. The University has launched a search for a new vice president for digital initiatives. At the same time, Virginia Evans was appointed as chief information officer on a permanent basis; she has held this position on an interim basis since July. The President provided a little history and context on these decisions. Before James Hilton left last July, he was vice president and CIO, and Virginia served as associate vice president for IT Services. After Mr. Hilton left, a review committee was appointed to examine the current IT leadership model and to recommend potential changes. The review committee’s report determined that the University would be best served by a new model in which the CIO focuses on operational IT demands, while the vice president is responsible for developing and implementing IT strategy.**

**The President made it very clear that we are not expanding the number of administrators in Information Technology. Using the same number of people and the same number of positions, the University is realigning IT resources and functions to provide optimal support for the strategic priorities identified in the Cornerstone Plan.**

**She said this is another value of having a strategic plan in place: it provides a “litmus test” for every decision.**

**President Sullivan provided the Gifts and Grants Report.**

**Gifts and Grants Report**

**Summary of Fiscal Year-To-Date through Dec. 31, 2013**

**Faculty Senate Report**

**Dr. Chris Holstege, chair of the Faculty Senate, informed the Board that this would be the last meeting of the Board of Visitors that he would be attending in his role as chair, representing all 11 schools’ faculties. He said the next time the Board meets in Charlottesville will be in June, at which time Joe Garofalo will be taking over the reins as chair. As a Curry School faculty member, Mr. Garofalo brings a wealth of knowledge pertaining to education, especially with his expertise in the use of technology to enhance teaching and learning. He said the Board will find Mr. Garofalo he is a talented musician who plays electric blues guitar and bluegrass banjo - a musical talent he has passed on to his daughter - a University student and a member of the Cavalier Marching Band.**

**Dr. Holstege said on February 3rd of this month President Sullivan addressed the full Faculty Senate. She gave a rousing speech pertaining to the University’s future as envisioned by the new strategic plan, The Cornerstone Plan. He said this was put in the context of the University’s rich history and the upcoming bicentennial celebrations. As noted in her speech, the University has evolved from a small, regional school to one of the country’s best universities – one that has become increasingly diverse, increasingly research-orientated, and increasingly global. Two of the initiatives derived from the Strategic Plan were discussed in depth at the Faculty Senate meeting: Don Brown and Everette Fortner, representing data science and career advising respectively, joined President Sullivan that afternoon on the stage for open discussions with the faculty.**

**Dr. Holstege said under the priority of strengthening the residential-learning experience, one of the strategies is to develop a new, improved form of student advising that is being called Total Advising (as found under Pillar 1 of the Strategic Plan). Faculty are thoroughly committed to the student body and want to assure that they receive not only an outstanding educational experience, but also comprehensive advising throughout their course of studies. He said it was obvious during the Educational Policy Committee session yesterday, chaired by Dr. Steve Long, that the students presenting had extensive advising as they pursued various global studies abroad. Being a quality student advisor takes effort and skill. Dr. Holstege said his current work-study student who comes from the College of Arts & Sciences recently explained to him that, as an introvert, it was difficult at times to engage faculty directly in large classes. Susan Cain, in the book entitled Quiet, notes that at least one-third of the population are introverts. These students tend to prefer listening over speaking, reading as opposed to socializing, and innovating as opposed to self-promotion. He said we need to draw these students out in classes and in advising. This involves skill. Archie Holmes, a respected faculty member from the School of Engineering and Applied Science, has recently assumed the position of Associate Provost, and he will be leading efforts with other faculty representatives to examine how to best enhance student advising, specifically pertaining to the role of the faculty.**

**Dr. Holstege said another initiative that was discussed in depth was the Data Science Institute, led by Don Brown. The Faculty Senate Academic Affairs Committee has been diligently working with Professor Brown’s team and recently approved two new degree programs: Masters of Science in Statistics with Data Science Concentration; Masters of Science in Data Science. The Faculty Senate unanimously voiced support for these new programs, the Educational Policy Committee voted to approve them, and now the full Board will be voting shortly to approve. He said he was a bit bemused when a comment was made alluding to faculty resistance to changing curricula and various course offerings. He said there may be some truth to that at times, but he assured the Board that such changes are constantly occurring, as the Data Science Institute exemplifies.**

**So how will this new Strategic Plan impact the university, faculty and students? Dr. Holstege gave one personal example. He said he has assumed the role of Interim Executive Director of Student Health. He said Student Health’s medical database is different than the University Health System’s database. In essence, there are four large databases that hold information regarding students: the Health System’s electronic medical record known as Epic, the Health System registration database known as A2K3, the Elson Student Health Center’s electronic medical record known as Medicat, and the University’s database known as the Student Information System. It is part of the job as committed health care providers caring for students to follow trends in their health and wellness. Recently, an Institutional Review Board approved blinded data set (in essence “Big Data”) that will combine these four large databases to enable further tracking injury and illness within the student body. With the creation of the Data Science Institute, there is a university entity where faculty can more easily dialogue with colleagues from other disciplines and improve on such data sets existing at the University. In this specific example, the goal of improving the health and welfare of students living within this residential community (such activity falls under Pillar 1 & 2 of the Strategic Plan). This initiative will also enable improving the organizational connectivity, furthering Pillar 5 - “Organizational Excellence”. With such large accessible datasets, employment for multiple UVA work study students focusing on specific research projects will be provided. Such employment will not only enable these work study students to make money, but will also provide them a valuable experience in research methodology and further expose them to advising by the associated faculty (further enhancing Pillar 1 of the strategic plan).**

**He spoke about Mr. Richard Chait’s presentation to the Board at the Governance and Engagement committee meeting the day before. Mr. Chait said the University of Virginia is a national treasure with its rich history and its educational excellence, and he warned that many public universities are rapidly losing elevation in the rankings.**

**Dr. Holstege said last year he spent a week in Britain on a collaborative project with Sheffield Hallam University regarding communications during terrorist attacks. An acquaintance of his, Lord John Alderdice of the House of Lords, who is best known for his work in fostering peace between the British government and the IRA, gave the team a personal tour of Parliament in the off hours. He relayed a story to Dr. Holstege during that tour that on January 4th of 1642, King Charles I entered the House of Commons in an attempt to arrest five members of Parliament for high treason. William Lenthall was leader of the House at that time and when approached by the King requesting the five, he replied: “May it please your majesty, I have neither eyes to see nor tongue to speak in this place but as this House is pleased to direct me whose servant I am here.” The King left without arresting the five members and no monarch has entered the House of Commons since.**

**Dr. Holstege said he relayed this story as it exemplifies appropriate leadership and to inform the Board how glad he is that he lives in an era as Senate chair that he is not at risk of losing his head. This University has various leaders representing various constituents. As chair of the Faculty Senate, Dr. Holstege represents the faculty. George Martin, as Rector, represents the Board of Visitors. Terry Sullivan, as President, represents the University as a whole. He said yesterday the Board had a session pertaining to governance. A key to governance is communication, especially among the leaders of the various groups. Dr. Holstege said he wanted to be clear that, as chair of the Faculty Senate, this communication is vastly improving as faculty are engaged in numerous discussions throughout the university. He stated that in his position as Faculty Senate Chair, officially representing the faculty, that he has neither eyes to see nor tongue to speak in this place but as the Senate is pleased to direct him, whose servant he is here. May this also hold true for all future Faculty Senate chairs.**

**Dr. Holstege said he looked forward to future engagement with the Board of Visitors during his remaining tenure as chair and to seeing the growth of engagement and communications with subsequent leaders in years to come. As we approach the university’s start of its 3rd century of existence, the faculty look forward to working with the talented students, alumni, staff, administration, and the Board of Visitors to govern with outstanding communication, and assure we do not descend in the rankings but remain a top tier public institution of higher education.**
