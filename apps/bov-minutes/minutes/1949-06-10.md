The annual meeting of the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia was held on this date in the Office of the President of the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia, with the following present: the Rector, Barron F. Black; President Colgate W. Darden, Jr., of the University of Virginia; Visitors Anderson, Carrington, Garnett, Gay, Gravatt, Mears, Talbott, Trout, Wailes, and Willis. Absent: President M. L. Combs of Mary Washington College; Visitors Barksdale, Miller, and Smith.

The minutes of the meeting of May 13, 1949, which had been copied and mailed to the members, were approved.

The President announced receipt of the following gifts:

The President announced that Dr. William Herndon Pearson, Instructor in Orthodontics, died May 20, 1949, Norfolk, Virginia.

President Darden announced the following retirements.

Dr. Llewellyn Griffith Hoxton, Professor of Physics, retiring at the end of the session of 1948-49. He has been on the staff of the University since 1906.

Dr. Harvey Ernest Jordan, Professor of Anatomy and until February 1, 1949 Dean of the Department of Medicine, retiring at the end of the session of 1948-49. He has been on the staff of the University since 1907.

Dr. Trout and Mr. Anderson were asked to prepare resolutions recording the appreciation of the Board for the long and distinguished service of these faculty members, and they were adopted as follows.

BE IT RESOLVED, WHEREAS: Dr. Harvey Ernest Jordan, Professor of Anatomy, Histology, and Embryology, and Dean of the Department of Medicine is retiring at the end of the session of 1948-49, the Rector and the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia desire to express to him their very deep appreciation of many years of distinguished service.

Dr. Jordan has not only made many valuable contributions to the success of the Department of Medicine at the University but has gained the well-deserved reputation of being one of the leading Histologists and Embryologists of America. Jordan's "Text Book of Histology" is used by many medical schools throughout the United States and is recognized as being one of the best text books ever published on this subject. More recently, he and Kindred jointly have published a text book on "Embryology" and this book is also employed in many of America's medical schools. His being so generally accepted as being a very high authority on these two subjects has added not only to his reputation but has materially advanced the standing throughout the country of the Medical Department of the University of Virginia.

It would be impossible to overestimate his valuable influence as a Dean. He has always been loved and admired by the students for his fairness and honesty as well as due to the fact that he never failed to take the time to help the students with their many difficult problems which were so frequently made simple after a conversation with him. He never compromised the truth and his striking character, as an example, has added much to the success of many of our medical Alumni. His contacts with the President, with the other members of the faculty, and with the various members of the Board of Visitors have always been most helpful. There has never been any occasion when his suggestions were not given great consideration, for any contact with Dr. Jordan inspires confidence in him.

Therefore, the Rector and the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia hope that many more useful and happy lives will be in store for Dr. Jordan, his wife, and family, and our best wishes accompany them no matter where they decide to live.

BE IT RESOLVED, WHEREAS: Dr. Llewellyn Griffith Hoxton, Professor of Physics, is retiring at the end of the session of 1948-49, the Rector and Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia desire to express to him their deep and sincere appreciation of many years of distinguished service.

Professor Hoxton became head of the Department of Physics of the University upon the retirement of Professor Francis H. Smith, with whom he had been associated. He received his Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Arts, and Master of Arts degrees from the University of Virginia in 1900, and did graduate work at Harvard and George Washington universities in 1900 and 1901-02. He received his Ph. D. from Johns Hopkins in 1916.

His splendid abilities and fine training soon caused his work in the field of physics to be widely known, and upon the outbreak of World War I he was retained in Military Investigations by the United States Bureau of Standards during 1917 and 1918. Again in World War II he was called to the service of the country and took part in the solution of many problems which confronted our Armed Forces. In 1946 he received the Naval Ordnance Development Award, Unit Citation. In spite of his many duties, he managed, at great personal sacrifice, to participate in the very large and important postgraduate work which was done as a part of the War effort. In this manner, he made a substantial contribution to the successful termination of the War.

In all of his work, Dr. Hoxton has shown great ability in and love for his profession, and his charming personality has strongly influenced the many students who have sat under him. His work in the field of physics will be greatly missed in this Institution, as well as beyond the confines of our University.

Therefore, the Rector and the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia hope that Dr. Hoxton will have many happy years to spend with his family, and that he will derive great satisfaction in reflecting upon his life which has contributed so much to improving the condition of his fellow man.

### Resolutions Adopted

Mr. Knox Turnbull as part-time Lecturer in Insurance for the session of 1949-50, at a salary of $1,170.

Mr. Black stated that in assuming the office of Rector he would welcome suggestions from any member of the Board and that the suggestions he had received thus far had proved most helpful.

He then reviewed the accomplishments of the administration during the two years since Mr. Darden had assumed office, stating that he believed many of the most pressing problems had been solved and that he felt that the delegation to the Student Council of responsibility for student discipline, together with other changes, had greatly improved student conduct.

He briefly reviewed the work of the Development Fund, stating that he believed its period of usefulness was over and its program should be brought to a conclusion as soon as possible.

He stated that the University was faced with a tremendous building program which would occupy the attention of the Board and the administration for several years.

Mr. Black announced the appointment of the following Standing and Special Committees.

The question was raised of whether or not the Board should formulate a general policy to guide the administration to prevent the infiltration of subversive elements among the faculty. After considerable discussion it was deemed unwise to impose upon the faculty a loyalty oath similar to that which has caused such disturbance at the University of California. The President pointed out that he exercised every caution in investigating prospective faculty members and that no member was added to the faculty without first coming to the University for a personal interview with the President and the Deans and department heads.

Messrs. Archibald A. Campbell, John Izard, Jr., and Gerard R. Moran, the Concession Committee of the Law School Student Advisory Council, appeared before the Board for discussion of this matter. Mr. Campbell, as spokesman for the group, stated that the extra-curricular activities of the Law School involved a considerable expenditure of money which, up to the present, had been met by the Dean's Contingent Fund. Unfortunately this fund is not now adequate to meet their needs and they feel that if they could take over the concession operating in the Law School, they could realize an annual operating profit of $2,500 which would greatly assist the various activities of the Law School.

After these gentlemen left there was a discussion of the matter and the Committee on Athletics was asked to secure information from the Alumni Association concerning the income and expenses of all of its concessions at the University. It was the sense of the Board that if the Law School concession were turned over to the students of the Law School, similar requests would come from other departments, possibly endangering the program of the Alumni Association which is now supported from this source. The President was requested to investigate the possibility of assisting the various student activities at the Law School from other funds.

The President presented a new faculty salary scale for the Departments of the College, Engineering, and Education, which had been approved by the Governor to go into effect September 15, 1949. The members of the Board commended the President on the fine work he had done in securing the approval of the Governor for this new plan.

The President reported that he had under way a plan to develop a School of Fine Arts independent of the School of Architecture. At a later meeting he will present details of this proposal.

The President asked the Board to consider further the proposal by Mrs. Sloane to turn over the Hermitage Foundation at Norfolk to the University. He stated that the Museum of Fine Arts of the State had been given the home of Mr. Gari Melcher near Fredericksburg and that the cost of maintaining this property had far exceeded original estimates. He is disturbed by the prospect that over a period of years the maintenance of the Hermitage Foundation might necessitate an annual appropriation of $30,000 or $40,000. A motion was passed directing the Rector to appoint a Committee, of which he should be Chairman, to study the Hermitage Foundation proposal. The Committee so appointed consists of Mr. Black as Chairman, Mr. Gay and Mrs. Smith.

A letter from the Alumnae Association of Mary Washington College enclosing a letter from The American Council of Christian Churches concerning the Communist infiltration at colleges and universities in America was read. The Secretary was directed to acknowledge the letter.

The Finance Committee of the Law School Alumni Association, Mr. John C. Parker, Chairman, appeared before the Board and presented the following resolution.

WHEREAS such is the national standing of the University of Virginia Law School that it would inevitably be included in any representative list of the leading law schools of the country,

WHEREAS the Law School is the only department of the University operating at a profit,

WHEREAS the former of these two highly desirable conditions is due in part and the latter entirely to a large number of students;

WHEREAS this volume cannot be maintained without a faculty of actual and recognized ability and proper balance between career teachers and experienced practitioners,

WHEREAS it has become increasingly difficult to either retain existing professors or to attract new men of the desired caliber at the present salary scale of the Law School,

WHEREAS maintenance of the present high standards of the Law School will continue to add to the prestige of the University but a lowering of them will by the same token hurt every department of the institution;

WHEREAS from a purely dollars-and-cents viewpoint a superior law school of a large number of students operating at a profit with a strong and adequately-paid faculty is preferable to an inferior school of a small number of students operating at a deficit with a weak but lower-paid faculty,

WHEREAS after careful study this Council has heretofore recommended that the existing basic salary scale for full professors be increased from two at $10,000 and six at $8,125 to three at $15,000, two at $10,000 and three at $8,125 at a total additional cost of $20,625 a year; and

WHEREAS the proposed new salary scale is a minimum only, substantially lower than that now prevailing at certain other law schools with which the University is in direct competition for both faculty and students;

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the Council of the University of Virginia Law School that a copy hereof be forthwith transmitted to the Dean of the Law School with the urgent request that in preparing for submission to the President of the University a proposed budget for the Law School for the 1949-50 session he use the basic salary scale heretofore recommended by this Council,

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that a copy hereof be forthwith transmitted to the President of the University with the urgent request that in preparing a budget for submission to the Rector and Board of Visitors for the 1949-50 session he in turn likewise incorporate the higher salary scale for law professors; and

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that copies hereof be forthwith transmitted to the Rector and other members of the Board of Visitors of the University with the urgent request that they approve the recommendation herein made.

There was a general discussion of the necessity of the Law School's securing the ablest faculty members to maintain its present eminence in this country.

After departure of the Committee a motion was passed requesting Mr. Gay to meet with the Finance Committee of the Law School Alumni Association and explain to them why the Board feels that it cannot at this time join in the recommendation of the Law School Alumni Association, but hopes that some provision can be made in the future.

Mr. Anderson, Chairman, reported that the Committee had met with the Alumni Board of Managers, who had heartily endorsed the recommendations of the Development Fund Committee presented at the May meeting of the Board. The Alumni Association was assured that the establishment of such an office would in no way interfere with the annual Alumni Fund Drive. The Board accepted the report and requested the President to set aside adequate time in the July docket for a full discussion of this problem.

Mr. Gay, Chairman, reported that the Finance Committee had met on the previous night to discuss the custodial agreements which the University had entered into in 1947 with the Peoples National Bank of Charlottesville. Under the first of these agreements, known as the Endowment Funds Custodial Agreement, the Peoples Bank serves as custodian of all mortgages held in the Consolidated Endowment Fund. The Finance Committee feels that the Bank has not been handling these securities as stipulated in the agreement. The Committee requested Mr. Gay to meet with Mr. Walsh, Trust Officer of the Bank, to discuss this agreement. Mr. Walsh was most receptive to the suggestions of the Finance Committee and stated that the Bank was desirous of complying fully with the agreement.

Mr. Gay then presented the Bursar's Custodial Agreement with the Peoples National Bank of Charlottesville, which had been approved on June 13, 1947. Under this agreement the Bank maintains custody of the securities in the current funds of the Bursar, paying to him quarterly the income received. The Finance Committee feels, as does the Bursar, that the cost to the University of this agreement does not justify the benefits. The Finance Committee recommends that the agreement be terminated and that these securities be kept in a safe deposit box of the bank in the custody of the Bursar. The recommendation met with the approval of the Board.

Mr. Gay stated that the Finance Committee wished instructions from the Board regarding the investment of endowment funds in mortgages on homes of faculty members. The Finance Committee recommends that the State regulations for banks, i.e., a maximum of sixty per cent of total cost, be followed. After considerable discussion the Finance Committee was directed to follow standard investment practices in making these loans, as the funds were a part of the Consolidated Endowment Fund and should be invested with great care.

The budget for the University Division for the year 1949-50 was approved as presented by the President, showing estimated revenues for the year of $4,769,679 and estimated expenditures of $4,717,598, leaving an estimated surplus of $52,081.

The following resolution was adopted.

RESOLVED that approval be and is hereby given to the charging off of schedules 64-B, 64-C, and 65 of uncollectible hospital accounts recommended for cancellation by the Hospital Accounts Committee.

Mr. Black, Chairman of a committee to investigate certain charges made by Professor Clifton Brooke McIntosh of Mary Washington College, presented the following report, which was approved by the Board.

***

TO THE BOARD OF VISITORS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA:

The undersigned were appointed as a Committee to investigate certain charges made by Professor Clifton Brooke McIntosh, Associate Professor of Spanish and Portuguese at Mary Washington College of the University of Virginia.

Briefly, these charges contained in his letter of December 7th, 1948 were to the effect that Professor Louis Cabrera, another member of the faculty of Mary Washington College, who has recently been appointed as head of the Department of Spanish of that institution, had deceived the Board of Visitors in regard to the authenticity of a degree received by him from Andhra Research University. Professor McIntosh asserted that by the appointment of Professor Cabrera, the holder of what he called a "questionable degree", his Ph. D. degree from the University of Virginia had been repudiated. Both Professors McIntosh and Cabrera on different occasions appeared before the Board of Visitors and stated their respective positions.

We have been unsuccessful in definitely locating Andhra Research University. On the other hand, there has been no definite statement up to the present date that such a university does not exist.

We were furnished with a pamphlet entitled "The Establishment of Independence in Brazil and South America Revisited", written by Dr. Percy A. Martin, Professor of History at Stanford University, which described itself as issued by Andhra Research University, and listed the officers of that University. We addressed a letter to Dr. Martin, asking various questions regarding this University, only to receive a reply from Mrs. May F. Martin that her husband, Percy A. Martin, had died in March, 1942. She closed her letter with the statement that her husband was very much of an internationalist and may not have sufficiently scrutinized this Indian University.

Professor Cabrera referred us to Dr. F. M. Dimas-Aruti, a dentist of Washington, D. C., who is listed in the Martin pamphlet as a member of the International Faculty of Andhra University, occupying the position of Councillor at Washington, D. C. He answered our letter referring to the Martin pamphlet, asserting that the degree was an honorary one, and that he was a good friend of the Pro Chancellor and Dean of the International Faculty and that he had recommended Professor Cabrera for the degree, but still with no word of the actual existence of Andhra University.

The Committee has corresponded at length with the Division of International Relations, a Government Bureau, and that Bureau in turn has taken the matter up with the Indian Embassy. There has been no definite reply from this source as to the existence of this University.

It does not appear to us that the burden of establishing this fact should rest on this Board. We, therefore, recommend that all reference to the honorary degree from Andhra Research University be omitted from any publication of Mary Washington College of the University of Virginia until definite proof of its existence is shown the Board by Professor Cabrera.

In this connection the Committee has investigated the practice of listing honorary degrees in publications of Universities and Colleges and finds that it is quite customary to do so without stating that the degree is an honorary degree, since this is self-apparent.

In Professor McIntosh's statement to the Board he informed us that Professor Cabrera's honorary degree must have been represented as an earned degree because on page 14 of the Bulletin of Faculty Studies of Mary Washington College, the title is given of the dissertation offered in fulfillment of the degree, and this would remove it from the realm of honorary degrees.

An investigation of this phase of the matter through Professor Cabrera reveals that the dissertation referred to was voluntarily submitted by Professor Cabrera and was returned to him with the statement that this being an honorary degree there were no requirements for the submission of any dissertation, and for that reason the manuscript could not be accepted. If this be the status of the dissertation we do not believe it should be listed in the publication referred to above, and we recommend its elimination in all future issues.

The degree in question held by Professor Cabrera was obviously an honorary one. It was entitled "Doctor of Literature from Andhra Research University, Vizianagaram, South India".

It is perfectly clear that no deception has been practiced by Professor Cabrera. In his application to Mary Washington College for employment, he answered the Question No. 18 as follows:

Q. State any other education you have had, such as correspondence courses. Also list any collegiate fellowships, scholarships, scholastic honors, and significant college activities.\
A. Doctor of Literature from Andhra Research University, Vizianagaram, So India. Member of the Royal Academy of Arts and Sciences Hispano Americana, Cadiz, Spain.

He does not pretend that this is a Ph. D. degree earned after the carrying out of prescribed courses.

President Combs tells us that he does not require a Doctor's degree as a prerequisite for the head of a department, and that Professor Cabrera did not pretend to have such a degree. He also stated that in his opinion, and he had a close acquaintance with the matter, the charges preferred by Professor McIntosh were based somewhat on personal feelings growing out of private affairs between the two men.

Obviously, there are other considerations besides degrees which would play a part in the selection of the head of a department, and we assume that it was these other considerations which motivated the appointment of Professor Cabrera and the failure to appoint Professor McIntosh, even though the latter had a Ph. D. degree, and the former did not.

Under all of the facts of the situation, it is the unanimous opinion of the Committee that no harm has been done to Professor McIntosh's degree by the occurrences in connection with the appointment of Professor Cabrera as head of the Spanish Department. Nor do we think that any deception has been practiced by Professor Cabrera.

The Committee therefore recommends that no action be taken upon Professor McIntosh's complaint, other than to request Dr. Combs and the administrative authorities of Mary Washington College to see that no further reference is made in the college catalogue to the honorary degree of Litt. D. now claimed to be held by Dr. Cabrera until he can satisfy the Board and/or the authorities at Mary Washington College that Andhra Research University was in fact an established institution of learning at the time it is purported to have awarded him the degree referred to; and that the College no longer make reference in the Bulletin of Faculty Studies, or in any other college publication issued by it, to the fact that Professor Cabrera has offered the above mentioned dissertation in fulfillment of the requirements of a Ph. D. degree.

On motion the meeting was then adjourned.
