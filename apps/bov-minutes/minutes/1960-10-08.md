President Shannon announced to the Board the death of Mr. Ullin W. Leavell, Professor of Education and founder of the Holmes McGuffey Reading Clinic, on 22 September 1960 after an illness of several weeks. Mr. Leavell had served on the faculty since 1946.

There were expressions of the affection and esteem in which Mr. Leavell was held, and the Secretary was directed to record in the permanent minutes the deep sense of loss felt by the Board, and the gratitude of the Visitors for his devoted and valuable services to the University.

President Shannon reported on a contract with the U. S. National Damage Assessment Center for which he had sought and received the approval of the Executive Committee because action was required prior to the October meeting of the Board. While the President and the Comptroller, by previous Board action, are empowered to sign contracts, the President pointed out that the contract with the National Damage Assessment Center had implications for future action, including the eventual establishment of a Department of Statistics in the College of Arts and Sciences, which he felt called for prior approval by the Executive Committee.

The following resolution was adopted

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the action of the Executive Committee on 9 September 1960 authorizing the President to negotiate a contract with the National Damage Assessment Center is hereby approved.

The President stated concern had been felt as to the possibility of serious delays arising in the execution of important documents due to illness or absence of the Secretary of the Board and that steps should be taken to obviate such difficulty. However, inasmuch as the Secretary is a statutory officer, some doubt had arisen as to the power of the Board to create the office of Assistant Secretary to the Board. This doubt had been resolved by the opinion of Attorney General Harrison as expressed in a letter to the President which reads as follows

> This will acknowledge your letter of July 8th, in which you request my advice as to whether or not the Board of Visitors of the University may appoint a full time assistant secretary who will act in that capacity when necessary in the place and stead of the regular secretary.
>
> In my opinion the Board of Visitors does have this power, and it may by proper resolution prescribe the scope of the authority and duties of the assistant secretary in such manner as the Board deems advisable.

The President then recommended the creation of the Office of Assistant Secretary to the Board

After discussion, upon motion duly made and seconded, the following resolution was adopted

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, that the office of Assistant Secretary to the Board of Visitors be and it is hereby created, to be filled by appointment by the Board for such term as the Board may designate. The Assistant Secretary shall perform all the duties and functions of the Secretary, whenever necessary, and, in addition, shall perform such other duties and functions as may be assigned to him by the Rector or the President.

The following resolution was adopted

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, that Francis L. Berkeley, Jr., be and he is hereby elected Assistant Secretary to the Board of Visitors for a term ending 28 February 1962.

The President stated that the present Manual of the Board of Visitors was adopted in 1947 (Minutes, Board of Visitors, University of Virginia, No. 11, 12 September 1947, p. 5) and that portions of the Manual are now out of date. In certain instances in which the University enters into contracts and other agreements, the President reported that copies of this Manual have to be submitted and the results are sometimes misleading.

The President proposed, pending the revision of the Manual, that the resolution adopting a Manual be rescinded.

The following resolution was adopted

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the resolution adopting the Manual of the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia passed on 12 September 1947 be and it is hereby rescinded.

The President reported that during the summer a new operator had been found for the University Airport and that it was necessary for the President to subscribe to a memorandum incorporating the terms of the contract, which had been prepared by the Counsel for the University, Mr. C. Venable Minor, but that the contract could not become effective until the Board had given its approval. The President asked for authorization to sign the contract as outlined in the memorandum of 7 July 1960.

The following resolution was adopted

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the Comptroller be and he is hereby authorized, on behalf of The Rector and Visitors, to execute a contract for the operation of the University Airport embodying the provisions of the memorandum subscribed to by the President on 7 July 1960, subject to the approval of the Attorney for the University.

The President reported on the retirement from the Board of Mr. Davis Y. Paschall as a result of his resignation as State Superintendent of Public Instruction, effective 15 August 1960, to accept the position of President of the College of William and Mary.

In appreciation for Mr. Paschall's services as a member of the Board of Visitors, the President proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the members of the Board express to Mr. Davis Y. Paschall their deep appreciation for his services as a member of the Board while occupying the position of Superintendent of Public Instruction and convey to him their congratulations on his appointment as President of the College of William and Mary.

Mr. Fenwick, Chairman of the Athletics Committee, laid before the Board, copies of "Intercollegiate Athletics Report of Receipts and Disbursements for the Period July 1, 1959 to June 30, 1960." At the conclusion of the discussion of the report, the Secretary was instructed to submit the report in triplicate to the Director of the Budget, to send one copy to the Comptroller for his files, and to hold one copy in the files of the Board.

The President reported that Mr. W. Allan Perkins, who served as Attorney for the University from 1917 to 1952, had died on 26 July 1960. As a mark of thanks for Mr. Perkins' services to the University, the President proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that in the death of William Allan Perkins on 26 July 1960 the University and the community have suffered a deep and permanent loss.

Born in Charlottesville on 6 July 1880, Mr. Perkins was the son and grandson of distinguished lawyers who had successively served at the Albemarle County Bar since the founding of the University. A graduate of the University's law class of 1902, he practiced actively for fifty-seven years. Throughout that period he gave outstanding leadership to his professional associations, to the educational, religious, and civic activities of the community; and to some of the most constructive work of the University of Virginia Alumni Association.

As Attorney to this Board from 1915 to 1952, Allan Perkins served the University with singular devotion and generosity. More than once during these thirty-seven years the Board has spread upon its minutes resolutions of appreciation, for work beyond the call of duty, voting him increases in legal fees that he had modestly set too low, or thanks for fees that he had returned to aid some needy University purpose. We have valued his wise counsel and his warm friendship. We shall hold him in grateful memory.

RESOLVED, FURTHER, that copies of this resolution be sent to the members of Mr. Perkins' family.

The President reported that he had established a University Long-Range Planning Committee to report to him on the educational and physical needs of the University for the period 1960-1975. The first task assigned to the Committee was to advise the President on the capital outlay requests to the State Capital Outlay Commission for the period 1962-1968. The Committee is to submit an outline of its work program to the President by November 1960 and a final report not later than May 1961.

The membership of the Committee is as follows:

* Mr. Frank A. Geldard, Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, Chairman
* Mr. Irby B. Cauthen, Jr., Associate Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences
* Mr. Almand R. Coleman, Professor of Accounting in the Graduate School of Business Administration
* Mr. Weldon Cooper, Administrative Assistant to the President
* Mr. Frederick D. Nichols, Associate Professor of Architecture

* Mr. Edward C. Stevenson, Professor of Electrical Engineering
* Mr. Joseph L. Vaughan, Chancellor for Community Colleges
* Mr. John C. Wyllie, Librarian
* Mr. Daniel J. Meador, Associate Professor of Law, Secretary.

The President stated that the Governor had established a State Capital Outlay Commission to report on the capital outlay needs of all State institutions and departments for the period 1962-1968. The President distributed a summary statement of the capital outlay requests which had been submitted to the Commission on 30 September 1960. The estimated total costs of the capital outlay needs were as follows:

1. The University at Charlottesville: $16,254,000
2. University of Virginia Medical Center: $2,883,500
3. Mary Washington College: $1,308,200
4. Clinch Valley College: $346,000
5. George Mason College: $2,665,000

The total request amounted to **$23,456,700**.

The President reported that the Buildings and Grounds Committee had met on 1 October 1960 to consider a number of current building projects. The plans for five projects recommended by the President and approved by the Buildings and Grounds Committee for submission to the Art Commission were as follows:

1. Site Plan for Copeley Hill and Lambeth Field
2. Plans for the Civil Engineering Wing
3. George Mason College Site Plan
4. Site Plan for the East Lawn Garden Road
5. Plans for the Northwest Wing of the Rotunda

In approving the Site Plan for Copeley Hill, the Buildings and Grounds Committee authorized the President to negotiate for the purchase of land to permit the construction of an underpass under the C & O Railway which would provide an entrance off Route 250 West to the Copeley Hill Site.

Final plans for five projects were proposed by the President and approved by the Buildings and Grounds Committee. There were

1. University Hospital - Phase II
2. Law School Building Addition
3. Minor Hall Renovation Plans
4. Madison Hall Renovation Plans
5. Piedmont Bachelors' Quarters Plans.

The President reported also that, at this same meeting of the Buildings and Grounds Committee, he had summarized the difficult situation ahead with respect to the growing need for increased eating facilities at Newcomb Hall. To meet this growing need, the Comptroller presented to the Committee a tentative plan for the construction of two wings on the west side of Newcomb Hall consisting of two floors, one of which would be below ground. The President requested and the Buildings and Grounds Committee approved the proposal tentatively and authorized the President and the Comptroller to proceed to prepare detailed plans for later presentation to the Committee and eventual submission to the Board.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the following resolution was adopted

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the actions of the Buildings and Grounds Committee taken at its meeting on 1 October 1960, as outlined above, be and they are hereby approved.

The President stated that by action of the Board in 1947, the Student Activities Committee, which is appointed by the President, has been responsible for the allocation of funds received from the $5 student activities fee to student organizations. In recent years several student organizations, which are fully worthy of financial support from this source, have had to be denied funds. Recently, the President stated that the Student Activities Committee and the Student Council had considered the matter and had come to the conclusion that the fee should be increased from $5 to $7 per session.

The President proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the Student Activities Fee be and it is hereby increased from $5 to $7 per session, effective 1 September 1961.

The President called to the Board's attention the situation with respect to a bequest made by Miss Katharine A. McIntire.

By the Sixth Paragraph of her Will, dated June 6, 1953, probated June 20, 1960, and of record in the Clerk's Office of the Corporation Court of Charlottesville, in W. B. 8, p. 388, Miss McIntire bequeathed to "the Bayly Museum at the University of Virginia, a sofa, pier tables, card table and a group of miniatures." On the Will appeared a notation, dated July 9, 1958, signed by Miss McIntire, to the effect that the miniatures had already been disposed of. Shortly before her death on June 14, 1960, at her request, a codicil to her Will was prepared also revoking the bequest of furniture to the Museum. However, Miss McIntire died before she could execute this codicil.

The question, the President pointed out, was whether the bequest should be accepted under the circumstances.

After discussion, upon motion duly made and seconded, the following resolution was adopted

RESOLVED, that the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, being desirous of complying with the known wishes of the late Miss Katharine A. McIntire, respectfully declines the bequest contained in the Sixth Paragraph of her Will dated June 6, 1953, to "the Bayly Museum at the University of Virginia", of a sofa, pier table and card table.

The President reported that the Reactor Facility was now operating at full power and that the dedication was to be held on 25 November 1960, the day before Commonwealth Day. The President stated that it was his hope that a number of State officials would be able to inspect the Reactor Facility on the morning of Commonwealth Day prior to the football game.

The President presented a detailed report on student registration for the session of 1960-1961. Current registration is 4,665 as against 4,438 one year ago. The chief increase in registration was in the College where the entering class numbered 667 as against 459 in 1959 and 441 in 1958. The President concluded his detailed report by noting an encouraging increase in the percentage of Virginia students which was 54 per cent in the College and 57 per cent for the University at Charlottesville.

The President reported on a letter dated 26 September 1960 from The Seven Society, delivered to him through the Secretary, in which The Seven Society proposed to present to the University "a suitable mace as a symbol of the power and authority of the University."

After discussion, the following resolution was adopted

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the proposal of The Seven Society, in a letter dated 26 September 1960, to present a mace to the University be referred to the Executive Committee for final action after study and recommendation by the President.

The following resolution was adopted

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the Hospital Accounts Committee be and it is hereby authorized to charge off as uncollectible accounts Schedules 935, 936, 939, 940, 942, 943, 946, 947, 950, 951, 954, and 955, aggregating $169,553.51, as recommended by it, consisting of the following.

The President reminded the Board of its action on 10 June 1960 by which tuition increases in the amounts of $20 for Virginians and $45 for out-of-state students were approved, effective 1 September 1961. The President stated that the Dean of the Graduate School of Business Administration had recommended to him a tuition increase for out-of-state students in his School of $100 instead of $45. The Dean reported that this increase would still make the tuition charge for his School below that of the graduate schools of business with which the University is in competition.

The President proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that, effective 1 September 1961, the tuition charge for out-of-state students in the Graduate School of Business Administration shall be increased from $850 to $950, for a total increase of $100.

The President reported that at a recent meeting of the President's Council, representatives of the Council of Higher Education had appeared before the group with the report that the Council wished to move toward greater coordination of the State-supported institutions of higher learning in accordance with the act of the General Assembly creating the Council. In moving toward this goal, the Council of Higher Education had requested at this meeting that the President arrange for the appearance of one of its representatives at a subsequent meeting of the Board. President Shannon recommended that this proposal be approved.

The following resolution was adopted

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the President be and he is hereby authorized to extend an invitation to the State Council of Higher Education to send a representative to appear before the Board at the next meeting on 10 December 1960 or at any subsequent meeting as may be arranged by the President.

The President reported that the Finance Committee at its meeting earlier in the morning had approved a proposal which would authorize the Comptroller to advance from current fund surplus not to exceed $500,000 at 4½ per cent interest for 20 years to be amortized from payments from the revenues of Newcomb Hall. The Newcomb Hall addition is to be devoted to the expansion of eating facilities and the President recalled to the attention of the Board its approval earlier in the meeting of the proposal for preparing plans for this project.

The President proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the Comptroller be and he is hereby authorized to advance not to exceed $500,000 from current fund surplus for the purpose of constructing an addition to Newcomb Hall, the loan to be amortized within 20 years at 4½ per cent interest.

Mr. Lewis stated that, in view of the athletic situation, certain decisions might be necessary before the next meeting of the Board on 10 December 1960. A discussion ensued as to the appropriate action to be taken to ensure authority was available to act in the event action was needed.

Following the discussion, the following resolution was adopted

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the Executive Committee and the President be and they are hereby authorized to explore ways and means of implementing the athletic program and to take such action as the Executive Committee may deem necessary between now and the next meeting of the Board on 10 December 1960.

The Chancellor reported that in April 1958 he had submitted to the Board a list of loans from the State Student Loan Fund which were uncollectible and had received authority from the Board to charge-off these loans. One loan, he reported, through oversight was not included in the list. The Auditor of Public Accounts in his annual examination of the College's records had suggested that the loan should be charged off. The Chancellor stated that the date of the note was 9 April 1935 in the original amount of $33.34. The unpaid principal of the note at this time amounts to $13.23. The note was signed by Ann Crute who resided at the time of the loan in Baskerville, Virginia. Since repeated efforts have been made to collect this loan without success, the Chancellor recommended that the note be charged off as uncollectible in accordance with the terms prescribed in the State Appropriation Act.

The following resolution was adopted

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that Mary Washington College of the University of Virginia be and is hereby authorized, subject to the written approval of the Governor, to charge-off as uncollectible a note from the State Student Loan Fund signed by Ann Crute, dated 9 April 1935, with a principal balance of $13.23.

The State Corporation Commission has issued an order approving the proposed plan of providing additional working capital for the Company and a copy of this order has been sent to the Rector.

On 26 September 1960, in a conference with the engineers from the Engineering Division of the Division of the Budget and a representative of the Natural Gas Service Company, a proposed set of plans and specifications was discussed and approved by the State engineers. The Chancellor concluded his report by noting that the State engineers had proposed that bids be received the latter part of October for the installation of the natural gas equipment.

The Chancellor reported that during the preceding week he had received an anonymous gift of 200 shares of du Pont stock valued at approximately $36,000 to $37,000.
