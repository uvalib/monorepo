\[Form of Back of Bond\]

This Bond is one of a duly authorized issue of Bonds of the University aggregating One Hundred Ten Million Dollars ($110,000,000) in principal amount, known as "Fixed/Adjustable Rate Hospital Revenue Bonds (Series B)" (the "Bonds"), issued under and pursuant to a resolution adopted by the Executive Committee of the Board of Visitors of the University (the "Board") on November 30, 1984 (the "Master Resolution"), as supplemented by a Series Resolution adopted by the Executive Committee on November 30, 1984 (the "Series Resolution") (said Master Resolution, as supplemented, being herein called the "Resolution"). This Bond is issued and the Resolution was adopted under and pursuant to the Constitution and laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, particularly Chapter 3, Title 23, Code of Virginia, 1950, as amended (herein called the "Act"). Reference is hereby made to the Resolution for the provisions, among others, with respect to the custody and application of the proceeds of Bonds issued under the Resolution, the collection and disposition of revenues, the funds charged with and pledged to the payment of the interest on and the principal of the Bonds, the nature and extent of the security, the terms and conditions on which the Bonds are or other series of bonds may be issued, the rights, duties and obligations of the University and the rights of the holders of the Bonds. Capitalized terms not defined herein shall be as defined in the Resolution. By the acceptance of this Bond, the holder hereof assents to all of the provisions of the Resolution.

The Resolution provides for the issuance from time to time, under the conditions, limitations and restrictions therein set forth, of additional series of Bonds.

As additional security for the payment of principal of and interest on the Bonds until the Fixed Rate Date, the University has caused to be delivered to the Paying Agent an irrevocable letter of credit in the initial stated amount of One Hundred Ten Million Dollars ($110,000,000) with an initial expiration date of December 14, 1991 (the "Credit Facility") issued by The Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, Limited acting through its New York Branch (the "Bank") pursuant to a letter of credit and reimbursement agreement, dated as of November 1, 1984 (the "Reimbursement Agreement") between the Bank and the University. The Paying Agent shall draw upon the Credit Facility (a) to pay principal of the Bonds due on mandatory or optional redemption, acceleration or maturity, and (b) to the extent the proceeds of sale derived from any remarketing of Bonds shall be insufficient for such purpose, to pay the purchase price of Bonds tendered or deemed to have been tendered to the Paying Agent for purchase. The initial Credit Facility shall terminate upon the earliest to occur of (i) December 14, 1991 or any later date to which the Credit Facility has been extended, (ii) the date following the Fixed Rate Date, (iii) the date as of which the Credit Facility is cancelled by notice from the University and the Paying Agent to the Bank, (iv) the date following the date on which there shall be a drawing to pay the principal of all Bonds tendered or deemed to be tendered and not remarketed upon the mandatory tender of the Bonds pursuant to the Series Resolution, or (v) the date that all of the Bonds shall no longer be outstanding under the Series Resolution. Bonds transferred to the Bank upon the payment thereof with the proceeds of a drawing on the Credit Facility shall not be deemed to have been paid for purposes of the Resolution and shall continue to be an obligation of the University until the principal of and interest thereon is paid by the University to the Bank. The University may, upon the conditions specified in the Series Resolution, provide for the extension of the Credit Facility or the delivery to the Paying Agent of a Substitute Credit Facility or Alternate Credit Facility.

In the event the University elects to convert the Bonds to a fixed interest rate or is unable to arrange for the extension of the Credit Facility or any Substitute Credit Facility prior to the expiration date thereof (unless such date is after the Fixed Rate Date or after the final maturity of the Bonds) on substantially the same terms as originally issued, or if at any time the University proposes to obtain an Alternate Credit Facility or to amend the Series Resolution in certain respects, the Paying Agent shall give, or cause to be given, written notice to the holders prior to the Fixed Rate Date, the expiration date of the Credit Facility or Substitute Credit Facility, the effective date of the proposed Alternate Credit Facility or the amendment to the Series Resolution. THE HOLDER OF THIS BOND, BY ACCEPTANCE HEREOF, AGREES TO SELL THIS BOND TO THE PAYING AGENT ON THE FIXED RATE DATE, ON THE ALTERNATE CREDIT DATE AND ON THE AMENDMENT DATE (UNLESS SUCH HOLDER DELIVERS NOTICE OF ITS ELECTION TO RETAIN THIS BOND TO THE PAYING AGENT BY THE FIFTEENTH DAY PRIOR TO SUCH DATE), AT A PRICE OF PAR, AND UPON SUCH PURCHASE TO SURRENDER THIS BOND, PROPERLY ENDORSED FOR TRANSFER IN BLANK. In the event (i) the Bank shall require the Paying Agent to cause the mandatory tender for purchase of all Bonds as a result of an event of default under the Reimbursement Agreement, (ii) the State Treasurer notifies the Paying Agent that there are not sufficient Net Revenues to make the deposits to the Reserve Account required by the Resolution or (iii) an Act of Bankruptcy occurs, the Paying Agent shall give, or cause to be given, written notice to each holder prior to the mandatory purchase date AND THE HOLDER OF THIS BOND, BY ACCEPTANCE HEREOF, AGREES TO SELL THIS BOND TO THE PAYING AGENT ON THE MANDATORY PURCHASE DATE SPECIFIED IN SUCH NOTICE AT A PRICE OF PAR PLUS, IF THE MANDATORY PURCHASE DATE IS A DATE OTHER THAN JUNE 1 OR DECEMBER 1, ACCRUED INTEREST HEREON, AND UPON SUCH PURCHASE TO SURRENDER THIS BOND, PROPERLY ENDORSED FOR TRANSFER IN BLANK.

Except as otherwise provided with respect to Bank Bonds, the Bonds that are stated to mature on December 1, 2010 shall bear interest to and including November 30, 1987, at the rate of seven and fifty hundredths percent (7.50%) per annum, the Bonds that are stated to mature on December 1, 2014 shall bear interest to and including November 30, 1988 at the rate of seven and seventy-five hundredths percent (7.75%) per annum, and the Bonds that are stated to mature on December 1, 2018 shall bear interest to and including November 30, 1989, at the rate of eight percent (8.00%) per annum. Thereafter, unless the Bonds shall have been converted to bear the Fixed Interest Rate (as hereinafter defined), the Bonds shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Adjustable Interest Rate for each period from and including December 1 in each year to and including November 30 in the next succeeding year (each of which 12-month periods is herein called a "Rate Period"), which shall be determined as hereinafter described:

Prior to establishing the Adjustable Interest Rate, a Preliminary Adjustable Interest Rate shall be determined. The Preliminary Adjustable Interest Rate for each Rate Period will be a rate determined by the Remarketing Agent on the Business Day next preceding November 1 in each year prior to the Fixed Rate Date in which an Adjustable Interest Rate is to be established (the "Determination Date") to be that rate which, in the judgment of the Remarketing Agent based on prevailing market rates, such judgment to be exercised in its sole discretion, is the minimum rate necessary for the Remarketing Agent (initially Goldman, Sachs & Co.) to sell all of the Bonds which may be delivered to the Paying Agent or deemed to have been tendered for purchase pursuant to the Resolution at par on the first day of such Rate Period.

On each Determination Date the Remarketing Agent shall notify the Paying Agent and the University of the Preliminary Adjustable Interest Rate for the next succeeding Rate Period by telephone or other telecommunications device and shall confirm such notice in writing as soon as practicable thereafter. Notice of such Preliminary Adjustable Interest Rate shall be mailed by first-class mail by the Paying Agent to each holder of Bonds that will bear interest at the Adjustable Interest Rate for the next Rate Period at his address as shown on the registration books on or before the second Business Day following such Determination Date. Such notice shall state (i) that the interest rate on the Bonds will be adjusted as of the next succeeding December 1 and (ii) the Preliminary Adjustable Interest Rate.

The Adjustable Interest Rate effective for each Rate Period prior to the Fixed Rate Date shall be a rate established by the Remarketing Agent on the third Business Day next preceding each Rate Period and shall be determined as hereinafter described. If no Bonds shall have been properly delivered to the Paying Agent or deemed to have been tendered for purchase on the first day of such Rate Period, the interest rate borne by all Bonds for such Rate Period will be a rate per annum equal to the Preliminary Adjustable Interest Rate determined for such Rate Period. If any Bonds shall have been properly delivered to the Paying Agent for purchase or deemed to have been tendered on the first day of such Rate Period, the interest rate borne for all Bonds for such Rate Period will be a rate determined by the Remarketing Agent to be that rate which, in the judgment of the Remarketing Agent based on prevailing market rates, such judgment to be exercised in its sole discretion, is the minimum rate necessary for the Remarketing Agent to sell all of the Bonds so delivered at par on the first day of such Rate Period.

On the Business Day following the determination of the Adjustable Interest Rate for the next succeeding Rate Period the Remarketing Agent shall notify the Paying Agent and the University of such Adjustable Interest Rate for such period by telephone or other telecommunications device and shall confirm such notice in writing as soon as practicable thereafter. Notice of the Adjustable Interest Rate for each Rate Period shall be mailed by first-class mail by the Paying Agent to each holder of Bonds on or before the second Business Day after its determination.

As to Bonds which are not Bank Bonds, in no event shall the Adjustable Interest Rate exceed fifteen percent (15%) per annum (the "Maximum Interest Rate") unless the University shall have amended the Resolution to approve a higher Maximum Interest Rate or be less than the Preliminary Adjustable Interest Rate.

If (i) the State Treasurer, the Bank, the Paying Agent and the Remarketing Agent shall have received a notice from the University given not less than 45 days in advance of December 1 in the Effective Year or in any year thereafter to the effect that the University elects to convert all of the Bonds to a Fixed Interest Rate on the next Fixed Rate Date together with an Opinion of bond counsel that such conversion will not cause interest on the Bonds to be subject to federal income tax, or (ii) at least forty-five (45) days prior to the expiration date of the Credit Facility, or any Substitute Credit Facility or Alternate Credit Facility, the University shall not have delivered a new Substitute Credit Facility or Alternate Credit Facility to the Paying Agent in accordance with the provisions of the Resolution, a Fixed Interest Rate for the Bonds of each stated maturity shall be established at a rate computed as hereinafter set forth on the next Fixed Rate Date.

Prior to establishing a Fixed Interest Rate for the Bonds of each stated maturity, a Preliminary Fixed Interest Rate for the Bonds of each stated maturity shall be determined by the Remarketing Agent. The Preliminary Fixed Interest Rate for the Bonds of each stated maturity will be that rate which, in the judgment of the Remarketing Agent based on prevailing market rates, such judgment to be exercised in its sole discretion, is the minimum rate necessary for the Remarketing Agent to sell all of the Bonds of such maturity deemed to have been tendered at par on the Fixed Rate Date. On the Determination Date, the Remarketing Agent shall notify the Paying Agent and the State Treasurer of each Preliminary Fixed Interest Rate by telephone or other telecommunications device and shall confirm such notice in writing as soon as practicable thereafter. Notice of the Preliminary Fixed Interest Rates will be mailed by first class mail by the Paying Agent to each holder of Bonds at his address as shown on the registration books on or before the second Business Day following such Determination Date. Such notice shall (i) specify the Fixed Rate Date, (ii) state that after the Fixed Rate Date the holders shall no longer be entitled to deliver Bonds for purchase pursuant to the Series Resolution and that funds provided by the Credit Facility will no longer be available to pay principal on the Bonds, (iii) state, if available, what the Moody's rating on the Bond will be after the Fixed Rate Date, (iv) state that the interest rate on the Bonds of each stated maturity will be converted as of the Fixed Rate Date to be the Preliminary Fixed Interest Rate for such maturity or, if higher, the Fixed Interest Rate for such maturity determined as provided in the Series Resolution and that such rate will remain in effect from and including the Fixed Rate Date until payment of the principal or redemption price of the Bonds of such maturity shall have been made or provided for in accordance with the Series Resolution, whether at maturity, upon redemption or otherwise, (v) state the Preliminary Interest Rates for the Bonds of each stated maturity, (vi) state that all holders who wish to continue to own Bonds must give notice to that effect to the Paying Agent no later than 4:00 P.M., New York time, on the November 15 prior to the Fixed Rate Date or be deemed to have tendered their Bonds for purchase and (vii) state that any holders of Bonds that are deemed to have tendered their Bonds shall not be entitled to any payment (including any interest to accrue subsequently to the Fixed Rate Date) other than the purchase price for such Bonds which shall be equal to the unpaid principal amount of such Bonds, and such Bonds shall no longer be entitled to the benefits of the Resolution except for the purpose of payment of the purchase price therefor, which payment shall be made only upon the surrender of such Bonds at the principal corporate trust office of the Paying Agent.

The Remarketing Agent shall determine the Fixed Interest Rate for the Bonds of each stated maturity on the third Business Day next preceding the Fixed Rate Date as hereinafter described. If no Bonds of a stated maturity shall be deemed to have been tendered to the Paying Agent for purchase on the Fixed Rate Date, the interest rate borne by all Bonds of such stated maturity will be a rate per annum equal to the Preliminary Fixed Interest Rate for the Bonds of such stated maturity. If any Bonds of a stated maturity shall be deemed to have been tendered to the Paying Agent for purchase on the Fixed Rate Date, the interest rate borne by all Bonds of such stated maturity will be a rate determined by the Remarketing Agent to be that rate, which, in the judgment of the Remarketing Agent based on prevailing market rates, such judgment to be exercised in its sole discretion, is the minimum rate necessary for the Remarketing Agent to sell all Bonds of such stated maturity deemed to have been tendered at par on the Fixed Interest Date.

On the Business Day following the determination of the Fixed Interest Rates the Remarketing Agent shall notify the Paying Agent and the University of the Fixed Interest Rates by telephone or other telecommunications device and shall confirm such notice in writing as soon as practicable thereafter. Notice of the Fixed Interest Rates shall be mailed by first-class mail by the Paying Agent to each holder of Bonds on or before the second Business Day after their determination.

The determination of the Adjusted Interest Rate and the Fixed Interest Rates by the Remarketing Agent shall be conclusive and binding upon the holders of the Bonds.

On the Fixed Rate Date, the registered owner of any Bond will be deemed to have elected to have such Bond purchased by the Paying Agent, unless such owner notifies the Paying Agent in writing received by the November 15 prior to the Fixed Rate Date, of its desire to retain such Bonds after such Fixed Rate Date.

In the event that any Bonds tendered or deemed to have been tendered are not delivered to the Paying Agent on the appropriate tender date, no further interest on such Bonds shall be payable to the prior holders thereof after such tender date. Any such Bonds shall be deemed to have been sold by such prior holders and such prior holders shall have recourse solely to the funds held by the Paying Agent for the purchase of such Bonds, and the Paying Agent shall not recognize any further transfer of such Bonds by such prior holder.

The Bonds are subject to optional redemption prior to and on the Fixed Rate Date, at the option of the University, on any Interest Payment Date on or after December 1, 1987 with respect to Bonds maturing in 2010, December 1, 1988 with respect to Bond maturing in 2014 and December 1, 1989 with respect to Bonds maturing in 2018, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus interest accrued to the redemption date.

The Tendered Bank Bond Interest Rate shall equal (i) for the period commencing on the date of delivery of a Bank Bond to the Bank or its designee to and including the date 30 days thereafter, the lesser of (x) the sum of 100% of the Federal Funds Rate (as defined in the Resolution) in effect from time to time plus 1/2 of 1% per annum calculated on the basis of a 360-day year and (y) 100% of the Prime Lending Rate in effect from time to time calculated on the basis of a 365/366-day year and (ii) after such initial 30-day period, 100% of the Prime Lending Rate in effect from time to time calculated on the basis of a 365/366-day year.

(b) Prior to establishing a Fixed Interest Rate for the Bonds of each stated maturity, a Preliminary Fixed Interest Rate for the Bonds of each stated maturity shall be determined by the Remarketing Agent on the Determination Date next preceding the Fixed Rate Date. The Preliminary Fixed Interest Rate for the Bonds of each stated maturity will be that rate which, in the judgment of the Remarketing Agent based on prevailing market rates, such judgment to be exercised in its sole discretion, is the minimum rate necessary for the Remarketing Agent to sell all of the Bonds of such maturity deemed to have been tendered pursuant to Section 402 hereof at par at 10:00 A.M., New York time, on the Fixed Rate Date.

The Remarketing Agent shall determine the Fixed Interest Rate for the Bonds of each stated maturity on the third Business Day next preceding the Fixed Rate Date as hereinafter described. If no Bonds of a stated maturity shall be deemed to have been tendered to the Paying Agent for purchase on the Fixed Rate Date, the Fixed Interest Rate for the Bonds of such stated maturity will be a rate per annum equal to the Preliminary Fixed Interest Rate for the Bonds of such stated maturity. If any Bonds of a stated maturity shall be deemed to have been tendered to the Paying Agent for purchase on the Fixed Rate Date, the Fixed Interest Rate borne by all Bonds of such stated maturity will be a rate determined by the Remarketing Agent to be that rate, which, in the judgment of the Remarketing Agent based on prevailing market rates, such judgment to be exercised in its sole discretion, is the minimum rate necessary for the Remarketing Agent to sell all Bonds of such stated maturity deemed to have been tendered at par at 10:00 A.M., New York time, on the Fixed Interest Date.

On the Business Day following the determination of the Fixed Interest Rates the Remarketing Agent shall notify the Paying Agent and the University of the Fixed Interest Rates by telephone or other telecommunications device and shall confirm such notice in writing as soon as practicable thereafter. The Paying Agent shall then promptly notify the State Treasurer of the Fixed Interest Rates. Notice of the Fixed Interest Rates shall be mailed by first-class mail by the Paying Agent to each holder of Bonds on or before the second Business Day after their determination.

(d) In no event shall any Fixed Interest Rate exceed the Maximum Interest Rate unless the Board shall have amended the Resolution to provide a higher Maximum Interest Rate pursuant to Section 801 hereof.

(e) In addition to bearing interest at the Fixed Interest Rate as described above, Bank Bonds shall bear interest as provided in Section 202 hereof during any period in which such Bank Bonds are held by the Bank or its designee.

The determination of each Adjustable Interest Rate and the Fixed Interest Rates by the Remarketing Agent shall be conclusive and binding upon the State Treasurer, the Bank, the University, the Holders and the Paying Agent. Failure by the Paying Agent to give any notice required hereunder, or any defect therein, shall not affect the interest rate borne by the Bonds or the rights of the Holders pursuant to Section 206 hereof.

(a) (i) In the case of any Holder other than the Holder of Bank Bonds, on any December 1 commencing, for the 2010 Bonds on December 1, 1987, for the 2014 Bonds on December 1, 1988 and for the 2018 Bonds on December 1, 1989, including the Fixed Rate Date, any Bond shall be purchased by the Paying Agent upon the demand of the holder thereof, at a purchase price equal to the principal amount thereof, if such Bond, together with a properly completed Notice of Election Regarding Demand For Purchase of Bond at Bondholder Option and Assignment in substantially the form hereinabove set forth executed by such Holder, shall have been delivered to the Paying Agent at its principal corporate trust office, not earlier than October 15 and not later than four o'clock p.m., New York time on the November 15 (or the next succeeding Business Day, if such November 15 is not a Business Day) next preceding such December 1.

(ii) In the case of any Holder that is a registered investment company, on any December 1 commencing, for the 2010 Bonds on December 1, 1987, for the 2014 Bonds on December 1, 1988 and for the 2018 Bonds on December 1, 1989, including the Fixed Rate Date, any Bond shall be purchased by the Paying Agent upon the demand of the holder thereof, at a purchase price equal to the principal amount thereof, if a properly completed Notice of Election Regarding Demand For Purchase of Bond at Bondholder Option and Assignment in substantially the form hereinabove set forth executed by such holder shall have been delivered to the Paying Agent at its principal corporate trust office, not earlier than October 15 and not later than four o'clock p.m., New York time, on the November 15 (or the next succeeding Business Day, if such November 15 is not a Business day) next preceding such December 1. Such notice shall be irrevocable and upon receipt of such notice by the Paying Agent, the Holder of any Bond with respect to which such notice was given shall be deemed to have tendered such Bond effective as of the next December 1 and any such holder shall have only those rights with respect to such Tendered Bond as are set forth in Section 207 hereof.

(b) Bonds tendered for purchase in accordance with the foregoing shall be remarketed in accordance with Sections 301(c) and (d) hereof. The purchase of such Bonds shall not extinguish the debt represented thereby.

(c) After the Fixed Rate Date, Holders shall have no right to tender Bonds for purchase.

(d) In the case of Bonds deemed to have been tendered pursuant to Section 403 only, if the Mandatory Tender Date shall be a date other than June 1 or December 1, the purchase price of such Bonds shall be equal to the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest thereon through the Mandatory Tender Date.

After the Tender Date applicable to any Tendered Bonds, any Holder of such Tendered Bonds shall not be entitled to any payment (including any interest to accrue subsequently to the applicable Tender Date) other than the purchase price for such Bonds which shall be equal to the unpaid principal amount of such Tendered Bonds (except for Bonds deemed to be tendered pursuant to Section 403 hereof), and such Bonds shall no longer be entitled to the benefits of the Resolution, except for the purpose of payment of the purchase price therefor. Payment of the purchase price of any Tendered Bond shall be made only upon the presentment and surrender of such Bond at the principal corporate trust office of the Paying Agent. Any such Bonds shall be deemed to have been sold by such prior Holders and such prior Holders shall have recourse solely to the funds held by the Paying Agent for the purchase of such Bonds, and the Paying Agent shall not recognize any further transfer of such Bonds by such prior Holders. In the case of any Tendered Bond, whether or not such Bond is delivered to the Paying Agent, the University shall cause to be executed, and the Paying Agent shall authenticate and deliver to the new holder in accordance with Section 304 hereof, a new Bond of like date and tenor in lieu of and in substitution for such Tendered Bond. Interest on any such Bonds from such Tender Date shall be payable to the purchaser thereof in accordance with Section 208.

(a) So long as any of the proceeds of the Bonds remain on deposit to the credit of the Interest Account, the State Treasurer shall: (i) not later than the Business Day preceding each Interest Payment Date withdraw from the Interest Account and remit by wire transfer to the Paying Agent an amount sufficient to pay all interest except for Additional Interest or Additional Default Interest coming due on the Bonds on such Interest Payment Date; and (ii) not later than the tenth day next preceding each Interest Payment Date, withdraw from the Special Fund and deposit in the Bank Interest Account, an amount equal to the Additional Interest and Additional Default Interest to be paid on Bank Bonds on such Interest Payment Date, assuming that the rate of interest payable on the Bank Bonds during the ten-day period preceding such Interest Payment Date shall be equal to the interest rate payable on the Bank Bonds on the date of the deposit.

(c) Prior to the Fixed Rate Date, not later than the Business Day preceding an Interest Payment Date for all Bonds, the State Treasurer shall withdraw first from the Interest Account, to the extent it contains Aged Money, and second from the Reserve Account on a first-in first-out basis, and remit by wire transfer to the Paying Agent, an amount sufficient to pay interest on all Bonds which are not Bank Bonds and interest on Bank Bonds in an amount not exceeding the interest payable at the Maximum Interest Rate.

(d) Prior to the Fixed Rate Date, not later than the Business Day preceding an Interest Payment Date for all Bonds, the State Treasurer shall withdraw from the Bank Interest Account and remit by wire transfer to the Paying Agent the amount of interest payable on the Bank Bonds which exceeds interest on such Bank Bonds payable at the Maximum Interest Rate.

(e) Prior to the Fixed Rate Date, not later than the Business Day preceding an Interest Payment Date for Bank Bonds only, the State Treasurer shall withdraw from the Bank Interest Account and remit by wire transfer to the Paying Agent the amount of interest payable on the Bank Bonds.

(f) Not later than the tenth day preceding each Interest Payment Date, the Bank shall notify the University and the State Treasurer by telephone (confirmed in writing), telecopy, computer transmission or other similar means, of the amount of interest payable on Bank Bonds on such Interest Payment Date, assuming that the rate of interest payable on the Bank Bonds shall not change during the ten-day period preceding the Interest Payment Date. Except as provided in (g) below, if the rate of interest payable on the Bank Bonds increases during the ten-day period preceding the Interest Payment Date, the State Treasurer shall withdraw from the Special Fund and remit by wire transfer to the Paying Agent on the Business Day preceding the Interest Payment Date, the amount of any such increase. Except as provided in (g) below, if the rate of interest payable on the Bank Bonds decreases during such ten-day period, the State Treasurer shall deposit the amount of any excess in the Special Fund.

(g) On the third day preceding each Interest Payment Date, the Bank shall notify the University and the State Treasurer by telephone (confirmed in writing), telecopy, computer transmission or similar means, of any change in the rate of interest payable on the Bank Bonds since the giving of the notice described in (f). If there shall be any change in the rate of interest payable on Bank Bonds during the three-day period preceding the Interest Payment Date, the amount of any resulting increase or reduction of interest payable on the Bank Bonds shall be credited or debited, as the case may be, against the interest payable on the Bank Bonds on the next succeeding Interest Payment Date.

(h) After the Fixed Rate Date, the State Treasurer shall, no later than the Business Day preceding each Interest Payment Date, withdraw from the Interest Account and remit by wire transfer to the Paying Agent an amount sufficient to pay all interest including Additional Interest and Additional Default Interest coming due on the Bonds on such Interest Payment Date.

(i) Payment shall be made by the Paying Agent, in the case of Bonds other than Bank Bonds, by check mailed by the close of business on the last day of the month immediately preceding the Interest Payment Date to the registered owner at his address as it appears on the registration books of the Paying Agent as of the close of business on the Record Date immediately preceding the Interest Payment Date and, in the case of Bank Bonds, as provided in Section 2.09 of the Reimbursement Agreement on each Interest Payment Date.

(j) Each notice that the Bank is required to give to the State Treasurer, Commonwealth of Virginia, 101 North 14th Street, James Monroe Building, Richmond, Virginia 23215, shall set forth the manner in which any amounts set forth in such notice were calculated.

(a) Not later than (i) the Business Day preceding each November 20, commencing November 20, 2002, and (ii) the tenth day preceding any date on which principal of Bank Bonds (other than Bank Bonds the principal of which is payable on demand) is due, the Paying Agent shall give notice to the State Treasurer, Commonwealth of Virginia, 101 North 14th Street, James Monroe Building, Richmond, Virginia 23215, of the amount required to pay principal of the Bonds then coming due, whether by mandatory redemption or maturity and the State Treasurer shall thereupon transfer a sum equal to such amount from the Special Fund to the Sinking Fund Account. The State Treasurer shall remit such sums from the Sinking Fund Account to the Paying Agent by wire transfer, from Net Revenues made available by the University, not later than the Business Day preceding the date such sums are due to pay principal of the Bonds.

(b) The Paying Agent shall, no later than 3:00 p.m., New York time, on the Business Day preceding each day on which principal is due prior to and including the Fixed Interest Date, on which principal of the Bonds comes due, whether by optional redemption, mandatory redemption, acceleration or maturity, submit the necessary draw certificates to ensure that, on each December 1 prior to and including the Fixed Rate Date, the Paying Agent shall draw on the Credit Facility or any Substitute Credit Facility or Alternate Credit Facility an amount sufficient to pay the principal of all Bonds other than Bank Bonds becoming due upon presentation and surrender thereof. Prior to and on the Fixed Rate Date, the Paying Agent shall pay all principal coming due on all Bonds other than Bank Bonds, whether at maturity, upon mandatory or optional redemption or upon acceleration, solely from moneys drawn on the Credit Facility or any Substitute Credit Facility or Alternate Credit Facility. No drawing under the Credit Facility or any Substitute Credit Facility or Alternate Credit Facility shall be made or proceeds of any drawing applied to pay the principal of any Bank Bonds.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Resolution, Bonds paid or deemed paid with the proceeds of a drawing on the Credit Facility shall be transferred to the Bank in exchange for the proceeds of such drawing and shall not be deemed to be paid for purposes of the Resolution, shall remain Outstanding and shall continue to be an obligation of the University until such time as the principal amount thereof and interest accrued thereon (including Additional Interest and Additional Default Interest) has been paid by the University to the Bank as reimbursement for such drawings. Principal of and interest on the Bank Bonds shall be paid at the times and in the manner set forth in Sections 202, 208 and 209 hereof. Bonds which are not surrendered by the prior Holders thereof on the date of maturity, redemption or purchase thereof shall be entitled only to the amounts held by the Paying Agent for the payment of such Bonds, and the University shall cause to be executed and the Paying Agent shall authenticate and deliver to the Bank or other purchaser of such Bonds, a new Bond of like tenor in lieu of and in substitution for such Bond.

(d) Prior to and on the Fixed Rate Date, within one (1) hour after the Paying Agent has received the money drawn on the Credit Facility to pay principal of all Bonds other than Bank Bonds and the money provided by the State Treasurer pursuant to subsection (a) hereof, the Paying Agent shall notify the Bank that a principal payment is to be made and use the sums received from the State Treasurer pursuant to subsection (a) hereof (i) to reimburse the Bank for such draw and (ii) to pay any principal then due on Bank Bonds.

(e) Following the Fixed Rate Date, within one (1) hour after the Paying Agent has received the money provided by the State Treasurer pursuant to subsection (a) hereof the Paying Agent shall notify the Bank (if it is the Holder of any Bank Bonds) that a principal payment is to be made and shall use the sums received from the State Treasurer pursuant to subsection (a) hereof to pay the principal of the Bonds, including Bank Bonds, when due.

In the case of Bonds deemed to have been tendered pursuant to Section 403 only, if the Mandatory Tender Date shall be a date other than June 1 or December 1, on the Business Day preceding such Mandatory Tender Date the State Treasurer shall withdraw, first, from the Interest Account to the extent it contains Aged Money, and, second, from the Reserve Account on a first-in-first-out basis, and remit by wire transfer to the Paying Agent an amount sufficient to pay the portion of the purchase price of all such Bonds which is attributable to accrued interest.

If at any time any Bank shall default in its obligation to honor a Principal Drawing or a Tender Drawing (each as defined in the Reimbursement Agreement) under the Credit Facility or any Substitute Credit Facility or Alternate Credit Facility with respect to Bonds of any maturity, the Paying Agent shall no longer be required to purchase Bonds of such maturity that are tendered pursuant to Section 206(a) hereof or deemed to have been tendered pursuant to Sections 204, 402, 403 or 801 hereof and no Holder shall be entitled to any payment with respect to the purchase price of such Bonds from the University. However, notwithstanding any other provisions of this Resolution, beginning on the date of such default by the Bank, all Bonds of such maturity shall bear interest at the rate of fifteen percent (15%) per annum to and including the November 30 following the date on which a new Alternate Credit Facility is obtained pursuant to Section 402 hereof. Thereafter the Bonds shall bear interest at the rate determined in accordance with the other provisions of this Resolution. Upon a Bank default, the University agrees to use its best efforts to obtain an Alternate Credit Facility prior to the next December 1.

Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Resolution, principal of Bank Bonds shall be payable on the dates and in the amounts set forth in the applicable Credit Agreement.

Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Resolution, the Bank shall not have the right to tender Bank Bonds for purchase pursuant to Section 206 hereof or to be deemed to have tendered its Bank Bonds pursuant to Sections 204(c), 206, 402, 403 or 801 hereof, but the Bank shall be subject to the provisions of Section 305.

(a) On each November 15, commencing November 15, 1987, prior to the Fixed Rate Date and fifteen (15) days prior to the Mandatory Tender Date, the Paying Agent shall give notice by telephone, telecopier, telegram or other telecommunications device, promptly confirmed by a written notice, to the State Treasurer, the University, the Remarketing Agent and the Bank specifying the principal amount of Bonds, if any, tendered or deemed to have been tendered for purchase on the next succeeding Tender Date pursuant to Sections 204(c), 206, 402, 403 and 801 hereof and the amount necessary for said purchase.

(b) The Remarketing Agent shall offer for sale an aggregate principal amount of Bonds equal to the amount of Bonds as to which the Paying Agent has delivered the notice specified in Section 301(a) above except that Bonds deemed to have been tendered pursuant to Section 403 hereof shall not be remarketed.

(c) Upon receipt of notice from the Paying Agent of any Bonds tendered or deemed to have been tendered in accordance with Sections 204(c), 206, 402 and 801 hereof, the Remarketing Agent shall offer for sale and use its best efforts to sell all such Bonds on the next December 1, at a price equal to the principal amount thereof and with an interest rate determined pursuant to Sections 203 and 204 hereof. All Bonds sold by the Remarketing Agent pursuant to this section shall be sold at the Adjustable Interest Rate prior to the Fixed Rate Date and at the Fixed Interest Rate on and after the Fixed Rate Date. The Remarketing Agent shall notify the Paying Agent by 11:00 A.M., New York time, on the Business Day prior to each December 1 of the principal amount of Bonds sold pursuant to this paragraph, and the names and addresses of the purchasers of such Bonds. The proceeds received from the purchaser of any Bonds resold by the Remarketing Agent shall be paid by the Remarketing Agent to the Paying Agent by 11:00 A.M., New York time, on such December 1 for payment to the holders who have tendered or are deemed to have tendered such Bonds.

(d) On the appropriate Tender Date, the Paying Agent shall draw on the Credit Facility an amount sufficient, together with the proceeds received from the Remarketing Agent, to pay the Holders tendering or deemed to have tendered their Bonds for purchase on said date pursuant to Sections 206(a), 204, 402, 403 and 801 hereof. The Paying Agent shall, not later than 3:00 P.M., New York time, on the Business Day preceding each Tender Date, submit the necessary draw certificates to ensure that, on each Tender Date, the Paying Agent shall draw on the Credit Facility in an amount sufficient, together with the proceeds received from the Remarketing Agent, to pay the purchase price of any Bonds tendered or deemed to have been tendered for purchase on such Tender Date. Bonds purchased with the proceeds of a drawing under the Credit Facility shall be delivered to the Bank in exchange for the proceeds of such drawing.

(e) The Remarketing Agent shall continue to offer for sale Bank Bonds for the account of the Bank and shall use its best efforts to sell, at a price not less than the principal amount thereof, any Bank Bonds.

(g) The portion of the purchase price of Bonds attributable to interest shall be paid only from the sources specified in Section 210 hereof.

(h) The University and the Remarketing Agent shall, upon the remarketing of any Tendered Bonds, deliver to the Paying Agent in its capacity as Custodian under the Custody Agreement, dated as of November 1, 1984, by and between the Bank and the Paying Agent (the "Custody Agreement"), the certificates required to be delivered by each of them by Section 3 of the Custody Agreement in order to cause the automatic reinstatement of the obligation of the Bank to honor drawings under the Credit Facility for the purpose of paying the principal portion of the purchase price of such Tendered Bonds in an amount equal to the principal amount of such Tendered Bonds.

The University may reduce the amount of the Credit Facility, but in no event shall the amount of the Credit Facility (as so reduced) be less than the aggregate principal amount of Bonds Outstanding as determined by the Paying Agent.

Bonds tendered or deemed to have been tendered to the Paying Agent for purchase and remarketed pursuant to Sections 301 and 302 shall be registered by the Paying Agent in the name of the transferee thereof. Bonds purchased by the University shall be cancelled by the Paying Agent. Bank Bonds held by the Paying Agent for the account of the Bank shall be held or delivered in accordance with Section 305 hereof.

(a) The Paying Agent shall hold Bank Bonds for the account of the Bank and deliver such Bank Bonds to the Bank at its direction. Unless such Bank Bonds have been delivered to the Bank (in which event the Paying Agent shall notify the Remarketing Agent), the Paying Agent shall deliver such Bank Bonds on one Business Day's notice to any purchaser selected by the Remarketing Agent upon payment of the principal of and interest accrued on the Bank Bonds. The portion of proceeds received from the purchaser of any Bonds so remarketed and resold pursuant to the foregoing sentence, representing the principal amount of such Bank Bond, shall be paid to the Bank and the portion of such proceeds representing accrued interest, if any, shall be paid to the State Treasurer for deposit in the Special Fund. Any interest owed to the Bank for such Bank Bond (being all interest including any Additional Interest and any Additional Default Interest accrued and unpaid as of the purchase date) shall be paid by the State Treasurer from the Net Revenues and shall be deemed a payment of interest due and payable on the purchase date.

(b) In the event of a redemption of any Bank Bonds, the Paying Agent shall remit to the Bank the redemption price of such Bank Bonds, including the Additional Interest and Additional Default Interest, if any, due on such Bank Bonds.

(c) Upon finding a purchaser for all or any Bank Bonds, the Remarketing Agent shall so notify by telephone notice the Paying Agent and the Bank by 3:00 P.M., New York time, and the Bank shall either (i) deliver such Bank Bonds to the Paying Agent on the Business Day after it receives such notice from the Remarketing Agent or (ii) retain such Bank Bonds; provided, however, that if the Bank elects to retain such Bank Bonds instead of delivering them to the Paying Agent upon request, such Bank Bonds shall no longer bear Additional Interest. Upon delivery of such Bonds to the Paying Agent, and upon receipt from the purchaser or the Remarketing Agent of the principal amount and accrued interest (other than Additional Interest and Additional Default Interest) thereon and from the State Treasurer of the interest (including Additional Interest and Additional Default Interest) owed to the Bank thereon, the Paying Agent shall register and deliver such Bond to such purchaser or the Remarketing Agent, as the case may be, and shall pay to the Bank the par amount of such Bank Bonds together with the interest (including Additional Interest and Additional Default Interest) accrued thereon and shall pay the accrued interest received from the purchaser or the Remarketing Agent to the State Treasurer for deposit, on behalf of the University, in the Special Fund.

Anything in the Resolution to the contrary notwithstanding, there shall be no purchases or sales of Bonds (other than Bank Bonds) pursuant to this Article III after the Fixed Rate Date.

Anything in the Resolution to the contrary notwithstanding, the Remarketing Agent shall not sell to the University Bonds tendered or deemed to have been tendered for purchase in accordance with Sections 204(c), 206, 402 or 801 hereof to the Paying Agent.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Credit Facility, as initially issued, will expire on December 14, 1991, unless it is extended in accordance with its terms. A Substitute Credit Facility may be substituted for the Credit Facility or any Substitute Credit Facility at any time if the University has first obtained an opinion of Bond Counsel to the effect that such substitution will not cause interest on the Bonds to become subject to federal income taxes; provided that prior to the effective date of the new Substitute Credit Facility the University delivers to the Paying Agent (i) the Substitute Credit Facility and (ii) a letter from Moody's stating that the rating assigned by Moody's to the Bonds will not be lowered because of the substitution of such Substitute Credit Facility. The Paying Agent shall notify the Holders of such substitution within five days after the effective date of such new Substitute Credit Facility. In no event shall the Credit Facility be terminated or released prior to the effective date of the Substitute Credit Facility.

(a) Effective on any December 2, beginning December 2 in the Effective Year, an Alternate Credit Facility may be substituted for the Credit Facility or any Substitute Credit Facility or Alternate Credit Facility, if the University (i) delivers to the Paying Agent such Alternate Credit Facility at least sixty (60) days in advance of such December 2 and (ii) has obtained an opinion of Bond Counsel to the effect that the delivery of the Alternate Credit Facility will not cause interest on the Bonds to become subject to federal income taxes.

(b) Notice of the substitution of the Alternate Credit Facility will be mailed by first-class mail by the Paying Agent to each Holder at his address as shown on the registration books on or before the second Business Day following the Determination Date next preceding the Alternate Credit Date, concurrently with the notice required to be mailed by the Paying Agent to all holders pursuant to Section 203(b) hereof. Such notice shall state (i) that the existing Credit Facility, Substitute Credit Facility or Alternate Credit Facility is being replaced by a new Alternate Credit Facility, (ii) the principal terms of such new Alternate Credit Facility, (iii) the ratings that will be assigned to the Bonds by Moody's as a result of the substitution of such new Alternate Credit Facility, (iv) that all Holders who wish to continue to own Bonds after the Alternate Credit Date must give notice to that effect to the Paying Agent no later than 4:00 P.M., New York time, on the November 15 prior to the Alternate Credit Date or be deemed to have tendered their Bonds for purchase and (v) that any Holders of Bonds that are deemed to have tendered their Bonds shall not be entitled to any payment (including any interest to accrue subsequently to the Alternate Credit Date) other than the purchase price for such Bonds which shall be equal to the unpaid principal amount of such Bonds, and such Bonds shall no longer be entitled to the benefits of the Resolution except for the purpose of payment of the purchase price therefor, which payment shall be made only upon the surrender of such Bonds at the principal corporate trust office of the Paying Agent.

(c) Any Holder desiring to retain such Bonds after the Alternate Credit Date must notify the Paying Agent in writing received not later than the November 15 prior to the Alternate Credit Date. Said notice shall state in substance: (1) The numbers and principal amounts of the Bonds which the Holder wishes to retain after the Alternate Credit Date;(2) A statement that the Holder wishes to continue to hold the Bonds specified in (1) above; and(3) The Holder is aware that the rating assigned to the Bonds by Moody's may be reduced or changed. Any Holders not providing the Paying Agent with the notice described above shall be deemed to have tendered their Bonds to the Paying Agent effective as of the Alternate Credit Date and any such Holders shall have only those rights with respect to such Tendered Bonds as are set forth in Section 207 hereof.

(d) If the Bank shall have defaulted in its obligation to honor a Principal Drawing or a Tender Drawing (each as defined in the Reimbursement Agreement) under the Credit Facility or any Substitute Credit Facility or Alternate Credit Facility and a new Alternate Credit Facility is obtained pursuant to Section 211 hereof, it may become effective on any date without compliance with the procedures set forth in subsections (b) and (c) above, except that the Holders shall be notified by the Paying Agent that an Alternate Credit Facility has been obtained.

If (i) the Bank gives notice to the Paying Agent requiring the Paying Agent to cause the mandatory tender for purchase of all Bonds on the Mandatory Tender Date as a result of an event of default under the Reimbursement Agreement (or similar agreement with respect to a Substitute Credit Facility or Alternate Credit Facility), (ii) the State Treasurer gives notice to the Paying Agent that there are not sufficient Net Revenues made available by the University to make the deposit to the Reserve Account required by Section 605(d) hereof or (iii) an Act of Bankruptcy shall have occurred, the Holders of all Bonds (other than Bank Bonds) shall be deemed to have tendered their Bonds to the Paying Agent effective as of the Mandatory Tender Date and the Holders of such Tendered Bonds shall have only those rights with respect to such Tendered Bonds as are set forth in Section 207 hereof. Upon receipt of such notice from the Bank or the State Treasurer the Paying Agent shall give written notice to the Holders as soon as practicable thereafter, but in any event not later than twenty days prior to the Mandatory Tender Date, stating: (i) that all Bonds shall be deemed to have been tendered as of the Mandatory Tender Date, (ii) that the Holders of all such Bonds shall not be entitled to any payment (including any interest to accrue subsequently to the Mandatory Tender Date) other than the purchase price for such Bonds which shall be equal to the unpaid principal amount of such Bonds, and such Bonds shall no longer be entitled to the benefits of the Resolution except for the purpose of payment of the purchase price therefor, which payment shall be made only upon the surrender of such Bonds at the principal corporate trust office of the Paying Agent; and (iii) that the Holders will not have the right to elect to retain their Bonds.
