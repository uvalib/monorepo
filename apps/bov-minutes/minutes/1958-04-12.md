The Board accordingly reelected Mr. Berkeley as Secretary for the four-year term ending on 28 February 1962.

In response to a resolution of the Board, as noted below, the Rector appointed as a special committee to study student publications, and to report back to the Executive Committee with recommendations for action to be taken prior to the close of the present session on June 9th, the following: Visitors Greear (chairman), Bryan, and Martin.

There followed a discussion of the heavy financial burden imposed on the University by the failure of county and city governments to provide adequately for the care of indigents at the University Hospital.

The Board resolved that the Medical Committee make a fresh study of the problem of indigent hospital costs and proceed with a definite plan for remedial action, preferably through the General Assembly.

In response to a letter of 30 January 1958 from Dean Hunter presented to the Board by the President, the Board adopted the following resolution

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia that the Department of Social and Environmental Medicine in the School of Medicine be and it is hereby renamed the Department of Preventive Medicine.

President Darden discussed the progress on Newcomb Hall and plans for its opening, and read to the Board the following letter from the Comptroller which it had not been practicable for the Board to consider on February 1st:

I note that a copy of Mr. Minor's opinion concerning the authority of the Board to reduce the library fee has been sent to you. Based on this opinion, I should like to recommend that the Board be asked this Saturday to reduce the library fee from the present **$20.00** to **$6.00**, and that it be made applicable to all students enrolled. Based on the estimated enrollment next session of **5,000**, this will yield **$30,000**, an amount more than adequate to cover the principal and interest charges.

I should like to recommend that the Board establish a student union fee to defray the major part of the cost of operating Newcomb Hall. I should like to recommend that this fee be **$14.00**, which would yield **$70,000**, based on the projected enrollment next session. Thus, the total charge to students would remain the same.

If at all possible, I hope that the Board can consider the matter this Saturday as we should like to make the change in as many catalogs as possible, as well as in other notices which have to be prepared very soon for distribution to entering students.

After discussion the Board adopted the following resolution:

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia that the present Library Building Fee be and it is hereby reduced from twenty dollars **($20.00)** a session to six dollars **($6.00)** a session,

RESOLVED further that a Student Union Fee of fourteen dollars **($14.00)** a session be and it is hereby established in support of the operating costs of Newcomb Hall,

RESOLVED further that payment of both the Library Building Fee and the Student Union Fee be required of all regularly enrolled students in the University, effective at the beginning of the 1958-59 session.

The President read to the Board the following letter:

May I take this opportunity to submit the attached proposal for revising the statement of fees on pages 34 and 35 in the catalogue of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. If these proposals meet with your approval, would you please submit them to the Board for their action if this is necessary.

Furthermore, I would like to establish some uniformity of overall graduate student fees and costs, for students in all departments of the Graduate School, where, because of the diverse subject matters to be studied, there are considerable differences in the proportion of course work to laboratory work and therefore, in the past, different rates of tuition. It seems to me, that a candidate for the Doctor's degree should pay full fees for at least two academic sessions while he is completing his course program and the reduced fees for one or more academic sessions while he is completing his research, dissertation, and other requirements, or if the student requires more than three or four years because of part-time employment, he should pay the equivalent, i.e., half-time fees for four academic sessions plus the additional necessary sessions of part-time fees.

Finally, I should like to propose that a limited amount of University loan funds be made available to graduate students on a special basis. Mr. Moyer advises me that some of the special loan funds do not seem to be much used. Graduate students are mature, most of them with family responsibilities, and the possession of a Doctor's degree means an increase in their future salaries of up to a **$1000** a year. Therefore, it would be a sound financial investment for a graduate student to incur even a substantial debt, in order to devote full-time to his degree program and earn the degree promptly, rather than working part-time and delaying his degree several years. Our regular graduate fellowships will nearly support a single student for the nine months session, but it is useless to offer a stipend of **$1000** plus the tuition fee to a man with a wife and one or two small children. There are even some single students who must devote so much time and energy to an outside job for support, that they are unable to earn the very high grades necessary for them to compete successfully for a du Pont Fellowship, so they are caught in a kind of vicious circle of never getting their head sufficiently above water to be able to proceed full-time with their graduate work.

If these considerations seem to you to have some merit, would you be willing to authorize a committee consisting of Mr. Shea, Mr. Vaughan, myself and perhaps others, to submit some definite recommendations for making loans in special cases, up to **$1000** or **$1200** a year at an interest rate of **3%**? With the prospect of additional fellowship programs from both the federal government and charitable foundations, there will not be a large number of cases requiring loans of this magnitude. However, there will be individual cases in which a substantial loan will make a great deal of difference.

During the discussion that followed, President Darden noted that the proposals had been studied and were favored by the Comptroller. The Board adopted the following resolution

RESOLVED that the Catalogue of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences be revised, effective for the session of 1958-59, so that the two paragraphs under the heading PART-TIME FEES shall read as follows:

"Students taking only one subject pay one-third of the regular tuition fee, plus the library building, medical, Student Union, and student activities fees. Students taking only two subjects pay one-half of the regular tuition fee, plus all additional fees. Students taking more than two courses are considered full-time students and pay all tuition and auxiliary fees.

"Students not in residence at the University who wish to return to take an examination, submit a thesis or dissertation, or receive a degree pay a **$5.00** tuition fee for that semester and are exempt from all other fees. Students in residence who have completed their course programs and who are registered for thesis, dissertation or research pay a **$15.00** tuition fee each semester, plus the library building, medical, Student Union, and student activities fees."

RESOLVED further that the President be and he is hereby authorized to proceed to set up a special loan plan for graduate students at low interest as proposed in Dean Hammond's letter.

President Darden laid before the Board a letter of 10 January 1958 from William S. Hildreth proposing the purchase by the University of the Bowles tract on the old Ivy Road (adjacent to the Hulvey and McGavock properties at a price of **$2,000** an acre. The President also presented a letter and enclosure from the Comptroller as follows:

I enclose copy of Mr. William Hanckel's letter concerning the above property. Mr. O'Grince and I have examined the property and recommend that the Board of Visitors be requested to authorize the purchase of the property, under the terms set forth in Mr. Hanckel's letter.

This property will be ideal for a faculty housing development. Mr. Hanckel has informed me that Mrs. Bowles has turned down an offer substantially higher than that at which she has offered the property to the University, as she would much prefer its sale to the University.

Confirming our conversation of today, Mrs. Bowles would like to work out an arrangement whereby she would sell the University 39 acres less 9.818 acres. This 9.818 acres she will agree to sell the University when she desires to upon giving the University 90 day notice.

The University would pay Mrs. Bowles **$58,364** for the 29.182 acres now and **$19,636** for the 9.818 acres with delivery of same.

This offer is made to the University of Virginia and to no one else.

Your special committee on the Paunch issue of The Spectator submits its report herewith. You asked us to determine whether or not this issue of The Spectator discredited the name of the University of Virginia, and if so, whether to a degree sufficient to warrant your bringing the matter before the Student Council.

You have asked for a relative judgment, and we express our judgment in relative terms. Our unanimous opinion is that the Paunch issue does discredit the name of the University of Virginia. The degree of the offense, however, we think should be measured by comparison with the much more serious discredit brought upon the University by contemporaneous issues of The Cavalier Daily.

Measured in this or any other way, however, the objectionable character of Paunch does not seem to us primarily a problem for punitive action. The irresponsibility of Paunch and The Cavalier Daily alike seem to us natural products of the University's present policy of permitting student sovereignty; one can hardly punish students for doing something for which they have never realized they might be held responsible. As to the past, therefore, we see little to be gained by taking the problem to the Student Council.

As to the future, which is the important aspect of the problem, here, too, we see little to be gained by taking the problem to the Student Council. We believe that the important question for the future raised by the Paunch magazine is this. Are students at the University of Virginia to continue to enjoy license or are they hereafter to be held responsible to University authority? We believe that the necessarily normative function of any educational institution makes the latter policy preferable here, and moreover we believe that the majority of the people of the Commonwealth favor the latter policy. In any case, since this is a question which the student body cannot ultimately decide, we conclude that there is little reason to take the Paunch problem to the Student Council.

Since you specifically requested that the committee make no positive recommendation for the disposition of this case, we assume that this report completes our work. We ask that you accept the report and discharge the committee.

I send you this note to confirm the views expressed to you in our talk a few days ago about the Spectator. Since Mr. Carlson, the Editor, is not eligible to continue the direction of the magazine, because of academic probation, you will be required to appoint a new editor and approve the staff selected by him. In doing this I wish you to bear in mind that though you act as the Board chosen by the Jefferson Society which owns Spectator, you act also as representatives of the University. In fact, as in the public understanding, a magazine published by a student group at the University, using University buildings and under the control of a society of the University with long and distinguished history, has an important sanction from the University. The public may with reason judge the University accordingly. The University's reputation is dear to all of us who serve it and love it. It is not the property of one small group to be dealt with in the uncontrolled judgment of that group, however honest that judgment may be.

I do not share the warm approval of the recent "Paunch" issue expressed by the Student Council. There runs through it, especially in the jokes, coarseness and vulgarity which are utterly out of keeping with the innate good taste which has distinguished the University of Virginia in the past and which we hope will mark it in the future. Moreover, one article - "The Decline and Fall of American Humor" was plagiarized directly from an editorial in The News Leader, but, as the editor of that paper says, "with a butcher's hand."

It is not enough to plead the tendencies of the times as an excuse for commonness. The publication of smutty and, in some instances, utterly revolting jokes and questionable stories cannot be justified as necessary in order to make a student publication sell. This is a form of intellectual prostitution.

Universities are under an enduring obligation to establish and maintain standards that are calculated to lift the intellectual and spiritual level of the societies of which they are a part. To pander to that which is unworthy for the sake of profit or cheap popularity, as does the last issue of Spectator, is to betray the great tradition of which our universities and colleges are at once the inheritors and the protectors.

The editors of Spectator do not act for themselves alone. They act for an old and honorable society which bears the name of the founder of this University, and they act for the University, the founding of which was the crowning achievement of his long and useful life. If students wish, acting only for themselves and over their own names, to compete in the open market place with the salacious and offensive publications found there, they may do so and take their chances with others engaged in such activities, even though I would deeply regret such action. But they should not be permitted to associate with themselves, in order to lend respectability to such ventures, the name of this University.

As I told you when you were good enough to meet with me earlier this week, I shall discuss this matter with the Board at its April meeting and I shall then talk with you further.

Our mutual friend and benefactor, Mrs. Preston Davie, has now given each of our institutions a work of art. To the University in 1956 came a small (25 3/8â€²h Ã— 19 1/2â€²w) portrait of Raleigh, and to the Museum in 1957, a larger (45â€²h Ã— 32 1/2â€²w) portrait of Burke. The official appraisals by French and Company are. Raleigh **$7,500**, Burke **$8,500**. I enclose photographs of each portrait.

You most generously lent the Raleigh portrait to us for our England's World of 1607 exhibition, staged during the spring and summer of 1957 as our contribution to the Jamestown Festival; and since the closing of this display the portrait has been on view in our gallery devoted to English art of the 16th and 17th centuries. Here we have contemporary portraits of persons related historically to Virginia. Sir Thomas Dale, James I and his wife, Anne of Denmark, etc., including a rare painting of William Byrd I, as a boy, when he was in England being "educated".

The Raleigh portrait adds so much to this appropriate and growing group that our Trustees and Staff would like very much to make the arrangement permanent. Also, we already have a portrait by Copley, who painted the Burke. Therefore, we have the following proposal to make to you.

We would like to give you the Burke in return for the Raleigh. Mrs. Davie has been consulted about this and is entirely agreeable. Also, Mr. William B. O'Neal, Curator of your Museum of Fine Arts at the University, has personally inspected both portraits and written a report (copy attached) giving his favorable reactions to our proposal.

We hope that the exchange will also appeal to you, and that it soon can be consummated officially. Here, apparently, we have one of those rare occasions where all concerned will be benefitted.

1. The Board of Directors of the Thomas Jefferson Memorial Foundation has recently adopted the following resolution. That there be established "not later than the college year 1959-60 the Thomas Jefferson Foundation Fellowships paying **$1,500.00** per annum plus tuition, in general along the lines set forth in the Memorandum of July 10, 1957, from Mr. Oron J. Hale, Chairman of the Department of History, to Mr. Colgate W. Darden, Jr., President of the University, and contribute up to **$5,000.00** per year towards such Fellowships, with the understanding that this Foundation would match the amount put up by the University up to **$5,000.00** and would, if Fellows of the desired type in sufficient number can be obtained, put up additional amounts, it being contemplated that the Foundation would in such case contribute at least **$15,000.00** per year towards the expense of these Fellowships and quite possibly even more in the future."

2. It is recommended that this offer be accepted and that the proposed fellowships be described and awarded on the following terms:

"From five to ten fellowships with income of not less than **$1500** plus tuition fee. These fellowships, provided by the Thomas Jefferson Memorial Foundation with a view to perpetuating the spirit and ideals of Thomas Jefferson, are awarded competetively to beginning or advanced graduate students in History and Political Science by the Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, upon the recommendation of the respective Departments. Preference will be given to applicants who expect to make a career of college teaching and whose interests focus generally upon the history, ideas and institutions of the Age of Jefferson. The fellowships are renewable upon recommendation of the Department concerned."

3. These Fellowships, with tuition, would amount to **$1730** for resident Virginians and **$1960** for non-residents. To finance the program for approximately ten fellows would require **$20,000** annually, of which the University would contribute **$5,000** and the Foundation **$15,000**. The proposal that the program be initiated with an equal amount (**$5,000**) from the Foundation and the University of Virginia, with the Foundation contributing up to **$15,000** as suitable candidates are selected, seems entirely reasonable. In the first year probably no more than five awards would be made.

4. It is recommended that the fellowship proposals of the Thomas Jefferson Memorial Foundation be accepted.

5. The Corcoran Department of History recommends appointment of Dr. Dumas Malone as Thomas Jefferson Foundation Professor of History, effective July 1, 1959, and that during the session 1958-1959, when Dr. Malone will be on sabbatical leave from Columbia University, he be appointed Visiting Professor of History in the University of Virginia. The terms of the appointment are those stated in the "Resolution For The Board of Directors of the Thomas Jefferson Memorial Foundation," of which paragraph one specifies the grants and salary to be paid to Professor Malone by the Foundation. Salary and Foundation grants will amount to **$15,000** annually.

6. In line with the above-mentioned Resolution it is further recommended that beginning with the session 1959-1960, Professor Malone offer a seminar in "The Age of Jefferson" during each regular session, and direct such studies and dissertations as may develop from his seminar or his work in the Department of History.

7. If this recommended appointment requires justification, the following points should be emphasized. Professor Malone is one of the most distinguished American historians, he holds earned and honorary degrees from Yale, Northwestern, Dartmouth, Emory and Rochester, he was the editor-in-chief of the Dictionary of American Biography, the greatest achievement of cooperative scholarship ever undertaken in the field of American history, he is engaged in writing and publishing a multi-volumed life of Thomas Jefferson, which will be the definitive biography of the founder of this University, his appointment in the Department of History will greatly advance our graduate program and proposed fellowship program in Jefferson studies, and will make Professor Malone's services available to the Department for two years after the resignation of Professor Abernethy. This latter point is one of considerable importance to the Department owing to Professor Abernethy's impending retirement.

I concur with the Department of History in recommending that Dr. Dumas Malone be appointed Visiting Professor of History, without salary, for the academic year 1958-59 beginning July 1, 1958. During this time, Dr. Malone will be on sabbatical leave from Columbia University. It is my understanding that he will receive a supplemental research grant from the Thomas Jefferson Memorial Foundation.

I transmit to you the recommendation of the Corcoran Department of History, with my concurrence, that Dr. Dumas Malone be appointed Thomas Jefferson Foundation Professor of History effective July 1, 1959, for a term of three years, at a twelve month salary of **$7,500** per year.

In accordance with the recent "Resolution for the Board of Directors of the Thomas Jefferson Memorial Foundation" on this subject, it is understood that the Foundation will pay an additional **$7,500** on a twelve months annual basis as research grant to Dr. Malone. The salary for the professorship will also come from the foundation grant.

Professor Malone's duties as Thomas Jefferson Foundation Professor of History will be to offer a seminar in "The Age of Jefferson" during each regular session and to direct such studies and dissertations as may develop from his seminar work in the Department of History.

I enclose Mr. Hale's letter which in turn includes some biographical data. If you wish more, I will ask the Department of History to furnish it.

I take pleasure in quoting the resolution unanimously adopted at a meeting of the University of Virginia Law School Foundation October 11, 1957, as follows

"Whereas it has been proposed that there be three chairs for distinguished professors in the Law School and that the regular salaries of the occupants of such chairs be supplemented by grants from the Law School Foundation and endowment funds available to the University,

Resolved that, if the Board of Visitors of the University shall provide for annual grants from University endowment funds of **$2,000** each to the occupants of three chairs for distinguished professors in the Law School, until further action of this Committee the Law School Foundation will make annual grants of the same amount to the occupants of such chairs payable at the same time and in the same manner as the grants provided by the Board of Visitors."

**Professional Leave for Graduate Study**

1. The University may pay the faculty member approved for professional leave-of-absence for graduate study or research, an amount not to exceed one-half of the salary for his grade and rank in the faculty salary schedule for the period during which the leave-of-absence is granted.

2. The recipient of the professional leave allowance shall agree that, after the completion of the approved leave-of-absence for graduate work or research, he will continue to teach at the University of Virginia immediately thereafter for a time at least twice as long as the time of the leave at the prevailing salary schedule, if the full allowance is made.

3. The recipient must sign a promissory note for the amount of the scholarship aid, which note is cancelled and returned to the applicant upon fulfillment of the contractual agreement. If, for any reason, the terms of this agreement can not be met, the recipient must repay the University on a pro rata basis for the specified time that was not worked as contracted.

**APPROVED**
