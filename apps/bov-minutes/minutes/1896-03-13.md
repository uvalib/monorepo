The Chairman of the Faculty laid before the Board a report of the Faculty of date March 12th 1896.

The Building Committee submitted its report, which was read and considered, and the following resolution was adopted:

Resolved; That the Report of the Building Committee be received and spread upon the records, and its action in the matter of terminating the contract with McDonald Bros. and making an arrangement with Messrs McKim, Mead & White for formulating plans, specifications etc. for the proposed buildings, be and the same is hereby ratified and confirmed. Said report is in the following words and figures:

To the Rector and Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia.

Immediately upon our appointment as the Building Committee, in compliance with your directions employed McDonald Bros. of Louisville, K'y as Architects for the restoration of the Rotunda and its wings. We also assigned to them the duty of demolishing the Annex and preparing, by removing such materials as were worth it and leveling the debris, for the construction of the esplanade as designed in the plan adopted by yourselves in your last meeting. The Architect was directed to furnish plans and to rebuild the wings as speedily as possible; their needs, as lecture rooms being very great. He was also instructed, the original design for those wings having been furnished him, to adhere as closely as was possible and as consistent with making the two buildings fire-proof, to this original design. His plans, to wit flat roofs continuous with level of the Rotunda portico floor, to be made as nearly as possible, water-proof, heat proof and sound proof, with railings surrounding it on three sides in accord with the style of architecture of the surrounding buildings; a cement floor, in place of the wooden floor, having no wood but the doors and windows, was adopted. It was also decided, it being in accordance with the original design, that the two doors entering each of the rooms from the passage-ways, should be in arches corresponding exactly in size and a continuation of the arches under the Rotunda. The repair of the walls, that had been damaged by explosives and the calculation as to their strength, were left entirely to the Architect. In presenting his plans he stated that the buildings would be ready for use about the first of January. The protection of the walls of the Rotunda, by a temporary roof was also assigned to him. This was speedily done and in a satisfactory manner. On the arrival of the steel substructure and its being put in place and when half the concrete roofing had been put on, it began to be suspected that the steel sub-structure was too weak. This with the intense coldness of the weather, so cold that cement could not be safely worked induced us to stop the work. The concrete having been supposed by Mr McDonald to be unsafe, The Cranford Co. sent an architect as an expert to decide as to it. He reported the steel beams of the roof as too weak. This led to a thorough investigation ably conducted by Mr Dessez supervised and verified by Profr Wm M. Thornton. The report justified this suspicion. An interview then with Mr H. P. McDonald induced him, upon our expressing the desire to put the whole matter of the construction and reconstruction in the hands of Messrs McKim, Mead & White of New York, to withdraw from the service of the University upon our agreeing to pay him the usual architects price of 2 1/2 % for his design, he agreeing to pay for the strengthening of the steel substructure of the wings. Your Committee then employed Mr Stanford White of the concern of McKim, Mead & White, as the architect, not only for the new buildings, but for the reconstruction of the Rotunda and its wings. In his appointment for the reconstruction, Your Committee are aware that they have exceeded their authority, but confidently ask your confirmation of their action. This action was taken upon the 18th day of January. Owing to an attack of sickness, Mr White did not get here for a fortnight. He thoroughly investigated the difficulties of the problem he had to solve, asked us that we would get for him at once contour lines in order that he might fix his locations, said that it would take him some time to develop his plans, but that he would be as expeditions as was practicable. He appeared before the Committee on the second day of March. The Committee adopted his plans subject to the revision of your body, except that they required that he should value the total expenditure for his buildings, grounds, etc. to the sum of $250,000.00, and consented that in doing this, he should not be required to make his new buildings fire-proof, but that the plan for making the Rotunda and its two wings fire proof should be held to. It is unnecessary in the Report of this Committee to enter into the plans as Mr White will be before you with the drawings and specifications and can more easily explain them than we can. We beg leave further to state, that pressed by the absolute need of two new Lecture rooms we have erected a cheap wooden building to supply this need.

The best mode of getting brick for the buildings of the size and color used in the old buildings has been closely looked into. Clay almost identical with the clay of the original bricks has been found and enough for a half million of brick has been gotten out and exposed to the weather. The yard will be prepared and brick will be moulded as soon as the weather will permit. We append herewith the financial report of the Building Committee as furnished to us by the Superintendent of Buildings and Grounds. The amounts expended are stated as follows and will be found to be itemized in the Report:

On examining the items it will be found that there is quite a large amount of supplies for future use on hand. That at the request of the Executive Committee they turned over to the Superintendent of Buildings & Grounds for his repair fund between $700.00 and $1000.00, an amount expended by the University force in paying for repairs incident to the fire.

Dear Sirs. I hereby tender my resignation as Professor of Mathematics in the University to take effect at the close of the present session. My failing health and advancing age making it desirable for me to retire from public life, and let younger men take up the work.

Wishing your honorable body large success in the promotion of the best interests of the great school of the people, over which you preside.
