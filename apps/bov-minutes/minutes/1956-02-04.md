The President laid before the Board the following letter from the Comptroller.

The Committee on Bad Debts composed of Messrs. Bryant, Kaulback and the undersigned has reviewed the loans set forth on Schedule 1, totalling $64,790.93 and recommends that they be charged off.

For the information of the Board, there is no record that such loan notes have ever been previously charged off. Some of the loans date back to the period immediately after World War I. About three years ago an intensive effort was made to collect all of these old loan notes and some were paid.

The Committee on Bad Debts recommends that the student accounts set forth on Schedule 2, totalling $30,850.65, be charged off. These accounts are of two types. The vast majority are balances for Virginia veterans which had to be absorbed by the University under an agreement with the Veterans Administration permitting the University to charge out-of-state tuition for all Virginia veterans. The Veterans Administration authorized this provided no Virginia veteran was penalized thereby. The State auditors feel that the Board of Visitors should authorize these accounts to be charged off, even though they are not actually an obligation of the student to the University.

The balance of the accounts represent accounts running back as far as 1930. An intensive effort has likewise been made to collect all of these accounts.

Once the Committee disposes of the sizeable backlog of these accounts, the amount to be charged off each year will be quite small. For example, during the current semester out of total charges of nearly $1,000,000, only $500 is now outstanding.

Schedules 1, dated 17 October 1955, and 2, dated 10 January 1956, laid before the Board with the foregoing letter were ordered to be filed with the minutes of this meeting.

Following a discussion of this matter, including consultation with Mr. Shea, who appeared before the Board for the purpose, the following resolution, on motion of Mr. Talbott seconded by Mr. Mears, was adopted:

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that Schedule 1 of the Committee on Bad Debts in the sum of $64,790.93, dated 17 October 1955, and Schedule 2 in the sum of $30,850.65, dated 10 January 1956, as submitted to the President and subsequently to the Board in the Comptroller's letter of 24 January 1956, be and they are hereby charged off as uncollectible, as recommended by the Committee on Bad Debts.

President Darden laid before the Board a communication from the University's Special Counsel, Mr. C. Venable Minor, pointing out that the adequate handling of the real estate in the Hugh E. Vincent Succession, in which the University has an interest, requires the presence in New Orleans, Louisiana, of a representative of the University legally authorized to make prompt decisions.

On motion, duly seconded, the Board thereupon resolved as follows:

WHEREAS, by resolution adopted April 11, 1952, this Board authorized Wayne G. Borah of New Orleans, Louisiana, to act for it in conjunction with the Executors of the Succession of Hugh E. Vincent, Mrs. Mildred Saffold Vincent, the widow and Usufructuary of the decedent, Hugh E. Vincent, and with the other two Naked Owner legatees under the will of the said Hugh E. Vincent, namely - Trinity Church and The Administrators of the Tulane Educational Fund, in the handling of the real estate which forms part of that Succession, and

WHEREAS, under date August 24, 1955, a judgment was rendered by the Civil District Court of Orleans Parish, Louisiana, placing the said Usufructuary and Naked Owners in possession of the said real estate and it is, therefore, necessary that this institution act in conjunction with the said Usufructuary, Mildred Saffold Vincent, and the other two Naked Owners, namely, - Trinity Church and The Administrators of the Tulane Educational Fund, the Testamentary Executors being no longer necessary parties, and

WHEREAS, in connection with the administration of that real estate, it will be necessary from time to time for prompt decisions to be reached by the parties in interest consisting of the widow and Usufructuary, Mildred Saffold Vincent, and the three Naked Owners, and in order to expedite such handling for the benefit of all concerned, it is desirable that the three Naked Owners have representatives in New Orleans authorized to act promptly,

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that Wayne G. Borah of New Orleans, Louisiana, be and he is hereby designated as the representative of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, generally known and designated as the "University of Virginia", for the purpose of acting in the premises.

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the said Wayne G. Borah be and he hereby is authorized and empowered on behalf of said The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia in any case in which (a) the widow and Usufructuary and (b) the other two Naked Owners concur in that action, to subscribe the name of this institution to an endorsement upon a lease of any portion of the property bequeathed to the said Usufructuary and the said three Naked Owners by the late Hugh E. Vincent, and in which this institution has an undivided naked ownership interest as above set out, which lease shall be for a period not exceeding five years, which endorsement shall read substantially as follows:

The undersigned Naked Owners of this property take cognizance of the above lease and if, as and when they come into full ownership of the property, they will assume the obligations of landlord under this lease in accordance with its terms and for the period which it designates.

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that in connection with the execution of any such lease, the said representative is hereby authorized to consent to the charge against this institution of its proportionate part in any expenditures (not in excess of $5,000 for the total of such expenditures in any one case), which under the Louisiana law are chargeable to the Naked Owners of the property in question.

President Darden presented a letter of 16 December 1955 from the University Comptroller enclosing a letter of the preceding November 8th from Mr. Bernard P. Chamberlain of Charlottesville, proposing: (1) that the University purchase for $25,000 his seven-acre tract of land adjacent to Observatory Mountain connecting University land on the south with the American Red Cross tract on the north, and (2) that if this purchase be declined, then that the University grant three additional rights of way to this tract.

The Board resolved after discussion that both of these proposals be declined.

Having reminded the Board of the discussion at the September 9th meeting relative to Professor Balz's proposal for named professorships, President Darden laid before the Board the following resolution endorsed by Dean Duren as unanimously adopted by the College Faculty on 26 October 1955:

1. Resolved that the faculty of the College of Arts and Sciences approves the proposal to define named professorships as honorary titles of distinction, not necessarily associated with the chairmanship of a department.

2. Resolved that the faculty approves the creation of new named professorships to be known as Thomas Jefferson Professorships. It further recommends

   (a) that they be awarded on the basis of academic distinction to members of the academic faculty,

   (b) that no one professorship be permanently associated with a particular department,

   (c) that they carry additional remuneration,

   (d) that they be held by the professors so honored for the duration of their tenure,

   (e) that a joint committee of the faculty and the Board of Visitors be formed to work out the details of the establishment and administration of these professorships.

The President, in recommending the Faculty plan, expressed dissent from (1) the use of the name of Thomas Jefferson for individual professorships, and (2) Proposal 2 (e) for a joint committee of Faculty and Visitors to work out details.

After considerable discussion, the Board resolved that the Rector appoint a small committee to work with the President in current planning for named professorships.

Mr. Mears, as Chairman of the Finance Committee, read to the Board the following letter, approving its recommendations and laying before the Board other correspondence relative thereto.

Mr. Darden suggested that I write you concerning a matter which he and I were discussing, which he would like for you to present to the Board if approved by the Finance Committee.

The regulations governing the University of Virginia are set forth in Chapter 9 of the Code of Virginia. Section 23-76 of this chapter provides for the appointment by the Board of a President, a Bursar, a Proctor, etc.

In 1953 the Board, by resolution, created the office of Comptroller. It is our desire that the Board authorize us to seek appropriate legislation to change Section 23-76 to read Comptroller where the word Bursar is now used.

There are three reasons for this request:

1. Some legal documents have to signed as Bursar and others as Comptroller. Mr. Minor and I have to check carefully to determine which is appropriate. In some cases, he has asked that I use both titles.

2. Quite a few people go to the Bursar's office and request to see the Bursar and are referred over here. Actually, most of them wish to discuss the payment of tuition and fees and should see the Assistant Bursar who directly handles such matters.

3. The most important reason, however, is to free the title of Bursar so that Mr. Moyer, who is now the Assistant Bursar, can be given this title. He is an extremely capable person and I feel should receive such recognition.

The proposed plan of organization would conform more generally to that obtaining in other institutions where the Comptroller is the principal business officer and the Bursar is concerned with the collection and disbursement of University funds, under the general supervision of the Comptroller.
