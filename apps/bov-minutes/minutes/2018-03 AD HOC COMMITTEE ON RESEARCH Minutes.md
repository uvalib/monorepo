Micah Mazurek was the presenter.

Mr. Walker opened the meeting and gave the floor to Mr. Ramasubramanian.

**Researcher Perspective**

Mr. Ramasubramanian introduced Ms. Micah Mazurek, Associate Professor of Education. Ms. Mazurek’s research focuses on the assessment and treatment of autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders. She said autism affects 3.5 million Americans. CDC statistics show its prevalence rising from 1 in 500 in 1995 to 1 in 68 in 2012. For boys, the prevalence was 1 in 42. Her research addresses measurement and assessment, mechanisms and targets, and treatments and outcomes. She has developed an Autism Impact Measure tool, which has been well received. The University has invested in autism research through the use of cluster hires, the Curry School seed fund, partnerships with the UVA Brain and Data Science institutes, and the strategic investment fund. She works with researchers throughout the University and at the University of Virginia Children’s Hospital, as well as collaborators at universities and academic medical centers across North America. Ms. Mazurek said the University’s autism program is unique because of its range of collaborators with research and practice throughout Virginia.

**Report on Enhancing Research**

Mr. Ramasubramanian began with a report on strategic seed funding. Its purpose is to bring faculty together from different schools and disciplines to focus on large scale research projects. It helps faculty advance their careers by providing funding at different scales and at different levels. The 3 Cavaliers program is one of these seed funds; it provides $15,000 to $60,000 to teams comprised of three faculty from at least two different disciplines in different schools to encourage them to collaborate on an idea with the goal of developing it into viable research. To help faculty find colleagues with similar interests or areas of expertise, the University is developing a database with profiles of all University faculty. In lieu of funding a Pan-University Institute this year, the Provost provided seed funding for three projects to advance their research themes in preparation for the FY 2019 solicitations for Pan-University Institutes.

Mr. Ramasubramanian continued with a report on the research administrative infrastructure initiative. One of its goals is to shift the burden for pre-award and post-award reporting, compliance, and monitoring related to research projects from researchers to the Office of Sponsored Programs (OSP). The initiative also includes developing an effective research administrative team, implementing policies and procedures that are streamlined, user-focused, consistent and well-communicated, improving the ResearchUVA infrastructure, and developing business intelligence reporting and analytics. To strengthen its research connection, OSP will report to the Vice President for Research instead of the Office of Finance.

The chair adjourned the meeting at 5:00 p.m.
