The following resolution was adopted.

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the Hospital Accounts Committee be and it is hereby authorized to charge off as uncollectible accounts schedules 255, 258 and 259, aggregating $19,916.76, recommended by them for cancellation.

This matter was deferred until the next meeting of the Board.

President Darden presented a proposal submitted by Professor John Gange, Director of the Woodrow Wilson School of Foreign Affairs, for an annual lecture on Indian affairs. An offer has been received from the Taraknath Das Foundation to bear the expenses of such an annual lecture, to be called the Rabindranath Tagore Memorial Lecture. The Board approved the proposal.

The President presented a proposal from the School of Foreign Affairs for a summer seminar in Mexico to be given under the supervision of University of Virginia faculty during June, July and August 1952. Special summer seminar scholarships would be established to help defray students' expenses for this study, to be paid from Doherty Foundation funds. Mr. Giovanni Previtali was proposed for appointment as the faculty supervisor for this seminar, at a compensation of $1,000, also to be paid from Doherty Foundation funds. The trustees of the Henry L. and Grace Doherty Foundation have approved the proposal as submitted to them by Professor Gange.

The Board approved the proposal.

The following resolution was adopted.

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that a fee of $2.00 per session be charged each engineering student for a subscription to the Engineering Review, effective with the beginning of the session of 1952-53.

The following resolution was adopted.

RESOLVED that a diploma fee of $5.00 be established to enable the University to furnish each graduate with a sheepskin diploma, this fee to be paid by each student graduating in June 1953 and thereafter, and -

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that this fee is to be paid to the Bursar at the beginning of the semester or summer session at the end of which the degree is to be conferred, and that it not be returnable.

President Darden stated that Mrs. Smith had proposed that the University mark its first building with an appropriate plaque. A resolution was adopted approving the idea of the erection of a marker and requesting that the history of the building be explored and the proper wording for such a marker prepared for submission to the Board at its next meeting.

President Darden reported that he had executed a contract for the calendar year 1952 with the Virginia Hospital Service Association (Blue Cross). He said that he was not satisfied with the contract but had signed it to protect the University's interests. The President then explained the "recapture provision" of the Blue Cross contract, under which Blue Cross recaptures the amount paid the hospital by a patient occupying a private room instead of semi-private room as specified for Blue Cross patients. The new contract partly reduces this recapture by returning to the institution one-fourth of the private room surcharge. The President stated that he did not believe that this recapture is fair to the institution, although the new contract is an improvement over the old one. He stated that Dr. Ackart had headed a sub-committee of the Blue Cross Board which had drafted the new contract and while he felt Dr. Ackart had worked hard to improve the contract, he did not feel that Blue Cross should recapture any of the differential between semi-private room costs and the amount charged the private patient.

President Darden requested that the Board investigate the contract and if it agrees with the President, that he be authorized to continue negotiation with Blue Cross and attempt to secure a fairer treatment for the University, failing this, that he be authorized to withdraw the University from participation.

Mr. Gay and Mr. Anderson were requested to look into the matter and report to the Board.

President Darden stated that as the new Academic Building neared completion it seemed unwise to build the Physics Building at its original site, so close to the new Academic Building. The design of the Physics Building had proved to be larger than at first anticipated. He had consulted the architects, Eggers and Higgins, who had prepared the master plan for the University, and now recommended to the Board that the Physics Building be located on the north side of McCormick Road, east of the new Residence Houses. Whereupon a resolution was adopted approving this site for the Physics Building.

The Rector read a letter from a former student, Mr. William Vail Johnson, stating that he, Mr. Johnson, had been expelled from the University and setting forth the circumstances. He requested permission of the Board to resign so that the record would not show that he had been expelled. Mr. Black stated that he had also received a letter from the student's mother making a similar request. It was not possible to determine from the letters whether the student had been expelled by the Honor Committee or by the Student Council. The Rector was asked to investigate the matter to determine whether the Board had authority to review the case and to report at the next meeting.

President Darden reported that the Norfolk and Western Railway had contributed $25,000 to the Graduate School of Business, under provision that the other railroads in the State jointly contribute an equal amount within a year.

Approximately fifteen members of the faculty are not members of the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association program, but belong to the State Retirement System. Having once been eligible for TIAA, these faculty members have been ruled by social security authorities to be ineligible under present regulations to participate in social security. The attorney for the University has proposed the following resolution, which has been approved by the social security attorneys, and which will lift this ban and enable these persons to join social security. Whereupon the following resolution was adopted.

BE IT RESOLVED, by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that those positions held by members of the faculty of the University of Virginia at Charlottesville, who do not as of the present date, hold annuity policies with the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association, are not and shall not be eligible for matching fund payments made by the Board of Visitors of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia to the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association.

Mr. Garnett, Chairman of the Buildings and Grounds Committee recommended that the house on East Range formerly occupied by Dr. C. S. Lentz be assigned to Dr. David C. Wilson, Professor of Neurology and Psychiatry. This assignment was approved.

Mr. Garnett stated that he had received an offer for the University's interest in Falls Church property left to the University by Mr. Riley, subject to a life interest of his two sisters. Mr. Garnett did not think it wise for the University to sell its interest. The Rector was asked to look at the property and confer with the State Senator from Falls Church, Mr. Donovan, concerning the advisability of selling the University's interest at this time.

The President reported that Mr. Frederick E. Nolting who was being considered for this position was not available, as he has received a new assignment from the State Department. The Development Fund trustees are continuing to look for someone to fill this position.

A proposal submitted by the President of the Senior Class, who acts as Honor Council President, and the President of Student Government, was presented by Dr. Combs as follows:

"We, the Honor Council and student body of Mary Washington College of the University of Virginia, do hereby propose that the President of the Honor Council be elected by the entire student body. She shall be a member of the Senior Class and shall hold no other major office. Under our present system, the President of the Senior Class automatically becomes President of the Honor Council."

The proposal was approved as presented.

Mrs. Wailes, Chairman of the Mary Washington Committee, was unable to be present but sent a message that the Committee had had no success in securing aid from foundations for the purchase of the Mendel collection. President Combs recommended that Dr. Iltis upon his retirement be appointed curator of the museum. This recommendation was not approved.

In view of the importance of the museum to the college, it was deemed advisable to attempt to work out a proposal for retention of the museum at Mary Washington. Whereupon the following resolution was adopted.

BE IT RESOLVED that President Combs be and he is hereby authorized to employ Mrs. Hugo Iltis as curator of the Mendel Museum for one year, this appointment to take effect upon the retirement of Professor Iltis, at such compensation as the Board may hereafter approve.

The following resolution was adopted.

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the Student Activities Building now under construction at Mary Washington College be and the same is hereby named in honor of Ann Carter Lee, the mother of General Robert E. Lee.

The naming of the Fine Arts Building and the Music Building was referred to the Mary Washington Committee. President Combs stated that the name of Gari Melcher had been suggested for the Art Building and John Garland Pollard for the Music Building.

President Combs stated that an appropriation had been received from the Legislature for a new dormitory, which in the master plan for the College was shown opposite the Administration Building. He requested approval of the Board for its location at this site, whereupon a resolution approving same was adopted.

President Combs stated that the building now located on this site would be moved part way down the hill to another location. This proposal was approved, with the proviso that the building be torn down instead, should the cost of moving it prove too high.

On motion the meeting was then adjourned.
