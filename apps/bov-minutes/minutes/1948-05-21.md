Visitor: Captain Norton G. Pritchett.

Mr. Carrington, speaking for the Board, stated that it was the opinion of the Board that the present athletic policy should be continued, pending a further study of the NCAA proposal.

The Board approved in principle the institution of a graduate engineering extension program and left the details of such a program to be worked out with the President.

The Board requested the President to ask the Student Council to prepare a proposal for the Board, setting forth a procedure to be followed in the handling of student conduct. The Board wished to go on record as being shocked and disgusted with reports of student conduct during "Little Easters" week end.

Visitors: Messrs. Martin B. Hiden, Jr. and Adolphus W. Hawkins, Jr.

Mr. Hiden, speaking for the Tavern Club, outlined the type of club which the students desire to build, displaying architectural drawings of the proposed building. The Tavern Club backers proposed to finance the Club by a $100,000 first mortgage to be sold to the banks, plus a $100,000 second mortgage to be sold to individuals in small amounts. Mr. Anderson expressed some doubts as to the feasibility of such a method of financing the project.

The Board thanked Messrs. Hiden and Hawkins for their presentation and requested them to explore further the possibilities of financing their building and to report to the Board at its next meeting.

A verbal report for the Committee on Mary Washington College was made by Mrs. Wailes, Chairman. Mrs. Wailes pointed out that the need for certain new buildings at Mary Washington was becoming crucial, particularly an addition to the cold storage plant and a new infirmary. She proposed the following resolution, which was adopted by the Board.

RESOLVED, by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the Governor be requested to release the appropriations approved by the General Assembly for construction to meet emergency building requirements, i. e., a cold storage plant of $40,000 which necessitates an addition to the dining hall building ($109,115), and an infirmary of $158,837.

The matter of the conversion of Mary Washington College to a liberal arts college was referred to the Mary Washington Committee with the directive that the committee meet with the officials at Mary Washington College and prepare a statement suggesting a plan to accomplish this conversion, this statement to be mailed to the members of the Board prior to the June meeting.

There being no further business to come before the meeting, the same was adjourned after a motion to that effect had been made, seconded, and carried.
