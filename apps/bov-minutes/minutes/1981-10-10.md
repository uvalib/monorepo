## RESCINDING THE RESOLUTION ESTABLISHING THE OFFICE OF UNIVERSITY CHANCELLOR

The following resolution was adopted: RESOLVED by The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the action of the Board on October 4, 1980 establishing the Office of University Chancellor under the President of the University be and it is hereby rescinded.

## ELECTION OF MR. RAY C. HUNT, JR., VICE-PRESIDENT FOR BUSINESS AND FINANCE, AS CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA

The following resolution was adopted: RESOLVED by The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that Mr. Ray C. Hunt, Jr., Vice-President for Business and Finance, be and he is hereby elected Chief Operating Officer of the University of Virginia to serve at the pleasure of the Board, effective October 1, 1981.

## STATEMENT BY THE RECTOR

The University of Virginia recently engaged Cambridge Associates, Inc., to carry out a study and make recommendations regarding the administrative structure of the University at the Vice-Presidential level and above.

Several considerations prompted this study. A year ago the Board of Visitors established a Chancellorship for the purpose of relieving the President of certain internal management details in order that he devote a greater portion of his time to fund raising. However, the Board's efforts to identify a person for this position and elect a Chancellor during the past academic year were not successful. Also, last spring a faculty task force recommended certain changes in the Vice-Presidencies, and the Executive Planning Group established by the President last spring recommended that the entire administrative structure be studied. Finally, the last such study was carried out in 1967, when the student body and faculty were only one-half as large as they are today.

The President has received and distributed to the Board of Visitors a preliminary report from Cambridge Associates containing convincing arguments concerning the Chancellorship. Specifically, it is recommended that efforts to elect a Chancellor be terminated, and that the Vice-President for Business and Finance be designated Chief Operating Officer on an interim basis. The intent is that he would serve in this capacity during that period in the years ahead when the Board expects the President to devote a major portion of his time to University development.

Accordingly, the President has recommended and the Board has approved the election of Mr. Ray C. Hunt, Jr., as Vice-President for Business and Finance and Chief Operating Officer for a term beginning October 1, 1981. The position of Chancellor has been disestablished effective October 1, 1981.

As Chief Operating Officer he will have the authority to (a) set priorities for the initiation, discussion, and resolution of internal University issues; (b) execute day-to-day decisions which bear upon the internal operations of the University as distinct from its external relations; and (c) resolve any issues which are not of such importance that presidential involvement is required. He would, of course, report directly to the President, and therefore, reflect the President's priorities on any matters which may arise.

Cambridge Associates is continuing the study of the University's Plan of Organization with regard to the possible reassignment of a number of offices among the Vice-Presidents and with regard to the need for a more comprehensive and integrated management and planning process.

## SELECTION OF JONES AND STRANGE-BOSTON AS ARCHITECTS FOR THE HAZARDOUS WASTE FACILITY PROJECT

The following resolution was adopted: RESOLVED by The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the firm of Jones and Strange-Boston of Richmond, Virginia, be and it is hereby approved as the architects for the Hazardous Materials Handling Facilities Project.

## MODIFICATION OF FACULTY MORTGAGE LOAN REGULATIONS

The following resolution was adopted: RESOLVED by The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the regulations governing the Faculty Home Mortgage Loan Program be amended effective October 10, 1981 as follows:

1. At present money rates, no loan will be made at less than 13%.
2. A service charge due and payable at the time of the closing of the loan shall be 1/2 of 1% of the principal amount of the loan.
3. Loans shall be limited to one per faculty member during the period of employment.
4. The outstanding principal balance of mortgage loans shall not exceed an aggregate amount of $32,000,000. The University will maintain a waiting list for mortgage loans at such time as the principal amount of mortgage loans outstanding reaches the $32,000,000 limit.
5. There shall be an appraisal fee of $100 each for residential properties.
6. The program regulations will be reviewed by the Finance Committee of the Board of Visitors on an annual basis or more frequently if necessary.

## INCREASE IN FUNDING REQUIRED FOR ESTABLISHING PROFESSORSHIPS
