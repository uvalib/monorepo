The following resolution was adopted: WHEREAS, in 1983, the Board of Visitors (the "Board") of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia (the "University") adopted a resolution (A) authorizing the financing of the Clinch Valley Student Union, Newcomb Hall Additions and Student Housing (together, the "1983 projects") through the issuance by the Commonwealth of Virginia (the "Commonwealth") of $8,385,000 of its $57,015,000 Higher Educational Institutions Bonds, 1983 Series D, E, F and G (the "1983 Bonds") and (B) pledging certain revenues derived from or related to the 1983 Projects to the payment of that portion of the 1983 Bonds;WHEREAS, in 1985, the Board adopted a resolution (A) authorizing the financing of the Observatory Dining Hall Addition, Sponsor's Hall Addition and Student Activity Building (together, the "1985 Projects") through the issuance by the Commonwealth of $3,250,000 of its $24,690,000 Higher Educational Institutions Bonds, Series 1985 (the "1985 Bonds") and (B) pledging certain revenues derived from or related to the 1985 Projects to the payment of that portion of the 1985 Bonds;WHEREAS, to lower the aggregate debt service payments owed on the 1983 Bonds and the 1985 Bonds, the Commonwealth proposes to refund some or all of the 1983 Bonds and the 1985 Bonds through the issuance of the Commonwealth's Article X, Section 9(c) Higher Educational Institutions Refunding Bonds, Series 1992 (the "Refunding Bonds"), all as permitted by the Commonwealth of Virginia Article X, Section 9(c) Refunding Bond Act of 1992, Chapter 265 of the Virginia Acts of Assembly of 1992 (the "Act"); andWHEREAS, the effect of the refunding of some or all of the 1983 Bonds and the 1985 Bonds will be to reduce the aggregate debt service payments owed by the University with respect to the 1983 Projects and the 1985 Projects;NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE RECTOR AND VISITORS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA:Section 1. The Board acknowledges that the Commonwealth intends to issue the Refunding Bonds in order to lower the aggregate debt service payments due on the 1983 Bonds and the 1985 Bonds. This will have the effect of reducing the aggregate debt service payments owed by the University with respect to at least some, if not all of the 1983 Projects and the 1985 Projects. The Board further acknowledges and agrees that the University has an obligation to pay its proportionate share of debt service and other costs owed with respect to the 1983 Projects and the 1985 Projects, whether such payments are due on the 1983 Bonds, the 1985 Bonds or the Refunding Bonds, on the same terms on which the University is currently making payments relating to the 1983 Bonds and the 1985 Bonds. The University further acknowledges that the Commonwealth will determine which of the 1983 Projects and the 1985 Projects will be refunded with the proceeds of the Refunding Bonds.Section 2. The Board acknowledges and agrees that, as stated in Section 8 of the Act, upon the issuance of the Refunding Bonds, the net revenues derived from or related to the 1983 Projects and the 1985 Projects previously pledged to the payment of the 1983 Bonds and the 1985 Bonds, respectively, also will be pledged to that portion of the Refunding Bonds allocable to the 1983 Projects and the 1985 Projects.Section 3. The Board covenants that the University will not take or omit to take any action the taking or omission of which will cause the 1983 Bonds, the 1985 Bonds or the Refunding Bonds to be "arbitrage bonds" within the meaning of Section 103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended (the "1954 Code"), or Section 148 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "1986 Code"), or otherwise cause interest on the 1983 Bonds, the 1985 Bonds or the Refunding Bonds to be includable in the gross income of the holders thereof for federal income tax purposes under existing laws. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the University will pay from time to time its proportional share of any rebate to the United States of the earnings derived from the investment of the gross proceeds of the Refunding Bonds.Section 4. The Board covenants that the University has not and will not permit the proceeds of the 1983 Bonds, the 1985 Bonds and the Refunding Bonds, on an aggregate basis, to be used in any manner that would result in (a) 25% or more of such proceeds being used in a trade or business carried on by any person other than a governmental unit, as provided in Section 103 of the 1954 Code, (b) 25% or more of such proceeds being used with respect to any output facility within the meaning of Section 103 of the 1954 Code considered as being used in a trade or business carried on by any person other than a governmental unit or (c) 25% or more of such proceeds being used directly or indirectly to make or finance loans to persons other than a governmental unit, as provided in Section 103(o) of the 1954 Code. The University need not comply with such covenants if the University obtains the written approval of the State Treasurer and an opinion of nationally recognized bond counsel acceptable to the Treasury Board that such covenants need not be complied with to prevent the interest on the 1983 Bonds, the 1985 Bonds and the Refunding Bonds from being includable in the gross income of the owners thereof for federal income tax purposes.Section 5. The Board covenants that for so long as any of the 1983 Bonds, the 1985 Bonds or the Refunding Bonds are outstanding, the University will not enter into any additional operating lease, management contract or similar agreement (or any amendment to any existing lease, management contract or similar agreement) with any person or entity, other than a state or local governmental unit, for all or any portion of the 1983 Projects or the 1985 Projects without first obtaining the written approval of the State Treasurer and an opinion of nationally recognized bond counsel acceptable to the Treasury Board that entering in to such agreement will not cause the interest on the 1983 Bonds, the 1985 Bonds or the Refunding Bonds to be included in the gross income of the owners thereof for federal income tax purposes.Section 6. The Board covenants that for so long as any of the 1983 Bonds, the 1985 Bonds or the Refunding Bonds are outstanding, the University will not sell or dispose of all or any part of the 1983 Projects or the 1985 Projects or allow any 1983 Project or 1985 Project to cease being a revenue producing capital project of the University within the meaning of the Act without first obtaining the written approval of the State Treasurer and an opinion of nationally recognized bond counsel acceptable to the Treasury Board that such sale or disposition or cessation will not cause interest on the 1983 Bonds, the 1985 Bonds or the Refunding Bonds to be included in the gross income of the owners thereof for federal income tax purposes and will not otherwise violate the Act.Section 7. The officers of the University are authorized and directed to execute and deliver all certificates and instruments and to take all such further action as may be considered necessary or desirable in connection with the sale and issuance of the Refunding Bonds.Section 8. The Board acknowledges that the Treasury Board will rely on the representations and covenants set forth herein in issuing the Refunding Bonds, that such covenants are critical to the security for the Refunding Bonds and the exclusion of the interest on the 1983 Bonds, the 1985 Bonds and the Refunding Bonds from the gross income of the owners thereof for federal income tax purposes, that the Board will not repeal, revoke, rescind or amend any of such covenants without first obtaining the written approval of the Treasury Board, and that such covenants will be binding upon the Board and the University so long as any of the 1983 Bonds, the 1985 Bonds or the Refunding Bonds are outstanding.Section 9. This resolution shall take effect immediately upon its adoption.

ATTACHMENT A THE CAMPAIGN FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA GIFT CREDITING AND VALUATION POLICY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I. GENERAL

A. Gifts received and commitments made during the period of July 1, 1993 to June 30, 1998 will be credited to the Campaign, including annual, capital and endowed gifts, matured bequests, and irrevocable life insurance gifts.

B. Gifts received prior to July 1, 1993 may, under certain circumstances, be credited to the Campaign. These circumstances include:

1\. Endowed and Capital Gifts to the Darden School and Jefferson Scholars campaigns. These fund raising efforts constitute the first phase of the Campaign for the University of Virginia.

2\. Gifts received for projects/programs designated as priorities in the "Plan for the Year 2000." The size of gift should be at the prospect's maximum giving potential.

3\. Selected gifts received where the donor requires the gift to count as part of his/her Campaign commitment.

4\. All of the above are to be counted only after review and approval of the President and the Vice President for Development.

C. Pledges exceeding five years will be considered on an individual basis by the Gifts Policy Committee.

D. Oral pledges must be confirmed in writing before they are counted. Donors will be encouraged, insofar as possible, to state their philanthropic intentions in a letter or memorandum, even though such statements may be informal and non-binding. Failing this, the solicitor will record his/her own understanding of the terms of the oral commitment and submit it via letter to the donor for written confirmation or modification.

E. Gifts are to be valued and credited on the date the University gains control of the assets. The amounts reported are to be arrived at without regard to the donor's personal estimation of the gift value.

F. Naming of commemorative gifts for new construction (or a portion thereof) will be accepted if equal to at least 50% of the total private cost of the project. Other naming gift opportunities relating to existing facilities are available and negotiable.

II. CURRENT ANNUAL, CAPITAL AND ENDOWED GIFTS

A. Cash, securities, written pledges, and gifts of tangible assets are to be credited at full value. A donor may include in his or her pledge an explicit provision for altering the time period of the pledge if his or her personal circumstance were to change substantially.

B. Gifts of securities are to be credited at market value on the date the University gains control of the assets. Neither losses nor gains realized by the sale of the securities after their receipt, nor brokerage fees or other expenses associated with the transaction are to affect the gift value.

C. Corporate matching gifts will be recorded according to the policies and procedures of the company matching the gift. Matching gifts will be credited to the donor as annual or capital gifts. If a donor wants his or her matching gift to follow the original gift into a restricted fund, every effort will be made to accommodate the request.

III. GIFTS OF REAL ESTATE AND PERSONAL PROPERTY

A. Gifts of real estate and personal property--such as land, residential housing, income producing property, paintings, antiques, and rare books--are to be valued by an independent, expert appraiser paid for and retained by the donor. The University retains the right to receive its own independent appraisal for property with a market price of $250,000 or more.

B. Gifts of real estate must undergo an environmental study and zoning assessment before they are accepted by the University.

C. Small gifts of real and personal property--such as rare books or prints--with an apparent worth of less than $5,000 may be valued by someone with knowledge in the field, and that informal valuation may be used for reporting purposes.

D. Gifts of real estate and personal property, if accepted by the University, will be credited to the campaign goals at the appraised fair market value.

E. Gifts of real estate, personal property or gifts-in-kind which are retained by the University for its own collection are to be counted in a separate column.

F. Gifts accepted by the University which may become part of the University's inventory (generally, property held for sale in the course of the donor's trade or business), will be credited to the Campaign at fair market value. Special approvals are required for gifts of computing resources or gifts of materials requiring the execution of a contract with a vendor.

IV. PLANNED GIFTS

A. Gifts to establish charitable remainder trusts, contributions to pooled income funds, and gift annuities are to be credited at fair market value.

1\. Regarding trusts administered by others, the value of the assets in trust that the donor has chosen to have administered by others is to be included in the gift totals provided the trust is irrevocable and the University of is an irrevocable beneficiary. The University must have a copy of the trust agreement.

B. In crediting charitable lead trusts, only the income received from the lead trust each year during the period of the Campaign (or a five year period) is to be reported in the gift totals.

C. Paid bequests, outright bequests from estates in probate, and any additional payments on previous bequests received during the campaign are to be given full credit for the amount received.

D. For individuals age 70 or over by June 30, 1998, properly documented and realistically valued bequest expectancies are to be recognized at full value if the bequest is to be received outright from the testator's estate or if the bequest is in the form of a remainder interest which has no more than two beneficiaries, both of whom are to be 70 or over by June 30, 1998. They will not be counted toward the Campaign goal but noted as "future support".

1\. Bequest expectancies are to be reported separately so as to emphasize the fact that the proceeds therefrom will likely not be available to complete the goals of the Campaign. Each donor will be encouraged to include with his or her bequest intention a gift of cash or securities to help complete campaign goals.

2\. All donors will be encouraged to provide in their wills for payment by charitable bequest of any unpaid portions of a Campaign pledge.

E. In crediting gifts of insurance the University must be named both beneficiary and irrevocable owner of an insurance policy before the policy is to be recorded as a gift.

1\. The cash surrender value of the policy when given, rather than its face value, is the amount to be credited as a gift.

2\. If the donor pays further premiums on the policy, the premiums are to be included in the gift totals.

3\. If University elects to pay the premiums, the institution should consider those payments as operating expenditures and not report increases in the cash surrender value as gifts.

4\. Regardless of whether the donor or the University pays the premiums on the policy it owns, the difference between the cash value and the insurance company's settlement at the death of the donor should not be reported as a gift but rather as a gain on the disposition of assets.

5\. In those cases where the University receives the proceeds of an insurance policy in which it was named beneficiary but not owner, the full amount received is to be reported as a gift.

V. GOVERNMENT AND NON GOVERNMENT GRANTS AND CONTRACTS

A. A differentiation must be made between gifts, grants and contracts when reporting. Grant income from private, non-government sources should be included in the gift totals; contract revenue should not be included.

B. A private grant is bestowed voluntarily and without expectation of any tangible compensation; it is donative in nature.

1\. Whereas UVa has the legal responsibility of using funds received as gifts and grants for the purpose specified by its donors, its obligation to the donor usually does not, and probably should not, exceed the limit of the gift.

2\. UVa's responsibility under a contract, on the other hand, normally involves the generation of some tangible product or service, such as a report of research, often for the exclusive or proprietary use of the contracting agency and subject to certain standards of performance, and the expectation of economic benefit on the part of the grantor.

C. Government grants, whether local, state, federal or foreign, are not to be included in the Campaign gift totals.

VI. EXCLUSIONS

The following type of funds will be excluded from campaign report totals:

A. Gifts or pledges, outright and deferred, which already have been counted in previous campaigns, even if realized during the campaign, even if realized during the campaign reporting period.

B. Investment earnings on gifts, even if accrued during the time period of the campaign and even if required within the terms specified by a donor source.

C. Earned-income transfer payments from medical or analogous practice plans.

D. Surplus-income transfers from ticket-based operations.

GIFTS POLICY COMMITTEE AND GIFT LIMITATIONS THE CAMPAIGN for the UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I. Gifts Policy Committee

A. Responsibility

Approved crediting policies will cover the majority of anticipated commitments. However, in the event that situations or opportunities occur during the course of the Campaign for which these guidelines are inadequate, there will be a Gift Policy Committee which shall be empowered to resolve any questions regarding acceptance, valuation, and crediting.

The Gifts Policy Committee will approve or disapprove all gifts-in-kind to the university that are not immediately convertible to cash and all gifts-in-kind that have donor-imposed restrictions as to their disposition.

As necessary, recommendations of the Gifts Policy Committee will be forwarded to the Board of Visitors for final approval.

B. Membership

The Gifts Policy Committee will consist of the following:

1\. Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

2\. Provost

3\. Vice President for Development

4\. Associate Vice President for Development

5\. Treasurer

6\. Director of Planned Giving

C. Meeting Schedule

Meetings of the Gifts Policy Committee will be called as necessary by the Associate Vice President for Development, who will serve as chairman of the committee.

II Gift Limitations

Gifts with limitations based on race, color, religion, creed, sex, sexual preference or national origin cannot be accepted by the University of Virginia, except in instances where, after review by the Gifts Policy Committee, such gifts are determined to be non-discriminatory because of the general availability of other gifts or resources.

The following gift stipulations also cannot be accepted by the University for scholarships, fellowships, or other financial aid funds:

A. Those in which a donor designates a specific recipient;

B. Those designating as recipient the donor's relative or descendants;

C. Those based on the future employment of the recipient.

III. Gift Recording

The Gift Recording Department of the University Development Office shall oversee the receipt, recording, depositing, and acknowledgment of all private contributions to the University. Gift Recording in turn will assure that appropriate departments, schools, or fund raising units are notified in a timely fashion regarding contributions restricted for their use.
