American Tel. & Tel. Convertible 6's, 1925 at 115 1/2, realizing a profit of $3,484, or 14.3% on the purchase price. These bonds were convertible into the common stock of the company at 106 and as this stock has been paying 9%, it has advanced until it recently sold as high as 123. We considered it wise to realize the profit on the original cost inasmuch as we would only have received par for the bonds if they had been held to maturity.

The following formal contract between the University of Virginia and the City of Charlottesville prepared by the attorney for the University, in accordance with resolutions adopted at meetings of the Board November 29th 1921 and February 28th 1922, was read and approved, and the Rector authorized to sign the same on behalf of the Rector and Visitors:

WHEREAS, constant growth of the University of Virginia has brought about full realization for some time past that steps must be taken and provision made for an augmented and purified supply of water for that institution and its environs; and

WHEREAS, the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, recognizing this imperative need and demand, has recently considered divers plans whereby the quality of the water might be improved, and the pressure at the University increased, thereby safeguarding property in case of fire, and adding to the convenience and comfort of users on the grounds of the University, and

WHEREAS, any of the plans contemplated would have necessitated the expenditure of considerable sums of money, far greater expenditures than the University with its present funds could afford to make alone for these purposes; and

WHEREAS, the City of Charlottesville having likewise been met with demands on the part of water users for a purified supply and better quality of water, determined to obviate these difficulties by means of a filter plant to be erected at some point convenient to the City and its reservoirs; and

WHEREAS, with a view toward overcoming the difficulties of the University and avoiding excessive expenditures, for the purposes named, the said Rector and Visitors of the University did, by resolution adopted in meeting of November 29th 1921, determine to combine with the said City in the erection of a filter plant, and by said resolution authorized and directed the lease, without charge, to the City of Charlottesville for a term of ninety-nine (99) years of a tract of land situate on the east side of Observatory Mountain, containing approximately three and one-half (31/2) acres, for the purpose of constructing such filter plant, and appropriated for said purpose the sum of fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000.00) or so much if any as might be appropriated by the Legislature of Virginia of 1922 for improvements of the water supply and system at the University of Virginia; and

WHEREAS, the Legislature of Virginia, in its wisdom, failed to appropriate any sum whatever to be used toward augmenting or improving the supply of water at the University of Virginia; and

WHEREAS, at a meeting of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, held on the 28th day of February 1922, a resolution was duly introduced and adopted again authorizing the lease of said tract of three and one-half (3 1/2) acres on Observatory Mountain for a filter plant and right of way for pipe lines thereto, containing approximately one and one-half (1 1/2) acres, together with rights of ingress egress thereto and therefrom, for the said term of ninety-nine (99) years, without charge, and with the right on the part of the City of renewal, the said resolution further providing that a portion of the present six-inch pipe line now belonging to the University should be turned over to and become the property of the City of Charlottesville, as hereinafter detailed, in consideration for which said line the City would lay a part of said six-inch pipe at other points near the University, as hereinafter specified, said resolution providing further for the furnishing by the City to the University of filtered water as hereinafter specified, and the payment by the University to the City of a portion of the costs of operating the said filter plant and a booster pump and station in connection therewith, all of which is more fully set out in said resolution and provided for hereinafter; and

WHEREAS, the same resolution authorized and directed said Rector of the University of Virginia, on behalf of said University, to enter into and execute a contract with the City of Charlottesville, embodying and carrying out the provisions set forth therein,

NOW, THEREFORE, THIS CONTRACT made this 18th day of April 1922, by and between the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, hereinafter styled the University, part of the first part, and the City of Charlottesville, a munifipal corporation, hereinafter styled the City, party of the second part.

THAT in consideration of the premises and in further consideration of the advantages and benefits to be derived therefrom by said University, the said University doth hereby lease and demise unto the City of Charlottesville for the term of ninety-nine (99) years from the date hereof, with privilege of renewing this lease at the expiration thereof, a tract or parcel of land belonging to the University and being a part of the lands of the University situate on the east side of Observatory Mountain, and west and southwest of the Rotunda of said University, containing five (5) acres, more or less, approximately three and one-half (31/2) acres of which shal be used as the site for the filter plant, and approximately one and one-half (1 1/2) acres of which shall be used for rights of way for two sixteen-inch water mains from a point on the Lynchburg Road through the lands of the said University for a distance of about eleven hundred eighty-seven (1187) feet to said filter plant, the wideth of said right of way being twenty (20) feet throughout the entire length; which said tract of 3 1/2 acres and right of way aforesaid are accurately described upon a plat prepared by Lee H.

The following communication was received from the Charlottesville & Albemarle Railway Company with respect to the erection of a waiting room on Rugby Road and of rescinding the rental charge of $20.00 per month for the land on which its loop is located:

Please find attached hereto a petition signed by sixteen of your professors living north of the University who request that we build a small waiting room at the end of our car line on Rugby Road, near the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway.

The only place we can find to build a waiting room is in the center of the loop track, which will be on University property, and we wish to ask you kind permission to do so, same to be approved by Prof. Fiske Kimball and Dr. W. A. Lambeth, or any one you may designate.

The proposed waiting room will cost us about $1,000.00 and in view of the fact that our car line is of great service to the University and that we have never increased our rate of fare from five cents, in spite of the great increase in operating expenses, we will greatly appreciate it if you will relieve us of the rental charge of $20.00 a month for the use of the loop at the end of the line, in accordance with agreement with you and this Company dated December 14th, 1918, copy of which is hereto attached.

If granted the above permission we will use our best efforts to erect a very attractive waiting room and with the planting of shrubbery around it we feel sure it will meet the approval of everyone.

Thanking you in advance for your kind consideration of the above, we remain

The foregoing matter was disposed of in the following resolution unanimously adopted:

RESOLVED, That permission is hereby granted to the Charlottesville & Aloemarle Railway Company to erect a waiting-room for the accomodation of its passengers in the center of the loop track located on the grounds of the University near the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway on Rugby Road, said building to be erected according to plans approved by Prof. W. A. Lambeth, Superintendent of Grounds and Buildings of the University and Prof. Fiske Kimball, Professor of Art & Architecture, and shall be removed by the said Charlottesville & Albemarle Railway Company upon 60 days notice in writing from the Rector and Visitors. Said permit is granted without cost to said C. & A. Ry Co.

RESOLVED, further, That that portion of the petition of said Railway Company of April 26th., requesting release from paying the monthly rental for the privilege of maintaining its loop track in the grounds of the University be not granted.

Petition of citizens residing on the south side of the grounds of the University in reference to the nuisance created by the dumping and burning of trash at power house was referred to the Committee on Buildings and Grounds.

The Board adjourned at 1 o'clock P. M., April 27th sine die.

E. I. Carruthers Secretary

University, Va., June 12th, 1922

The annual meeting of the Rector and Visitors was held on the above date with the following Visitors present: Dillard, Duke, Greever, McIntire, Miss. McVea, Oliver, Scott and Williams and President Alderman.

The Rector being absent, Mr. Scott was elected to preside at this meeting.

The minutes of the previous meeting having been copied and distributed to the members of the Board for examiniation, were approved.

The President announced the following gifts received since the last meeting:

From Mr. A. W. Erickson to President and from President Alderman to the Art Department of the University a set of dry point etchings of the Washington Conference Celebrities, by Mr. Walter Tittle, value $750.00.

From Professor A. H. Tuttle to the Heck Memorial Library a new set of Encyclopedia Britannica.

From Hon. John Bassett Moore certain books to the Law Library.

In connection with the gift of the members of the family of the late William H. White, the President presented the following correspondence:

My mother, sisters, brother and myself are planning to make a contribution to the Centennial Endowment Fund, which we wish to take the shape of a memorial of some kind to my father, William H. White. It is our wish that it be used in some way in connection with the Law School. As we do not know how it could be best used, we are desirous of an expression of an opinion from you. The fund will be available early in May and will be about $10,000.00.

I should like to discuss the details with you in person. At the present time I am not able to travel with any comfort, as I am still suffering from the effects of an automobile accident. Therefore, if you should be coming to Washington at any time in the near future, I wish that you would let me know so that I could meet you. Otherwise, I will endeavor to get to Charlottesville early in May.

Meanwhile, please be good enough to treat this as confidential.

I have your letter of the 7th inst., and it is difficult for me to tell you how much pleasure and satisfaction it would be for me and to this University to have here this memorial to my dear friend, your father. It so happened that we served together on the Board of Visitors and the Alumni Board for over ten years, and I know something of his devotion to the Institution. It is equally pleasing to me that you contemplate something in connection with the Law School. I am coming to Washington, unless I am prevented by reasons not now foreseen, about the 21st of April, and I shall let you know in advance of my coming. Of course, I shall treat your communication as confidential.

Assuring you of my deep interest and appreciation in this matter, I am

Please find enclosed the following checks:

There are also enclosed the following State of Virginia bonds:

These bonds are, I believe, a part of the so-called Riddleberger issue, which the State of Virginia declined to pay in full, but I believe offers some form of compromise. My brother, Dr. W. H. L. White, asked me to transmit them to you as his additional contribution to the fund, and in the hope that it might be possible to get the Legislature of Virginia to pay them in full. He writes me that there is a precedent for this in that sometime ago Mr. Maury gave a number of these bonds to St. Paul's Church in Richmond and that an Act of the Legislature authorized their payment in full, together with the coupons attached. It is his hope that you might be able to secure a similar legislation regarding these bonds.

A letter from your secretary informs me that you will be in Charlottesville on the 13th instant, and I hope to have the pleasure of seeing you during the forenoon of that day.

At the request of the President the following statement outlining the purposes of the William H. White Foundation was approved.

For this Foundation the University of Virginia is indebted to Mrs. Emma Gray White, widow, Emma Gray Trigg, daughter, W. H. Landon White and William H. White, Jr., sons of the late William H. White, a devoted and distinguished alumnus and for many years a Visitor of the University, whose memory the Foundation will perpetuate. The Foundation was established in 1922 by a gift of $10,000.00. The conditions require that the income be used in securing each session the delivery before the University Law School of a series of lectures, preferably not less than three in number, by a jurist or publicist, who is specially distinguished in some branch of jurisprudence, domestic, international, or foreign, that the lecturer present some fresh or unfamiliar aspect of his subject. Each series of lectures shall possess such unity that they may be published in book form, and that the copyright thereof shall vest in the Foundation.

The President reported the resignation of Dr. Thomas Walker Page, whereupon the following resolution was adopted:

RESOLVED, That the Rector and Visitors accept with profound regret the resignation of Dr. Thomas Walker Page, as head of the Department of Economics and Professor of Economics in the University of Virginia. They desire to place on record their appreciation of his long, capable, and faithful service in this field, and express for him their best wishes for usefulness in any new service he may enter.

James William Blincoe for Vanderbilt Fellowship

The following special appropriations were made:

RESOLVED, That Dr. Speidel's salary be fixed, for next session at $2,500, instead of $2,250, as carried by the budget; That $60.00 increase in salary of the office boy in the President's office be allowed; That $200.00 be appropriated for the installation in the President's house of one of the Pittsburg water heaters # 3.

On motion duly seconded the following was adopted:

RESOLVED, That the sum of $1000.000 or so much thereof as may be necessary be and is hereby appropriated to finance an expedition by the Leander McCormick Observatory, to Mexico September 10, 1923 for the purpose of observing the total eclipse of the sun, said sum to be included in the budget of 1923-24.

A petition was presented from the members of the faculty residing on East Lawn calling attention to the fact that for more than three months, during the past winter, while the hot water system of heating was being installed, their respective houses were not supplied with the necessary heat, forcing them to purchase considerable fuel supplies, to remedy the deficiency, and requested a deduction of 25% from the regular charge, which was granted.

The Bursar brought to the attention of the Board the following communication from Mr. I. McD. Garfield, Trustee of the Arthur W. Austin Estate.

The Trustees of the Austin Estate held for a number of years a mortgage from the heirs of Elizabeth C. Blackbird. A year ago last December the mortgage was paid off and we executed a discharge of the same.

It now appears that Mrs. Blackbird originally placed two mortgages, one in 1866 for something over $400., and one on another piece of property in 1869 for something over $800. These two mortgages were subsequently assigned to Arthur W. Austin in 1875. The following year, namely, 1876, Mr. Austin accepted from Mrs. Blackbird a new mortgage for $1500. That is the mortgage which we discharged only in December 1920. It seems apparent from all of the facts that at the time that Mr. Austin took the mortgage in 1876 he intended to discharge the two mortgages then existing, which he had taken by assignment, but the discharge was never attended to or at any rate never recorded. This situation has only just come to light in connection with Mr. Blackbird's effort to place a new mortgage upon the property. I have looked into the matter carefully and am convinced that the Austin Estate and you as residuary legatee had no interest which could be enforced under either of the first two mortgages and that, in fact, they must have been paid, which the present Mr. Blackbird assures me he knows is a fact. Accordingly Mr. Howard Stockton, Jr., as Administrator d. b. n, with the will annexed, of Arthur W. Austin, and I, as one of the Trustees under Mr. Austin's will, have today executed a discharge of the mortgages in question.

I should have preferred to advise you in advance before doing this, but the delay would have been a very great inconvenience to Mr. Blackbird. The situation seems so clear, I proceeded in the matter, but wish to advise you of the fact.

In connection with the foregoing, the following resolution was adopted:

RESOLVED, That the action of I. McD. Garfield, one of the Trustees of the Arthur W. Austin Estate, in executing a discharge of the mortgages as set forth in his letter of May 25th 1922, made a part of this record, be and is hereby approved.

The President presented the following correspondence had with the Carnegie Corporation in connection with its gift of $100,000 to the Centennial Endowment Fund:

The Carnegie Corporation has upon its books an appropriation of One Hundred Thousand dollars ($1000,000) to the University of Virginia on which it is at present paying interest, all conditions in connection therewith having been fulfilled by the University of Virginia. If satisfactory to you, the Corporation will find it convenient to pay this amount in cash on June thirtieth, together with the regular quarterly payment of interest. I am sending you this advance notice in order that you may make what arrangements are necessary for the disposition of the funds.

Edwin A. Alderman, President,

University of Virginia,

Charlottesville, Virginia

I have your communication of the 6th inst., informing me that on June 30, the Corporation will find it convenient to pay the amount of $100,000 to the University of Virginia together with the regular quarterly payment of interest.

I beg to assure you of our very great satisfaction at this information. We shall immediately take steps to invest this money in the wisest possible way, and we shall always retain the liveliest sense of gratitude to the Corporation.

The following communications were received from the Chi Phi Fraternity with respect to a site on the property of the University, on which to erect a Chapter House:

Confirming our conversation of this morning:The Chi Phi Fraternity would like to lease for the purposes of building a fraternity house, a plot of land on Rugby Road between The Gymnasium and the Kappa Sigma house.

It would be our idea to face Kappa Sigma, if this meets with your approval, and we wish to have an attractive building which would add to the appearances of the surrounding grounds and would use plans approved by you and in keeping with the architecture of the other buildings of the University.

We would like to have the lease soon, if your terms are not excessive, so that we can build this summer and be ready for our returning members when college opens next September.

Please refer to our letter of May 31st in which we ask for a lease to a certain piece of land for the use of the Chi Phi Fraternity:-

As we understand that other fraternities are now asking the University for a lease on this same piece of land, we would like to add some information which was not included in our former letter.

If this lease is granted us, the Chi Phi's will build a house costing somewhere about $30,000 to $35,000 and will build it as soon as it is possible under present conditions, avoiding only necessary waste.

We own outright a building lot on Madison Lane and two other lots near the new gymnasium. These lots are unimcumbered and are valued at about $10,000. We will sell them and use the money towards building on the land leased of you.

During the past week we have collected $7,500 of our old men and have promises of $4,000 additional.

Our General Fraternity has also offered to lend us $5,000, but we expect to build without borrowing so that we can turn the house over to our local chapter free of debt and believe that within thirty days we will have all the money we need.

We are also arranging to have the building kept in repair and looked after generally by a local Trust Company.

And as a claim for preference over any other fraternity making a lease on this same lot, we want to remind you that the Chi Phi Fraternity in the spring of 1887 bought of Capt Eugene Davis a part of the grounds now occupied by the Y. M. C. A.

But before this deed had been made to us, although we had paid the price, Prof. Noah K. Davis, representing the Y. M. C. A. requested the Chi Phi's to surrender their lot to the Y. M. C. A as otherwise it would prevent the erection of their building, now known as Madison Hall.

Prof. Davis promised us that when we were ready to build our fraternity house the Y. M. C. A. would deed us a lot 50 by 150 feet at the corner of University Avenue and Madison Lane.

We tried to get Prof. Davis to put this in writing but were unable to get more than his oral promise.

But we were students and, trusting in the promise made by Prof. Davis and also on account of our love for and interest in the University, we relinquished our lot which has since become very valuable to the University and would have met our present needs.

We believe that Prof. W. H. Echols and Dean W. M. Lile have some knowledge of this transaction.

We offer this, not as a claim to any leagal right against the University, but, if the University is willing to lease any lot of its land for fraternity purposes, we trust that we will have the preference.

In connection with the foregoing, the following resolution was adopted:

RESOLVED, That the site facing the Kappa Sigma House be granted to the Chi Phi Fraternity, under the usual terms for leasing sites for Fraternity Houses, provided the house be begun by October 1st., 1922 and completed with reasonable dispatch.

While the Fund is being raised, The Virginia Trust Company, of Richmond, Virginia, will act as Depository and Comptroller of the Fund. Legal title to all securities should be transferred to the Virginia Trust Company, Comptroller and that the Fund raised be handled and treated accordingly.

On behalf of the donors, I have the privilege of presenting to the Rector and Visitors a portrait of the first President of the University of Virginia. It is the work of Eugene Speicher, of New York, a noted artist and portrait painter. The portrait is the joint gift of many alumni, members of the faculty, and other friends of the President and of the University.

This presentation is the fulfillment of a deep and long felt desire that the University of Virginia should own, as one of its cherished possession, a worthy portrait of its distinguished President.

I beg to acknowledge the receipt of your kind letter, in which you announce the presentation to the Rector and Visitors, by a joint group of alumni, members of the faculty, and friends of the University and of the President, a portrait of the first President of the University of Virginia.

I shall have great satisfaction in announcing this gift to the Rector and Visitors at their meeting tonight, and I am sure shall be authorized by them to express to you, ad through you, to the generous givers their gratitude for this gift.

I trust I may be permitted, as an expression of personal gratitude, to say that I deeply appreciate this acto fo thoughtful good will and am genuinely touched to know of the desire to my friends to have this portrait upon the walls of the University which I have sought to serve for so long a period.

Assuring you of my personal affection and good will, and begging that you will in some way convey to the givers of this gift my personal thankfulness, I am,

Please find attached hereto a petition signed by sixteen of your professors living north of the University who request that we build a small waiting room at the end of our car line on Rugby Road, near the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway.

The only place we can find to build a waiting room is in the center of the loop track, which will be on University property, and we wish to ask you kind permission to do so, same to be approved by Prof. Fiske Kimball and Dr. W. A. Lambeth, or any one you may designate.

The proposed waiting room will cost us about $1,000.00 and in view of the fact that our car line is of great service to the University and that we have never increased our rate of fare from five cents, in spite of the great increase in operating expenses, we will greatly appreciate it if you will relieve us of the rental charge of $20.00 a month for the use of the loop at the end of the line, in accordance with agreement with you and this Company dated December 14th, 1918, copy of which is hereto attached.

If granted the above permission we will use our best efforts to erect a very attractive waiting room and with the planting of shrubbery around it we feel sure it will meet the approval of everyone.

Thanking you in advance for your kind consideration of the above, we remain

My mother, sisters, brother and myself are planning to make a contribution to the Centennial Endowment Fund, which we wish to take the shape of a memorial of some kind to my father, William H. White. It is our wish that it be used in some way in connection with the Law School. As we do not know how it could be best used, we are desirous of an expression of an opinion from you. The fund will be available early in May and will be about $10,000.00.

I should like to discuss the details with you in person. At the present time I am not able to travel with any comfort, as I am still suffering from the effects of an automobile accident. Therefore, if you should be coming to Washington at any time in the near future, I wish that you would let me know so that I could meet you. Otherwise, I will endeavor to get to Charlottesville early in May.

Meanwhile, please be good enough to treat this as confidential.

I have your letter of the 7th inst., and it is difficult for me to tell you how much pleasure and satisfaction it would be for me and to this University to have here this memorial to my dear friend, your father. It so happened that we served together on the Board of Visitors and the Alumni Board for over ten years, and I know something of his devotion to the Institution. It is equally pleasing to me that you contemplate something in connection with the Law School. I am coming to Washington, unless I am prevented by reasons not now foreseen, about the 21st of April, and I shall let you know in advance of my coming. Of course, I shall treat your communication as confidential.

Assuring you of my deep interest and appreciation in this matter, I am

There are also enclosed the following State of Virginia bonds:

These bonds are, I believe, a part of the so-called Riddleberger issue, which the State of Virginia declined to pay in full, but I believe offers some form of compromise. My brother, Dr. W. H. L. White, asked me to transmit them to you as his additional contribution to the fund, and in the hope that it might be possible to get the Legislature of Virginia to pay them in full. He writes me that there is a precedent for this in that sometime ago Mr. Maury gave a number of these bonds to St. Paul's Church in Richmond and that an Act of the Legislature authorized their payment in full, together with the coupons attached. It is his hope that you might be able to secure a similar legislation regarding these bonds.

A letter from your secretary informs me that you will be in Charlottesville on the 13th instant, and I hope to have the pleasure of seeing you during the forenoon of that day.

The Trustees of the Austin Estate held for a number of years a mortgage from the heirs of Elizabeth C. Blackbird. A year ago last December the mortgage was paid off and we executed a discharge of the same.

It now appears that Mrs. Blackbird originally placed two mortgages, one in 1866 for something over $400., and one on another piece of property in 1869 for something over $800. These two mortgages were subsequently assigned to Arthur W. Austin in 1875. The following year, namely, 1876, Mr. Austin accepted from Mrs. Blackbird a new mortgage for $1500. That is the mortgage which we discharged only in December 1920. It seems apparent from all of the facts that at the time that Mr. Austin took the mortgage in 1876 he intended to discharge the two mortgages then existing, which he had taken by assignment, but the discharge was never attended to or at any rate never recorded. This situation has only just come to light in connection with Mr. Blackbird's effort to place a new mortgage upon the property. I have looked into the matter carefully and am convinced that the Austin Estate and you as residuary legatee had no interest which could be enforced under either of the first two mortgages and that, in fact, they must have been paid, which the present Mr. Blackbird assures me he knows is a fact. Accordingly Mr. Howard Stockton, Jr., as Administrator d. b. n, with the will annexed, of Arthur W. Austin, and I, as one of the Trustees under Mr. Austin's will, have today executed a discharge of the mortgages in question.

I should have preferred to advise you in advance before doing this, but the delay would have been a very great inconvenience to Mr. Blackbird. The situation seems so clear, I proceeded in the matter, but wish to advise you of the fact.

The Carnegie Corporation has upon its books an appropriation of One Hundred Thousand dollars ($1000,000) to the University of Virginia on which it is at present paying interest, all conditions in connection therewith having been fulfilled by the University of Virginia. If satisfactory to you, the Corporation will find it convenient to pay this amount in cash on June thirtieth, together with the regular quarterly payment of interest. I am sending you this advance notice in order that you may make what arrangements are necessary for the disposition of the funds.

I have your communication of the 6th inst., informing me that on June 30, the Corporation will find it convenient to pay the amount of $100,000 to the University of Virginia together with the regular quarterly payment of interest.

I beg to assure you of our very great satisfaction at this information. We shall immediately take steps to invest this money in the wisest possible way, and we shall always retain the liveliest sense of gratitude to the Corporation.

Confirming our conversation of this morning:The Chi Phi Fraternity would like to lease for the purposes of building a fraternity house, a plot of land on Rugby Road between The Gymnasium and the Kappa Sigma house.

It would be our idea to face Kappa Sigma, if this meets with your approval, and we wish to have an attractive building which would add to the appearances of the surrounding grounds and would use plans approved by you and in keeping with the architecture of the other buildings of the University.

We would like to have the lease soon, if your terms are not excessive, so that we can build this summer and be ready for our returning members when college opens next September.

Please refer to our letter of May 31st in which we ask for a lease to a certain piece of land for the use of the Chi Phi Fraternity:-

As we understand that other fraternities are now asking the University for a lease on this same piece of land, we would like to add some information which was not included in our former letter.

If this lease is granted us, the Chi Phi's will build a house costing somewhere about $30,000 to $35,000 and will build it as soon as it is possible under present conditions, avoiding only necessary waste.

We own outright a building lot on Madison Lane and two other lots near the new gymnasium. These lots are unimcumbered and are valued at about $10,000. We will sell them and use the money towards building on the land leased of you.

During the past week we have collected $7,500 of our old men and have promises of $4,000 additional.

Our General Fraternity has also offered to lend us $5,000, but we expect to build without borrowing so that we can turn the house over to our local chapter free of debt and believe that within thirty days we will have all the money we need.

We are also arranging to have the building kept in repair and looked after generally by a local Trust Company.

And as a claim for preference over any other fraternity making a lease on this same lot, we want to remind you that the Chi Phi Fraternity in the spring of 1887 bought of Capt Eugene Davis a part of the grounds now occupied by the Y. M. C. A.

But before this deed had been made to us, although we had paid the price, Prof. Noah K. Davis, representing the Y. M. C. A. requested the Chi Phi's to surrender their lot to the Y. M. C. A as otherwise it would prevent the erection of their building, now known as Madison Hall.

Prof. Davis promised us that when we were ready to build our fraternity house the Y. M. C. A. would deed us a lot 50 by 150 feet at the corner of University Avenue and Madison Lane.

We tried to get Prof. Davis to put this in writing but were unable to get more than his oral promise.

But we were students and, trusting in the promise made by Prof. Davis and also on account of our love for and interest in the University, we relinquished our lot which has since become very valuable to the University and would have met our present needs.

We believe that Prof. W. H. Echols and Dean W. M. Lile have some knowledge of this transaction.

We offer this, not as a claim to any leagal right against the University, but, if the University is willing to lease any lot of its land for fraternity purposes, we trust that we will have the preference.
