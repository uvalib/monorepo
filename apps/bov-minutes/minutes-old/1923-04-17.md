Prof. F. P. Dunnington, Chairman, of the University Cemetery Committee, brought to the attention of the Board application of Dr. Philip A. Bruce to purchase a lot in the University Cemetery, and asking for instructions in the matter, as Dr. Bruce is not a member of the faculty or otherwise connected with the University officially. After consideration of the matter, the following motion, duly made and seconded, was adopted unanimously.

RESOLVED, That in view of the service rendered the University by Dr. Philip A. Bruce in writing the History of the University of Virginia at great personal sacrifice and without financial remuneration from the University, his application for a burial plot in the University Cemetery be granted and that he be relieved from the usual charge made for such plots.

The question of erecting the proposed Orthopedic and Obstetric Ward to the Hospital was brought up for consideration. Prof. Fiske Kimball, Supervising Architect, reported that bids had been received from several contractors, the lowest being that of the W. P. Thurston Company, of Richmond, Virginia, at $115,310.00, the building to be completed by January 1, 1924.

In the matter of financing the construction the President announced that in addition to the gift of Mr. Paul G. McIntire of $50,000, which had been on hand for the past year, he would designate $25,000.00 of the Col. Oliver H. Payne gift towards its construction, and that, at his request, the Alumni Board of Trustees of the University of Virginia Endowment Fund had agreed to make a loan to the University of $40,000.00 for the said purpose, making in all the sum of $115,000.00, which, together with the interest on the $50,000.00 now on certificate of deposit with the local banks, would provide the sufficient funds.

Following a general discussion of the question, the following resolutions duly made and seconded, were unanimously adopted:

RESOLVED, That the bid of The W. P. Thurston Company of Richmond, Va., of $115,310.00 for the erection of the Orthopedic and Obstetrical ward to the Hospital be and is hereby accepted, and that the Committee on Buildings & Grounds be and is hereby directed to proceed with the erection of the said building and to take such steps as may be necessary in the matter:

RESOLVED, That the Alumni Board of Trustees of the University of Virginia Endowment Fund, be, and it is hereby, requested to lend to the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, to be applied toward the construction of the Orthopedic and Obstetrical wing of the Hospital shortly to be undertaken, a sum not in excess of Forty Thousand ($40,000), payable on demand, the amount, or amounts, advanced to bear interest at the rate of six per centum per annum from and after the dates when such sum or sums shall have been advanced, respectively.

RESOLVED, That the Rector and Secretary of the Board be, and they are hereby, authorized and empowered to execute on behalf of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, their note, payable on demand, to the Alumni Board of Trustees of the University of Virginia Endowment Fund for the aggregate principal sum which may be lent by that Board to the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia in response to the request evidenced by these resolutions, which note shall bear interest from date at the rate of six per centum per annum, and to pay to the said Alumni Board of Trustees any interest that may have accumulated upon advances made by it prior to the date of said note.

The Minutes of the meeting of the Alumni Board of Trustees of the University Endowment Fund, April 9, 1923, a copy of which had been furnished to each member of the Rector and Visitors, was taken up, considered, and those matters requiring the attention of this Board were acted on, as follows:

With respect to the several appropriations made, the following was adopted:

RESOLVED, That the Board of Visitors concur in the several appropriations and expenditures authorized by the Alumni Board of Trustees of the University of Virginia Endowment Fund, as set forth in the minutes of their meeting on April 9, 1923, a copy of which has been submitted to the Board, and express their gratitude for the appropriation enabling them to go forward without interruption to the completion of the Gymnasium and Hospital Wing.

With resepct to the resolution of the Alumni Board of Trustees stating it to be the sense of the said Board that the securities held by said Board should be eliminated from the report of the Bursar on the Endowment Funds of the University and, further, that the Bursar be requested to omit from future reports made by him the list of securities held by this Board, but that a note be made in said report that it does not include any statement of the case and securities held by the Alumni Board of Trustees, etc., the following action was taken:

RESOLVED, That Mr. Robert B. Tunstall, Treasurer of the Alumni Board of Trustees, be requested to consider this question with a committee consisting of the President, Messrs. Duke and McIntire and the Bursar.

Mr. E. H. Coltrane, Sup't of Schools, for Roanoke Rapids, N. C., appeared before the Board and requested that authority be given the Rector to unite in the deed by which some ten acres of land situated in or near Roanoke Rapids, N. C. was to be conveyed to the Board of School Trustees of Roanoke Rapids, by Mr. John Armstrong Chaloner, said deed to be executed also by the proper authorities of the University of North Carolina.

The request was granted and the papers in the matter ordered spread on the minutes.

Copy of paper concerning land near Roanoke Rapids

The situation presented Mr. Coltrane's request was considered fully, it appearing that the property in question being a portion of a larger tract of land which along with other property was dealt with by an instrument in writing under date of May 10th 1912, and which was recorded in the Clerk's Office of Albemarle County, Va., in D. B. 150, P. 36, and by which instrument Mr. Chaloner undertook to convey said property to the Universities of Virginia and North Cardina, jointly, reserving to himself a life estate therein, and also reserving certain rights with reference to encumberance and otherwise.

It was recalled that conveyance of another portion of this land to the Roanoke Rapids School Board had been the subject of extensive correspondence during the early part of 1915, between Mr. John L. Patterson, Secretary of said Board of School Trustees, Mr. Armistead C. Gordon, who was then Rector, Dr. E. A. Alderman, the President, Mr. W. Allen Perkins, Attorney for the University, and Mr. Chaloner himself, that at a meeting held on the 9th of March 1915 the following resolution was adopted upon the subject:-

"The question of whether or not the University has a right to join in a deed conveying its rights in this property was discussed at length, and owing to the uncertain position of the University in the premises the whole matter was referred to the Rector to investigate."

That after full investigation by the Rector, the Attorney for the University and several members of the Board, at a meeting of this Board held April 1915, the following resolution was adopted:-

"That in view of the position taken by Mr. Chaloner, we feel that it would not be proper for this Board to take any action in the matter, and the Secretary is instructed to express to Mr. Patterson the regret of the Board at its inability to comply with his request."

The "position taken by Mr. Chaloner" was set out in a letter from Mr. Chaloner to Mr. John L. Patterson under date of February 24th, 1915, and is expressed as follows:

"I cannot under any circumstances unite with said Universities. Such an act would be an open admission onmy part that there was a cloud upon the deed—which there is not."

In a letter to Mr. Coltrane under date of October 24th 1922, Mr. Perkins, writing as Attorney for the University, in explanation of the foregoing action on the part of the Board, makes the following statement:-

"An examination of my correspondence with Mr. Patterson makes it plain that the difficulty of the University of Virginia was that in 1915 Mr. Chaloner refused to unite in the deed along with the Universities of Virginia and North Carolina. The University of Virginia therefore felt that in view of this attitude of Mr. Chaloner's it would probably be ungracious in it to take any affirmative action."

It is understood, however, that Mr. Chaloner is willing to make the conveyance now in question provided the Universities of North Carolina and Virginia will unite with him in his deed and convey and right, title or interest held by them in and to the land in question. It is considered, therefore, that the objection referred to above does not apply to the present case, and it is, therefore

RESOLVED, That the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, through its Rector and Secretary execute and deliver to the Board of School Trustees of Roanoke Rapids, North Carolina, a deed in fee for all its right, title, interest and estate in and to that certain tract or parcel of land situate in Roanoke Rapids Township, Halifax County, North Carolina, containing ten acres more or less and being a portion of the larger tract referred to in the foregoing preamble, said ten acres being accurately described in a deed which is presented to this meeting for execution, copy of which is ordered spread as a part of this resolution.

On motion, duly seconded, it was

RESOLVED, That the Rector be and is hereby authorized to execute a release deed to R. L. Carter for approximately 18 acres of a tract of some 95 acres of land on which the University holds a deed of trust to secure a bond of $1500 held for the University Cemetery Association.

Professor Fiske Kimball, Supervising Architect, presented his bill for preparing plans for the proposed orthopedic and obstetrical wing to the Hospital, in the sum of $2,035.95; same was approved for payment.

A petition from the Albemarle Game and Fish Association, W. H. Echols, President, was presented requesting the Board to take action declaring the property of the University to be a perpetual game refuge and sanctuary under the laws of the State Providing and inviting the establishment of such sanctuaries and game refuges for the purpose of protecting and propagating game birds, etc. On motion, duly made and seconded, the following resolution was adopted:

RESOLVED, That the property of the University of Virginia, be, and is hereby, declared to be a perpetual game refuge and sanctuary under the laws of the State, and the Department of Game and Inland Fisheries be, and is hereby requested to establish a sanctuary and game preserve thereon for the purpose of protecting and propagating game birds, etc.
