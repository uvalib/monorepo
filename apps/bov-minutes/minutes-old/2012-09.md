**NCAA Orientation**

**The Rector introduced Mr. Eric Baumgartner, Associate Athletics Director of Compliance, to provide training on NCAA rules. He said the rules are complex, and the NCAA expects a university to monitor their athletics program through policies and procedures. President Sullivan has delegated responsibility for developing policies and procedures to the Director of Athletics and the Director of Compliance. The Faculty Representative is also part of the system for institutional control.**

**Mr. Baumgartner said boosters are representatives of athletic interests, and this includes Board of Visitor members. Board members may not engage in recruiting. This means Board members should not meet with or speak with prospective student athletes or their parents or guardians either on Grounds or off Grounds. Recruiting is prohibited for high school students in grades 9 through 12. There are different levels of violations; sanctions include banning from post-season play, fines, and many other potential sanctions.**

**ACC Certification**

**The Atlantic Coast Conference requires the Rector to read a certification to the Board that states the President is responsible for the athletics program and has full authority from the Board to run the program. The Rector read the certification, and said she and President Sullivan would sign it later.**

**Comments by the Student Member**

**Ms. Hillary Hurd said student groups have organized information sessions and panel discussions to appreciate the events of the summer and to talk about what the President’s reinstatement means for students, how they may engage with the Faculty Senate and the Board of Visitors, and what ways students might share their experiences. She listed some resources available for students, including the Institute for Humanities and Global Culture forum, to share and test ideas.**

**President’s Report**

**President Sullivan said she would focus her remarks primarily on faculty salaries and Access UVA following her initial comments. She said the University had retained its U.S. News ranking as the number two public university, after Berkeley, and ranked 24th overall, up from 25th a year ago. The University has the lowest ranking for financial resources among the top 25 universities, number 53. She said alumni giving has been very strong.**

**Ms. Sullivan said the Atlantic Coast Conference has added Notre Dame to the conference. Their football program remains independent; however, they will be obligated to play a certain number of games against ACC opponents every year.**

**Faculty Salary Proposal**

**The President explained her proposal for increasing faculty salaries. She said her goal is to be in the top 20 in the AAU faculty salary survey within five years. The University is behind, on average, $7,700 per faculty member. Efforts to lure faculty away are more intense this year than in recent previous years. The University has a high number of faculty retiring over the next few years as well. She said there will be a 3% across-the-board bonus for this year approved by the General Assembly, but next year we would like to start to put aside a pot of money to pay faculty salaries. This will require support from the legislature, donors, the foundations, and monies from the President’s Fund for Excellence. The College Foundation has already indicated a willingness to work with the President on this goal. We may increase the endowment payout to assist in reaching the goal. For this coming year, she said we will be able to reach this number through many sources including one-time savings of $4 million and a 3.1% tuition increase.**

**President Sullivan said there are some barriers and caveats. The different schools have different market positions, and the increases should be awarded on a merit basis that requires serious peer review. In any raise, the schools will need to pick up most of the costs, and so we may need to set up a system to subsidize certain schools. She said this is the single most important priority for the coming year.**

**Access UVa**

**Access UVA is the number one financial aid program of any public university according to Princeton Review. The total annual cost of the program is $95.4 million, but this includes all sources of funds. The President explained the program’s four main components. The program keeps an education for low income students affordable and assists middle income families.**

**President Sullivan explained the phases of work of Art and Science, the consulting firm that was engaged to do a thorough review of the Access UVA program. She said their benchmarking and survey research will be presented at the November Board meeting. Once the survey results are finalized, the firm will synthesize their findings and develop recommendations to bring to the Finance and Educational Policy committees for discussion. Program modifications will be presented for approval at the meeting currently slated for June 2013.**

**Ms. Sullivan said this year the University saved $3.3 million by making administrative changes, and we plan to make more changes in the future to save costs.**

**Gifts and Grants Report**

**The President said philanthropic cash flow to the University of Virginia and its related foundations was $247,477,983.15 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2012. This is an increase of $16,314,839.75, or 7.12% above the results of the previous fiscal year. Most of the schools and units reported results above last fiscal year, most notably, the Jefferson Scholars Foundation, Women’s Center, the UVa Fund, and the University of Virginia’s College at Wise more than doubled their results.**

**For the first month of fiscal year 2012-13, philanthropic cash flow is $7,945,960.07, with an additional $5,832,891.73 pledged.  Although cash flow is below the results of July 2011, the schools of Engineering, Law, and Medicine, the Darden School, the Curry School of Education, Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy, and the UVA Fund all achieved a strong first month in fiscal year 2013.**
