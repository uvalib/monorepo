(At the lunch in the Rotunda which preceded the meeting, the Board met Mr. Tony Bennett, the new head Men’s Basketball coach.)

The Rector asked Mr. Hardie to lead the Pledge of Allegiance.

Approval of the Minutes of the Meeting of February 5-6, 2009

On motion, the Board approved the Minutes of the last Board meeting, held February 5th and 6th.

Approval of Resolution to Consider Addenda to the Agenda

As is required by the Manual of the Board of Visitors, the Board approved the following resolution permitting it to consider addenda to the published Agenda:

RESOLVED, the consideration of addenda to the published Agenda of this meeting of the Board of Visitors is approved.

Introduction of Mr. Gorawara, the Student Member-elect

The Rector introduced Mr. Rahul Gorawara, the Student Member-elect. Mr. Gorawara, who is from Buffalo Grove, Illinois, is both a third year undergraduate student and a first year graduate student: he will take degrees in two subjects from the School of Engineering and one from the College in May; he is a first year graduate student in the Batten School, from which he will take a degree in May, 2010.

Mr. Gorawara will become the Student Member at the conclusion of this meeting of the Board.

Comments by the Rector

The Rector made several announcements on Board matters and encouraged Members to attend Founder’s Day at The University of Virginia’s College at Wise on April 13th.

He then called on the Secretary to read a statement into the Minutes:

The University of Virginia Art Museum: Statement on the Naming of the Museum

“There has been confusion over the years about the proper name of the University’s Art Museum, which was built in the 1930s. It has been called the Bayly because the bequest that paid for part of it was made in honor of Thomas Bayly, but the proper name for it should be The University of Virginia Art Museum. As best as I have been able to ascertain, this is the name that was given to it when it opened, but as is typical of that era, there is no recorded Board resolution covering this.

So in an attempt to resolve the confusion, and assuming that this name was approved by the Board when the building was finished, I want to read into the record in the Minutes of this meeting that the name of the museum is The University of Virginia Art Museum.”

Report on Plans for Entertaining Former Board Members

The Rector reminded the Board that – following the recommendations made by Mr. Diamonstein’s committee – at the February meeting he had charged the Secretary-elect and the Secretary with identifying a home football game to which former Board Members could be invited in the fall. He then called on Ms. Harris, the Secretary-elect, to report.

Ms. Harris said she and the Secretary had identified the football game with Texas Christian University, set for September 12th – which immediately follows the September meeting of the Board – as the best date. They suggest, too, that there be a formal program of about an hour, involving both current and former Members, before the game. The program would include an update on University issues of the moment.

The Rector said it seemed a workable plan and he asked Ms. Harris to proceed with organizing it.

Naming of Rice Hall

The Rector called on the President to present a resolution on the naming of the Information Technology Building at the School of Engineering; the groundbreaking for the construction of the building will take place on April 17th.

The President explained that Paul G. Rice and his wife, Gina, who live in Warrenton, have made a significant gift – the second largest, in fact, in the history of the School of Engineering – toward the construction of the building. He proposed that the building be named Rice Hall in recognition of the Rices’ gift.

On motion, the Board approved the following resolution:

NAMING OF THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ENGINEERING

BUILDING RICE HALL

WHEREAS, Paul G. Rice, an alumnus of the School of

Engineering, and his wife, Gina, of Warrenton, through the

Rice Family Foundation, have made a splendid gift to the School

of Engineering, the second largest ever given to the School; and

WHEREAS, the Rice Family Foundation gift will provide a

significant portion of the funding for the Information Technology Engineering Building, to be built at the intersection of Whitehead

and Stadium Roads; and

WHEREAS, the groundbreaking for this building will take

place on April 17, 2009;

RESOLVED, the Board of Visitors names the Information Technology Engineering Building Rice Hall and thanks Mr. and Mrs. Rice for their generosity and support.

*   \- - - - - - - -

Summer Orientation

The Secretary presented the schedule for the Summer Orientation sessions and urged Members to continue the custom of a Board Member opening each session with a short speech on the importance of the Honor System.

President’s Report

The Rector asked the President to make his customary report.

The President referred to three things put at Members’ places: “Scientific Jefferson Revealed,” a new book by Martin Clagett; a Garden Week insert from DP Magazine with articles about Carr’s Hill and Morven; and a copy of the Morven website pages.

Recalling his written report to the Board last month, the President outlined funding that will be available to the University through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA): the University will receive $10.7million in ARRA funds in 2009-10 to offset the Governor’s recommended $23.1million cut in General Funds, which would leave a net reduction of $12.4million in 2009-10.

So far, the University has submitted proposals for competitive grants totaling $2.9million: all are proposals to the National Institutes of Health, save an application for an Americorps grant for the College Guide Program.

The Governor, he said, has not taken action to fund proposals received under the economic stabilization portion of the funds available to the state.

The University has received $1.1million to pay for detailed planning of Ruffner Hall.

The President then reported on development related trips he has made in the last month to Florida and to Hong Kong, as well as trips planned later in the spring.

Gifts and Grants Report

Turning to his report on gifts and grants received since the last meeting of the Board, the President said that philanthropic giving to the University and its related foundations for the current fiscal year, as of February 28th, amounts to $172,990,411, a decrease of 15.51% from the amount given in the same period last year. Despite the economic situation, gifts to the University in a number of categories have shown increases over the same period in the last fiscal year.

Among significant gifts received in this reporting period are a grant of $1,000,000 from the Wallace H. Coulter Foundation to the Biomedical Engineering Department in the School of Medicine; a grant of $720,000 from the American Cancer Society to the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology in the Medical School; a $400,000 grant from the Dana Foundation to the Pathology Department in the Medical School; $399,000 from the Andrus Family Fund to the Institute of Environmental Negotiation in the School of Architecture; and a pledge of $350,000 from the Manley Family Foundation toward the South Lawn Project.

A significant new pledge is $10,700,000 from the Hunter Smith Family Foundation for the Cavalier Marching Band Rehearsal Hall, as well as a pledge of $4,000,000 to The University of Virginia’s College at Wise for the Dining Commons.

Other important new pledges are $1,000,000 from the William Stamps Farish Fund to the McIntire School; $500,000 from Dr. Gwo Jaw Wang and Mrs. Chen-Mei Wang to the School of Medicine; and $500,000 from Timothy J. Ingrassia (a former Student Member of the Board) for the Echols Scholars Program.

The Rector asked for a motion to approve the Gifts and Grants Report. The motion was made, seconded, and the Report was approved.

The Rector called on Mr. Payne to make an announcement:

Gift in Honor of Mr. Farrell

Mr. Payne, as a member of the law firm McGuire Woods, read a letter from Mr. Richard Cullen of the firm, addressed to the President.

“Dear John:

“Inspired by the example of our former partner and great friend, Ton Farrell, McGuire Woods commits $65,000 to the Clarence B. Cain Scholarship. As you may know, Mr. Cain was Tom’s Resident Assistant during the future Rector’s first year at the University. Our firm is pleased to support this and the related Ridley Scholarship Fund which does so much to ensure a rich and diverse student body.”

\- - - - - - - - - - -

The Board recessed meeting as the full Board at 1:50 p.m., and began meeting in Committee.

Board Dinner

The Board Dinner in the Dome Room of the Rotunda on April 2nd,

as is customary, was given in honor of retiring members of the faculty of the University.

\- - - - - - - - - - - -

The Board resumed meeting as the full Board at 12:25 p.m., on Friday, April 3rd. All Members were present.

After adopting the following motions, the Board went into Executive Session:

     That the Board of Visitors convene in Closed Session to consult with General Counsel regarding his privileged legal report to the Board on pending and anticipated litigation affecting the University, as provided for in Section 2.2-3711 (A) (7) of the Code of Virginia.

Executive Session

The Board met in Executive Session until 12:45 p.m. when, after adopting the following resolution, it resumed its meeting in Open Session:

That we vote on and record our certification that, to the best of each Board member’s knowledge, only public business matters lawfully exempted from open meeting requirements and which were identified in the motion(s) authorizing the closed session, were heard, discussed or considered in closed session.

The Board Retreat

At the Rector’s request, Mr. Wynne, the Vice Rector, reported on plans for the Board’s Retreat in July; he distributed copies of a proposed outline of the Retreat Agenda, which was considered and agreed to by the Ad-Hoc Committee on Revenue Sources on April 1st (see the Minutes of that meeting for the complete text of the proposed outline of the Retreat Agenda). Mr. Wynne reminded the Board that the Retreat will be held July 10, and 11, at the Boar’s Head Inn in Albemarle County. He said that the necessary materials will be distributed to Members well in advance of the Retreat, and he urged that this material be read and considered before the meeting. The Retreat, he said, “will not be a dog and pony show.”

ATTACHMENT A

The University of Virginia Program to Prevent, Detect, and Mitigate Identity Theft

The University of Virginia Program to Prevent, Detect, and Mitigate Identity Theft is composed of existing University policies and procedures, related to identity theft and incident reporting, along with a plan for the development of new policies and procedures in specific areas.

The institution already has in place several core existing policies and procedures which address various aspects of identity theft. These policies and procedures include, but are not limited to:

*   Protection and Use of Social Security Numbers
*   Electronic Storage of Highly Sensitive Data
*   Rights of Students at the University of Virginia Pursuant to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)
*   Issuance and Use of University Identification Cards
*   University Payroll Employee Responsibilities
*   Release of Information from Faculty Personnel Records
*   Confidentiality of Patient Information
*   Patient Identification
*   Verification for Release of Patient Information
*   Information Technology Security Risk Management Program
*   Electronic Data Removal Policy
*   University Information Technology Security Incident Reporting Policy
*   Reporting Fraudulent Transactions

These policies and procedures will continue to be in effect to reduce the risk of identity theft at the University of Virginia.

There are also new and proposed policies and procedures to further enhance the institution’s compliance with the requirements of the Red Flags Rule. These new and proposed policies and procedures include, but are not limited to:

*   Medical Center Policy: Prevention, Detection, and Mitigation of the Theft of Patients’ Identities (NEW)
*   Academic Division Policy: Prevention, Detection, and Mitigation of Identity Theft (PROPOSED)

These policies will require relevant University departments to create procedures to:

1.  Identify indicators of identity theft (“red flags”) that are relevant to the University’s operations;
2.  Detect identified red flags and respond appropriately to detected red flags in order to prevent and mitigate identity theft;
3.  Educate employees regarding their responsibilities under the Identity Theft Prevention Program;
4.  Require vendors that perform activities involving accounts covered by the Red Flags Rule to have equivalent policies and procedures, and to report observed red flags to the University;

Responsible University Official

The Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer shall be the oversight executive for the Program and may delegate administration of the Program to appropriate senior University officials. The oversight executive or his designees shall exercise appropriate and effective management of the Program, and shall update it periodically to respond to evolving risks of identity theft.

The Registrar shall not be required to transfer or exchange any Series 2009 Bond selected or called for redemption pursuant to the provisions therein or from a Record Date through the next succeeding Interest Payment Date.

Whenever any Series 2009 Bonds shall be surrendered for registration of transfer, the University shall execute and the Registrar shall authenticate and deliver a new Series 2009 Bonds, of authorized denominations of the same maturity and interest rate and for a like aggregate principal amount.

*   *   *   1.  to any Bondholder, if an Event of Default (as hereinafter defined) shall have occurred and be continuing; and
            2.  to the Holders of 25% or more in aggregate principal amount of the Series 2009 Bonds then outstanding, at any time.

Prior to due presentment for registration of transfer of any Bond, the Registrar shall treat the registered owner as the person exclusively entitled to payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest and the exercise of all other rights and powers of the owner, except that interest payments shall be made to the person registered as owner on the registration books of the Registrar as of the 15th day of the month preceding the Interest Payment Date.

*   1.  **Temporary Series 2009 Bonds**. The Series 2009 Bonds may be issued in temporary form exchangeable for definitive Series 2009 Bonds when ready for delivery. Any temporary Bond may be printed, lithographed or typewritten, shall be of such denomination as may be determined by the University and may contain such reference to any of the provisions of this Resolution as may be appropriate. A temporary Bond may be in the form of a single Bond payable in installments, each on the date, in the amount and at the rate of interest established for the Series 2009 Bonds maturing on such date. Every temporary Bond shall be executed by the University and be authenticated by the Registrar upon the same conditions and in substantially the same manner as the definitive Series 2009 Bonds. If the University issues temporary Series 2009 Bonds it will execute and deliver definitive Series 2009 Bonds as promptly thereafter as practicable, and thereupon the temporary Series 2009 Bonds may be surrendered, for cancellation, in exchange therefor at the designated office of the Registrar and the Registrar shall authenticate and deliver in exchange for such temporary Series 2009 Bonds an equal aggregate principal amount of definitive Series 2009 Bonds of authorized denominations of the same maturity or maturities and interest rate. Until so exchanged, the temporary Series 2009 Bonds shall be entitled to the same benefits under this Resolution as definitive Series 2009 Bonds authenticated and delivered hereunder.
    2.  **Series 2009 Bonds Mutilated, Lost, Destroyed or Stolen**. If any Series 2009 Bond shall become mutilated, the University, at the expense of the Bondholder of such Series 2009 Bond, shall execute, and the Registrar shall thereupon authenticate and deliver, a new Series 2009 Bond of like tenor bearing a different number in exchange and substitution for the Series 2009 Bond so mutilated, but only upon surrender to the Registrar of the Series 2009 Bond so mutilated. Every mutilated Series 2009 Bond so surrendered to the Registrar shall be canceled by it and shall be delivered to, or upon the order of, the University. If any Series 2009 Bond shall be lost, destroyed or stolen, evidence of the ownership thereof and of such loss, destruction or theft may be submitted to the University, and the Registrar and, if such evidence be satisfactory to both of them and indemnity satisfactory to them shall be given, the University, at the expense of the Bondholder, shall execute, and the Registrar shall thereupon authenticate and deliver, a new Series 2009 Bond of like tenor bearing a different number in lieu of and in substitution for the Series 2009 Bond so lost, destroyed or stolen (or if any such Series 2009 Bond shall have matured or shall be about to mature, instead of issuing a substitute Series 2009 Bond, the Paying Agent may pay the same without surrender thereof). The University may require payment of a sum not exceeding the actual cost of preparing each new Series 2009 Bond issued under this Section and of the related expenses which may be incurred by the University, the Registrar, and the Paying Agent. Any Series 2009 Bond issued under the provisions of this Section in lieu of any Series 2009 Bond alleged to be lost, destroyed or stolen shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation on the part of the University whether or not the Bond so alleged to be lost, destroyed or stolen be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to the benefits of this Resolution with all other Series 2009 Bonds secured by this Bond Resolution.
    3.  **Terms and Conditions for Issuance and Delivery of the Series 2009 Bonds**. The Series 2009 Bonds authorized by this Bond Resolution shall be executed in the form and manner hereinabove set forth and shall be deposited with the Registrar for delivery to the Underwriters pursuant to the Bond Purchase Agreement, but before the Series 2009 Bonds shall be delivered by the Registrar, there shall be filed with the Registrar the following:
        1.  a copy, certified by the Secretary of the Board, of this Bond Resolution;
        2.  an opinion of Bond Counsel stating that the issuance of the Series 2009 Bonds has been duly authorized and that all conditions precedent to the delivery of such Bonds have been fulfilled.

When the documents mentioned above in this Section shall have been filed with the Registrar and when the Series 2009 Bonds shall have been executed as required by this Bond Resolution, the Registrar shall deliver such Bonds to or upon the order of the Underwriters pursuant to the Bond Purchase Agreement, but only upon payment to the Custodian of the purchase price of such Bonds. The Registrar shall be entitled to rely upon such Bond Purchase Agreement as to the names of the purchasers and the amount of such purchase price.

The proceeds of such Bonds shall be deposited as described in Section 4.1.

*   1.  **Book Entry Provisions**. The provisions of this Section 2.11 shall apply to the Series 2009 Bonds so long as all of the Series 2009 Bonds shall be maintained in book-entry form with a Securities Depository, any other provisions of this Bond Resolution to the contrary notwithstanding.
        1.  The principal or redemption price of and interest on the Series 2009 Bonds shall be payable to the Securities Depository, or registered assigns, as the registered owner of the Series 2009 Bonds, in same day funds on each date on which the principal of, and premium, if any, or interest on the Series 2009 Bonds is due as set forth in this Bond Resolution and in the Series 2009 Bonds. Such payments shall be made to the offices of the Securities Depository specified by the Securities Depository to the University and Paying Agent in writing. Without notice to or the consent of the beneficial owners of the Series 2009 Bonds, the University and the Securities Depository may agree in writing to make payments of principal and interest in a manner different from that set out herein. If such different manner of payment is agreed upon, the University shall give the Paying Agent written notice thereof, and the Paying Agent shall make payments as if set forth herein. Neither the University nor the Paying Agent shall have any obligation with respect to the transfer or crediting of the appropriate principal, premium, if any, and interest payments to participants of the Securities Depository or the beneficial owners of the Series 2009 Bonds or their nominees.
        2.  The Paying Agent at the written direction of the University may replace any Securities Depository as the depository for the Series 2009 Bonds with another qualified securities depository or discontinue the maintenance of the Series 2009 Bonds in book-entry form at any time if the University determines to do so. Notice of any determination above shall be given to such Securities Depository at least 30 days prior to any such discontinuation (or such fewer number of days as shall be acceptable to such Securities Depository). The University may undertake to locate a qualified replacement Securities Depository and/or may discontinue the book-entry system of evidencing ownership of the Series 2009 Bonds.
        3.  If the University discontinues the maintenance of the Series 2009 Bonds in book-entry form, the University will issue replacement Series 2009 Bonds directly to the participants in the former Securities Depository or, to the extent requested by any such participant, to the beneficial owners of the Series 2009 Bonds as further described in this Section. At the written direction of the University, the Paying Agent shall notify participants and the beneficial owners of the Series 2009 Bonds, by mailing an appropriate notice to the Securities Depository, or by other means deemed appropriate by either the Securities Depository or the Paying Agent, that the University will issue replacement Series 2009 Bonds directly to the participants shown on the records of the Securities Depository or, to the extent requested by any participant, to beneficial owners of the Series 2009 Bonds shown on the records of such participant, as of a date set forth in such notice, which shall be a date at least 10 days after receipt of such notice by the Securities Depository (or such fewer number of days as shall be acceptable to the Securities Depository).

In the event that replacement Series 2009 Bonds are to be issued to participants in the Securities Depository or to beneficial owners of the Series 2009 Bonds, the University shall promptly have prepared replacement Series 2009 Bonds registered in the names of the participants as shown on the records of the former Securities Depository or, to the extent requested by any participant, in the names of the beneficial owners of Series 2009 Bonds shown on the records of such participant, as of the date set forth in the notice delivered in accordance with the immediately preceding paragraph. Replacement Series 2009 Bonds issued to participants in the Securities Depository or to beneficial owners shall be in fully registered form substantially in the form of Exhibit A. The form set forth in Exhibit A may be modified to include any variations, omissions or insertions that are necessary or desirable in the delivery of replacement certificates in printed form. In delivering replacement certificates, the Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely, without independent investigation, on the records of the former Securities Depository as to its participants and the records of the participants acting on behalf of the beneficial owners. The Series 2009 Bonds will thereafter be registrable and exchangeable as set forth in Sections 2.6 and 2.7.

*   *   1.  So long as there is a Securities Depository for the Series 2009 Bonds, (1) such Securities Depository shall be the registered owner of the Series 2009 Bonds, (2) transfers of ownership and exchanges shall be effected on the records of the Securities Depository and its participants pursuant to rules and procedures established by such Securities Depository and its participants, and (3) references in this Resolution to Bondholders, Holders or registered owners of the Series 2009 Bonds shall mean the Securities Depository and shall not mean the beneficial owners of the Series 2009 Bonds.
        2.  If the University replaces any Securities Depository as the depository for the Series 2009 Bonds with another qualified Securities Depository, replacement Series 2009 Bonds issued to such replacement Securities Depository shall have the same terms, form and content as the Series 2009 Bonds initially registered in the name of the predecessor Securities Depository or its nominee except for the name of the registered owner.
        3.  Each Securities Depository and the participants thereof and the beneficial owners of the Series 2009 Bonds, by their acceptance of the Series 2009 Bonds, agree that the University and the Paying Agent shall have no liability or responsibility with respect to (1) the accuracy of any records maintained by such Securities Depository or any Securities Depository participant; (2) the payment by such Securities Depository to any Securities Depository participant or by any Securities Depository participant to any beneficial owner of any amount due in respect of the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on the Series 2009 Bonds; (3) the delivery or timeliness of delivery by such Securities Depository to any Securities Depository participant or by any Securities Depository participant to any beneficial owner of any notice which is given to Bondholders; (4) the selection of the beneficial owners to receive payment in the event of any partial redemption of the Series 2009 Bonds; or (5) any consent given or other action taken by such Securities Depository or any nominee of such Securities Depository, as Bondholder.

    REDEMPTION OF THE SERIES 2009 BONDS
    1.  **Redemption of the Series 2009 Bonds**.

The Series 2009 Bonds shall not be subject to prior redemption except as provided in this Article III.

*   *   1.  The Series 2009 Bonds are subject to redemption prior to their maturity at the option of the University, in whole or in part on any date, at a redemption price equal to the greater of:

100% of the principal amount of the Series 2009 Bonds to be redeemed; or

the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to the maturity date of the Series 2009 Bonds to be redeemed, not including any portion of those payments of interest accrued and unpaid as of the date on which the Series 2009 Bonds are to be redeemed, discounted to the date on which the Series 2009 Bonds are to be redeemed on a semi-annual basis, assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months, at the Treasury Rate, plus \_\_ basis points, plus, in each case, accrued interest on the Series 2009 Bonds to be redeemed to the redemption date.

At the request of the Paying Agent, the redemption price of the Series 2009 Bonds to be redeemed at the option of the University shall be determined by an independent accounting firm, investment banking firm or financial advisor retained by the University at the University’s expense to calculate such redemption price. The Paying Agent and the University may conclusively rely on the determination of such redemption price by such independent accounting firm, investment banking firm or financial advisor and shall not be liable for such reliance.

*   *   1.  Subject to applicable procedures of the Securities Depository while the Series 2009 Bonds are held in book-entry only form by the Securities Depository, if less than all of the Series 2009 Bonds are to be called for redemption, the Series 2009 Bonds to be redeemed shall be selected by the University in such manner as the University in its discretion may determine.
    
    1.  **Notice of Redemption**.

Whenever the Series 2009 Bonds are to be redeemed under the provisions of this Resolution, the Paying Agent shall, not less than thirty (30) nor more than sixty (60) days prior to the redemption date, mail notice of redemption to all registered owners of all Series 2009 Bonds to be redeemed at their registered addresses. The Paying Agent shall also mail a copy of any such notice of redemption to any Rating Agency. Any such notice of redemption shall identify the Series 2009 Bonds to be redeemed, shall specify the redemption date and the redemption price, and shall state that on the redemption date the Series 2009 Bonds called for redemption will be payable at the designated office of the Paying Agent and that from that date interest will cease to accrue. The Paying Agent may use "CUSIP" numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Bondholders, provided that any such notice shall state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Series 2009 Bonds or as contained in any such notice.

*   *   1.  If at the time of mailing of notice of any optional redemption the University shall not have caused to be deposited with the Paying Agent money sufficient to redeem all the Series 2009 Bonds called for redemption, such notice may state that it is conditional in that it is subject to the deposit of such moneys with the Paying Agent not later than the redemption date, and such notice shall be of no effect unless such moneys are so deposited. Failure by the Paying Agent to give any notice of redemption or any defect in such notice as to any particular Bonds shall not affect the validity of the call for redemption of any Bonds in respect of which no such failure or defect has occurred. Any notice mailed as provided in this Bond Resolution shall be conclusively presumed to have been given whether or not actually received by any Holder.
    
    1.  **Effect of Calling for Redemption**. On the date designated for redemption, notice having been mailed in the manner and under the conditions hereinabove provided and moneys for payment of the redemption price being held in separate accounts by the Paying Agent in trust for the Holders of the Series 2009 Bonds to be redeemed, all as provided in this Resolution, the Series 2009 Bonds so called for redemption shall become and be due and payable at the redemption price provided for redemption of such Bonds on such date, interest on the Series 2009 Bonds so called for redemption shall cease to accrue, such Bonds shall cease to be entitled to any benefit or security under this Resolution and the Holders or registered owners of such Bonds shall have no rights with respect thereto except to receive payment of the redemption price.
    2.  **The Series 2009 Bonds Redeemed Not Deemed Outstanding**. The Series 2009 Bonds which have been duly called for redemption under the provisions of this Article, or with respect to which irrevocable instructions to call for redemption have been given by the Board to the Paying Agent in form satisfactory to him or her, and for the payment of the redemption price of which moneys shall be held in separate accounts by the Paying Agent in trust for the Holders of the Series 2009 Bonds to be redeemed, all as provided in this Resolution, shall not thereafter be deemed to be outstanding under the provisions of this Resolution.

All moneys from the funds of the University or that the University shall have received from any other source and set aside or deposited with any Paying Agent for the purpose of paying any of the Series 2009 Bonds hereby secured, either at the maturity thereof or upon call for redemption, shall be held in trust for the respective Holders of such Bonds. Any moneys which shall be so set aside or deposited and which shall remain unclaimed by the Holders of such Bonds for the period of five (5) years after the date on which such Bonds shall have become due and payable shall be disposed of by the University and the Paying Agent in accordance with The Uniform Disposition of Unclaimed Property Act, Chapter 11.1, Title 55, Code of Virginia of 1950, as amended (the "Unclaimed Property Act").

        1.  Limitation on Parity Credit Obligations. The University may incur, assume, guarantee or otherwise become liable on any Parity Credit Obligation, but only if, prior to the incurrence of each such Parity Credit Obligation, an Authorized Officer of the University certifies in writing that (1) taking into account the incurrence of such proposed Parity Credit Obligation (i) the University will have sufficient funds to meet all of its financial obligations, including its obligations to pay principal of and interest on all Credit Obligations, for all Fiscal Years to and including the second full Fiscal Year after the later of (A) the issuance of such Parity Credit Obligation and (B) the completion of any facility financed with the proceeds of such Parity Credit Obligation, and (ii) such Authorized Officer has no reason to believe that the University will not have sufficient funds to pay all amounts due under all indebtedness of the University during the term of such proposed Parity Credit Obligation, and (2) to the best of his or her knowledge, the University is not in default in the performance and observance of any of the provisions of this Resolution. Any such Parity Credit Obligation shall be secured by a pledge of Pledged Revenues on a parity with the pledge of Pledged Revenues herein, unless expressly subordinated to the pledge hereof.

The University may incur, assume, guarantee or otherwise become liable on any Credit Obligation pursuant to the provisions of Article X, Section 9(c) of the Constitution of Virginia, as such section may be amended from time to time, and may pledge and apply such portion of the Pledged Revenues as may be necessary to provide for the payment of any such Credit Obligation, the funding of reasonable reserves therefor, or the payment of operating and other reasonable expenses of the facilities financed in whole or in part with the proceeds of such Credit Obligation or facilities reasonably related to such facilities, and such pledge shall be senior and superior in all respects to the pledge of Pledged Revenues securing the Series 2009 Bonds and any other Parity Credit Obligations, but only if, prior to the incurrence of each such Credit Obligation, an Authorized Officer of the University certifies in writing that (1) taking into account the incurrence of such proposed Credit Obligation (i) the University will have sufficient funds to meet all of its financial obligations, including its obligations to pay principal of and interest on all Credit Obligations, for all Fiscal Years to and including the second full Fiscal Year after the later of (A) the issuance of such proposed Credit Obligation and (B) the completion of any facility financed with the proceeds of such proposed Credit Obligation, and (ii) such Authorized Officer has no reason to believe that the University will not have sufficient funds to pay all amounts due under all indebtedness of the University during the term of such proposed Credit Obligation, (2) to the best of his or her knowledge, the University is not in default in the performance and observance of any of the provisions of this Resolution, and (3) in connection with the issuance of such proposed Credit Obligation, the University has received an opinion of Bond Counsel to the effect that such proposed Credit Obligation has been validly issued under Article X, Section 9(c) of the Constitution of Virginia.

The University may incur, assume, guarantee or otherwise become liable on any Credit Obligation not described elsewhere in this Section 6.3, including any Credit Obligation incurred pursuant to the provisions of Article X, Section 9(d) of the Constitution of Virginia, as such section may be amended from time to time, and may pledge and apply such portion of the Pledged Revenues as may be necessary for the payment of any such Credit Obligation, the funding of reasonable reserves therefor, or the payment of operating and other reasonable expenses of the facilities financed in whole or in part with the proceeds of such Credit Obligation or facilities reasonably related to such facilities and such pledge shall be senior and superior in all respects to the pledge of Pledged Revenues securing the Series 2009 Bonds and any other Parity Credit Obligations, but only if, prior to the incurrence of each such Credit Obligation, an Authorized Officer of the University certifies in writing that (1) taking into account the incurrence of such proposed Credit Obligation (i) the University will have sufficient funds to meet all of its financial obligations, including its obligations to pay principal of and interest on all Credit Obligations, for all Fiscal Years to and including the second full Fiscal Year after the later of (A) the issuance of such proposed Credit Obligation and (B) the completion of any facility financed with the proceeds of such proposed Credit Obligation, and (ii) such Authorized Officer has no reason to believe that the University will not have sufficient funds to pay all amounts due under all indebtedness of the University during the term of such proposed Credit Obligation, (2) to the best of his or her knowledge, the University is not in default in the performance and observance of any of the provisions of this Resolution, and (3) the University has received an opinion of Bond Counsel to the effect that such proposed Credit Obligation has been validly issued under the relevant provisions of the Constitution of Virginia.

Except for Credit Obligations issued pursuant to subsections (b) or (c) above or to refund any Qualifying Senior Obligation as described in subsection (e) below, no additional bonds or other obligations may be issued or incurred by the University on a parity with any Qualifying Senior Obligation.
        5.  Limitation on Additional Encumbrances. The University shall not encumber the Pledged Revenues in any manner (except as permitted in connection with Credit Obligations issued pursuant to subsections (a), (b) or (c) above or to refund any Qualifying Senior Obligation as described below), unless any such encumbrance is made junior and subordinate in all respects to the liens, pledges, covenants and agreements of this Resolution. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, however, the University may issue bonds to refund any Qualifying Senior Obligation and to secure such refunding bonds with the same source of revenues securing the Qualifying Senior Obligation being refunded. Upon the defeasance of the refunded Qualifying Senior Obligation pursuant to any such refunding, the refunding bonds will be considered Qualifying Senior Obligations for all purposes.
    3.  **Disposition of Assets**. The University may convey, sell or otherwise dispose of any property of the University as long as (1) such conveyance, sale or encumbrance is in the ordinary course of business, or (2) an Authorized Officer certifies in writing that, taking into account the conveyance, sale or other disposition of such property (i) the University will have sufficient funds to meet all of its financial obligations, including its obligations to pay principal of and interest on all Credit Obligations for all Fiscal Years to and including the second full Fiscal Year after such conveyance, sale or other disposition and (ii) such Authorized Officer has no reason to believe that the University will not have sufficient funds to pay all amounts due under all indebtedness of the University then outstanding.
    4.  **Insurance**. The University covenants that it will at all times carry or cause to be carried insurance policies with a responsible insurance company or companies, qualified to assume the risks thereof, or that it will maintain an adequate program of self-insurance, in either case sufficient to provide the University with insurance in such amount and covering such risks as the University shall deem to be reasonable and desirable.
    5.  **Rights of Bondholders Not to Be Impaired**. Except as otherwise set forth herein, the University covenants that no contract or contracts will be entered into or any action taken which might impair or diminish the rights of the Bondholders.
    6.  **Further Instruments and Actions**. The University covenants that it will, from time to time, execute and deliver such further instruments and take such further action as may be required to carry out the purposes of this Resolution.
    7.  **Accurate Records and Accounts**. The University covenants that it will keep accurate records and accounts of all items of cost and of all expenditures relating to Pledged Revenues collected and the application of such Pledged Revenues.

The University further covenants that not later than the end of the ninth month following the close of each Fiscal Year it will cause to be mailed to all Bondholders who shall have filed their names and addresses with the Secretary of the Board for such purpose a report, signed by the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the University and by the Virginia Auditor of Public Accounts or by an independent certified public accountant or firm of certified public accountants to be approved by the Virginia Auditor of Public Accounts, setting forth for the preceding Fiscal Year, in reasonable detail, the financial condition of the University, including its statement of net assets as of the end of the preceding Fiscal Year and the related statements of revenues, expenses and changes in net assets and statement of cash flows for the preceding Fiscal Year.

If at any time the University is of the opinion that for purposes of this subsection it is necessary to restrict or limit the yield on the investment of any moneys held under this Bond Resolution the University shall so instruct the Custodian, any trustee or the Paying Agent in writing, and such Custodian, trustee or Paying Agent shall take such action as may be reasonably necessary in accordance with such issuance.

*   *   1.  The University shall not use or permit the use of any proceeds of Series 2009 Bonds or any other funds of the University, directly or indirectly, in any manner, and shall not take or permit to be taken any other action or actions, which would result in any of the Series 2009 Bonds being treated as an obligation not described in Section 103(a) of the Code by reason of classification of such Bond as a "private activity bond" (except for those Series 2009 Bonds which the University has designated or allocated as "private activity bonds" benefiting a 501(c)(3) organization) or an "arbitrage bond" or "bond not in registered form" within the meaning of Section 103(b) of the Code.

    EVENTS OF DEFAULT AND REMEDIES
    1.  **Events of Default**. Each of the following events is hereby declared to be an "Event of Default" under this Resolution:

        2.  due and punctual payment of any interest on any of the Series 2009 Bonds is not made when the same becomes due and payable;
        3.  the University, for any reason, is rendered incapable of fulfilling its obligations hereunder;
        4.  an order or decree is entered, with the consent or acquiescence of the University, appointing a receiver or receivers of the University or any part thereof or of the revenues thereof, or if such order or decree, having been entered without the consent or acquiescence of the University, is not vacated or discharged or stayed on appeal within sixty (60) days after the entry thereof;
        5.  any proceeding is instituted, with the consent or acquiescence of the University, for the purpose of effecting a composition between the University and its creditors or for the purpose of adjusting the claims of such creditors pursuant to any federal or state statute now or hereafter enacted; or
        6.  the University defaults in the due and punctual performance of any other of the covenants, conditions, agreements and provisions contained in the Series 2009 Bonds or in this Resolution on the part of the University to be performed, and such default continues for thirty (30) days after written notice specifying such default and requiring same to be remedied is given to the Board by any Bondholder, provided that if such default is such that it can be corrected but cannot be corrected within such thirty (30) day period, it shall not constitute an Event of Default if corrective action is instituted by the University within such period and is diligently pursued until the default is corrected.
    2.  **Remedies**.

Upon the happening and continuance of an Event of Default, hereunder, the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Series 2009 Bonds, by instrument or instruments filed with the University and proved or acknowledged in the same manner as a deed to be recorded, may appoint a trustee to represent the Holders of the Series 2009 Bonds for the purposes herein, which trustee may be the State Treasurer and shall be the same trustee so appointed with respect to all other outstanding Parity Credit Obligations. Such trustee may, and upon written request of the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Series 2009 Bonds then outstanding shall, in its own name:

by mandamus or other suit, action or proceeding at law or in equity enforce all rights of the Holders of the Series 2009 Bonds, including the right to require the University and its Board to collect fees, rents, charges or other revenues adequate to carry out an agreement as to, or pledge of, such revenues, and to require the University and Board to carry out any other agreements with the Holders of the Series 2009 Bonds and to perform it and their duties under the Act;

bring suit upon the Series 2009 Bonds;

by action or suit in equity, require the University to account as if it were the trustee of an express trust for the Holders of the Series 2009 Bonds; or

by action or suit in equity, enjoin any acts or things which may be unlawful or in violation of the rights of the Holders of the Series 2009 Bonds.

*   *   1.  Any such trustee, whether or not all such Series 2009 Bonds have been declared due and payable, shall be entitled as of right to the appointment of a receiver who may enter and take possession of any property of the University any of the revenues from which are pledged for the security of the Series 2009 Bonds and operate and maintain the same and collect and receive all fees, rents, charges and other revenues thereafter arising therefrom in the same manner as the University itself might do and shall deposit all such moneys in a separate account and apply the same in such manner as the court appointing such receiver shall direct. In any suit, action or proceeding by the trustee the fees, counsel fees and expenses of the trustee and of the receiver, if any, shall constitute taxable costs and disbursements and all costs and disbursements allowed by the court shall be a first charge on any fees, rents, charges and other revenues of the University pledged for the security of the Series 2009 Bonds.

Such trustee shall, in addition to the foregoing, have and possess all of the powers necessary or appropriate for the exercise of any functions specifically set forth herein or incident to the general representation of the Holders of the Series 2009 Bonds in the enforcement and protection of their rights.

*   *   1.  To the extent permitted by law, upon the happening and continuance of any Event of Default, then and in every such case any Bondholder may proceed, subject to the provisions of Section 7.5, to protect and enforce the rights of the Bondholders by a suit, action or special proceeding in equity or at law, either for the specific performance of any covenant or agreement contained herein or in aid or execution of any power herein granted or for the enforcement of any proper legal or equitable remedy as such Bondholder shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce such rights.
    
    1.  **Pro Rata Application of Funds**. Anything in this Bond Resolution to the contrary notwithstanding, if at any time the moneys available in the Debt Service Fund shall not be sufficient to pay the interest on or the principal of the Series 2009 Bonds as the same shall become due and payable, such moneys, together with any moneys then available or thereafter becoming available for such purpose, whether through the exercise of the remedies provided for in this Article or otherwise, shall be applied as follows:
        1.  If the principal of all the Series 2009 Bonds shall not have become due and payable, all such moneys shall be applied:

first: to the payment to the persons entitled thereto of all installments of interest then due and payable in the order in which such installments became due and payable and, if the amount available shall not be sufficient to pay in full any particular installment, then to the payment, ratably, according to the amounts due on such installment, to the persons entitled thereto, without any discrimination or preference except as to any difference in the respective rates of interest specified in the Series 2009 Bonds; and

second: to the payment to the persons entitled thereto of the unpaid principal of any of the Series 2009 Bonds which shall have become due and payable (other than Series 2009 Bonds called for redemption for the payment of which moneys are held pursuant to the provisions of this Resolution), in the order of their due dates, with interest on the principal amount of such Series 2009 Bonds at the respective rates specified therein from the respective dates upon which such Series 2009 Bonds became due and payable, and, if the amount available shall not be sufficient to pay in full the principal of the Series 2009 Bonds due and payable on any particular date, together with such interest, then to the payment first of such interest, ratably, according to the amount of such interest due on such date, and then to the payment of such principal, ratably, according to the amount of such principal due on such date, to the persons entitled thereto without any discrimination or preference.

*   *   1.  If the principal of all the Series 2009 Bonds shall have become due and payable, all such moneys shall be applied to the payment of the principal and interest then due and unpaid on the Series 2009 Bonds, without preference or priority of principal over interest or interest over principal, or of any installment of interest over any other installment of interest, or of any Bond over any other Bond, ratably, according to the amounts due, respectively, for principal and interest, to the persons entitled thereto, without any discrimination or preference.

Whenever moneys are to be applied by the trustee pursuant to the provisions of this Section, such moneys shall be applied by the trustee at such times, and from time to time, as the trustee in his or her sole discretion shall determine, having due regard to the amount of such moneys available for application and the likelihood of additional moneys becoming available for such application in the future; the deposit of such moneys with any Paying Agent, or otherwise setting aside such moneys, in trust for the proper purpose shall constitute proper application by the trustee; and the trustee shall incur no liability whatsoever to the Board, to any Bondholder or to any other person for any delay in applying any such moneys, so long as the trustee acts with reasonable diligence, having due regard to the circumstances, and ultimately applies the same in accordance with such provisions of this Resolution as may be applicable at the time of application by the trustee. Whenever the trustee shall exercise such discretion in applying such moneys, he or she shall fix the date (which shall be an Interest Payment Date unless the trustee shall deem another date more suitable) upon which such application is to be made and upon such date interest on the amounts of principal to be paid on such date shall cease to accrue. The trustee shall give such notice (or shall cause the Paying Agent to give such notice) as he or she may deem appropriate of the fixing of any such date and shall not be required to make payment to the Holder of any Bond until such Bond shall be surrendered to the trustee or any Paying Agent for appropriate endorsement, or for cancellation if fully paid.

Notwithstanding anything in this Bond Resolution to the contrary, this Section 7.3 shall be interpreted so that term "Series 2009 Bonds" or "Bonds" shall include the Series 2009 Bonds and any Parity Credit Obligations. In each resolution authorizing the issuance of any Parity Credit Obligation, the University agrees to provide for the trustee or paying agent thereunder to be the same entity as under this Bond Resolution, and further agrees to include provisions substantially identical to those contained in this Section 7.3.

*   1.  **Effect of Discontinuance of Proceedings**. In case any proceeding taken by any Bondholder on account of any Event of Default shall have been discontinued or abandoned for any reason, then and in every such case the University and the Bondholders shall be restored to their former positions and rights hereunder, respectively, and all rights and remedies of the Bondholders shall continue as though no such proceeding had been taken.
    2.  **Proceedings for Equal Benefit of All Bondholders**. No Bondholder shall have any right in any manner whatever to affect, disturb or prejudice the security of this Resolution or to enforce any right hereunder, except in the manner herein provided, and all proceedings at law or in equity shall be instituted, had and maintained for the equal benefit of all Bondholders.
    3.  **No Remedy Exclusive**. No remedy herein conferred on the Bondholders is intended to be exclusive of any other remedy or remedies, and each and every remedy conferred shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to every other remedy given hereunder and under the Act or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute.
    4.  **No Delay or Omission Construed to Be a Waiver**. No delay or omission of any Bondholder to exercise any right or power accruing upon any Event of Default occurring and continuing as aforesaid shall impair any such right or power or shall be construed to be a waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence therein; and every power and remedy given by this Article to the Bondholders may be exercised from time to time and as often as may be deemed expedient.

1.    
      
    EXECUTION OF INSTRUMENTS BY BONDHOLDERS AND

Proof of the execution of any such instrument and of the ownership of the Series 2009 Bonds shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Bond Resolution and shall be conclusive in favor of the University and the Paying Agent with regard to any action taken by them under such instrument if made in the following manner:
        1.  The fact and date of the execution by any person of any such instrument may be proved by the verification of any officer in any jurisdiction who, by the laws thereof, has power to take affidavits within such jurisdiction, to the effect that such instrument was subscribed and sworn to before him or her, or by an affidavit of a witness to such execution. Where such execution is by an officer of a corporation or association or a member of a partnership on behalf of such corporation, association or partnership such verification or affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of his or her authority.
        2.  The fact of the holding of the Series 2009 Bonds hereunder by any Bondholder and the amount and the numbers of such Series 2009 Bonds and the date of its holding the same shall be proved by the registration books kept under the provisions of Section 2.7.

If the Holders of not less than a majority or all, as appropriate, in aggregate principal amount of the Series 2009 Bonds outstanding at the time of the adoption of such supplemental resolution shall have consented to and approved the adoption thereof as herein provided, no Bondholder shall have any right to object to the adoption of such supplemental resolution, or to object to any of the terms and provisions contained therein or the operation thereof, or in any manner to question the propriety of the adoption thereof, or to enjoin or restrain the Board from adopting the same or from taking any action pursuant to the provisions thereof.

The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia (the "University"), an educational institution established by the Commonwealth of Virginia, for value received, hereby promises to pay, solely from the revenues provided therefor, as hereinafter set forth, to the registered owner named above, on the maturity date set forth above (or earlier as hereinafter set forth), upon the presentation and surrender hereof, the principal sum set forth above and to pay, solely from such revenues, interest thereon from the date hereof at the rate per annum set forth above, until payment of said principal sum. Both the principal of and the interest on this Series 2009 Bond are payable in any coin or currency of the United States of America which on the respective dates of payment thereof is legal tender for the payment of public and private debts. The principal or redemption price of this Series 2009 Bond shall be payable, upon surrender of this Series 2009 Bond, at the office of The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, National Association, Richmond, Virginia, as Paying Agent and Registrar, or at the designated corporate trust office of any successor Paying Agent appointed pursuant to the Series 2009 Resolutions (hereinafter defined). Payment of interest on this Series 2009 Bond shall be made by check or draft mailed on the applicable Interest Payment Date to the registered owner as of the close of business on the 15th date of the month immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date (a "Record Date") at its address as it appears in the registration books of the Registrar appointed pursuant to the Series 2009 Resolutions. The term "Interest Payment Date" with respect to the Series 2009 Bonds means each September 1 and March 1, commencing September 1, 2009.

This Series 2009 Bond shall bear interest from the Interest Payment Date next preceding the date on which it is authenticated, unless this Series 2009 Bond is (a) authenticated before the first Interest Payment Date following the initial delivery of the Series 2009 Bonds, in which case it shall bear interest from its dated date, or (b) authenticated upon an Interest Payment Date, in which case it shall bear interest from such Interest Payment Date; provided, however, that if at the time of authentication of this Series 2009 Bond interest is in default, this Series 2009 Bond shall bear interest from the date to which interest has been paid. Interest on this Series 2009 Bond shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.

The University shall not be obligated to pay the principal of or interest on this Series 2009 Bond except from the Pledged Revenues of the University and other legally available moneys, all as provided in the Series 2009 Resolutions. "Pledged Revenues" are all of the revenues now or hereafter lawfully available to the University which are not required by law, by binding contract entered into prior to the adoption of the Series 2009 Resolutions or, in certain circumstances described in the Series 2009 Resolutions, by binding contract entered into subsequent to the date of the Series 2009 Resolutions, to be devoted to some other purpose. This Series 2009 Bond and the interest hereon shall not be deemed to constitute a debt or liability of the Commonwealth of Virginia, legal, moral or otherwise. Neither the Commonwealth of Virginia nor the University shall be obligated to pay the principal of or interest on this Series 2009 Bond or other costs incident hereto except from the sources noted above, and neither the faith and credit nor the taxing power of the Commonwealth of Virginia are pledged to the payment of the principal of or interest on this Series 2009 Bond or other costs incident hereto.

This Series 2009 Bond is one of a duly authorized issue of Bonds of the University aggregating \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ DOLLARS ($\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_) in principal amount, known as "General Revenue Pledge Bonds, Series 2009" (the "Series 2009 Bonds"), issued pursuant to resolutions adopted by the Board of Visitors of the University (the "Board") on April \_\_, 2009 (the "Series 2009 Resolutions"). This Series 2009 Bond is issued and the Series 2009 Resolutions was adopted under and pursuant to the Constitution and laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, particularly Chapter 4.10, Title 23, Code of Virginia of 1950, as amended (the "Act") to finance the costs of certain capital improvements at the University and to refund certain outstanding indebtedness of the University. Reference is hereby made to the Series 2009 Resolutions for the provisions, among others, with respect to the custody and application of the proceeds of Bonds issued under the Series 2009 Resolutions, the funds charged with and pledged to the payment of the interest on and the principal of the Series 2009 Bonds, the nature and extent of the security, the terms and conditions on which the Series 2009 Bonds are or may be issued, the rights, duties and obligations of the University and the rights of the holders of the Series 2009 Bonds. Capitalized terms not defined herein shall be as defined in the Series 2009 Resolutions. By the acceptance of this Series 2009 Bond, the Holder hereof assents to all of the provisions of the Series 2009 Resolutions.

The Series 2009 Bonds are subject to redemption prior to their maturity at the option of the University, in whole or in part on any date, at a redemption price equal to the greater of:

100% of the principal amount of the Series 2009 Bonds to be redeemed; or

the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to the maturity date of the Series 2009 Bonds to be redeemed, not including any portion of those payments of interest accrued and unpaid as of the date on which the Series 2009 Bonds are to be redeemed, discounted to the date on which the Series 2009 Bonds are to be redeemed on a semi-annual basis, assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months, at the Treasury Rate, plus \_\_ basis points, plus, in each case, accrued interest on the Bonds to be redeemed to the redemption date.

At the request of the Paying Agent, the redemption price of the Series 2009 Bonds to be redeemed at the option of the University shall be determined by an independent accounting firm, investment banking firm or financial advisor retained by the University at the University’s expense to calculate such redemption price. The Paying Agent and the University may conclusively rely on the determination of such redemption price by such independent accounting firm, investment banking firm or financial advisor and shall not be liable for such reliance.

Subject to applicable procedures of the Securities Depository while the Series 2009 Bonds are held in book-entry only form by the Securities Depository, if less than all of the Series 2009 Bonds are to be called for redemption, the Series 2009 Bonds to be redeemed shall be selected by the University in such manner as the University in its discretion may determine.

If any of the Series 2009 Bonds or portions thereof are called for redemption, the Paying Agent shall mail a notice of the call for redemption, identifying the Series 2009 Bonds or portions thereof to be redeemed, not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date, to the registered owner of each Series 2009 Bond to be redeemed, at its address as it appears on the registration books kept by the Registrar. Provided funds for their redemption are on deposit at the place of payment on the redemption date, all Series 2009 Bonds so called for redemption shall cease to bear interest on such date, shall no longer be secured by the Pledged Revenues and shall not be deemed to be outstanding under the terms of the Series 2009 Resolutions. If a portion of this Series 2009 Bond is called for redemption, a new Series 2009 Bond in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion hereof will be issued to the registered owner upon the surrender hereof.

This Series 2009 Bond is transferable by the registered owner, in person or by its attorney duly authorized in writing, at the designated office of the Registrar, upon presentation of a written instrument of transfer and surrender of this Series 2009 Bond to the Registrar for cancellation. Upon the transfer, a new Series 2009 Bond or Bonds of the same aggregate principal amount, maturity date and interest rate will be issued to the transferee. No transfer will be effective unless represented by such surrender and reissue. This Series 2009 Bond may also be exchanged at the designated office of the Registrar for a new Series 2009 Bond or Bonds of the same aggregate principal amount, maturity date and interest rate without transfer to a new registered owner. Exchanges and transfers will be without expense to the holder except for applicable taxes or other governmental charges, if any. The Registrar shall not be required to transfer or exchange any Series 2009 Bond selected or called for redemption pursuant to the provisions hereof or from a Record Date through the next succeeding Interest Payment Date. All Bonds delivered in exchange or transfer shall be dated so that neither gain nor loss results from the transfer or exchange.

The University, the Paying Agent and the Registrar may treat the registered owner as the absolute owner of this Series 2009 Bond for all purposes, notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.

Neither the members of the Board nor any person executing this Series 2009 Bond are liable personally hereon or subject to any personal liability or accountability by reason of the issuance hereof.

This Series 2009 Bond will not be valid until the Certificate of Authentication has been signed by the Registrar.

The holder of this Series 2009 Bond shall have no right to enforce the provisions of the Series 2009 Resolutions or to institute action to enforce the covenants therein, or to take any action with respect to any Event of Default under the Series 2009 Resolutions, or to institute, appear in or defend any suit or other proceeding with respect thereto, except as provided in the Series 2009 Resolutions.

All acts, conditions and things required by the Constitution and laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia and by the rules and regulations of the Board to happen, exist and be performed precedent to and in the issuance of this Series 2009 Bond have happened, exist and have been performed as so required.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia has caused this Series 2009 Bond to be issued and caused this Series 2009 Bond to bear the manual or facsimile signatures of its Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer and its official seal to be impressed, imprinted, reproduced or lithographed hereon, all as of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, 2009.
