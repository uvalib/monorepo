The President announced the receipt of a gift of 4,291 shares of the capital stock of the First City National Bank of Houston, in Houston, Texas, which has been made to the University of Virginia by Mrs. M. W. Perkins (Mrs. Sallie Shepherd Perkins) of Asheville, North Carolina. This gift is to be added to an earlier gift of $50,000 made in June 1947, and the income from the combined sum is to be used to supplement the salary of a distinguished pediatrician to occupy a Chair to be known as the Benjamin Armistead Shepherd Professorship of Pediatrics.

The gift has been made by Mrs. Perkins in honor of and as a memorial to her grandfather, Benjamin Armistead Shepherd, and her brother, Benjamin Armistead Shepherd, II

Benjamin Armistead Shepherd was born on 14 May 1814 in Fluvanna County, Virginia, and moved to Kentucky in 1833. He lived successively in Nashville, Memphis, and New Orleans, from which he moved to Galveston, Texas, where he was married on 28 October 1840 to Mary Hobson of Nashville. The exact date of Mr. Shepherd's move to Houston is not known, but he was living there on 30 December 1847 when a bank was chartered, of which Mr. Shepherd was a Director. He opened a private bank in Houston in 1854 and continued with that institution until January 1867 when it was merged with the First National Bank of Houston, now the First City National Bank of Houston, of which he became President and held that position until his death in 1891. During the War Between the States, he and some associates bought and operated a ship, which ran cotton through the Federal blockade. In 1867, he purchased a residence on Park Street in Charlottesville, which he called "Meadeland" and which he and his family used for a summer home for several years.

Mr. Shepherd is known as one of the great contributors to the growth and development of Houston, and it was through his farsightedness and business acumen that many enterprises, including one of the railroads entering the city in the early days, were brought to Houston. His name is still revered as one of the pioneers in the development of Houston as a great commercial center

Benjamin Armistead Shepherd, II, who was named for his grandfather, was born in Fluvanna County in December 1886. He entered the University of Virginia and graduated with a Master of Arts degree in 1909. Following graduation, he studied law at Columbia University, but because of failing health, was unable to complete the course. He died in Richmond, Virginia, in November 1916 at the age of 30.

In order to carry out the wishes of Mrs. Perkins, the President proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that there is hereby established a Chair in the School of Medicine to be known as the Benjamin Armistead Shepherd Professorship of Pediatrics

The President proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution

WHEREAS Mrs. Sallie Shepherd Perkins has made a magnificent gift to the University of Virginia for the purpose of supplementing the salary of a distinguished Professorship in Pediatrics in the School of Medicine in honor of and as a memorial to her grandfather, Benjamin Armistead Shepherd, and her brother, Benjamin Armistead Shepherd, II,

AND WHEREAS this Board has established a Chair in the Department of Pediatrics in the School of Medicine, to be known as the Benjamin Armistead Shepherd Professorship of Pediatrics, in order to carry out the wishes of Mrs. Perkins,

NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that we hereby record our deep gratitude for this gift which will enable the University to attain further eminence in the field of pediatrics, and direct the Secretary to transmit a copy of this resolution to Mrs. Perkins as a mark of our warm appreciation.

The President announced the receipt of a gift by an anonymous donor for the support of instruction and research in the Department of Chemistry. This gift consists of 2,300 shares of common stock of the Du Pont Company. The anonymous donor, who has previously made gifts of approximately the same amounts for the Departments of Physics and Biology, has directed that the gift is to be used to supplement the salary of a distinguished professor to occupy a Chair to be known as the John W. Mallet Professorship of Chemistry, to supplement the salaries of younger, promising members of the faculty of the Department of Chemistry, to purchase equipment needed in Chemistry, and to establish a scholarship fund to be used to attract undergraduate, graduate, and post doctoral students. The gift was made on the condition that an appropriation be made by the 1962 General Assembly in the amount of $3.5 million to construct a Chemistry Building. As the President reported to the Board at its April meeting (Minute Book, University of Virginia, No. 12, 14 April 1962, p. 314), such an appropriation was made, and it is now necessary to establish the Chair in Chemistry as requested by the anonymous donor

Mr. John W. Mallet was born near Dublin, Ireland on 10 October 1832. He came to the United States in 1853 to collect information for his father about the Erickson Caloric Engine with no expectation of remaining in this country. He became a professor at Amherst College, however, and served as a member of the faculty at a number of institutions of higher learning in this country before accepting a position as Professor of Chemistry at the University of Virginia. He was a member of the University faculty from 1868 to 1883 and from 1885 to 1908 when he retired and became Professor Emeritus. He died in 1912

The President proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that there is hereby established a Chair in the Department of Chemistry to be known as the John W. Mallet Professorship of Chemistry.

The President proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution

WHEREAS a devoted friend of the University, who desires to remain anonymous, has made a magnificent gift of 2,300 shares of common stock of the Du Pont Company for the support of instruction and research in the Department of Chemistry,

AND WHEREAS this same person in previous years has made gifts of a similar magnitude for the support of instruction and research in Physics and Biology,

NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that we hereby record our deep gratitude for these gifts which have enabled the University to attain a position of eminence in the field of science, and direct the Secretary to transmit a copy of this resolution to the anonymous donor as a mark of our warm appreciation

The Chairman of the Finance Committee, Mr. Blanton, submitted for the Board's consideration the proposed 1962-1963 University Budget, copies of which had previously been mailed to each member of the Board. Mr. Blanton reported that the Finance Committee had met with the President and the Comptroller on 18 May 1962 for a detailed review of the proposed budget and that the Finance Committee, at the conclusion of its meeting, had unanimously approved the budget as recommended. Following a discussion, Mr. Blanton proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the proposed 1962-1963 University Budget as recommended by the President and as approved by the Finance Committee be and it is hereby approved

The President reported on some changes be was making in the organization of the Arts and Sciences, which were to be effective on 1 July 1962. He explained in detail the reasons for these changes and reported that he had sent a letter under the date of 1 June 1962 to each member of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences describing these changes. This letter is as follows

I am today reporting to the Rector and Visitors a new administrative structure which I believe will permit more effective operation of the College and Graduate School of Arts and Sciences than has previously been possible.

At present, the Dean of the College is burdened with more duties than one man should be called upon to discharge. In addition to administrative details of the undergraduate College, he is responsible for obtaining suitable replacements and additions to the faculty of Arts and Sciences without having any responsibility for the graduate teaching which many of the new members of the faculty actually will engage in and must be employed to do

The plan set forth below, to become effective 1 July 1962, (a) changes the title of the present position of Dean of the College to Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, (b) relieves the Dean of the Faculty of the day-to-day duties of administering the undergraduate College, which are delegated to a new position (although its title is not new) to be known as Dean of the College, and (c) makes the Dean of the Faculty responsible for appraising and co-ordinating both the graduate and undergraduate curricula and for recommending to the President persons to join the faculty of Arts and Sciences.

Direct responsibility for administering the undergraduate College is placed under the new position of Dean of the College, and the present position of Associate Dean of the College is discontinued

The position of Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences is only slightly modified to include responsibility for research policy in Arts and Sciences and to provide for active participation with the Dean of the Faculty in obtaining members of the faculty of Arts and Sciences who will participate in graduate instruction

I have appointed, effective 1 July 1962, Mr. Frank L. Hereford, Jr., Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and Mr. Irby B. Cauthen, Jr., Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences

In a short time I hope to be able to announce the appointment of the Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences

The duties and responsibilities which will be assigned to the three positions are as follows

(1) Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences to serve as the chief staff advisor to the President on all matters related to the undergraduate and graduate curricula in Arts and Sciences, to appraise the existing faculties of the several Departments in Arts and Sciences, and in consultation with the Dean of the Graduate School, the Dean of the College, and the Chairmen of Departments, to recommend to the President persons to fill vacancies on the faculty and to staff positions for expansion â€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒ to staff into areas not now covered, to prepare tables of organization for each of the several Departments p Departments, to consult with the Comptroller on the preparation of the annual and biennial budgets and other matters of a financial nature involving Arts and Sciences, on behalf of the President, to interview prospects for election to the faculty and make recommendations to the President on all such elections, and, in general, to conduct a continuous re-appraisal of the faculty strengths and weaknesses and needs of the faculty as expansion of enrollment occurs. The President will continue to interview all candidates for tenure appointments

(2) Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences to advise the President and the Dean of the Faculty on all matters relating to graduate instructional and research policy in Arts and Sciences, to develop and expand the graduate enrollment in Arts and Sciences, to counsel graduate students on appropriate matters relating to graduate instruction, and to participate actively with the Dean of the Faculty in obtaining faculty members whose duties will involve graduate instruction

(3) Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences to undertake all duties with respect to the academic programs of undergraduate students in the Arts and Sciences, to advise the Dean of the Faculty with respect to undergraduate faculty staffing and curricula, to advise the Dean of the Faculty on such matters involving undergraduate educational policy as he may deem advisable or as may be requested by the Dean of the Faculty, and to undertake such other duties as may be assigned by the Dean of the Faculty

The President proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that C. Waller Barrett and David J. Mays be and they are hereby re-elected to the Advisory Committee for the McGregor Library for terms of four years, effective 1 July 1962

The President advised the Board that, at the University's request, Mr. John B. Gordon, a Charlottesville Realtor, had obtained an option in his own name, to purchase a parcel of land fronting approximately 180 feet on the south side of Jefferson Park Avenue, between Lee and Randall Streets in the City of Charlottesville, Virginia, from G. Slaughter Fitz-Hugh, J. Jason Crigler, and Marion K. Humphreys, Jr., at a price not to exceed $53,500.00, that because of tax consequences to them, the Grantors of the option had refused to grant an option unless the transaction, if the option was exercised, would constitute an instalment sale, and had therefore insisted upon a method of payment of consideration as follows: $13,375.00 cash on date set for delivery of deed, $40,125.00, the balance to be evidenced by three purchase money notes each in the amount of $13,375.00, bearing interest at 3% per annum payable in one, two and three years respectively from date of delivery of deed. The purchase money notes are to be unsecured

The option expires if not exercised prior to 1 July 1962. It appeared advisable, should the option be exercised, to obtain the authorization of the Board for the execution in the name and on behalf of the University, of the three unsecured notes for $13,375.00 each, above referred to

After discussion, upon motion duly made and seconded, it was,

RESOLVED, that Edgar F. Shannon, Jr., President, or Vincent Shea, Comptroller, be and either of them hereby is, authorized and empowered, to execute in the name and on behalf of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, three promissory notes not to exceed the principal sum of $13,375.00 each, payable to Bearer, bearing interest at the rate of 3% per annum, and payable one, two, and three years after date, respectively, said notes to be delivered as part of the consideration for the purchase by The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia of certain property fronting approximately 180 feet on the south side of Jefferson Park Avenue, between Lee and Randall Streets, in the City of Charlottesville, Virginia. Said notes shall be unsecured

The President advised the Board of the passage by the General Assembly of Virginia in the 1962 Session, of House Bill No. 725 (to become effective as Chapter 604, Acts of Assembly, 1962), which authorizes and empowers the governing bodies of The College of William and Mary in Virginia, the University of Virginia, and Virginia Polytechnic Institute, or duly authorized committees of such governing bodies, to enter into a joint agreement on behalf of their respective institutions for the operation and management of a space radiation effects laboratory to be constructed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in the area of Hampton Roads, Virginia. The Act provides that such joint agreement shall be approved by resolution of the governing bodies of each institution, duly entered upon the minutes thereof, and that such joint agreement shall be executed on behalf of each institution by an official designated in such resolution

The Act further authorizes and empowers the governing bodies of said institutions, or duly authorized committees thereof, to negotiate and execute a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration for the operation and management of such space radiation effects laboratory by said institutions in conformity with the terms and conditions of the joint agreement

In order to carry out the provisions of this Act, the President reported that at his request the University's Counsel had prepared a tentative draft of a joint agreement between the three institutions for the operation and management of the contemplated space radiation effects laboratory and that at a meeting of representatives of the three institutions held on 11 May 1962, which was also attended by representatives of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and by Mr. William H. McFarlane, Director of the State Council of Higher Education, a final draft of such joint agreement to be submitted to the governing bodies of the three institutions had been agreed upon

Copies of such final draft were then distributed to the members of the Board for examination

After full discussion and careful consideration, upon motion duly seconded and carried, the following resolution was adopted

BE IT RESOLVED, by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, that the Joint Agreement between The College of William and Mary in Virginia, the University of Virginia, and Virginia Polytechnic Institute bearing date of 1 July 1962, for the operation and management of a space radiation effects laboratory to be constructed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, in the form submitted to this meeting, be and the same hereby is, approved,

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that Edgar F. Shannon, Jr., President of the University of Virginia, be and he is hereby, authorized, empowered, and designated to execute said Joint Agreement, bearing date of 1 July 1962, in the name and on behalf of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, and that Weldon Cooper, Secretary of this Board, be and he is hereby, authorized, empowered, and designated to affix the corporate seal of this Institution thereto and to attest the same,

BE IT STILL FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Rector be and he is hereby authorized, empowered, and designated, as a committee of one of this Board, in conjunction with the governing bodies of The College of William and Mary in Virginia and Virginia Polytechnic Institute, or duly authorized committees of such governing bodies, to negotiate and execute a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, for the operation and management of such space radiation effects laboratory by said three institutions in conformity with the terms and conditions of said Joint Agreement dated 1 July 1962, and that Weldon Cooper, Secretary of this Board, be and he is hereby, authorized, empowered, and designated to affix the corporate seal of this Institution to such contract and to attest the same.

The President proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the President be and he is hereby authorized to employ Mr. J. Russell Bailey, Architect, of Orange, Virginia, as architect for the proposed addition to Alderman Library Building.

The President reported in detail on the prospect for admissions for the academic session of 1962-1963

The President reported on a proposal by the School of Engineering, which was approved by the University Senate at its meeting on 15 May 1962, to establish a degree in the School of Engineering to be known as "Bachelor of Engineering Science." The basis for this proposal is that there has arisen a need and demand for a degree with a curriculum which bridges science and mathematics and is outside the specialized subject matter of any given branch of engineering. The adoption of this degree will not involve any increase in the Engineering faculty since the available instructional staff in Engineering and in the Research Laboratories for the Engineering Sciences will be sufficient to offer this program at the present level of enrollment in the School of Engineering

Accordingly, the President proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that there is hereby established in the School of Engineering a degree to be known as "Bachelor of Engineering Science," effective 1 September 1962.

The President reminded the Board that, at its meeting on 13 June 1959 (Minute Book, University of Virginia, No. 12, 13 June 1959, p. 158), the fields in which the degree of Doctor of Science may be conferred were extended to include Nuclear Engineering and Electrical Engineering. The President reported that the faculty of the School of Engineering has requested the extension of the degree of Doctor of Science to include Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics be authorized. At its meeting on 15 May 1962 the University Senate approved this proposal. Adding these two fields in which the Doctor of Science may be earned will not result in an increase in staff, since qualified persons to teach in these two areas are already on the faculty

Accordingly, the President proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that, effective 1 September 1962, the fields in which the degree of Doctor of Science may be conferred be and they are hereby extended to include Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics

The President reported on a proposal by the faculty of the School of Engineering that the name of that School be changed to the "School of Engineering and Applied Science." The basis for this recommendation is the lack in the present title of any indication of the instruction and research now being conducted in applied science by the faculty and students in the School of Engineering

Accordingly, the President proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that, effective 1 July 1962, the name of the School of Engineering be and it is hereby changed to the School of Engineering and Applied Science

The President presented and discussed the annual report of the Student Activities Committee for 1961-1962

The President distributed a copy of the report of the Committee on Fallout Protection to each member of the Board and summarized the contents of the report.

The President reported that under the terms of the existing contract with Claude Coakley, dated October 27, 1960, for the management of the University Airport, Mr. Coakley had given the required notice of his desire to terminate the contract on June 1, 1962 and that it had been necessary to negotiate a new contract. The new contract would be with a corporation to be formed under the name of Charlottesville Aviation, Inc. of which Mr. William C. Clontz would be President and Mr. Ralph P. Zehler, Jr., would be secretary, and would run from June 1, 1962 to June 30, 1965, with automatic yearly renewals thereafter.

The President then submitted for consideration a draft of the new contract prepared by the University's special counsel, the terms and conditions of which had been approved by Dean Quarles of the School of Engineering, and recommended its execution on behalf of the University

After careful consideration, upon motion duly seconded, the following resolution was adopted

RESOLVED, by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the Comptroller be and he is hereby authorized, empowered and directed to execute in the name and on behalf of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, a contract with Charlottesville Aviation, Inc., for the management of the University Airport at Milton, Virginia, such contract to be in the form submitted to this meeting, with such changes and additions as may be approved by the University's special counsel, and that the Secretary of this Board be, and he is hereby, authorized, empowered and directed to affix the seal of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia thereto and attest the same

The President stated that the University Long-Range Planning Committee had presented a report to him a few days before. A preliminary review of the report indicated that a number of excellent suggestions had been made. The President stated that he planned to review the report in detail this coming summer and to have a report on long-range planning ready for presentation to the Board at its next meeting on 29 September 1962

The President reported it had been called to his attention by The Riggs National Bank of Washington, D. C., successor trustee under the Will of William Jackson Humphreys, that the grave of Dr. Humphreys in Charlottesville has never been marked. Under the Will of Dr. Humphreys, his residuary estate was held in trust to pay certain annuities, one of which was $200.00 per month to his wife, Margaret Antrim Humphreys, the balance of income to be accumulated until the death of the survivor of the annuitants. Mrs. Humphreys is that survivor. Upon her death the assets of the trust and the accumulated income thereon are payable to the University of Virginia. The trust when last reviewed amounted to some $315,000.00

Apparently, at the time of the death of Dr. Humphreys, his wife had stated she would attend to the erection of a stone at the grave but this had never been done and her disability had become such that The Riggs National Bank had been appointed her conservator. Since it is not now possible to use Mrs. Humphreys' funds for this purpose, The Riggs National Bank has requested, on behalf of the family of Dr. and Mrs. Humphreys, that the University consent to the payment of the sum of $260.00 from the principal of the trust fund for the erection of an appropriate stone at the grave of Dr. Humphreys. Such stone would be inscribed with his name and the dates of his birth and death and the name and date of birth of Mrs. Humphreys.

After discussion of the matter, upon motion duly made and seconded, it was,

RESOLVED, by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, that it gives its consent to the payment of the sum of $260.00 from the principal of the trust fund created under the Will of the late William Jackson Humphreys, of which the University of Virginia is beneficiary in remainder upon the death of Margaret Antrim Humphreys, widow of the testator, for the erection of an appropriate stone at the grave of Dr. Humphreys, to be inscribed with his name and the dates of his birth and death and the name and date of birth of his wife

The President reported that the three daughters of the late Dean Thornton of the School of Engineering, who lived on University Circle, had approached the University to inquire as to the interest of the Board of Visitors in accepting a gift of their property on University Circle if it should be offered. Following numerous expressions of appreciation by the Visitors, the President proposed and the Board adopted the following resolution

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the offer of Mrs. E.

The President stated that he had reported in full to the Athletics Committee and the Finance Committee, in a meeting on 31 May 1962, on (1) the financial condition of the Department of Athletics, and (2) the necessity for a bond issue to complete the construction of University Hall.

On motion the meeting was then adjourned at 1:00 p.m.

I am today reporting to the Rector and Visitors a new administrative structure which I believe will permit more effective operation of the College and Graduate School of Arts and Sciences than has previously been possible.

At present, the Dean of the College is burdened with more duties than one man should be called upon to discharge. In addition to administrative details of the undergraduate College, he is responsible for obtaining suitable replacements and additions to the faculty of Arts and Sciences without having any responsibility for the graduate teaching which many of the new members of the faculty actually will engage in and must be employed to do

The plan set forth below, to become effective 1 July 1962, (a) changes the title of the present position of Dean of the College to Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, (b) relieves the Dean of the Faculty of the day-to-day duties of administering the undergraduate College, which are delegated to a new position (although its title is not new) to be known as Dean of the College, and (c) makes the Dean of the Faculty responsible for appraising and co-ordinating both the graduate and undergraduate curricula and for recommending to the President persons to join the faculty of Arts and Sciences.

Direct responsibility for administering the undergraduate College is placed under the new position of Dean of the College, and the present position of Associate Dean of the College is discontinued

The position of Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences is only slightly modified to include responsibility for research policy in Arts and Sciences and to provide for active participation with the Dean of the Faculty in obtaining members of the faculty of Arts and Sciences who will participate in graduate instruction

I have appointed, effective 1 July 1962, Mr. Frank L. Hereford, Jr., Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and Mr. Irby B. Cauthen, Jr., Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences

In a short time I hope to be able to announce the appointment of the Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences

The duties and responsibilities which will be assigned to the three positions are as follows

(1) Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences to serve as the chief staff advisor to the President on all matters related to the undergraduate and graduate curricula in Arts and Sciences, to appraise the existing faculties of the several Departments in Arts and Sciences, and in consultation with the Dean of the Graduate School, the Dean of the College, and the Chairmen of Departments, to recommend to the President persons to fill vacancies on the faculty and to staff positions for expansion â€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒ to staff into areas not now covered, to prepare tables of organization for each of the several Departments p Departments, to consult with the Comptroller on the preparation of the annual and biennial budgets and other matters of a financial nature involving Arts and Sciences, on behalf of the President, to interview prospects for election to the faculty and make recommendations to the President on all such elections, and, in general, to conduct a continuous re-appraisal of the faculty strengths and weaknesses and needs of the faculty as expansion of enrollment occurs. The President will continue to interview all candidates for tenure appointments

(2) Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences to advise the President and the Dean of the Faculty on all matters relating to graduate instructional and research policy in Arts and Sciences, to develop and expand the graduate enrollment in Arts and Sciences, to counsel graduate students on appropriate matters relating to graduate instruction, and to participate actively with the Dean of the Faculty in obtaining faculty members whose duties will involve graduate instruction

(3) Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences to undertake all duties with respect to the academic programs of undergraduate students in the Arts and Sciences, to advise the Dean of the Faculty with respect to undergraduate faculty staffing and curricula, to advise the Dean of the Faculty on such matters involving undergraduate educational policy as he may deem advisable or as may be requested by the Dean of the Faculty, and to undertake such other duties as may be assigned by the Dean of the Faculty
