**Action Item**

Visitor Emeritus N. Thomas Connally Jr. M.D. passed away last spring. Rector Murray said he was a remarkable man and made a difference in the lives of many people and he was a good friend of many at the University. He asked Mr. Blue to read a resolution in remembrance of Dr. Connally. On motion, the following resolution was approved by unanimous voice vote:

**MEMORIAL RESOLUTION FOR DR. N. THOMAS CONNALLY JR.**

WHEREAS, Dr. N. Thomas Connally Jr., of Norfolk, took a B.A. and M.D. from the University of Virginia, where he was president of both Student Council and the Beta Chapter of Zeta Psi, and a member of numerous honorary and social groups, including The Raven Society, The IMP Society, and The Eli Banana Ribbon Society; and

WHEREAS, after graduating from medical school, Dr. Connally served in the United States Public Health Service at the National Institutes of Health before completing his medical residency at the University of Virginia Hospital, where he served as chief resident in his final year; and

WHEREAS, Dr. Connally was a respected physician who, in private practice, cared for many prominent figures in Washington, D.C., including Supreme Court Justices and numerous members of Congress; and

WHEREAS, Dr. Connally earned numerous honors in his career, including the American Society of Internal Medicine’s (ASIM) Young Internist of the Year, and served in various leadership positions including trustee for the ASIM, chief of medicine at Sibley Memorial Hospital, member of the clinical faculty at Georgetown University Medical School, professor of internal medicine at George Washington University, and board member for CareFirst Blue Cross Blue Shield; and

WHEREAS, after retiring from private practice, Dr. Connally was a loyal volunteer at the Arlington Free Clinic, where he served as medical director and continued to see patients and review charts, and taught courses in medicine and health care policy to area seniors through Arlington’s Encore Learning; and

WHEREAS, Dr. Connally was active in politics throughout his life, serving as a Virginia representative on the presidential campaign of Robert Kennedy in 1968, a longtime precinct captain in his Arlington neighborhood, and a delegate to the 2004 Democratic National Convention; and

WHEREAS, Dr. and Mrs. Connally, a community leader and former member of the Virginia House of Delegates, shared the James B. Hunter Human Rights Award, given to those in the Arlington community who promote human rights; and

WHEREAS, Dr. Connally served ably on the Board of Visitors from 1989 to 1995, serving on the Educational Policy Committee; Executive Committee; Health Affairs Committee, of which he was chair; and the Special Committee on Clinch Valley College; and

WHEREAS, Dr. Connally’s legacy lives on at the University through the N. Thomas Connally Professorship in Clinical Excellence, which grateful patients endowed in his honor at the School of Medicine; and

WHEREAS, Dr. Connally passed away on April 2, 2020, at the age of 83, and it was revealed that he was a member of the Seven Society;

RESOLVED, the Board of Visitors commemorates the extraordinary life and accomplishments of Dr. N. Thomas Connally Jr., particularly his dedicated service to the University of Virginia; and

RESOLVED FURTHER, the Board extends its sincerest condolences to his wife, Judy; children; beloved grandchildren; and many friends and admirers.

**NCAA Orientation**

Mr. Eric Baumgartner, Associate Athletics Director for Compliance, gave the annual briefing on NCAA rules and regulations. Visitors are boosters and must avoid any activity that could violate the athlete recruiting rules. He said boosters may not provide extra benefits to student athletes, i.e. benefits provided to student athletes or their family members that are not provided to the general public. He said since the Board meeting last year, there were five major violations at other NCAA Division One schools that were caused by staff or boosters providing extra benefits to prospective or current student athletes. Visitors are boosters for life, so even after they go off the Board they continue to be subject to these rules. He encouraged Visitors to let him or his staff know if they hear of any potential violations.

**ACC Certification**

The Rector read the annual ACC certification statement that designates the chief executive officer of the University as the individual responsible for the athletics program at the University. He said he and President Ryan would sign the statement. The certification statement is in the written materials for the meeting.

\_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_

**Discussion with University Leadership**

President Ryan presented two main topics: 1) the Racial Equity Task Force report and historic landscape; and 2) return to Grounds.

Mr. Ryan said Valerie Gregory, Associate Dean of Students and Director of Admissions Outreach, is retiring after 21 years at UVA. During her time in the admissions office she reached out to help students and families who are often overlooked in the admission process. Her impact on the community and student lives is immeasurable: on any given day she could meet with 80 high school students, serve as a mentor for students who need a shoulder to lean on, or provide words of encouragement for first-generation college students. She is a major reason why UVA enrolled the most racially diverse first-year class in its history six years in a row. In her honor, the auditorium in Peabody Hall will be named for her. This is the auditorium where thousands of prospective students come each year to learn about the admission process. There will be a portrait of Ms. Gregory and a plaque placed in the auditorium to commemorate her service to the Office of Admission and the University.

**Racial Equity Task Force Report and Historic Landscape**

President Ryan gave a brief overview of the task force process and covered some of the highlights of his memo asking the Board to take certain actions recommended by the task force. Mr. Ryan formed the Racial Equity Task Force of Kevin McDonald, Vice President for Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Community Partnerships; Ian Solomon, dean of the Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy; and Barbara Brown Wilson, a faculty member in the School of Architecture and the faculty director of The Equity Center; in the aftermath of the killing of George Floyd. He asked the group to work with students, faculty, and staff to gather recent and past recommendations, suggestions, and demands related to racial equity at UVA with a goal of providing a concrete and prioritized set of recommendations about the best steps forward, including actions that can be implemented right away.

Over the next two months, the Task Force met with hundreds of people across the University and the community and received letters and submissions from more than 1,000 people. At the same time, President Ryan and Provost Magill reached out to each member of the Board to understand their thinking and to get advice about the best way forward. He said they heard a range of opinions, but the consensus was that UVA should be action-oriented and bold.

President Ryan said some will think the report goes too far, and others will believe it doesn’t go far enough. He said the report is a call for the UVA community to be the best version of ourselves—to live out our commitments to diversity, equity, and inclusion in a way that will allow us to become a better university. He said he heard from some who believe this report is a reaction to this particular moment; he disagrees. UVA has been working on these issues for decades, and the recommendations in the report aim to build on the work that has been done based on the belief that becoming a more diverse, welcoming, equitable, place is both the right and smart thing to do.

President Ryan laid out some principles: look at initiatives to diversify students, faculty, and staff, and those aimed at programming and policies (or the revision of policies) that will help create a more inclusive and equitable community; and recognize, as the Task Force does, that initiatives should correspond with the goals of the 2030 Plan—elevating and sharpening them instead of pointing in an entirely different direction.

President Ryan said he endorsed many of the report’s recommendations related to faculty, student, and staff diversity; specific programs related to equity; launching several initiatives within the University Police Department; and connecting all of these initiatives to specific timelines, funding mechanisms, and metrics to track progress.

President Ryan then focused on the historic landscape of the Grounds. He recommends changes to the naming policy including renaming a building once the time period for a name expires; not celebrating the Confederacy or the myth of the Lost Cause; and creating a full biography of each previous namesake that is easily available in order to better confront and learn from history.

He recommended taking five actions regarding the historic landscape that are the subject of resolutions before the Board. He also recommended continuing efforts already underway to add to the historic landscape by installing markers, hanging portraits, and developing digital tours that celebrate the full history and those who worked to make UVA better and more inclusive.

Later in the meeting and on motion, the following resolutions were approved by unanimous voice vote:

**BOARD OF VISITORS SUPPORT FOR RACIAL EQUITY INITIATIVES**

WHEREAS, the Board of Visitors acknowledges the extensive time and effort devoted to developing the Racial Equity Task Force Report “Audacious Future: Commitment Required” (the Report) and thanks the Task Force members for their work; and

WHEREAS, the Board of Visitors supports wholeheartedly the stated objectives of creating a more welcoming climate, investing in relevant education and scholarship, committing to healing and repairing a painful history, and ensuring equal access and success;

RESOLVED, the Board of Visitors endorses the following goals articulated in the August 25, 2020 memorandum from University leadership to the Board of Visitors that reflect and build on the initiatives in the Report:

1.  Doubling the number of underrepresented faculty by 2030;
2.  Reviewing the tenure and promotion process;
3.  Developing a plan and a time horizon for having a student population that better reflects the racial and socioeconomic demographics of the Commonwealth of Virginia, and, as much as feasible, the nation;
4.  Encouraging related organizations to develop a scholarship program for the descendants of enslaved laborers who worked to build and maintain the University;
5.  Reviewing policies regarding staff hiring, wages, retention, promotion, and procurement, in order to ensure equity;
6.  Ensuring that the division of the Vice President for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion and Community Partnerships has sufficient resources to do their work;
7.  Developing a series of educational programs around racial equity and anti-racism, including leadership development programs focused on equity including racial equity;
8.  Endowing the key programmatic elements of the Carter Woodson Institute and providing funding to create more faculty positions;
9.  Exploring potential initiatives to recognize and support Native American students and Native American studies;
10.  Thoroughly reviewing University police practices and policies to ensure fair, equitable, and transparent practices reflecting 21st century policing principles, and developing relevant training for officers and supervisors;
11.  Forming a Department of Safety and Security Advisory Council; and

RESOLVED FURTHER, the Board asks University leadership to develop a plan for identifying resources to fund initiatives, and a plan for allocating resources, including allocating available Strategic Investment Fund monies to initiatives that align with the four core goals of The 2030 Plan in accordance with the 2019-2020 Revised Guidelines approved by the Board in August 2019, and the award allocations approved in December 2019 for three years ending June 30, 2022; and

RESOLVED FURTHER, the Board asks University leadership to create a system of metrics and assessment to identify goals and mark progress around racial equity and report to the Board of Visitors on progress on a semi-annual basis.

**REMOVING CURRY NAME FROM SCHOOL OF EDUCATION AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT**

WHEREAS, The University named its School of Education in memory of Jabez Lamar Monroe Curry in 1905 at the request of, and following a financial contribution to establish a school of education at the University made by, Mr. John D. Rockefeller Sr.; and

WHEREAS, J.L.M. Curry was one of the nation’s leading advocates for free, publicly financed education available to all children, served as president of Howard College (now Samford University) in Alabama, and professor of history and literature at Richmond College, now the University of Richmond. His legacy has been called into question among School of Education faculty, staff, students, and alumni due, in part, to Mr. Curry’s slaveholding, opposition to integrated schools, and service to the Confederate States during the Civil War; and

WHEREAS, three years ago, in an effort to fully comprehend Mr. Curry’s legacy and soundness to be the school’s namesake, the faculty and leadership of the Curry School of Education and Human Development began a process of diligence that engaged stakeholders; and

WHEREAS, the dean of the School submitted a report and attendant request to the University’s Committee on Names and to the University’s President asking that J.L.M. Curry be dropped from the School’s name; and

WHEREAS, The University’s Committee on Names has stated that naming decisions should reflect direct contributions to the University; and

WHEREAS, Mr. Curry was not a member of the faculty or a student at the University. His son, Major Manly Bowie Curry, attended the University; and

WHEREAS, in a report on Mr. Curry’s life and legacy, John L. Nau III Professor in the History of the American Civil War Emeritus and Director, John L. Nau III Center for Civil War History, Gary Gallagher, concluded, “To reduce a complex history to a single sentence, Curry showed real vision in advocating free public education for the South’s Black children but an overclouding blindness in refusing to recognize African Americans as having the same potentialities and capacities as whites;” and

WHEREAS, the mission of the School is to enhance and realize the potential of all individuals through scholarship, teaching, professional preparation, and public service promoting education and human development;

RESOLVED, The Board of Visitors approves renaming the Curry School of Education and Human Development as the School of Education and Human Development.

**AUTHORITY TO CONTEXTUALIZE THE STATUE OF THE UNIVERSITY’S FOUNDER, THOMAS JEFFERSON, ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE ROTUNDA**

WHEREAS, the life of the founder of the University of Virginia, Thomas Jefferson, is a complex one that until recent times has been explained almost exclusively with a focus on his many accomplishments as a thinker, writer, orator, politician, architect, inventor, and scientist; and

WHEREAS, Thomas Jefferson was one of the founding fathers of our democratic system, which fundamentally changed the relationship between a government and the governed by resting the power to govern in the hands of the people rather than the sovereign; and

WHEREAS, Jefferson drafted the Declaration of Independence, and in the Preamble he declared, “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by the Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness;” and

WHEREAS, Jefferson also drafted the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, which doctrine formed the basis for religious freedom protections contained in the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, and is commemorated at the University by a statue of Jefferson standing atop the Liberty Bell on the north side of the Rotunda. The Liberty Bell is surrounded by figures representing Liberty, Equality, Justice, and the Brotherhood of Man. The figure of Equality holds a bronze tablet inscribed with “Religious Freedom” and the names of the deity as described in several different religions: “God”, “Jehovah”, “Brahma”, “Atma”, “Ra”, “Allah”, and “Zeus”; and

WHEREAS, throughout his lifetime Mr. Jefferson owned slaves and slave labor was employed by the University’s founders to construct and maintain the University’s Academical Village, in direct contradiction of the American ideals of liberty and equality that Jefferson had expressed so eloquently in the Declaration of Independence and the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom; and

WHEREAS, in the last decade the University has made efforts to study the University’s historic landscape more fully and to educate the public on all aspects of its early history. This in-depth examination was undertaken by the President’s Commission on Slavery, established in 2013 by President Sullivan, that sponsored courses and symposia on slavery; developed an Enslaved African Americans Walking Tour Map to recognize and interpret the important contributions of free and enslaved African Americans on Grounds and in the Charlottesville community; and spearheaded the design and construction of a Memorial to Enslaved Laborers; and

WHEREAS, the work of recognizing inequities and taking action toward achieving a racially equitable University was furthered by the findings and recommendations of the President’s Commission on the University in the Age of Segregation and, more recently, the Racial Equity Task Force, appointed by President Ryan in the spring of 2020; and

WHEREAS, it is apparent that crucial to improving the racial climate is to reframe the historic landscape to tell a broader story about all of those who contributed to building and operating the University over its 200 year history, including recontextualizing the monuments to its founder Thomas Jefferson;

RESOLVED, the Board of Visitors authorizes University leadership to engage historians and other experts to contextualize the statue of Thomas Jefferson on the north side of the Rotunda to tell the broader story about his contributions to the University, the nation, and the world, as well as contradictory writings and actions that were an integral part of his life and work.

**SUPPORT FOR UNIVERSITY EFFORTS TO REMOVE AND RELOCATE THE STATUE OF GEORGE ROGERS CLARK**

WHEREAS, George Rogers Clark was a general in the Revolutionary Army who gained recognition for military successes against the British in the Illinois country, then called “the Northwest”, which led to an early nickname, “Conqueror of the Northwest;” and

WHEREAS, in his later military career, George Rogers Clark led fraught campaigns against Native Americans in the Northwest Indian War; and

WHEREAS, in an era of monument building in Charlottesville in the 1920s, at the request of the University, Paul Goodloe McIntire donated a large bronze statue of George Rogers Clark, where it was placed on a granite pedestal with the inscription “Conqueror of the Northwest” and located in a small park on University Avenue; and

WHEREAS, the statue depicts George Rogers Clark on horseback facing three Native Americans: a kneeling woman with a cradleboard, a crouching warrior, and a standing chief, while he is gesturing to armed men behind his horse; and

WHEREAS, the statue and its inscription were erected more than a century after the American Revolution and are historically inaccurate as the nickname referenced George Rogers Clark’s success in securing territory for the American side during the American Revolution and not his later, largely unsuccessful, campaigns against Native Americans; and

WHEREAS, at the time the statue was erected, it was described by the _Alumni News_ as Clark “explaining the futility of resistance,” which supports a popular sentiment at the time of the natural superiority of white Americans over Native Americans and other non-whites, which is not a view endorsed by members of the University community now; and

WHEREAS, George Rogers Clark’s career bears no relation to the history of the University of Virginia as he died before the University’s founding;

RESOLVED, the Board of Visitors supports University efforts to remove and relocate the statue of George Rogers Clark, which shall include determining the cost and identifying sources of funds for relocation.

**REQUEST TO EXPLORE REDEDICATION OR REMOVAL OF THE HUME MEMORIAL WALL**

WHEREAS, born in 1843 in Culpeper County, Frank Hume enlisted in the Confederate Army at age 18. He worked as a soldier and spy, fought in several major battles, and was wounded at the Battle of Gettysburg; and

WHEREAS, Hume later became a successful grocer and businessman in Washington D.C and served in the Virginia House of Delegates representing Alexandria; and

WHEREAS, Hume was known in northern Virginia for his civic engagement and philanthropy. He served on the Washington Board of Trade, and he donated land to build a school and playground in Arlington, Virginia that bore his name; and

WHEREAS, two sons of Frank Hume, John Edmund Norris Hume and Howard Hume, donated funds to the University to erect a curved wall and fountain honoring their father. The wall is known as the “Whispering Wall” because it transmits sound; and

WHEREAS, in addition to the date and location of Frank Hume’s birth and death, the inscription on the Whispering Wall reads, “A MEMORIAL TO THE HONORABLE FRANK HUME—A DEVOTED VIRGINIAN WHO SERVED HIS NATIVE STATE IN CIVIL WAR AND LEGISLATIVE HALL;” and

WHEREAS, in recent years the University community has undertaken a re-examination of its past and has removed or renamed a number of symbols of unequal treatment of racial minorities on Grounds. Efforts have included changing the names of several buildings, removing the Confederate War Memorial plaques from the Rotunda, constructing the Memorial to Enslaved Laborers, and naming a residence hall for a formerly enslaved couple who lived and worked at the University; and

WHEREAS, the inscription on the Whispering Wall celebrating the Confederacy is a symbol of support for slavery and inequality;

RESOLVED, the Board of Visitors requests that the University Committee on Names undertake to determine if rededication of the Hume Memorial Wall is appropriate and feasible, or if the memorial should be removed, and make a final recommendation to the Board at a future meeting.

**REMOVING THE WITHERS NAME FROM WITHERS-BROWN HALL**

WHEREAS, Henry Malcolm Withers was born into a slave-holding family in Culpeper County, Virginia, in 1845, and served in the Confederate army from 1863 to the end of the war as a member of “Mosby’s Raiders”, a cavalry unit that conducted irregular warfare, including ambushing a train carrying Union paymasters, known as the Greenback Raid of 1864; and

WHEREAS, following the Civil War, Mr. Withers studied law at the University of Virginia School of Law for two years and received a certificate of distinction in his classes. Mr. Withers did not complete the course of study at the Law School, which was common at the time; and

WHEREAS, Mr. Withers moved to Kansas City, Missouri in 1870 and had a successful business and legal career until his death in 1908. He was a regular speaker at Confederate veterans’ events, glorifying the Lost Cause and expressing his belief that black Americans were inferior to whites; and

WHEREAS, in 1981 Mr. Withers’ daughter, Lacy Withers Armour, passed away, leaving a will that stipulated a gift be made from her estate to the University in honor of her father. In 1983, the estate pledged $3 million to establish a scholarship fund in her name. The Lacy Withers Armour scholarships continue to provide significant support to students in the Law School and in the College of Arts & Sciences; and

WHEREAS, to show appreciation for Lacy Withers Armour’s generous bequest to the University, the Board of Visitors approved naming a portion of the Law School building to honor her father. Today Withers Hall and conjoined Brown Hall are commonly known together as Withers-Brown Hall; and

WHEREAS, at the time of the naming, there were objections to the Withers name expressed by, among others, members of the Black Law Students Association; and

WHEREAS, in the summer of 2020, an ad hoc committee appointed by the dean of the Law School undertook extensive research on the history of the Withers Hall naming and asked members of the Law School community, including faculty, students, staff, and alumni, to comment via a website dedicated to the issue; and

WHEREAS, the ad hoc committee filed a comprehensive report which concluded with a recommendation to Dean Goluboff to forward a request to the University Committee on Names and President Ryan to remove the Withers name from Withers-Brown Hall; and

WHEREAS, Dean Goluboff concurred with the ad hoc committee’s recommendation and forwarded that recommendation to the Committee on Names; and

WHEREAS, the Committee on Names and President Ryan approved the removal of the Withers name and forwarded the request to the Board of Visitors for final approval;

RESOLVED, the Board of Visitors approves removing the Withers name from Withers-Brown Hall. The former Withers-Brown Hall shall be designated Brown Hall.

\_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_

**Return to Grounds**

President Ryan said the coronavirus situation has been quite good thanks to a Herculean effort by students, faculty, and staff. Students are excited to be on Grounds. He thanked colleagues including Vice President for Student Affairs Pat Lampkin and Senior Vice President for Administration Colette Sheehy.

Student testing has been ramped up with symptomatic testing at Student Health and a clinic for asymptomatic testing at the Student Activities Building. There is additional prevalence testing including testing wastewater coming out of residence halls to get ahead of the virus before there is an outbreak. A saliva test will be available soon, thanks to Vice President for Research Ram Ramasubramanian and others.

Spaces for isolation and quarantine of students are available and ready. A COVID dashboard was launched and is being updated continuously. Students have been impressive in taking the necessary precautions seriously. In-person classes are operating but are challenging with some students present and others online. Many nonacademic programs have opened including some gyms and other activities. Attendance at sports venues will be limited to family members and coaches.

President Ryan thanked a number of people who have been working very hard to allow the University to have students on Grounds. A weekly newsletter and video will keep the community updated. Although there is a rise in case numbers, they remain fairly low among students and very low among employees.

**Athletics Report**

Athletics Director Carla Williams gave an update on fall sports. She thanked a number of people for the efforts over the summer, with student athletes returning as early as July 5. Seven sports practiced in July, with 514 COVID tests and 4 positives. In August, 3 more teams began practice, and 877 tests were administered with 4 positives. In September 17 teams were practicing with 649 tests and 5 positives.

Safety protocols included meeting with parents and players of every team before they returned and offering students the opportunity to opt out for the year. All athletes, staff, and coaches are required to use the COVIDWISE app. Regular testing continues and there is a tip line for athletics. The coaches have assisted as well as medical and legal teams. All fall sports are scheduled to compete, but they are prepared to pivot depending on the environment.

**Remarks/Reports**

**Remarks by the Rector**

Rector Murray thanked those participating in the meeting. He said the leadership team has done incredible work and the Board is grateful. This semester is the ultimate test of student self-governance. He commended the COVIDWISE app—the safest countries in the world are using the same app. Asymptomatic testing is another important tool and they are working on an even faster antigen test.

Rector Murray spoke about the issues arising out of the murder of George Floyd. The six related resolutions before the board are important. He commended President Ryan for his leadership on these issues.

**Remarks by the Student Member**

Mazzen Shalaby introduced himself and spoke about his background. He was born and raised in the Fredericksburg area, and he is a fourth-year student in his second year of a Masters in Public Policy program in the Batten School. He said he would like to recognize some people and groups: the five UVA alumni who were killed in the September 11, 2001 attacks; the native peoples and enslaved laborers whose land and labor the University is built upon; the members of the University community who have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic; and Logan Leemis, a McIntire student and rising fourth-year who passed away early in the summer. He also thanked former student representative, Derrick Wang, for his support and guidance and his genuine friendship.

He said his remarks reflect conversations and feedback from peers, as well as his own thoughts and opinions. He focused on the COVID-19 pandemic, the Racial Equity Task Force, and an umbrella category he called “student concerns.”

He said the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the University in much the same way it has affected everything else; it turned students’ lives upside down. He gave some examples and said he was impressed by the resilience and dedication the community has shown through the crisis thus far. Many students are not thrilled with the decision to reopen the University; they feel it was done for financial reasons and is doomed to be a short lived attempt. To their credit, most students have made earnest efforts to abide by the public health guidelines to ensure this is not the case. Valid concerns include asking what is the “plan B,” and what conditions would prompt its use; how do we protect the Charlottesville community from potential spread; what support is being offered to university employees during these challenging times; and what is the university doing to enforce public health regulations?

Mr. Shalaby said two main student concerns, outside of COVID-19 and racial equity, are about tuition and grading. There is a blossoming movement, led by student council and supported by a large number of students, to change the grading system for the semester. Many students face serious learning challenges, ranging from difficult learning environments to mental and emotional struggles to simple zoom fatigue. Students feel this should be reflected in the grading system through an optional or mandatory credit/no credit policy. There are also concerns about equity for students, particularly those who are disadvantaged under a normal grading system. The other topic is tuition. Students feel that the zoom/hybrid/online/COVID university experience is not the same as a “normal semester,” and that this decrease in value should be reflected by a decrease in tuition and fees, particularly in light of many students’ worsening financial situations. He said he recognized that this year’s tuition is already set, that the university is facing difficult times financially, and that costs are increasing rather than decreasing. However, that does not invalidate what students are feeling. Frank communication about the financial realities of the University during this time might be a good place to start.

Mr. Shalaby spoke about the work of the racial equity task force. He said the report is the floor rather than the ceiling. The University will not be great and good without doing our part to address issues of inequality. Just as it should not have taken a nationally televised murder to start a reckoning on issues of race and equity, we don’t need to wait for the next crisis to act on this report. He said we must not only attract and retain a more diverse community, but we must support these community members throughout their time at the University. Finances should not get in the way; it may be that we talk to the community and have frank conversations about the best way to spend money on this issue. The report and the recommendations in it should be the start of a never-ending project to improve the University, especially for those who it has historically failed. While we cannot change the past, it is our duty to shape the future.

Mr. Shalaby said being open to change and improvements does not mean hating UVA or tearing the institution down but caring about it enough to see its potential and work to achieve it. He said this is our chance to be on the right side of history. He said he welcomed feedback and input from members of the Board and thanked the members for their service.

**Remarks by the Faculty Senate Chair**

Mr. Joel Hockensmith said he can usually be found in his office/lab thinking about his research or thinking about teaching. He has been at the University for 34 years and he thinks of himself as an educator. A big part of educating is clean and crisp communication and one of his goals this year is to greatly improve communication between the Faculty Senate and various groups. He acknowledged his predecessor, Ellen Bassett, as an effective chair of the Senate last year.

Mr. Hockensmith explained the development of a Chairs Summit that brings together once a month the leadership of the Staff Senate, Faculty Senate, General Faculty Council, Graduate and Professional Council, Student Council, and the Medical Center Employee Council. Without this structure, this group would never come together, and they have a great deal to share.

This summer the Faculty Senate has held town halls with the President, the Provost, and the Executive Vice President for Health Affairs. Additionally, there have been four Executive Council meetings and they passed three resolutions.

The Faculty Senate is working together with the Provost’s office on a number of projects:

1.  Policy on Consensual Relationships
2.  Impact of COVID on Faculty Productivity
3.  Parental Resources (FRRRW)
4.  Faculty Conflict of Interest Guidelines
5.  COACHE Survey

The Faculty Senate is also working on a Faculty Senate Handbook. He invited Board members to contact him anytime.
