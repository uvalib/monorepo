The meeting was adjourned at 12:00 noon, and the Board returned to the Rotunda for lunch and Committee meetings.

Session on February 8th

The Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia met, as the full Board, at 1:05 p.m., Friday, February 8, 2008, in the Board Room of the Rotunda in Open Session; W. Heywood Fralin, Rector, presided.

Present were Daniel R. Abramson, A. Macdonald Caputo, the Hon. Alan A. Diamonstein, Ms. Susan Y. Dorsey, Thomas F. Farrell, II, G. Slaughter Fitz-Hugh, Jr., Ms. Glynn D. Key, Austin Ligon, Vincent J.

On motion, the Minutes of the October 4-5, 2007 meeting of the Board and the Minutes of the telephonic poll of the Board, conducted on December 4, 2007, were approved.

Resolution for Addenda to the Agenda

On motion, the Board approved a resolution permitting consideration of addenda to the published Agenda of the meeting.

RESOLVED, the Board of Visitors approves the consideration of addenda to the published Agenda of this meeting.

Presentation of the Crockett Award

The Rector noted that every year, The University of Virginia’s College at Wise presents an award to someone at the University who has contributed to the strengthening of the relationship between the College and the University. The award is called the Samuel P. Crockett Award, after one of the founders of the College.

The Rector called on Mr. Pippin to present the Award.

Mr. Pippin gave the Award to Mr. Rainey, and thanked him for all he has done for the College as Rector and as a Member of the Board.

Resetting the date of the Board Retreat for 2009

The Rector reminded Members that there is a consensus that for a variety of reasons, the date of the Board Retreat for 2009 should be moved from the customary end of July to the fall. As Mr. Wynne will be Rector then, the Rector called on him to lead the discussion.

Mr. Wynne said that with the constraints of time in mind, he would ask the Secretary to poll Members before the April meeting and establish a date.

Comments by the Rector:

Revision of the _Manual_

The Rector asked Mr. Pippin and the Secretary to undertake a revision of the Board _Manual_.

Consulting Members

Remarking that most Members had probably already met the three new Consulting Members from the Council on Foundations, the Rector welcomed Mr. John Nau, who will sit on the External Affairs Committee, Mr. Daniel Meyers, who will sit on the Finance Committee, and Mr. Michael Turner, who will sit on the Buildings and Grounds Committee. They and the fourth Consulting Member (who began his duties with the Educational Policy and External Affairs Committees, and the Special Committee on Diversity, at the October Board meeting), Mr. Kenneth Schwartz, the immediate past Chair of the Faculty Senate, will sit as non-voting Members.

Report by the President

The Rector asked the President to make his customary report.

Noting that this Session of the General Assembly is a long Session, 60 days, the President reported on legislation of interest to the University. Foremost, of course, is the state budget for 2008-2010, and the principal budgetary concern is the projected shortfall in state revenues. After reviewing the differing estimates on the amount of the shortfall, the President touched on the general fund budget reductions as they

relate to the University. He then discussed the Governor’s proposed capital bond package, together with Delegate Putney’s proposal on funding capital projects with a general obligation bond issue.

As for the University, the Governor’s general obligation bond issue proposal includes funds for an ITE Building, and the renovation of New Cabell Hall. Delegate Putney’s bill includes the ITE Building, New Cabell Hall, the enlargement of the Ivy Stacks, the renovation of Ruffner Hall, and a project to upgrade the University’s medium temperature hot water system.

Among other legislation in the President’s report was a bill which would exempt from the Freedom of Information Act certain records maintained in connection with fund raising and donor personal information, and would maintain the anonymity of anonymous donors. The President emphasized the obvious importance of protecting donors’ privacy.

Gifts and Grants Report

The President reported that philanthropic giving to the University and its foundations was $140.6million for the fiscal year through December 31, 2007, a figure which represents a decrease of $40.3million or 22.2% below the results of the previous fiscal year.

Since the last Gifts and Grants Report, athletics, The Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy, the Miller Center, the University Library, and the UVa Fund all report significant increases in giving.

In the months since the October Board meeting, the University has received a $35,000,000 pledge payment from the Batten Foundation to the Frank Batten Fund for the School of Leadership and Public Policy, as well as $10,000,000 from Mr. Frank Batten, Sr., for the same purpose.

Mr. Albert Small has made a gift in kind of $7,920,000 to the Special Collections Library; this represents his remaining 36% interest in the First Edition of the First Printing of the Declaration of Independence.

Mr. Paul T. Jones, II, and Mrs. Sonia Klein Jones have given $7,535,954, divided among gifts for the John Paul Jones Arena, to the College for environmental sciences, and to the Jefferson Scholars Foundation.

Mr. Michael W. Walters and Mrs. Joan S. Walters have given $2,000,000 to the Bob Olderman Student-Athlete Scholarship at the Virginia Athletics Foundation. And Mr. Roy Byron Harrill has made a deferred gift of $1,330,000 for the ultimate support of the Dean’s Fund for Excellence at the McIntire School of Commerce Foundation.

Among significant new pledges are $2,500,000 from Mr. Linwood A. Lacy, Jr., to the Virginia Engineering Foundation; and from Mrs. Frances M. Dulaney $1m to the Miller Center Foundation, $500,000 to the Virginia Health Foundation for the James D. Kitchin, III, M.D. Memorial Fund for Breast and Gynecologic Cancer Research Fund and $250,000 for the Frances Massey Dulaney Art Fund benefiting the Medical Center.

Other new pledges are $1,500,000 from Mr. Mark J. Kington and Mrs. Ann A. Kington and the same amount from Mr. Paul T. Jones, II, and Mrs. Sonia Klein Jones – both gifts directed to the College Foundation for the Joe D. and Helen J. Kington Professorship in Environmental Change.

On motion, the Gifts and Grants Report was accepted.

President’ Report, continued

The President announced that Hunter Rawlings of Orange County, President _emeritus_ of Cornell University, Professor of Classics and History at Cornell and Visiting University Professor of Classics at the University, will be the Speaker at the Commencement Exercises during Finals on May 18th.

Ms. Sheila Johnson, a great friend of the University and a benefactor of the Curry School, was chosen by the Graduating Class to be the Speaker at Valediction on May 17th.

That the Finance Committee of the Board of Visitors convene in Closed Session to discuss and consider the acquisition of real property by the University for the use and benefit of Medical Center access, where discussion in an open meeting would adversely affect the bargaining position or negotiating strategy of the University, as permitted by Section 2.2-3711 (A) (3) and (7) of the Code of Virginia.

That the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia convene in Executive Session to consider the appointment of a specific student member to the Board of Visitors, in accordance with Section 2.2-3711 (A)(1) of the Code of Virginia.

That we vote on and record our certification that, to the best of each Board member’s knowledge, only public business matters lawfully exempted from open meeting requirements and which were identified in the motion(s) authorizing the closed session, were heard, discussed or considered in closed session.
