**Approval of Addendum #2 to January 20, 1984 Agreement Among the University, the City Of Charlottesville, and the County Of Albemarle, Regarding Funding of the Joint Emergency Communications Center**

**Changes were made to the funding formula to base the funding from the three parties on the number of calls for service instead of on the participants’ populations. Other changes are enumerated in the resolution and the agreement.**

**On motion, the following resolution was approved:**

**APPROVAL OF ADDENDUM #2 TO JANUARY 20, 1984 AGREEMENT AMONG THE UNIVERSITY, THE CITY OF CHARLOTTESVILLE, AND THE COUNTY OF ALBEMARLE, REGARDING FUNDING OF THE JOINT EMERGENCY COMMUNICATIONS CENTER**

**WHEREAS, by an Agreement dated January 20th, 1984 (as amended, the “Agreement”), the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, the City of Charlottesville, Virginia, and the County of Albemarle, Virginia, entered into a joint exercise of power for the establishment of a centralized dispatching facility (the “Emergency Communications Center” or “ECC”)for their respective law enforcement agencies and other emergency services operating in the Charlottesville and Albemarle County community, and for the provision of a “911” emergency telephone system; and**

**WHEREAS, the Agreement provided that the funding of the ECC be apportioned among the participants in accordance with a formula based on the participants’ populations, number of calls for service and crime index figures; and**

**WHEREAS, at the meeting of the Emergency Communications Center Management Board held on September 12, 2012, the Management Board recommended a proposed amendment to the Agreement changing the funding formula so that it is based on actual calls for service received by the ECC, with each of the participants in the Agreement responsible for operating and capital costs of the ECC in direct proportion to their respective percentage of the actual calls for service, which the Management Board believes will be a more equitable and simpler funding formula for the operating costs of the ECC; and**

**WHEREAS, the Management Board also recommended that the Agreement be amended to implement a separate funding formula for operating and capital costs of the ECC’s 800 MHz communications system, with such costs to be allocated among the participants on the basis of the number of radios used by the participants and certain third party users; and**

**WHEREAS, the Management Board finally recommended that the Agreement be amended to include a fund balance provision so that the ECC may retain a year-end fund balance not to exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of the ECC’s total annual operating budget; and**

**WHEREAS, the Management Board has submitted an Addendum #2 to the Agreement, which Addendum sets forth the Management Board’s recommended amendments to the Agreement; and**

**RESOLVED, the Board of Visitors approves the attached Addendum #2 to Agreement dated January 20, 1984, by and among the County of Albemarle, Virginia, the City of Charlottesville, Virginia, and the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia for funding of the joint Emergency Communications Center, and authorizes the President, or Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, to execute such Addendum #2 on behalf of the University.**

**Remarks by the Rector**

**The Rector encouraged Board members to attend the annual Trustees’ meeting of the Association of Governing Boards in April in San Francisco. She also briefed the Board on scheduled events in April and May: there will be a Special Meeting of the Full Board on April 18 regarding tuition and other charges, along with meetings of the Advancement and Communications Committee and the Student Affairs and Athletics Committee. Final Exercises are May 19, with former Senator Jim Webb as the keynote speaker. Final Exercises will be followed by the Spring Board of Visitors meeting on Monday and Tuesday, May 20 and 21. She added that the Board Office will be working on setting the dates for both the 2013 and 2014 Retreats soon.**

**Ms. Dragas thanked Dr. Miller for inviting Dr. Pronovost to speak, and she thanked the Medical Center staff for the dinner the previous evening, which was a big success.**

**The Rector said that both the Board and the administration have been working hard on long range financial planning, working to balance objectives, which is a complicated process. She thanked everyone for their efforts. She said the Strategic Planning process has many people engaged and is an exciting time for the University, which will make UVA stronger and brighter.**

**Report by the Student Board Member**

**Ms. Dragas asked Ms. Hillary Hurd for her remarks. Ms. Hurd thanked those who attended the Jeffersonian Dinners on February 8th. She said 24 students from five different schools participated in three conversations regarding UVA’s future: Career Services, Advising, and A Global UVA. She surveyed the students who attended and listed three main conclusions:**

1.  **Because Advising comes from many sources, any changes to the advising system must help students build their networks;**
2.  **The University should encourage collaborative research efforts between graduate and undergraduate students; and**
3.  **As UVA grows and becomes more diverse, we should capitalize on the international student on Grounds who could be instrumental in developing research projects and networks abroad.**

**Ms. Hurd said she is hopeful that these dinners will continue, with themes that both the Board and students feel are pertinent. Other subjects on the minds of students are the possible changes to the Honor System, which Stephen Nash will address during the Student Affairs and Athletics Committee. She said the Honor Committee has worked extremely hard on this issue and has engaged thousands of students; it cannot be said that students are apathetic about the issue.**

**Report by the President**

The comments by the President are reproduced verbatim:

**Madame Rector, Members of the Board of Visitors:**

**We are meeting today on an important anniversary date for the University of Virginia. On this exact date 195 years ago — February 21, 1818 — the General Assembly formally approved the appropriation of funds for a state university “to be called ‘The University of Virginia,’ wherein all the branches of useful science shall be taught.” Six months later, Thomas Jefferson and the Board of Commissioners met in Rockfish Gap to lay out plans for the University in Charlottesville.**

**Yesterday, America’s new Secretary of State stood in UVa’s Old Cabell Hall to give his first major public address. He began his remarks by describing Thomas Jefferson’s vision for this University as a monument to “the illimitable freedom of the human mind.” He reminded us that Mr. Jefferson, who served as our nation’s _first_ Secretary of State, considered this University to be a more important part of his legacy than his service as Secretary of State or even as President.**

**Secretary Kerry could have gone to any venue, anywhere in the world, to deliver his first major speech. He chose to come to UVa because of our standing as one of the nation’s premier public universities and because of the University’s essential place in American history.** 

**Just a couple weeks earlier, The Princeton Review named UVa the #1 “Best Value” in the nation among public universities. When assessing the nation’s colleges and universities, The Princeton Review considers academic quality; costs; financial aid; the percentage of students who borrow from loan programs; and the average debt load that students carry at graduation. We have earned this best-in-the-nation value ranking at a time when “value” seems to be the most critical yardstick by which colleges and universities are being measured.**

**Tomorrow, you will hear a progress report on our strategic planning effort from Lin Rose, Frank Atkinson, and Milton Adams. As we continue this work to shape the University’s future, we face a very particular kind of**

**challenge. It’s a challenge because we are planning for the _future_ within the context of this University’s great _past_ and the high standards set by our founder. And it’s a challenge because — as noted in The Princeton Review’s #1 ranking — we are planning from the top.**

**Planning from the top is different, and more difficult, than planning from the bottom or the middle. We are not trying to move from mediocre to good, or from good to great. We are trying to move from great to greater. We have no peer institution to serve as a model for what we want to become, no single peer to which we can affix our aspirations, because our aspiration is to be something unique and greater than any of our peers. Our aspiration is to create a future version of _this_ University that is better, stronger, and more innovative than our current self.**

**Planning from this position requires that, rather than looking around us for a present model to emulate, we look to the future. And because we cannot see the future, we must envision it, and then put strategies in place to fulfill our aspirations. This is the work before us now.**

**As we plan, we should acknowledge that the environment for higher education right now is as challenging as any period in our history. At a time when European and Asian countries are racing to imitate America’s research universities because they view us as models of excellence, our own universities are being torn down in our national media. Our _public_ universities in particular are threatened by disinvestment coupled with increasing demands for affordability, productivity, and efficiency.**

**In this period of tremendous challenge for higher education, UVa is the best-qualified university to step forward and lead. I believe this is true for several reasons….**

**Thomas Jefferson founded this University nearly 200 years ago with a specific purpose: to create an educated citizenry with the knowledge and training needed to sustain the Republic. This founding story makes us different from our peers, and it should give us inspiration and a clear sense of purpose today. We have the institutional history and experience to be the training ground for national, and increasingly global, leaders.**

**UVa is qualified to innovate because innovation is part of our institutional DNA. Mr. Jefferson redefined higher education two centuries ago when he created a wholly new,**

**unprecedented type of university, constrained only by the “illimitable freedom of the human mind.” We can draw on that tradition of innovation now to foster a culture of innovation on these Grounds, and to redefine higher education in UVa’s third century.**

**We are qualified to define a new ideal because of our uncommon scale. This university combines the resources of a research university with the smaller scale of a liberal arts college. We combine the best of both. At large research universities — and I know, because I’ve been there — faculty focus mostly on their own research. At liberal arts colleges, faculty mostly reproduce knowledge discovered elsewhere. At UVa, we produce knowledge, and our students and faculty are partners in the process of discovery and innovation. Our professors guide our students through a sort of intellectual progression, by transforming information into data; data into knowledge; and knowledge into wisdom.**

**And finally, UVa has the moral authority to lead because this is a secular institution where values matter. Honor and ethics; self-governance; leadership; diversity — these values give moral and ethical underpinnings to University life and culture.**

**In its third century, UVa will be known as a truly global university, but the only one with our distinctively American story. We can use our unique scale to create the best residential education available on any campus anywhere, and to drive collaboration and innovation at a pace and quality unmatched by any other university. And we will proudly promote a set of values that give moral and ethical structure to our teaching, research, and service.**

**The strategic planning work under way now is providing the foundation for us to build this bright future for our University. Working groups drawn from faculty, staff, students, alumni, and parents have reported their initial priorities in seven areas: faculty recruitment and retention; student life; technology; streamlining; resources; synergies; and what it means to be a public university in this century. The 20-plus ideas that appear in the working group reports will eventually be distilled into a handful of priorities that we will pursue, but several over-arching themes have already emerged.**

**First, we see that our greatest potential to solve complex societal problems will come by creating multi-disciplinary teams of faculty who pursue discoveries at the nexus of disciplines — medicine and engineering, technology and design, and so on. Cross-school collaboration also has**

**implications for construction and renovation of our facilities. It holds opportunities for greater efficiency while nurturing innovation in the faculty.**

**Our plan must include strategies for integrating emerging technologies in the academic enterprise. This will include experimenting with new technologies to teach students both on Grounds and in remote locations, defining and supporting scholarship in the digital age, and harnessing tools to compute, analyze, and interpret massive data sets — and doing all this while strengthening UVa’s trademark commitment to face-to-face, residential education.**

**Our plan should also position UVa as a leading institution in advising — not just academic advising, but also career advising that we offer to students as a sort of “life-coaching,” in accord with the values of honor and ethics that we espouse here.**

**And our plan should include a reconsideration of our core purposes and relationships as a _public_ university in this century, including our relationships with a broad range of stakeholders in the Commonwealth. I recently asked the University’s deans to share with me their thoughts about UVa’s most important intellectual directions and aspirations for the future. The deans had a lot of good ideas, and several common themes appeared in their responses. The themes included the importance of our role in creating national and global leaders; the opportunity to enhance cross-Grounds collaboration at the natural intersections among intellectual disciplines; and the opportunities to enhance UVa’s global reach and reputation.**

**The themes highlighted by our deans and themes that are emerging in our planning group reports support and reinforce each other. In fact, it seems that we are experiencing a moment of great alignment at our University: a moment when the best ideas produced by our academic leaders, faculty, staff, students, and alumni are aligning along a set of key priorities; and a moment when our priorities and our unique values align with an opportunity to step forward as the leader in a troubled time for American higher education.**

**But to achieve our goals, first and foremost, we must successfully recruit and retain world-class faculty at a generational turning point when many of our faculty will be retiring. This is our opportunity to remake the University for its third century, and we must do this in a highly competitive environment in which many other universities are**

**recruiting for the same reason. If we falter or hesitate on this front, no other front will matter, because university excellence does not happen without faculty excellence. We need to act decisively, because the stakes are high and getting higher. As Secretary Kerry said yesterday in Old Cabell Hall, “There is no ‘pause’ button on the future.”**

**Today I urge you to support the goal of raising our average faculty salaries into the top 20 of the AAU universities by 2016-17. We have a four-year financial plan that gives us a road map for reaching that goal.**

**I spoke earlier about University traditions. Faculty excellence is a founding tradition here, too. It was Mr. Jefferson who said that he was “anxious to receive none but of the highest grade” when he was recruiting the University’s _first_ faculty members. Now, as we recruit and retain the faculty for the University’s third century, we need to do so with our standards set as high as Mr. Jefferson’s. Future generations will judge us by how well we meet those standards.**

**Mr. Goodwin asked what President Sullivan worries about late at night. She answered with three points:**

*   **Staying competitive for the best students;**
*   **International competition; and**
*   **Being in a strong, competitive position for faculty**
