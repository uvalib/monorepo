Board of Visitors' minutes, Accession # RG-1/1/, Special Collections Dept., University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Va.

Minutes of meetings of the university's governing body which is the legal owner and operator of the institution. Recorded in the minutes are appointments and other personnel decisions concerning faculty, decisions about construction of facilities, gifts to the university, and all other board actions, decisions and resolutions.

The Board met pursuant to adjournment. Present the same members as on yesterday.

Resolved that the Salary of the Demonstrator of Anatomy is hereby increased (from and after the 1st of October next) to $750- The additional amount of two hundred & fifty dollars to be paid from the Infirmary Fund and resolutions heretofore passed in reference to that Fund are hereby modified to that extent and amount- and whilst regular attendance at the Infirmary shall not be required of the said Demonstrator of Anatomy- it shall still be comptent \[sic\] for the Physicians who have that Institution in charge to call upon him to share the duties when highly increased by epedemic or otherwise.

Resolved

That the Salary of the Proctor and Superintendent of Grounds & Buildings be and the same is hereby increased to two thousand dollars a year, to take effect from and after the 1st of October next.

Resolved

That the resolution of 5th Sept. 1867 authorizing the Proctor to employ a clerk be and the same is hereby repealed.

Resolved, that the Faculty are hereby authorized to grant indefinite credit, and exemption from the payment of tuition fees as heretofore practiced to such students as may be proper subjects of this indulgence, and that the fees so remitted shall not be counted as part of the receipts of the several Professors or made chargeable therein in establishing the maximum of income.

Resolved, that the Board of Visitors have given full and respectful consideration to Professor Minor's communication in reference to the establishment of a maximum income to the Professors- but see no sufficient reason for changing their action on that subject.

The Rector at the request of the Board submitted the following

Report of Board to Visitors to Trustees of Miller Fund. which on motion was adopted and ordered to be spread upon the minutes-

The Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia, having fully considered the suggestions made to them by the members of the Miller Trust Fund- and being naturally anxious to comply with all the necessary requisitions for securing to the University the income arising from that fund, and for giving full effect to the purposes of the liberal and enlightened Donor, would respectfully make the following communication

They would first call attention to the fact that on the 17th of Sept 1869 they presented for the consideration of the Miller Trust Fund a detailed plan for Organizing the Agricultural Department of the University, which seems to be only defective in the omission to provide specifically for a Chair of Scientific, Experimental and Practical Agriculture- They would therefore now simply ask a reconsideration of this Plan as elaborated in the Report, on the part of the Miller Trustees, and would state that they have also by Resolution, supplied the omission indicated, and have established a Chair of Scientific, Experimental & Practical Agriculture- It will be a subject of the gravest consideration by the two Boards whether in view of the transcendent importance of filling this chair properly whether it is advisable to proceed at once to an election of the said Professor- It would seem to be better at once to give full notice both in this country and Europe that such a Chair has been established and invite proposals for it- thereby increasing the chances of obtaining the services of some man eminent not only in the particular Department of Agriculture, but in the congenial branches of Natural History

It is proper to state that under the agreement made at the close of the last session, public advertisement of this combined meeting of the two Boards has been made in several papers- but either from insufficiency of notice, or misaprehension of the character and importance of the proposed election, the responses have not been such as in the opinion of the Board of Visitors would justify an election at this time.

In reference to this point however, and indeed to all matters connected with the important subject which brings them together- the Board would invite the fullest and freest interchange of opinions, not doubting for an instant that the result will be such as to induce the hearty cooperation of all parties concerned, and the happiest realization of the objects contemplated by the Donor.

It may be proper to state in conclusion that the subjects embraced (for the present but looking to future subdivision) in the new Chair of Scientific, Experimental and Practical Agriculture might be severally stated as follows-

1\. History of Agriculture.

a. Field Culture of Plants (Grains- Grapes, Fruits used for Food and production of Wine- Fibres- as cotton, Flax, & Hemp- Tobacco- Hops &c.)

b. Breeding of Animals and care of same (as used for food, draught-production of Wool, Silk & Honey &c)

c. Forestry (Culture, preservation, and extension of Forests of useful timbres)

Natural History-

Mineralogy & Geology (including geological origin of soils)

Botany (including development of varieties in the vegetable kingdom, choice & improvement of seeds, modes of propagation of Plants &c)

Zoology (including study of insects injurious to vegetation-acclimatization of useful animals.

This enumeration of the more prominent subjects germane to this school, is in itself sufficient to indicate the absolute necessity of careful and deliberate selection of the Professor who is to undertake its manifold duties.

If desirable a copy of the Plan of Organizing the Agricultural Department of the University of Virginia together with the additions herein indicated will be prepared for insertion in the Minutes of the Miller Board.

The Board would also state that they propose immediately and as far as practicable to give efficiency to the Experimental Farm, & to that end would invite the consideration of the Miller Board to the appointment of a Superintendent of said farm and provision for his Salary and comfort.

In conclusion the Board sincerely believes, and trusts the Miller Board will share that belief, that the Agricultural Department thus organized and started, fully meets all the requisitions of the Trust under which they act, and that it may command and receive their zealous cooperation.

All of which is respectfully submitted

Resolved That the Chair of Scientific, Experimental, and Practical Agriculture in the Agricultural Department of the University of Virginia is hereby established-

Resolved That it is very desirable that a suitable superintendent of the Experimental Farm should be at once appointed.

Resolved That the application of H. H. Morton a student of Law of last session for a separate special examination for Proficiency in the class of Government and Constitutional & International Law- on the ground of sickness be granted.

The following letter was received from Professor S. Maupin

I have discharged the duties of Chairman of the Faculty, by annual election of the Board of Visitors, for the last sixteen years- I have on one occasion at least since the close of the war, formally expressed to the Board my wish to be relieved from service in this capacity and I have often informally expressed the same wish to my friends- Whilst I have no right to presume that it will be your pleasure to continue me in this position, I respectfully ask that you will, by the appointment of another, relieve me from duties which may be better discharged by some other member of the Faculty.

Resolved That Professor Charles S. Venable be and is hereby appointed Chairman of the Faculty from and after today till the close of the ensuing session.

Resolved That in response to the communication of the Proctor in reference to Prof. Venable's house, he ( the Proctor) is hereby instructed to have a critical examination made, and such repairs as he may deem absolutely necessary- the expense in no case to exceed $100.

Resolved That the sum of $110 be appropriated to defray the expense of fitting up the Bismark Donation.

Resolved That in view of the expenditure made by Professor Boeck for Books connected with his School, the Proctor is hereby instructed to pay (out of any funds hereafter accruing) the sum of Three hundred Dollars (in addition to the appropriation of $150 made at the June Meeting of the Board) upon the receipt of the books and verification of the Accounts by the Librarian-but this appropriation is made with the distinct understanding that it is entirely exceptional in view of the great need of Books by the New School- that it shall not be regarded as a precedent, but that on the contrary the Board of Visitors will in no wise hold itself responsible for any purchases made without its express sanction in advance and under a specific appropriation for the purpose, mentioned fully and particularly.

Whereas the Board of Trustees of the Miller Fund have agreed to make an appropriation for building a house for Professor Mallet on University ground, upon special condition that in case of separation of said Trust Fund from the University, the prime cost of said house shall be refunded- the Rector is hereby authorized and instructed to enter into such written legal agreement as shall bind this Board or their successors to fulfil said condition if said separation should occur.

The Board then on motion adjourned to meet again tomorrow morning at 9 Oclock.

Resolved That the sum of $400 be appropriated as salary for such assistant as Prof. L. J. Boeck may appoint in his school.

Resolved That the Rector be requested & authorized to proceed to Cincinnati for the purpose of disposing of the remaining Bonds- and if necessary to prosecute his Journey further in accomplishment of purposes connected with the in- terests of the University.

Resolved That no Scholarship shall be granted until the candidate shall have graduated in all the schools embraced in the Agricultural Department, and shall have passed a general examination on the same- and also that he shall bind himself to serve for two years in the Department unless relieved by the Board of Visitors.

Resolved That the Rector and Executive Committee be instructed to take charge of the disbursement of the appropriation from the Miller Fund and see that the plans and purposes are faithfully carried out.

On motion

The Finance Report was taken up and referred to the Executive Committee, and who were invested with discretionary power to cut on its recommendations.

The Rector laid before the Board the following letter from Col. Marmaduke Johnson.

I beg leave to imform you that the present is the eighth week of a painful and most serious illness, which has not only kept me confined to the house during that time, under the constant attention of my physicians, but which this morning finds me so perfectly helpless, that I cannot even walk across the room.

I deeply regret my inability to attend this meeting of the Board, and in tendering the above statement as my reason for doing so, beg leave to assure you of the respect with which I am
