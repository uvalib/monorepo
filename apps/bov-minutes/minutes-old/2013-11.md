**Changing the Meeting Dates for the Spring 2014 Regular Meeting**

**Mr. Martin stated that for the past two years the Board has held the late spring meeting immediately after final exercises. He said this has been convenient for many members of the board, but it is not easy for the university to transition from the biggest and most important public event of the academic year to two days of board meetings. He said he would like to return to meeting in June, however, the dates on the calendar do not work for several Board members. He proposed meeting on June 5 and 6, which immediately precedes reunions weekend. He said this would be convenient for those participating in the weekend events. On motion, the following resolution was approved:**

**CHANGING THE MEETING DATES FOR THE SPRING 2014 REGULAR MEETING**

**RESOLVED, the spring 2014 regular meeting is changed from June 12 and 13, 2014 to June 5 and 6, 2014.**

**The Rector also asked the Board members to add to their calendars the inauguration of the Chancellor of The University of Virginia’s College at Wise, which is scheduled for April 22nd in Wise, Virginia. He said Ms. Rinker would be polling the Board for their attendance at the inauguration events and for a possible tuition meeting in Abingdon or Wise the next morning, April 23.**

**Adoption of Integrated Emergency Operations Plan**

**Mr. Hogan presented revisions to the City of Charlottesville, Albemarle County, and the University of Virginia Emergency Operations Plan. On motion, the following resolution was approved:**

**ADOPTION OF INTEGRATED EMERGENCY OPERATIONS PLAN**

**WHEREAS, the Board of Visitors and the University of Virginia are concerned with the health, safety, and well-being of members of the University community and desire that the best possible emergency service be available to them; and  
  
WHEREAS, the Commonwealth of Virginia Emergency Services Law of 1973 requires that each city and county develop and maintain an Emergency Operations Plan which addresses its planned response to emergency situations; and** 

**WHEREAS, such a plan was adopted by the Board in 2008; and  
  
WHEREAS, such a plan has been developed by University staff in coordination with the Virginia Department of Emergency Management with input from local agencies;  
  
RESOLVED, the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia adopts the City of Charlottesville, County of Albemarle, and University of Virginia Integrated Emergency Operations Plan, to include plans and procedures for both peace time and war-caused disasters.**

**Resolution of Commendation for Gordon F. Rainey Jr.**

**The Rector said the $3 billion capital campaign was completed in the spring. This achievement was in no small part due to the tireless efforts of the campaign chair, Gordon Rainey. At a celebration of the campaign completion a couple of weeks previously, Mr. Nau read a resolution commending Mr. Rainey, and at that time Mr. Nau said the resolution would be presented to the Board of Visitors for its consideration. The Rector asked Mr. Sandridge to read the proposed resolution. On motion, the following resolution was approved:**

**RESOLUTION OF COMMENDATION FOR GORDON F. RAINEY JR.**

**WHEREAS, Gordon F. Rainey Jr., of Richmond, was appointed chair of the Campaign for the University of Virginia in 2005, the day after his position as Rector of the University ended; and**

**WHEREAS, Mr. Rainey demonstrated extraordinary leadership in every phase of the Campaign until it surpassed its historic $3 billion goal in May 2013: and**

**WHEREAS, Mr. Rainey, a proud alumnus of the University, having graduated from the College of Arts and Sciences in 1962 and the School of Law in 1967, provided calm, confident, and action-oriented guidance for the Campaign through unprecedented economic and institutional change; and**

**WHEREAS, Mr. Rainey personified the best of Virginia culture in treating donors, prospects and volunteers with integrity and respect while steadfastly moving the Campaign’s agenda forward; and**

**WHEREAS, Mr. Rainey’s service to the University in this capacity and many others has been of the greatest distinction;**

**RESOLVED, the Board of Visitors thanks Gordon F. Rainey Jr. for his dedicated and selfless leadership of the $3 billion Campaign for the University of Virginia and his superb example of what a leader should be; and re-affirms, as it did after his retirement as Rector, that it is reassured by the sure knowledge that Mr. Rainey’s love of, and devotion to, the University will in nowise be diminished by his retirement from this latest role.**

**Report by the Student Board Member**

**Mr. Blaze said point number 8 in the new mission statement emphasizes engendering an atmosphere conducive to fellowship and understanding as well as "constructive participation" between faculty and students. He said this is the foundation of student self-governance at the University and is one of our most distinguishing characteristics that will help to set us apart as we strive to be the premier public university in the country. Student leaders who spoke at the Board meeting were perfect examples of constructive participation, and as we endeavor to set ourselves apart we cannot lose sight of the importance of student self-governance as a motivation for students to continue to be involved over the duration of their time at the University.**

**Mr. Blaze said he would like to see Board members spend time with students in a more informal setting, outside of the board room, so they would get to know the students as people, which in turn would be ideally true for the student; students would come to know the Board members as people, also. Mr. Blaze said this interaction would go a long way toward taking the Board off of a pedestal that is shrouded by ignorance and a lack of familiarity.**

**Report by the President**

**President Sullivan made brief remarks prior to the gifts and grants report. She announced the commencement speaker chosen for Final Exercises in 2014 is Ray Mabus, the U.S. Secretary of the Navy. She said Secretary Mabus served as Governor of Mississippi from 1988 to 1992. He was the U.S. ambassador to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia from 1994 to 1996, and later served as chairman and CEO of a manufacturing company.**

**President Sullivan said this is a great selection for Final Exercises because Secretary Mabus will provide an inspiring example of national leadership and commitment to service for our students just as they embark on their own lives of leadership and service.**

**She also reminded the members that NFL quarterback Peyton Manning will be the speaker at Valedictory Exercises on Saturday of graduation weekend. She lightheartedly said, “You might say we have an expert on offense on Saturday and an expert on defense on Sunday.”  
**

**President Sullivan then gave the formal gifts & grants report, which follows.**

**Gifts and Grants Report**

**Faculty Senate Report**

**Dr. Holstege reflected on Veterans’ Day, also known as Armistice Day, a day when we acknowledge the service provided by our armed forces’ veterans such as Board member Frank Genovese, who was a U.S. Marine. He spoke briefly about his own family; his father and grandfather are both veterans. He read an entry in his grandfather’s diary from World War I.**

**Dr. Holstege said he mentioned Veterans’ Day as an example of service. He said in academics faculty often hear fellow faculty colleagues talk about being “in the trenches”. He said for faculty it has different connotation; it implies they are the life blood of this university as they strive to provide excellence in teaching, research, administration, clinical care, and service. He said maintaining such excellence is not easy; it is a battle as peer universities, both domestic and abroad, strive to overtake the University in reputation and position. Dr. Holstege said if that occurs, top tier students and faculty are at risk of being drawn away from the University of Virginia to others with better reputations.**

**Dr. Holstege said the Faculty Senate in 2012 performed an extensive survey of the faculty with the assistance of the UVA Center for Survey Research to assure methodological integrity. He said this was only the second time in the history of the University that such a survey was performed and the first time that questions pertaining to time utilization by faculty were asked. The survey revealed that full-time faculty worked, on average, 57 hours per week. The time was divided primarily among teaching (33%), research (31%), and administration (22%). He said the breakdown of those hours varied significantly depending on the school and the specific faculty member. However, 13% of time on average was also spent in service.**

**Dr. Holstege said the word “service” can have many different meanings. Service performed by University faculty includes such areas as medical volunteerism, community project participation, broad public outreach, participation in innumerable student activities, and time spent on various committees. He said this service serves as an example for young students and trainees to later emulate, and draws in those students (and trainees), enriching their academic experience. Much of the service faculty do for the greater societal good is because the University is a top tier public university that strives for excellence and grants faculty the platform from which to have credibility. Dr. Holstege said the international reputation of the University of Virginia has enabled him personally to serve in numerous arenas that faculty of other universities with lesser reputations could not.  
**

**He said the old and new mission statements also use the word “serve”, and the word can be found 12 times within the current proposed Cornerstone strategic plan. He said service is one of the "pillars" of a faculty member's obligations. As a university community, we serve and we do it well.**

**Dr. Holstege thanked the Board for their committed service as stewards charged with assuring that excellence is maintained at the University. He said not only does the Board’s work enable a tremendous educational experience for future students, but it also assures that outstanding faculty will be recruited and retained, empowered by the reputation of the University of Virginia to serve our greater society.**

**He ended his report with a quote from Thomas Jefferson:**

**"There is a debt of service due from every man to his country, proportioned to the bounties which nature and fortune have measured to him."**

**Committee Reports**

**The chairs of each of the committees gave reports on the actions and discussions in their committee meetings. These committee reports can be heard on the audio feed that is linked to the November 2013 materials under past meetings. It can be found at:** [**http://www.virginia.edu/bov/meetings/13Nov/index.html**](http://www.virginia.edu/bov/meetings/13Nov/index.html)**. Committee Minutes reflect the discussion and actions taken in the committee meetings.**

**After the committee reports, Mr. Martin asked Mr. Griffin to give a brief report on the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia (SCHEV) orientation session that was held in October. Mr. Griffin said he was joined for this orientation by Mr. Genovese, and this was the first “mandatory” orientation session for new board members. He said he found it to be very worthwhile. It was conducted by an impressive and diverse group of individuals including current and former rectors, former and current university presidents, the staff directors for state senate and house finance committees, the state secretary of education, and many others, including Rector Martin, who led a panel discussion.**

**Mr. Griffin described several of the sessions. He said the first presentation was on governance and fiduciary duties. The director of the Association of Governing Boards (AGB) spoke of how the boards of higher education institutions have a duty of loyalty to the institution, which means putting the interests of the institution above all else, and that all non-profit boards have accountability to the public interest. Mr. Griffin said he was told the primary duty of loyalty of a board of visitors member is to the institution and not the Governor or the Commonwealth; the Governor has appointed the members because he trusts their independent judgment, experience, and good faith, and their decisions should be free of any political considerations.**

**Mr. Griffin also described a session entitled “Effective Institutional Governance”. During this panel discussion there was universal agreement that board members should feel comfortable with disagreement and not fear situations when they agree to disagree because there is no expectation that boards will reach unanimous conclusions. Mr. Griffin said it was a good reminder that we are a collection of independent-minded individuals who all share a common bond: a passionate commitment to the welfare of the University of Virginia. He said the corollary point he took away from the panel discussion was that after debates, after the reasonable arguments, and most importantly, after the vote, there is a compelling duty that the board come together and speak with one voice to support the decision. He quoted a former rector as saying, “as a full board of visitors you have tremendous power, as an individual member you have none.”**

**Mr. Griffin said the panel on which Mr. Martin served described some of the perils of micro-managing, recognizing this is a challenge for boards to know where the line is between oversight and interference. Mr. Griffin finished his report with one last takeaway: SCHEV strongly suggests that all boards have some sort of self-evaluation. An annual process is encouraged where they ask themselves, “How are we doing as a board and how can we do better?” He said it was a challenge to find a full day to devote to the orientation session but he was glad he did it. He said he was very inspired by the people in the room and their palpable passion for the higher education institutions that we all deeply care about. He said we may disagree from time to time, but in our collective purpose we are united. He thanked the Rector for allowing him a few minutes to report on the SCHEV orientation and the importance of attending.**

**Special Committee on Strategic Planning with the Full Board**

**President Sullivan thanked the Board for their guidance in developing the Strategic Plan, in particular Mr. Atkinson and Mr. Rose, who spent many hours giving guidance and talking through the process of strategic planning. She said it was important to note that the strategic plan was developed not just for the current and incoming classes but it is for the future of the institution, for our children and our grandchildren, so that when they are ready to go to college, it is still a great University of Virginia. She said this strategic plan is fundamentally about leadership – student leaders, faculty leaders, and staff leaders. President Sullivan said the whole document is about the institution as a leader: the University keeping and advancing its position of leadership among public higher education institutions. She cited a comment that was made to her on her trip to China in 2012. She was told by the Chinese Minister of Education that when they think about American higher education, they think of Berkeley on the West Coast and Virginia on the East Coast. She said that is how she wants us to be seen, as leaders among our peers everywhere.**

**President Sullivan stated that the Board is not new to the Strategic Plan process. Two years ago, the Board approved a Strategic Plan for the Health System. It was approved without knowledge of where every dollar was coming from and it was made with a big assumption of what would happen with clinical revenues. She said the savings and additional revenues as they were accumulated were to go to a strategic initiative fund and that money would then be spent to meet the overall objectives of that plan. At the Medical Center Operating Board meeting the day before, the members were briefed on a business plan for one of the Centers for Excellence that was envisioned two years ago in that plan. What that says is that a plan such as this one needs to be both dynamic and flexible, and it means that not every dollar will be known at the beginning.**

**President Sullivan said there is no business in America and certainly no university in America that can tell you exactly what will happen over the next five years. You can forecast sales but your sales may not materialize; you can forecast what your vendors are going to charge you but it might not happen. She said interest rates can change, the regulatory environment can change, political issues can change, all of which can affect your plan. What makes your plan last is that you set a direction which the five pillars set, and that you are willing to be dynamic and flexible as you go forward.**

**The President reminded the Board about the University’s last strategic plan. The University adopted the Commission on the Future of the University (COFU) in 2008 and almost immediately the nation went into the worst financial crisis that our generation has faced and many things that we wanted to do could not be done. We did, however, have a general direction. We knew that it was important to get our students more international experience--we might not have had as much money as we wanted to do this, but we pursued that objective anyway.**

**President Sullivan said there will be areas that we will need to fund over the next five years, and some of them will not fit within the established strategies and pillars. She said four of the strategies involve taking things that we already do and doing them better, and this would be at a minimal cost. She said, however, there will be investments needed over the next five years and the reason for this is not directly related to the strategic plan. The reason for this is an issue the Board has already been told about: the generational turnover in our faculty. In addition, the Board has adopted a plan to increase the size of the student body by 16% between 2008 and 2017, and we need to have additional faculty to teach the additional students. This is an issue that needs to be addressed, but it is separate from the plan. The plan will help with this effort, though, by helping the University recruit faculty in a new and smarter way. We will be bringing faculty to a place where they believe they can become leaders in their field, and we will be bringing faculty to a place where we are refreshing our research infrastructure so students and faculty together can do the cutting edge work that distinguishes the University of Virginia from other places. She said we will do this through the annual budgeting process, which the Board already approves, and we will continue to do this same process over the next five years.**

**President Sullivan addressed metrics and the University’s ability to deliver. She reminded the Board that they had given the green light in August to go ahead with the Big Data Institute, which has been renamed the Data Science Institute. Since then, we have hired a dynamic director who is out talking to donors; we have an office for him but not a building because this is not the type of center we are going to build a building for. There are 170 faculty members from every college and school interested in this enterprise. She said today she received a cover letter to go to NIH because a new proposal has been written for a Center of Predictive Modeling to be associated with this center. Donors who are interested in it, and one of them is the Jefferson Trust, who has given the money to produce a curriculum for undergraduate students. Just talking about this Data Science Institute has landed faculty members that the University might not otherwise have been able to recruit.**

**President Sullivan said the Board had heard from Milton Adams on how we will keep this plan an evergreen plan and not one to be placed on a shelf somewhere. One of the ways we are working on this is by integrating it with the deans as they do their plans for the schools and other units that also do strategic plans. She said every dean has been involved in the strategic planning process, either on the steering committee or on one of the working groups. She then asked Dean Harry Harding, dean of the Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy, and Dean Robert Pianta, dean of the Curry School of Education, to address the Board about what they have observed in the strategic planning process.**

**Dean Harding spoke briefly about the Batten School strategic plan and its very close integration with the University’s strategic plan.**

**The Batten School began their strategic planning process about the same time as the University. Dean Harding found that there were striking similarities between what they developed in the Batten School and the University’s end product – very closely aligned even though they were two independent processes. The most obvious similarity was the emphasis on leadership. He said it was exciting to see development of student leaders while they are here as well as in their careers after graduation.**

**The second similarity he mentioned was recruiting distinguishing faculty. He said they are a relatively new school and their faculty are young, so retention is not a focus for them as much as recruiting distinguishing faculty. He said every one of their faculty have a joint or affiliated appointment, which maximizes the collaboration among schools and units across the Grounds. He said the Batten School was also looking for faculty who were interested in public policy as a practice and not just researching public policy, and they were looking for faculty who want to be engaged in the policy community even as they train students to enter it. He said they are looking for faculty who are not just interested in being engaged in Washington D.C., but also faculty who are interested in public policy in Richmond at the state level, at the municipal level in Charlottesville, in Albemarle at the county level, and in the world at the global level. They want faculty who want to be engaged with training students at every level, in every sector, and with every aspect of global policy issues.**

**Dean Harding spoke about high impact student experiences and the emphasis they place on co-curricular activities as well as curricular activities. Examples are student leadership dinners, student leadership retreats, and capstone public policy projects for undergraduate majors.**

**Globalization of curriculum was the third topic Dean Harding addressed. They have begun working on opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students in various kinds of activities abroad focusing on internships. Students are pressing faculty for more globalization opportunities; they want to be educated in it and for it, and the Batten School is going to do their very best to provide these opportunities. He concluded by saying these are just a few ways in which the Batten School’s strategic plan so closely aligns with the University’s plan.**

**Dean Pianta spoke about the Curry School of Education. He said since he became dean six and a half years ago, they have been focused on establishing and accelerating a trajectory of excellence. They have focused on strengthening their research capacity; having an interdisciplinary focus and impact; examining their programs and describing evidence of the impact of their programs; innovation and outreach; and raising their academic standards. All of these have been very well aligned with the strategic plan.**

**Dean Pianta said they have not been able to hire many faculty over the last several years but when they have hired, they have hired very strategically. Because of this, the faculty at the Curry School and more broadly at the University are ranked third by national magazines, behind Stanford and Harvard, in their influence in education policy. The Curry School jumped 10 points in the U.S. News and World Report ranking. At a time of decline in almost every other school nationally, their sponsored research has increased significantly. All of their hires have been interdisciplinary hires which closely aligns with the University’s strategic plan. He said their strategic plan closely aligns with the new Internal Financial Model. Stewardship is very important to the Curry School. This has enabled them to plan for excellence in a sustainable way. He said having a University-level plan that closely aligns with theirs is important and provides a catalyst for accelerating progress on their trajectory.**
