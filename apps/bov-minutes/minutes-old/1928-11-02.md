Attendance for the present session, 2098.

Gifts, as follows:

Bequest of the late Allie D. Smith, of Alexandria, Virginia, the sum of $10,000 to be held in perpetual trust as a memorial to her deceased son, said fund to be designated and known as the "THOMAS C. SMITH MEMORIAL FUND." The devise was on condition that the net income from said fund should be devoted entirely to the upkeep of the Law Library of the University of Virginia. The Rector and Visitors are given authority and power to invest and reinvest said fund from time to time, and to convert any securities held to other securities, whenever, in their judgement, would seem best for the interest of the fund.

Resignation of Dr. Thomas Fitz-Hugh, as professor of Latin, and Dr. John Staige Davis, Professor of Practice of Medicine, both of whom had been placed on the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching Retirement Fund, and for whom the following actions were taken:

RESOLVED, That the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia accept with great regret the resignation of Dr. Thomas Fitz-Hugh, Professor of Latin. Dr. Fitz-Hugh has carried forward his work here at this University with great devotion and skill, and the Rector and Visitors deplore the fact that his health will not permit of a continuation of his duties here.

RESOLVED, That the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia accept with great regret the resignation of Dr. John Staige Davis, Professor of Practice of Medicine. Dr. Davis has carried forward his work here at the University with great devotion and skill, and the Rector and Visitors deplore the fact that his health will not permit of a continuation of his duties at his Alma Mater, which he has served so long, with such distinction.

Appointments under the Co-operative Program of Experimental Education and Teacher Training entered into by the School Systems of the City of Charlottesville, the County of Albemarle, and the University of Virginia.

(83 du Pont scholarships have been awarded, one of which was not taken, leaving 82 now occupied).

With respect to the foregoing appointments, the following motion was adopted:

RESOLVED, That the above mentioned list be approved, and that the President be empowered to fill the one vacancy now existing in the du Pont Scholarships.

The resignation of Alvin Graydon Wood as the holder of the Ryan Scholarship from the Sixth Congressional District, was accepted, and Warren M. Ballard was appointed to fill the vacancy.

The following special appropriations were approved

Letters from the Attorney for the University, submitting Final Decree of the Circuit Court of Clarke County, Virginia, in the matter of the Blandy Experimental Farm, were submitted, read and ordered spread upon the minutes.

On October 13th, I wrote you with reference to the Blandy estate, and stated that the final settlement of this estate shows the corpus of the trust fund set aside by the will of Graham F. Blandy, deceased, from which his widow is to receive the income during her lifetime, and which passes to the University at her death, amounts to $971,486.12.

A further examination of the final settlement shows that this statement is not entirely accurate. The eleventh paragraph of the will of Graham F. Blandy directs the Trustee, upon the death of Mr. Blandy's widow, to pay from the corpus of the trust fund in said Trustee's hands, three pecuniary bequests aggregating $85,000.00. If the corpus of the trust fund should not be reduced or increased by fluctuation in value of securities during the lifetime of Mrs. Blandy, then upon her death the payment of these pecuniary bequests will reduce the corpus of said fund to $886,486.12.

For the sake of absolute accuracy, therefore, I am sending you this letter so that your files may reflect the exact situation.

I beg to enclose herewith copy of final decree which has been entered in the Circuit Court of Clarke County in the Chancery Cause of Georgette H. Blandy v. The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia. You will observe that this decree finally determines the fact that the University of Virginia has complied with all the conditions specified in the will of Graham F. Blandy as conditions precedent to the vesting of title in The Rector and Visitors of the University in the land devised to the University by the will of Graham F. Blandy, deceased.

A number of other questions were presented to the Court in this proceeding, among others the question of the vesting of the title to this land in the event of the University discontinuing operation of the Blandy Experimental Farm. On this point much time and trouble were expended, and it may be interesting to know that the position taken by myself, as Attorney for the University, and concurred in by Mr. Morris Douw Ferris, of Counsel for the Estate, was declared to be sound by the Court. Our position in this matter was strongly opposed by Mr. Joseph F. Moore, Counsel for Mrs. Blandy. Upon the entry of the final decree, however, we all agreed that for the present it might be wiser for the Court not to pass upon this point. Should this point ever be raised in the future the recore in this suit will be valuable.

You should also be advised that the final accounts of the Executors have been filed in the Surrogate's Court for the County of New York. This final settlement shows the corpus of the trust fund set aside by the will of Graham F. Blandy, deceased, upon which his widow, the said Georgette H. Blandy is to receive the income during her life time, and which passes to the University at her death, amounts to $971,486.12.

I am also enclosing herewith final statement of our account for services rendered in this Estate, showing a balance of $316.50 due on fee account. I also enclose a condensed statement of expense account, all of which has been paid.

If, under your present system of accounting, it is necessary to itemize the fee account I shall be glad to do so. If, in its present form, it is sufficient for your purpose I shall appreciate your sending me check as soon as convenient.

This cause came on to be further heard in Term time this \_\_\_\_\_ day of October, 1928, upon the papers formerly read and upon the oral arguments and written briefs of counsel for the respective parties in interest, and the Court having maturely considered the provisions of the Last Will and Testament of Graham F. Blandy, deceased, and particularly the provisions of the Ninth and Eleventh Clauses thereof in so far as the same are applicable to the question of the nature and character of the title acquired by The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, in and to that portion of the "Tuleyries Farm" devised to it, and to the remainder interest in the residuary estate of said Graham F. Blandy, deceased, and having likewise considered the arguments of counsel and the authorities therein cited,

Doth adjudge, order and decree that all conditions speficied in the will of said Graham F. Blandy, deceased, to the vesting of title in The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia to the lands in the Bill mentioned have been fully performed and duly complied with and that the estate thereby created is a charitable trust to be forever operated, maintained and conducted by The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia in the name of The Blandy Experimental Farm and in the manner specified by said will for the purpose of teaching boys farming in the various branches, including fruit raising.

And the Court doth further order and decree that all costs lawfully taxable in this cause be paid equally and proportionately by the Executors of Graham F. Blandy, deceased and The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia.

And all matters in controversy herein being now concluded this cause is ordered to be retired from the Docket of the Court among causes ended upon the payment of costs.

The following resolution in the matter of the certificates of indebtedness to be issued by the University to secure the loan of $500,000 from the Literary Fund of the State, was presented and adopted unanimously:

RESOLVED, by the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, that in accordance with an Act of the General Assembly, approved February 28, 1928, (Acts of Assembly, 1928, Chapter 61, page 324), it is hereby resolved that the University of Virginia through the Commissioners of the Sinking Fund, issue and sell certificates of indebtedness to the amount of $500,000, in the name of and on behalf of this institution, to raise funds for the construction and equipment of dormitories at the University of Virginia, bearing interest at four per cent per annum, payable semi-annually January 1st and July 1st of each year. The Rector of the University be and he is hereby authorized and directed to sign such certificates which shall be issued in such denominations and shall mature at such times as are set out in the following schedule:

A resolution of the Alumni Association of the University regarding the increase of salaries of the members of the faculty of the University was presented and, on motion, referred to the Committee of the Board now studying the matter of salary increases.

A resolution of the Alumni Association, regarding the establishment of an Alumni Fund for the University of Virginia, was, on motion, referred to the Finance Committee of the Board.

In the matter of the Estate of the late Robert Burns Waddy, the following motion was adopted:

RESOLVED, That the Rector be and he is hereby authorized to sign, and the Secretary to attest, a lease for the renting of property in the estate of the late Robert Burns Waddy by Fanny Herr Waddy, life tenant of the said Waddy devise.

Mr. Scott, Chairman of the Finance Committee, reported that he had had a conference with the Trust Committee and officers of the Wilmington Trust Company, Trustees and Custodians of the Philip F. DuPont bequest to the University, with respect to its investing, which conference was entirely satisfactory in so far as the interests of the University are concerned.

Mr. Rinehart, Chairman of the Building Committee, submitted the following report with respect to the contracts for the new dormitories and academic building

The dormitories and academic building have been let to contract as follows:

The question of demolishing the old building between Prof Faulkner's residence and Dr. Waddell's Laboratory, was referred to the Buildings & Grounds Committee for report.

The request of the Virginia Education Association for an extension of time in which to make final payment for the construction and furnishing of the Preventorium was disposed of in the following motion, unanimously adopted:

RESOLVED, That the Virginia Education Association be granted an extension until October 1, 1929, in which to pay the balance on the construction and furnishing of the Preventorium, provided, however, that this extension shall be agreed to by the guarantors of this unpaid balance.

The request of the Stillwater Worstead Mills for permission to use the old truck camp as a site for a temporary building to be used as a Textile School, in training their minor executives, was granted.

Report from the Engineering Department on purchase of electric current versus generation by the University, which report had been prepared by Prof. Macconochie, was submitted and referred to the Buildings & Grounds Committee for study and report to a subsequent meeting of the Board.

The suggestion of the President that the entries to the new dormitories be designated by names taken from the list of professors who had served the University from its beginning, was approved.

Report of the Committee of the Board, and of the Faculty of the University appointed to consider the establishment of a Radio Station at the University, was submitted, read, and ordered filed, awaiting further action of the Committee.

The meeting then adjourned.

On October 13th, I wrote you with reference to the Blandy estate, and stated that the final settlement of this estate shows the corpus of the trust fund set aside by the will of Graham F. Blandy, deceased, from which his widow is to receive the income during her lifetime, and which passes to the University at her death, amounts to $971,486.12.

On October 13th, I wrote you with reference to the Blandy estate, and stated that the final settlement of this estate shows the corpus of the trust fund set aside by the will of Graham F. Blandy, deceased, from which his widow is to receive the income during her lifetime, and which passes to the University at her death, amounts to $971,486.12.

A further examination of the final settlement shows that this statement is not entirely accurate. The eleventh paragraph of the will of Graham F. Blandy directs the Trustee, upon the death of Mr. Blandy's widow, to pay from the corpus of the trust fund in said Trustee's hands, three pecuniary bequests aggregating $85,000.00. If the corpus of the trust fund should not be reduced or increased by fluctuation in value of securities during the lifetime of Mrs. Blandy, then upon her death the payment of these pecuniary bequests will reduce the corpus of said fund to $886,486.12.

For the sake of absolute accuracy, therefore, I am sending you this letter so that your files may reflect the exact situation.

I beg to enclose herewith copy of final decree which has been entered in the Circuit Court of Clarke County in the Chancery Cause of Georgette H. Blandy v. The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia. You will observe that this decree finally determines the fact that the University of Virginia has complied with all the conditions specified in the will of Graham F. Blandy as conditions precedent to the vesting of title in The Rector and Visitors of the University in the land devised to the University by the will of Graham F. Blandy, deceased.

A number of other questions were presented to the Court in this proceeding, among others the question of the vesting of the title to this land in the event of the University discontinuing operation of the Blandy Experimental Farm. On this point much time and trouble were expended, and it may be interesting to know that the position taken by myself, as Attorney for the University, and concurred in by Mr. Morris Douw Ferris, of Counsel for the Estate, was declared to be sound by the Court. Our position in this matter was strongly opposed by Mr. Joseph F. Moore, Counsel for Mrs. Blandy. Upon the entry of the final decree, however, we all agreed that for the present it might be wiser for the Court not to pass upon this point. Should this point ever be raised in the future the recore in this suit will be valuable.

You should also be advised that the final accounts of the Executors have been filed in the Surrogate's Court for the County of New York. This final settlement shows the corpus of the trust fund set aside by the will of Graham F. Blandy, deceased, upon which his widow, the said Georgette H. Blandy is to receive the income during her life time, and which passes to the University at her death, amounts to $971,486.12.

I am also enclosing herewith final statement of our account for services rendered in this Estate, showing a balance of $316.50 due on fee account. I also enclose a condensed statement of expense account, all of which has been paid.

If, under your present system of accounting, it is necessary to itemize the fee account I shall be glad to do so. If, in its present form, it is sufficient for your purpose I shall appreciate your sending me check as soon as convenient.
