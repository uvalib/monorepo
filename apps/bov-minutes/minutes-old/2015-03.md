**March 24-25, 2015**

**The Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia met in open session at 5:00 p.m. on March 24 to hear from Ms. Joy Omenyi, a fourth-year student from Ellicott City, Maryland and President of the Black Student Alliance. The Rector, George Keith Martin, presided.**

**Mr. Martin asked Ms. Omenyi to speak about the arrest of Martese Johnson, a third-year student, by officers of the Virginia Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC), who are empowered to make arrests for law violations, and to provide general remarks about the climate at the University. Following Mr. Johnson’s arrest, students and community members held a march and protest in support of Mr. Johnson and in opposition to the actions of the Virginia ABC officers specifically, and racism generally.**

**Remarks by Student Leader, Joy Omenyi**

**Ms. Omenyi’s remarks are provided verbatim as follows:**

**Thank you, Rector Martin, and I thank you for the opportunity to be able to speak with you all today. As you all know, on Wednesday, March 18th, Alcoholic Beverage Control officers brutalized third-year student Martese Johnson outside of Trinity Irish Pub.**

**Martese is a University of Virginia student. Martese serves on the Executive Board of the Black Student Alliance and Martese is on the Honor Committee. But none of these factors are what made his abuse wrong. His abuse was horrific because Martese is a person and so he should be treated as such and we all need to understand that.**

**We all stand behind Martese in his personal fight for justice and will not be silent in our support. We will speak loudly and often until tangible changes are made in law enforcement procedures here at the University and in the larger Charlottesville community. What happened to Martese was quite obviously an instance of law enforcement abuse and so we must directly address these abuses, but we cannot be content with that. We cannot pretend that Martese’s abuse occurred within a vacuum. It did not.**

**The abuse of law enforcement exists within our society. It is funded by our communal tax dollars. Also, we must accept that it is engrained in our culture. Our culture at U.Va., in Charlottesville, and across the nation engenders those few law enforcement officers who commit abuses and a citizenry that too vigorously looks to excuse that abuse and a citizenry that in some cases supports that abuse. In recognizing this, we must address the direct cause of Martese’s abuse, police brutality. We must also address the indirect culprit in this situation, our culture. This is a struggle of the people. It was spurred by Martese’s abuse but it’s abuse that has been endured by millions and will be endured by millions more if we do not make a fundamental change. So, change is what we demand.**

**A change that includes the establishment of a culture of truth, an elimination of abuses, the proper allocation of resources, and an increase in the presence of faculty and students of color. We, the students, community members, faculty, workers, and most importantly parents and alumni will not be quiet until we get the change that we all so desperately need. We will make noise economically in our giving to this University and our spending in this community. We will raise our voices in telling the truth about what this University is to prospective students and will continue to be adamant about the physical, social, economic, and psychological abuses that U.Va. has inflicted on its black and brown students, faculty, and workers for its entire history and that it continues to inflict today. Do not be mistaken, we certainly don’t want to make this noise any more than you want to hear it. We only want a real change and nothing less.**

**A change we have been proposing to governing bodies like this for decades and if you do not give us this change, then we will not stop. The University of Virginia is now put on notice. You should all look out for actions that we propose in the coming days and you should support them, because, if you cannot commit to do it, if you cannot commit to helping us make U.Va. and Charlottesville a better and more humane place, then we will be forced to support each other. There is a history of great strength, great power, and great perseverance that flows through our veins. Once again, thank you for your time and this opportunity to talk to you. If there are any questions, I will be welcome in addressing them.**

**Ms. Fried asked Ms. Omenyi if she was prepared to describe the proposed changes now. Ms. Omenyi said she was prepared but preferred to put it all out at once. Ms. Kilberg asked her to share some specific thoughts now since the Board was in town as opposed to waiting for them to leave. Ms. Omenyi explained that she could get into the specifics but felt it would be more proper to wait until they could bring all of the proposals forward to both the Administration and the Board of Visitors at the same time. Board members urged her to go ahead and give some of the specifics now and she agreed.**

**Ms. Omenyi said when it comes to a culture of truth, she thinks it is very important for everyone to recognize and always keep in mind who we were founded by and who laid the foundation of this University. We need to do that as we look at the curriculum changes that we need to make - especially in the College - and how we address some of these issues and address the conditions of the people in this country. She said she did not think that was currently there and a severe curriculum change needs to happen.**

**Ms. Omenyi said we need to look at the training we give our students. We say we create citizens of the world, yet we don’t properly educate our students on certain areas of the world and certain people of the world.**

**Ms. Omenyi said we need to look at elimination of abuses, obviously ABC, looking at them internally and externally and looking into whether they necessarily need that law enforcement power, especially because this is the second student they have abused in her institutional memory.**

**She said when we look at our workers who don’t have a living wage yet, and we just approved tuition increases to have police substations on the Corner, she assumes to protect students from the residents of Charlottesville. Yet Monday through Friday, these same residents are cleaning their classrooms and feeding them but we are protecting our students from them on the Corner.**

**Looking at the proper allocation of resources, she said many students of color, especially in recent times, have been pushing for the allocation of a space for minority students because they simply do not have that space when other students do.**

**Looking at an increase of faculty and students of color, Ms. Omenyi said that was self-explanatory. She said black faculty have never been above 4% at this University. Black students are currently at 6% - other demographics are even lower.**

**Ms. Omenyi reminded the Board that these were just examples and they would come out in proposal form with specifics but this was just the things off the top of her mind. The Rector thanked her for coming and with that the meeting was adjourned for the day.**

**Comments by the Rector**

**The Rector welcomed Daniel Judge, the student board member who will start his term on June 1. He also asked Frank Genovese to introduce the University’s new chief audit executive, Carolyn Saint.**

**The Rector reminded the Visitors of the Board meetings and events planned for April and May. He said he would like to have a special meeting of the full board in April, and hopes to find a date that suits everyone. On Thursday, April 23, there will be a session on the audited financial statements. He asked the members to contact the Board Office if they would like to attend and have not already signed up. Wednesday, April 29, is the retiring faculty dinner at the Boars Head Inn. This is the annual dinner where the Board and the president honor distinguished retiring faculty. He also mentioned a Wise committee meeting on May 6 at Wise. Members not serving on the committee, but who would like to attend, are to contact the Board office. Lastly, he reminded the Visitors of final exercises on May 16 and 17. Ed Helms will be speaking at Valedictory Exercises on May 15; Governor McAuliffe will be the keynote speaker on Saturday, and the dean of the Darden School, Robert Bruner, will speak on Sunday.**

**On February 19, two committees met: the Medical Center Operating Board (MCOB) and the Executive Committee. Dr. Long provided a summary of the MCOB meeting. He said that in Executive Session the MCOB received updates on strategic partnerships and initiatives, a report from the President of the Medical Center Clinical Staff, and reports on regulatory and accreditation matters in consultation with legal counsel. In public session, the MCOB approved the Medical Center credentialing actions and endorsed and recommended to the Buildings and Grounds Committee, the Finance Committee, and the Board of Visitors a project that includes the expansion and renovation of the Emergency Department, the expansion of perioperative and interventional services, and the construction of a six story tower that includes the build out of three stories and core and shell for the remaining three stories for the Medical Center.**

**The Executive Committee approved the student board member, Daniel Judge, the issuance of general revenue pledge refunding bonds for capital projects and debt refunding, and a revision to the debt and interest rate risk management policies. They also approved an extension for one year of the lease on the upper apartment in Pavilion VIII to John Colley.**

**Items approved by the Executive Committee for recommendation to the full Board include leasing Pavilion I to the new dean of the Darden School, Mr. Scott Beardsley, and two manual revisions: 1) designation of the chancellor at the College at Wise as the “local chief executive officer” of the College at Wise; and 2) revising the charge of the audit and compliance committee to include risk. There was also a discussion about adding a nonvoting faculty representative to the Board. The executive committee approved a general resolution to accomplish this with the appointment process to be determined later. If the full Board approves the resolution, the Rector will ask the Governance Committee to develop the selection process.**

**Comments by the Student Member**

**Ms. Gould, the Student Board Member, made comments and also introduced her successor, Mr. Judge. Ms. Gould’s comments are reported verbatim:**

**Thank you Mr. Rector. Good morning, everyone. First I want to thank all of you for being here today: Board members, administration, faculty, community members, observers, and especially students. Thank you all for caring about the University in forthright manners and being present here to talk about them.**

**I’d also like to do my own introduction of the new student member, Daniel Judge. There were many things that I started and did not finish over the course of this year – or perhaps did not even begin — but I have full faith that Daniel will pick up those pieces and be insightful, helpful, and collaborative in all that he undertakes next year. But before I hand over the reins to Mr. Judge in June, I have some last thoughts to share.**

**It has certainly been an emotional and important year - for students, for national and local social causes, and the University as a whole.**

**​ During yesterday’s Board meetings, students spoke: in advising matters, in advancement conversations, and in a rightful speech to the Board yesterday afternoon by Joy Omenyi regarding last week’s brutal events regarding Martese Johnson. Those words speak for themselves. I cannot underscore enough the power of the experiences and poignant narratives of the individuals that have come forward in such a time of personal and communal discontent. As Joy said, a culture of truth and a stop to abuses is what the black community and its allies – indeed all of us, regardless of background – must work towards, within the University community and Charlottesville in its entirety.**

**These words of others share one thing, and that is a shared _responsibility_.  Now responsibility may mean different things to different people, but the word is clearly relevant in our community’s narrative: we, as students granted such an exceptional degree of self-governance and decision-making, have thus owned our responsibility for what _we_ can do to improve our community.**

**​**

**A few examples come to mind:**

*   **Students took responsibility to create a peer academic advising system called U-LINK this year after identifying a dearth of peer advising services.**
*   **Students also claimed responsibility in holding a student-organized, student-led press conference after the _Rolling Stone_ article was published. Even before then, they tasked themselves to advocate against sexual violence and educate other students here about responsive and proactive measures.**
*   **Last semester, University Democrats and College Republicans made it their responsibility to conducted “Get out the Vote” operations.**
*   **This semester, J Street UVA and Students for Peace and Justice in Palestine created forums, discussions, and a visual representation of the conflict as well as how it affected them.**
*   **Finally, individuals and organizations have organized vigils for students whom our community has lost or has witnessed be harmed, and for those whom other communities have lost. They have created working groups long before issues have gained national attention; they have held forums long before media sources give certain causes additional import.**

**​**

**​ And yet, there are concerns that we still are not being fully responsible to our fellow students. We ask: why do many events have minimal turn-out? Why did an Honor referendum affecting all students elicit votes from just 18% of the student body? Why does discourse about police brutality, sexual assault, or mental health remain within particular groups of concerned students until public incidents make others listen? Why do people resort to online media to confront or lambast other students?** 

**The questions we ask of ourselves bring me to a relevancy point for the Board. If responsibility is equivalent to accountability, then students hope to hold all entities of the University accountable to the decisions and actions they make. As the Board acknowledges, students hope for constant self- and external evaluation of our present University from _all_ of its parts.**  

**To determine accountability, consider questions regarding the Cornerstone Plan:**

*   **​At its most foundational level, are we valuing every student the same and manifesting that value through the distribution of resources within the Cornerstone Plan?** 

**​**

**Or considering crises:**

*   **When acting under pressure, do we remain true to our values?**

**And finally, we must consider our history. With programs like the President’s Commission on Slavery at the University I have faith we can continue many collaborative, inclusive and interpretative opportunities to acknowledge and analyze the history of the University as it influences our present community.**

**​ As a fourth year, my fellow classmates and I are very aware of the waning moments of our time left to take responsible actions to better this community. However, we also realize that what replaces us, this next incoming class, represents what the University could and _should_ be.**

**For them, we should try to change the fact that right now our student body lacks full social integration or solidarity; it lacks a full appreciation of our pluralism and differences. I believe that all students do care about diversity and the richness of experience here but they frankly cannot see that richness when operating in silos of their own. The idea we have of diversity should be extended. Alleviating socio-economic stratification, in the words of African American Studies and History Professor Claudrena Harold, isn't about diversity; it's about equality.  The University should ring true to having fairness pervade everything we do.**

**A concerted effort to ensuring that our school in all aspects is socially, culturally, and emotionally aware will reveal fairness in our actions. By financing resources for students struggling with social acceptance to academic anxiety, we can not only level the student experience, but we can _connect_ students with the resources they need to have an equitable experience. Furthermore, in the vein of self-governance, providing students with funds and freedom to develop their own clubs and activities will create the greatest returns for the University.**

**Finally, I want to stress how we can be responsible and accountable. I hope that the Board can apply the same strategy of quantifiable progress and planning that we see in the Cornerstone Plan to everything it undertakes — being proactive, deliberate, inclusive, transparent, and measureable in addressing the needs of students today: increasing availability of classes, emphasizing career services, providing fully and substantially for programs at CAPS and the Women’s Center, and looking at alleviating financial duress for students. On that last note, I am resolutely hopeful that in conjunction with implementing this new financial plan, the University will _follow through_ with its commitment to creating a sufficient and sustainable endowment for financial aid - for both in- and out-of-state students.**

**Thank you for your time and I look forward to the few months I have left with all of you.**

**Comments by the Faculty Senate Chair**

**Mr. Garofalo began by introducing Dr. Nina Solenski who will become the new Faculty Senate Chair on June 1, 2015. He followed with a presentation on the top 10 reasons for putting a non-voting faculty member on the Board of Visitors. This presentation can be found at:** [**http://www.virginia.edu/bov/meetings/'15Mar/Faculty%20Senate%20-%20BOV%20Top%20Ten.pdf**](http://www.virginia.edu/bov/meetings/'15Mar/Faculty%20Senate%20-%20BOV%20Top%20Ten.pdf)

**Comments by the President**

**President Sullivan’s comments are reported verbatim:**

**This morning I will provide reports on two things that are critically important to the University — progress on our Cornerstone Plan, and the actions of the General Assembly.**

**The Cornerstone Plan is continuing to come to fruition through the creation of new programs and initiatives. Some examples:**

**Data Science Institute**

**The first cohort of students is enrolled in our new M.S. in Data Science (MSDS) program through the Data Science Institute. We received 200 applications and enrolled 48 students in the first class. To date, we have received over 300 applications for the next cohort, which will enroll about 45 students.**

**Searches are underway in the Data Science Institute to fill positions for five post-doctoral students, who will help us launch an undergraduate minor in data science. The Institute is also conducting executive-education programs in collaboration with the School of Continuing and Professional Studies. These programs involve faculty from the College, Engineering, Darden, and the School of Medicine.**

**In the Cornerstone Plan, we envisioned creating a series of pan-University institutes, with Data Science being the first one. The Faculty Senate’s Planning Committee is working now to provide recommendations on a process for developing the next research institute.**

**Global Experiences**

**Strengthening U.Va.’s global presence and building our global activities are key components of the Cornerstone Plan. Earlier this month, we opened our new China office with a delegation of U.Va. representatives on hand, including Pat Hogan and five of our deans.**

**This year we launched a new Global Studies major composed of four concentrations: Global Development; Global Public Health; Environments and Sustainability; and, Security and Justice. One hundred and fifty students are enrolled in the new major this year, and we expect that the program will have 225 majors by fall 2015, and more than 250 by fall 2016.**

**Last summer, we created a new Global Internships program. During the program’s first year, 40 interns worked in eight countries in Africa, Asia, and Europe. One hundred and thirty-seven students are seeking internships in 18 countries for summer 2015 so far.**

**Last week, through our partnership in the Presidential Precinct, U.Va. hosted Prince Charles at a global-issues forum on the Magna Carta in Washington, DC.**

**Our efforts to make U.Va. a truly global university received recognition in February, when we were awarded a 2015 Paul Simon Award for Comprehensive Internationalization. The award is named for the late Senator Paul Simon of Illinois, and it recognizes outstanding achievements in global education.**

**U.Va. has entered into a partnership with the Max Planck Institute, Europe’s premier research institution, to revolutionize the production and use of energy. The collaboration will focus on producing clean energy from alternative sources such as water and solar, and it will distinguish U.Va as a leader in addressing global-energy challenges.**

**Student Leadership Development**

**Leadership development for students is another priority in the strategic plan, and we have enrolled our first class of 25 Fellows in the Meriwether Lewis Institute for Citizen Leadership.**

**These second-year students are enrolled in a leadership course titled “Leadership Across the Disciplines.” Over the summer, they will participate in a six-week program that will cover a broad range of leadership topics, including public speaking, team building, budgeting, and group projects. They also will have the opportunity to take an academic course over the second half of the summer. All this prepares them to embark on a two-year field-based independent study focused on a leadership issue.**

**Total Advising**

**I provided an update on total advising last November. Since then, Career Services has continued to develop new programs to provide more targeted career-advising for students earlier in their college careers.**

**We are also using technology to improve career-services activities. For example, we consolidated all career offices onto one employer-facing technology platform. This has increased employer participation at our career fairs by more than 30%.**

**Summary of Plan Progress**

**A strategic plan does no good if it only sits on a shelf. These new programs show that the Cornerstone Plan is a living, developing plan that will shape U.Va. for years to come. When the Board approved the plan’s pillars, you gave us a blueprint for the University’s future, and now we are building that future.**

**I will continue to provide Cornerstone Plan updates at future Board meetings, and I encourage you to follow our progress on our new planning website at** [**http://planning.virginia.edu/**](http://planning.virginia.edu/)**.**

**General Assembly**

**The 2015 Session of the General Assembly convened on January 14 and adjourned February 27, one day ahead of schedule. During the session, legislators considered nearly 2,800 pieces of legislation, 1,500 of which passed.**

**The Governor has until midnight on Sunday, March 29, to approve, veto, or propose amendments to enacted bills, including the budget. The General Assembly will reconvene on Wednesday, April 15, to consider the Governor’s actions.**

**I am pleased to report that the University’s two legislative proposals passed the General Assembly with broad bipartisan support, and have been signed by the Governor.**

**Our first proposal was carried by Delegate Steve Landes, and it provides that the terms of the Rector and Vice Rector will be as specified in the Board of Visitors Manual, rather than being codified. The Code currently mandates that the terms commence on July 1. This statute change will provide greater flexibility for the Board to determine the dates on which the terms of the Rector and Vice Rector begin and end.**

**The second proposal, carried by Delegate Gilbert and Senator Ruff, clarifies that certain medical records already classified in the Code as privileged and exempt from discovery in legal proceedings are exempt from the Freedom of Information Act.**

**This legislation closes a gap in the law that places our Medical Center and other state-owned health facilities at risk of greater exposure in sensitive areas of patient safety, quality improvement, peer review, and credentialing communications.**

**In addition to our legislation, there were many other bills of interest to higher education generally and to the University specifically, including the Health System and the College at Wise. Key topics included conflict-of-interest disclosures, mental health, efficiency and transparency of higher education, student safety, Medicaid, and other health-related issues.**

**Sexual Assault Legislation**

**More than 30 bills were introduced related to sexual assault and violence, touching on a broad array of areas. During the final days of the session, the General Assembly passed three key bills that are still being reviewed by the Governor.**

**The first requires that all acts of sexual violence reported to the Title IX Coordinator be reviewed by an evaluation panel within 72 hours of the report. At a minimum, the evaluation panel must include the Title IX coordinator, a representative of law enforcement, and a student affairs representative. In addition, the bill requires reporting of such acts to a local law-enforcement agency if there is a health and safety issue, and reporting of certain felony acts to the local Commonwealth’s attorney.**

**The second bill requires a transcript notation for students who are suspended or expelled, or who withdraw from an institution while under investigation of a violation of the institution's code, rules, or set of standards governing student conduct. The bill also provides for the removal of the notation when a suspended student completes his/her suspension and is in good standing with the institution.**

**The final bill requires that mutual-aid agreements between campus police and local law-enforcement agencies include provisions to notify the local Commonwealth attorney of any investigation involving felony criminal sexual assault within 48 hours of beginning an investigation.**

**Budget Amendments**

**The General Assembly also adopted amendments to the 2014-16 biennial budget. In general, we fared better than anticipated at the beginning of the session. While the $8.2 million reduction remains in place, the General Assembly approved some additional funding for the University largely because of the improvement of economic forecasts. The additions include:**

*   *   **$1.6 million for partial restoration of the budget reduction and enrollment growth;**
    *   **$1 million for cancer research;**
    *   **$100,000 for undergraduate financial aid;**
    *   **$85,000 for the Virginia Foundation for the Humanities;**
    *   **$5.64 million for the Rotunda renovation; and,**
    *   **$1.54 million in the Higher Education Equipment Trust Fund, which can be used for faculty start-up packages.**

**The General Assembly also approved base salary increases for employees, and will fund the state’s share of these increases, which is approximately 1/3 of the total cost that the University will incur:**

*   **2% on average for faculty and University staff. We can reallocate an additional 2.5% from existing funds for faculty.**
*   **2% plus compression adjustment of $65 per year of service for classified staff.**

**The approved budget also includes language requiring the implementation of 14 of the 32 recommendations made by JLARC based on its study of the efficiency of public higher education. In addition, the approved budget establishes a Joint Subcommittee on the Future Competitiveness of Virginia Higher Education which, among other things, will review ways to maintain and improve the quality of higher education while providing for broad access and affordability. The Subcommittee will also examine the remaining JLARC recommendations.**

**We will continue to monitor the actions of the Governor and the General Assembly over the next several weeks to ensure that the University is in the best possible position to comply with the newly enacted legislation when it becomes effective on July 1.**

**Bill Antholis**

**Before I deliver the gifts and grants report, I have one final bit of news about an important new hire. Bill Antholis recently began work as Director of the Miller Center, following Governor Baliles’s retirement in December.**

**Before coming to the Miller Center, Bill was managing director of the Brookings Institution. He has also held key positions at the White House and the State Department. He served as director of studies and as a fellow at the German Marshall Fund of the United States, focusing on international trade and development issues. Earlier, he worked at the White House as director of international economic affairs for the National Security Council and the National Economic Council.**

**Bill is the right leader at the right time for the Miller Center. I met with Bill and the Miller Center Governing Council in late January, and all of us are excited about Bill’s leadership.**

**President Sullivan gave the Gifts and Grants Report, which is summarized below.**

**Summary of Fiscal Year-To-Date through Feb. 28, 2015**

**Philanthropic cash flow to the University of Virginia and its related foundations is $160,952,200 through February 28, 2015, with an additional $20,876,400 pledged.**

**Increases in gifts over the same time period last year occured in the following schools and units: Architecture School; College of Arts & Sciences; Blandy Farm; McIntire School of Commerce; Darden School of Business; Curry School of Education; Engineering School; Batten School; Children’s Hospital; Medical School; Medical Center; School of Nursing; Virginia Health Foundation; College at Wise; Athletics; Miller Center; Fralin Museum; University Library; and the UVa Alumni Association.**

**Significant Gifts Received Since The Last Meeting**

**The following are significant gifts received since the last Board meeting:**

**Mrs. Hunter J. Smith pledge payments of $2,500,000 to the College of Arts & Sciences for the Hunter Smith Band Building Endowment, and $1,500,000 to the College at Wise for the Hunter Smith Athletic Scholarship;**

**WHEREAS, all Virginia students, regardless of personal and family income, currently pay less in tuition than the cost of the education they receive at the University, and this will continue to be true after implementation of the tuition and financial aid actions provided in this resolution; and**

**WHEREAS, the Finance Subcommittee recommends that the University enhance affordability by lessening reliance on loans in financial-aid packages for Virginia students, including reducing by $10,000 the maximum need-based indebtedness that a Virginia student can incur over four years, while continuing to meet 100% of demonstrated financial need;**

**RESOLVED, the Board of Visitors approves a reduction in the maximum loan amount from $14,000 to $4,000 for low-income Virginia students, and from $28,000 to $18,000 for all other Virginia students demonstrating financial need; and**
