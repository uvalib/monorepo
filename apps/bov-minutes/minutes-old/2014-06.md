**Miller Center Governing Council Appointments**

**On motion, the following appointments were made to the Miller Center Governing Council:**

**THE WHITE BURKETT MILLER CENTER OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS GOVERNING COUNCIL APPOINTMENTS: ALICE W. HANDY, JONATHAN J. HIRTLE, AND FREDERIC W. SCOTT JR.**

**WHEREAS, the White Burkett Miller Center of Public Affairs (the Miller Center) is a unit of the University and its Governing Council has certain responsibilities concerning the Center; and**

**WHEREAS, since the Miller Center’s founding in 1975, its Governing Council has operated under Bylaws approved by the Board of Visitors, which stipulate that the Board of Visitors will elect members of the Governing Council on nomination by the Council; and**

**WHEREAS, the Governing Council has nominated the following three individuals for election to the Governing Council:**

**Alice W. Handy**

**Alice W. Handy founded Investure, a firm which handles money management for educational institutions which outsource their endowments, in December 2003. In her capacity as CEO and president, she oversees all client relationships and works with the management team on investment decisions.  The firm had about $8 billion in assets under management in 2011, including the endowments of Smith, Barnard and Middlebury colleges.**

**Prior to Investure, Handy spent 29 years managing the endowment of the University of Virginia. She started as the first Investment Officer, later became Treasurer, and finally President of the University of Virginia Investment Management Company (UVIMCO).  At the beginning of her tenure, the University’s endowment was $60 million; in 2003, at her departure, it stood at $1.8 billion as one of the top five endowments for public universities, and in the top 25 of all U.S. colleges and universities.**

**Handy began her career as a bond portfolio manager and assistant vice president at the Travelers Insurance Company. She also served as State Treasurer for the Commonwealth of Virginia from October 1988 to January 1990. She currently serves on the boards of Bessemer Securities Corporation and MSCI, Inc. and is an emeritus trustee and former chairman of the board of the Thomas Jefferson Foundation. Handy earned her B.A., cum laude from Connecticut College and took graduate courses in economics at the University of Virginia.**

**Jonathan J. Hirtle**

**Jonathan J. Hirtle is one of the pioneers of investment outsourcing, having co-founded Hirtle, Callaghan & Co. LLC with Donald E. Callaghan in 1988. Today, he serves as president and CEO of the firm based in West Conshohocken, Pennsylvania, just outside Philadelphia.  The firm’s model offers investors a customized investment management approach, and was one of the earliest pioneers of the now much-imitated “outsourced Chief Investment Officer” (or OCIO) strategy, offering total portfolio management using a manager-of-managers approach.** 

**Initially, the firm’s client base was largely private investors, family offices and foundations; in 2011, 65% of the firm's $21 billion in assets under management was from institutional investors.**

**Hirtle served for seven years in the U.S. Marine Corps and earned his B.S. and M.B.A. from Pennsylvania State University.  For six years, he served at the Goldman Sachs Group as a vice president in the securities sales division.  His charitable and board work include serving as a trustee of the Abbey Leadership Foundation and the Parents Committee of the University of Virginia.**

**Frederic W. Scott Jr.**

**Frederic W. Scott Jr. retired in 2006 from a nearly four-decade career as one of Virginia's most prominent purebred beef cattlemen.  During his career, Bundoran Farm was recognized as one of the top Polled Hereford herds in the Commonwealth, and was the location for the Jefferson County Classic Sale of Polled Herefords, a prestigious event in Virginia.  In 2006, Scott sold Bundoran Farm to Edge Valley Preservation LLC, which helped the site to become the nation's leading example of "preservation development," where over 90% of the 2,300 acres are protected landscape.**

**Scott was a Sergeant in the U.S. Marine Corps.  He is a graduate of the University of Virginia, and has attended executive training courses at the Darden School of Business and the Wharton School of Business.  He has been a civic leader in Central Virginia for decades, and has been significantly involved in a number of charitable causes, including serving as a board member of the Sorensen Institute and the Charlottesville Area Community Foundation.  Scott is also an accomplished commercial pilot, flying Angel Flight patients and transplant missions.**

**RESOLVED, the Board of Visitors elects Alice W. Handy, Jonathan J. Hirtle, and Frederic W. Scott Jr. to the Governing Council of the White Burkett Miller Center of Public Affairs for a term of three years, with the possibility of re-election to a second three-year term.**

**\- - - - - - - - -**

**Reporting Relationship and Supervisory Structure**

**To comply with the requirements of the Virginia State and Local Government Conflict of Interests Act, President Sullivan presented a resolution to the Board to approve the reporting relationship for Ms. Diane Szaflarski, a faculty member who is the spouse of the Executive Vice President and Provost John D. Simon. She said this reporting structure would assure the absence of any real or perceived conflict of interest.**

**On motion, the Board adopted the following resolution approving the reporting relationship and supervisory structure for Diane Szaflarski:**

**APPROVAL OF REPORTING RELATIONSHIP AND SUPERVISORY STRUCTURE FOR DIANE SZAFLARSKI**

**(recommended by the Rector for approval by the Board)**

**WHEREAS, the Virginia Conflict of Interest Act permits the dual employment of immediate family members by public institutions of higher education on certain terms and conditions; and**

**WHEREAS, the School of Nursing has recommended that Ms. Diane Szaflarski, the spouse of Executive Vice President and Provost John D. Simon, be employed as a member of the faculty; and**

**WHEREAS, Executive Vice President and Provost John D. Simon is an officer of the University and would accrue a personal interest in Diane Szaflarski’s employment contract as her spouse;**

**RESOLVED, the Board of Visitors finds it in the best interests of the University of Virginia and the Commonwealth to employ Diane Szaflarski as a member of the faculty in the School of Nursing; and**

**RESOLVED FURTHER, the reporting relationship and supervisory structure for Ms. Szaflarski shall be as follows:**

**(a) All personnel matters concerning Ms. Szaflarski while employed as a member of the faculty of the School of Nursing will be handled in accordance with customary practices and policies of the School of Nursing with the faculty member reporting to the chair of the Department of Acute and Specialty Care. Where further University approval may be required, the dean of the School of Nursing shall make appropriate recommendations regarding Ms. Szaflarski’s salary, faculty rank, performance evaluations, and other personnel matters to the President;**

**(b) The President shall act in the stead of the Executive Vice President and Provost for all matters that may require the Executive Vice President and Provost’s action concerning Ms. Szaflarski, and will present to the Board of Visitors those matters that require its action.**

**Comments by the Student Board Member**

**Mr. Blaze, the outgoing Student Board Member, made comments and introduced his successor, Ms. Gould. Mr. Blaze’s comments are reported verbatim:**

**Thank you Mr. Rector. Thank you especially for inviting me to these meetings even though my term has officially expired. I’ve found that the best way to cope with graduating from the University of Virginia is to pretend that you have not in fact graduated, which I’ve been able to do for the past two and a half weeks while looking forward to this meeting.**

**Thank you to everyone in this room. This past year has without a doubt been the most formative and influential year of my life, and I have the individuals in this room to thank for that. I would like to now appeal to a short YouTube clip to help illustrate a point about graduation: (**[**http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc9fCbWHD8A&list=UUZBPr0phbzka\_f5I-bbh69A**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc9fCbWHD8A&list=UUZBPr0phbzka_f5I-bbh69A)**)**

**A fraternity brother of mine said to me: “Blake, your hat looks so silly, you look like Michelangelo.” Despite being compared to a Renaissance artist, this moment was my proudest moment as an undergraduate, the moment right before I would walk the Lawn with the Board. Hillary told me, in her final bit of advice, that this position would define my fourth year. I could not have possibly known what she meant by that until walking the Lawn. But sadly, this year must come to a close, and despite my best efforts to convince Meg to allow me to stay another year and the Board’s best efforts to scare her off during the special committee meeting on governance yesterday afternoon, she is confident about and committed to the year ahead.**

**But before I reluctantly hand over the reins, I have a few final thoughts to offer. Over the course of the year, through conversations with friends and during presentations to first years dorms, one word came up enough times to describe students’ desires about the board that I knew it had to be a buzzword: transparency. I thought about this for a while and realized that it was more or less a word that is easy to throw at any governing board and so, in order for it to be meaningful, it had to be broken down. I believe that what students want, and what the board should focus on, are two things that compose transparency: accessibility and accountability. This past year has been a story of overwhelmingly positive trends in both categories.**

**Accessibility is improved by vigilance and diligence to the student experience. What I mean by this: the willingness of board members to take time out of their schedules to get lunch with students and listen to their candid criticisms of the school; fantastically generous gifts that demonstrate a commitment to students; and, perhaps most of all, being as eager a student as any undergraduate, willing to go to class and be a part of the University.**

**An example of the fruit of this labor is the board’s relationship with Student Council, which admittedly had a long way to come but has nonetheless vastly improved. Mr. Rector, I know that your visit to a general body meeting was greatly appreciated. I did not appreciate having to follow your act the next week but that’s another matter.**

**The board’s commitment to improving accountability has been evident over even these past two days, in both accountability to our goals and to ourselves. Achieving goals like total advising, after clearly outlining and emphasizing them in the Cornerstone Plan, is an example of the former that will come to impact students’ lives in a tremendously positive fashion. The Board’s meeting on governance yesterday is an example of the latter that will continue to impact the board for some time to come. And on this note, I find it truly incredible that an entity such as this, a governing board with a great deal of responsibility, has the potential and commitment to be dynamic. Unfortunately, though, I will have to watch this dynamism from afar.**

**The only reason that I can leave this position in comfort and confidence is that I am certain that Meg will do an incredible job. There were many things I started and did not finish over the course of this year, but I know that Meg will pick up where I left off and exceed all expectations on her way to being one the best, if not _the_ best, student member this board has ever seen. And with that, I’d like to very reluctantly hand over the reins to Ms. Gould.**

**Ms. Gould’s comments are also reported verbatim:**

**Thank you, Blake, and everyone in this room. Although he’s a hard act to follow and an even harder one to get rid of – like he said he just doesn’t want to leave - I couldn’t appreciate his guidance any more. I will do my best as the Student Member to replicate Blake’s incredible timeliness with answering emails, and make it to all tuition meetings, in person. But, in all honesty, it is a difficult task to live up to Blake’s quite remarkable job this past year both serving you the Board and serving the student body in creating a more open, direct, and productive relationship between the two. I can only hope to emulate that service. As people have mentioned several times to me this week, I have literally and figuratively large shoes to fill.**

**Today I want to relate to you what I anticipate to be student concerns for next year, concerns that crystallized for me in a student leadership conference in which I participated here last week.**

**As Vice President Lampkin told us in the Student Affairs and Athletics meeting, L2K is a weeklong “meeting of the young minds” program for students representing 30 different student organizations to learn about the University’s inner workings, and most importantly test the strength of student self-governance as we meet each other and discuss critical University-wide issues.**

**With an extensive array of perspectives ranging from representatives from minority awareness or mentoring groups to broader University-wide organizations, clear major student concerns surfaced throughout the week. These concerns unsurprisingly aligned to the pillars of the University’s Cornerstone Plan, and ultimately related to a central theme: how we should approach access, diversity, and maintaining a safe and successful residential culture, in the face of the University’s growth.**

**I’ll get affordable access and diversity over with first to put you all, and myself, at ease! As financial demands as well as constraints grow, students are anxious that although the Board is improving the student experience through its continued investment in AccessUVA, ensuring competitive faculty pay, and improving advising, tuition increases will negatively affect the diversity of the student body.**

**While they understand the many necessary University components and improvements for which these tuition increases provide, organizations such as United for Undergraduate Socio-Economic Diversity and the Minority Rights Coalition feel that the cumulative effect of these increases with the recent AccessUVA changes make exclusive the privilege of attending UVA. Students within and outside these groups feel that the Board should prioritize finding other sources of funding for budget increases – as the finance subcommittee is tasked to do—and as we all desire, should prioritize keeping our University consistently and predictably accessible and affordable.**

**Secondly, I’d like to note that students also perceive another side to accessibility to the school. Students are thankful that the University supports organizations with many different and broad definitions of diversity, but they also hope for an extension of that model - they desire a diverse faculty as much as they desire a diverse set of peers. By placing emphasis on this sense of a more comprehensive inclusivity, I believe the University can have faculty that not only excel in their fields, but also serve as approachable resources for all students.**

**I’d like to now turn to the residential culture here at the University. As we move into next year, a shared student, University, and Board effort could very much improve this Community of Trust by addressing the presence of sexual misconduct on Grounds, especially as we increase in size and scope.**

**As the University is certainly aware of and working exhaustively to address this issue, in the words of the external chair for the Sexual Assault Leadership Council, students and the institution can “do better” – we can do better, we can do more, and we can do it earlier for students.**

**Student Council crafted a statement called the SMART (Sexual Misconduct Awareness, Recovery, and Tangible change) Resolution, in partnership with many student awareness organizations, that made seven practical recommendations including increasing bystander intervention training, and lending transparency to the selection for the Sexual Misconduct Board.**

**There also will be a concerted effort to address sexual misconduct with first years at the start of the year to produce an initial and lasting culture of mutual respect, safety and support. I hope that the University continues both to lead a national conversation regarding sexual misconduct as we have this year, and to seek on-the-ground ways to address the issue.**

**Finally, even as numbers increase, students applaud the Total Advising initiative as a strategy to help our residential culture become more accountable. This proposal will improve what is now an incomplete system and hopefully complete it by both guiding students academically and preparing them professionally, for motivating self-inquiry and offering opportunities for specialization. From my own experience interning and studying abroad I also encourage the global internship initiative as certainly progressive and incredibly valuable for the holistic development of students.**

**I would like to end by saying that the University of Virginia is a collaborative community. The Board of Visitors has already embraced this shared approach with the creation of the Cornerstone Plan. Looking forward, I hope the Board of Visitors, students, faculty and staff, as the high-achieving Women’s soccer team did this year, will go all in, together: that we will explore and act at the frontier of higher education with shared motivation and intentions. I look forward to what is sure to be a whirlwind of the year ahead of us.**

**Thank you, and join me again in thanking Blake for his invaluable year of service and his wise guidance before and during the course of this meeting. I would be happy to answer any questions.**

**Following Ms. Gould’s remarks, the Rector asked Ms. Dragas to present a commending resolution, which she read:**

**RESOLUTION COMMENDING BLAKE E. BLAZE**

**WHEREAS, Blake E. Blaze of Barnstable, Massachusetts, took a B.A. in Economics and Math from the College of Arts & Sciences in May 2014; and**

**WHEREAS, Mr. Blaze was a Jefferson Scholar and an Echols Scholar, as well as a teacher, having developed and taught an upper level course in the College during his third year. He was the backup long-snapper on the football team, a resident of the Lawn, and a member of Phi Delta Theta fraternity as well as One in Four, which provides peer education on preventing sexual assault; and**

**WHEREAS, among Mr. Blaze’s many honors and awards, he retained a place on the athletic honor roll throughout his undergraduate years, received the ACC Academic Achievement Award twice, won the _ACC Top VI Award_ given to the 6 student-athletes most involved in community service at each institution, and earned the Ernest H. Ern Jr. award for outstanding contributions to student life; and**

**WHEREAS, as Student Member, Mr. Blaze shared his experiences as a student leader, Jefferson Scholar, and student athlete; his insights into student issues and concerns were invaluable to members of the Board; and**

**WHEREAS, Mr. Blaze’s term as Student Member concluded June 1, 2014;**

**RESOLVED, the Board of Visitors thanks Blake E. Blaze for his devoted service to the Board and the University, values his friendship as a colleague, anticipates his many future contributions to the University, and wishes him great success and happiness in all of his future endeavors.**

**The commending resolution was approved.**

**Comments by the President**

**President Sullivan said during this Board meeting and during several prior meetings, the Board has been informed about the strategic plan for the Academic Division, the Cornerstone Plan; however, the Health System adopted a clinical strategic plan in 2011, and the plan is now well into its successful implementation phase. The Medical Center Operating Board receives regular updates on the Health System plan, but she wanted to take the opportunity to make sure that all Board members were familiar with the Health System strategic plan.**

**Through its planning process, the Health System identified four strategic goals, and they are making significant progress in each area. Under the first goal — to advance our stature as a leading clinical and academic enterprise — the Health System has brought Centers of Excellence into operation in three areas: cardiovascular health, neuroscience, and cancer. Each Center is implementing planned initiatives and hiring key clinical faculty and staff. Programs of excellence in transplant and digestive health are currently in development.**

**Critical investments have been made in infrastructure, and faculty recruited to support clinical research. They have established a successful internal grants program: to date, 13 awards have been given, totaling about $4.8 million.**

**Clinical research funding has increased, from $31 million total in fiscal year 2011 to $45.1 million as of the third quarter of fiscal year 2014.**

**Gains in local and regional market share have occurred, from 42% of local share in fiscal year 2011, to 43.3% in the first quarter of fiscal year 2014; and from 11.2% of regional share in fiscal year 2011 to 12.3% in the first quarter of fiscal year 2014.**

**In the same time frame, Health System revenue has grown steadily, from $1.31 billion in fiscal year 2011 to $1.6 billion in fiscal year 2014, annualized.**

**Under the second goal -- to strengthen organizational alignment -- Dr. Rick Shannon was hired as the Executive Vice President of Health Affairs in November 2013.**

**New ventures have been developed and managed, such as the medical park at Zion Crossroads, through collaboration among the Medical Center, School of Medicine, and the Physicians Group.**

**The Accountable Care Organization, “Well Virginia,” in January of this year was created with the dual primary goals of improving quality while reducing costs, through better care collaboration and management of patients who are covered by Medicare.**

**The School of Medicine is currently developing an academic strategic plan, meant to be complementary to the Health System plan, with emphasis on the research and teaching missions.**

**There is an on-going dialogue with potential partners, and many successful clinical partnerships have been established with other organizations — for example, the joint-venture in dialysis with Centra Health and the collaboration in pediatric care with Bon Secours.**

**Under the third goal — to achieve operational excellence —**

**she said the University is continually working to improve access to providers and facilities. As one result, more University employees are now seeking care within the Health System, comprising 33% of visits in 2013 compared with 30% in 2012. Last November, a Patient Experience Officer was hired to help re-orient the organization to better meet the needs of patients and families.**

**The Medical Center maintains a solid operating margin, even after strategic investments.**

**President Sullivan said that Dr. Shannon introduced the “Be Safe” initiative, with the goal of making the Health System the safest place in the country to work and to receive care. “Be Safe” has become the priority focus within the organization, and an aggressive training program is underway. Through pilot programs in clinical units, transformation is occurring in the way we solve problems in real-time, and at the point of care.**

**Finally, under the fourth strategic goal — to provide resources to support our Health System’s missions — a strategic investment pool was established, funded through 2017, to support strategic initiatives, and a hiring campaign for experienced nurses far exceeded expectations, with 120 nurses hired as of May 23 against an initial goal of 50 hires.**

**President Sullivan said Dr. Shannon and Mr. Howell deserve much of the credit for the significant progress that the Health System has made toward its strategic goals. As Mr. Howell prepares to step down from his role as CEO of the Medical Center, she said we owe him a debt of gratitude for his 12-plus years of service. She indicated that she was also delighted to welcome Pamela Sutton-Wallace, who will take over as the Medical Center CEO next month.**

**The President concluded by pointing out that the goal for the Health System is to provide the very best patient care, in the safest environment, for people from all over the Commonwealth and beyond. Thanks to a clearly defined strategic plan, and strong leadership, they are well on their way to realizing that goal.**

**President Sullivan provided a report on the gifts and grants received since the previous regular meeting of the Board.**

**Gifts and Grants Report**

**Summary of Fiscal Year-To-Date through April 30, 2014**
