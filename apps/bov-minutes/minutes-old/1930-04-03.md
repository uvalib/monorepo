A special meeting of the Rector and Visitors was held on the above date at 8 o'clock P. M., with Visitors Buchanan, Carson, Hart, McIntire, Rinehart, Scott, Virginius R. Shackelford, Walker, and Williams, and President Alderman present.

Mr. Virginius R. Shackelford, appointed by the Governor as a Visitor of the University of Virginia for the term expiring February 28, 1934, presented his qualifications.

Mr. C. Harding Walker, whose term as Rector expired on February 28, 1930, called the meeting to order and stated that as he had held the position of Rector for the past eight years he did not care to stand for re-election. Thereupon, Senator Buchanan was elected temporary chairman and called for nominations for the office of Rector. Mr. Williams placed in nomination Mr. Frederic W. Scott for the position of Rector, and he was unanimously elected to that office for the term ending February 28, 1934.

Upon taking the chair the Rector appointed a committee consisting of Messrs. Buchanan and Williams, in conjunction with the President, to prepare resolutions to be spread upon the Minutes of the Board expressing the Board's appreciation of the services of the retiring Rector, Honorable Cyrus Harding Walker. The Committee prepared and presented the following resolution:

The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia desire to spread upon their minutes a resolution of appreciation and gratitude to their colleague, Cyrus Harding Walker, who this evening asks to retire from the post of Rector of the University, which he has held for the past eight years.

The Rector and Visitors recall that Mr. Walker, an alumnus of the University of the year 1882, has been, for thirteen years, a member of the Board of Visitors, and it is a satisfaction to them to know that they will continue to have in their counsels the benefit of his ripe wisdom and wide knowledge of University affairs. It is their special wish to place on their official records a permanent acknowledgement of their obligations to Cyrus Harding Walker, for his efficient services as Rector, his unfailing courtesy, his sense of justice, his highminded and unselfish devotion to the interests of the University, and his far-seeing vision of the duty and destiny of his Alma Mater.

The Rector announced the following Standing Committees for 1930-32, and by resolution of the Board the Rector for the present term shall be Chairman of the Finance Committee:

EXECUTIVE: Williams, Hart, Buchanan, Mrs. Munford, and the Rector.

FINANCE: Walker, Scott (Chairman), and McIntire.

The President stated that Mr. Charles Steele of New York, an alumnus of the University, had had executed by the noted Russian Sculptor, Sergei Konenkov, a bronze bust of himself and offers to present the same to the University. The Board expressed its appreciation of the gift and on motion a committee consisting of Messrs. Walker and Buchanan was appointed to draw suitable resolutions expressing to Mr. Steele the Board's appreciation of his generous gift. The committee prepared and presented the following resolution:

The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, having learned with pleasure and gratification that Mr. Charles Steele, an alumnus of this University, residing in the City of New York, has had executed by the noted Russian Sculptor, Sergei Konenkov and offers to present to the University, a bronze bust of Dr. Edwin A. Alderman, its first President, desire to tender to Mr. Steele and to record in the Minutes of the Board their profound appreciation of his gracious act, and to assure him that they, on behalf of the University, will accept and treasure this gift as a work of art by a great sculptor, as a deserved tribute to its President, and as an additional token of the generosity of Mr. Steele and of his loyal interest in his Alma Mater.

The President made the following announcements of attendance, gifts and bequests:

Total enrollment to date, 2,451.

At the close of the reading of the list of gifts and bequests Mr. Frederic W. Scott announced through Mr. Newcomb, Assistant to the President, a gift of $300,000 for the erection of an athletic stadium at the University of Virginia. The gifts and bequests received since the last meeting of the Board, including the gift of Mr. Scott, made a total of $921,900.

In connection with the gifts from W. A. Clark, Jr., and Mr. Frederic W. Scott, the following letters of appreciation from President Alderman are entered:

In addition to the personal letter which it has been my pleasure to write to you, The Rector and Visitors, at their meeting on April 3rd, have requested me to send you their official gratitude and appreciation of your gift of Three Hundred and Fifty Thousand Dollars for a new building for the School of Law. They direct me to assure you of their pride in this gift and of their purpose to observe its conditions and to devote it, unreservedly, to the uses for which it was given.

I may add that this letter forms a part of the records of the University upon the minutes of the Rector and Visitors.

On behalf of the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia, and at their specific direction by resolution, I have the pleasure and privilege of sending you an expression of their appreciation, in order that it may form a part of the official records of the Rector and Visitors.

It is difficult to find the words in which to make clear to you the sentiments of gratitude and appreciation felt by the Board of Visitors, and the entire University, for your gift of Three Hundred Thousand Dollars, for the purpose of building a stadium to stimulate and enrich the athletic life of the Institution. It is one of the most generous gifts, for a specific purpose, that has come to the University in its entire life. It will be held with intense pleasure and satisfaction, and I am sure I am speaking the voice of all factors in our life when I acclaim not only the generosity but the wisdom and sagacity of your gift.

The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia desire to spread upon their minutes a resolution of appreciation and gratitude to their colleague, Cyrus Harding Walker, who this evening asks to retire from the post of Rector of the University, which he has held for the past eight years.

The Rector and Visitors recall that Mr. Walker, an alumnus of the University of the year 1882, has been, for thirteen years, a member of the Board of Visitors, and it is a satisfaction to them to know that they will continue to have in their counsels the benefit of his ripe wisdom and wide knowledge of University affairs. It is their special wish to place on their official records a permanent acknowledgement of their obligations to Cyrus Harding Walker, for his efficient services as Rector, his unfailing courtesy, his sense of justice, his highminded and unselfish devotion to the interests of the University, and his far-seeing vision of the duty and destiny of his Alma Mater.

On behalf of the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia, and at their specific direction by resolution, I have the pleasure and privilege of sending you an expression of their appreciation, in order that it may form a part of the official records of the Rector and Visitors.
