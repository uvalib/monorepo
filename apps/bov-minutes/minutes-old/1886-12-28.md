At a called meeting of the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia held at the University on the 28th day of December 1886.

Present: Messrs Conrad, Payne, Marye, Martan, Randolph, W. A. Stuart, Venable and Parrish.

On motion Genl Wm H. Payne was chosen Rector, Pro Tem. who thereupon called the Board to order, in the absence of the Rector.

Resolved, that the Secretary be directed to inform the Chairman of the Faculty that the Board of Visitors have organized and are ready to receive any communication from the Faculty.

A copy of the foregoing resolution having been reported by the Secretary to the Chairman of the Faculty, the Chairman in response forwarded to the Board his report accompanied by a report from the Proctor & Superintendent of Grounds & Buildings which were received and ordered to lie for the present.

The following resolution was offered by Mr W A Stuart.

Resolved, that the Executive Committee be requested to require of the Bank, with which the College funds are now, or may hereafter be deposited a Bond with security to be approved by said Committee, and in a penalty of not less than sixty thousand Dollars, conditioned for the faithful keeping of said funds.

As a substitute for the foregoing resolution Mr Venable offered the following:

Resolved, that the First National Bank of Richmond, Va be made the depository of the funds of the University, which being put to the vote the substitute was rejected and the original resolution adopted.

A communication was received from Prof. Geo Frederick Holmes renewing a request made by him to the Executive Committee of the Board at its meeting in October last, and which was then declined, that he be authorized to draw the monthly quotas of his salary at the beginning instead of at the end of the month, at least for the months of January and February next; the same was read and considered. On motion the following was adopted:

The Board directs the Secretary of the Board to inform Prof. Holmes that they considered his application to have his salary for the months of January & February paid to him on the first day of these months, and that they are constrained by considerations of grave interests to the University to decline his request.

Resolved, that the duties of Proctor shall hereafter, as heretofore embrace the care and safekeeping of all funds and securities of the University, which may be now in his hands, or which may hereafter be received by him as Proctor.

The Bond of the Proctor dated August 4th 1886 was presented to the Board, and a question arising as to whether the duties of Proctor necessarily involved the duties of a Treasurer or Custodian of the funds of the College, the Board without deciding that question, resolved that a new bond should be given, expressing as one of the conditions thereof that the said Peyton shall faithfully keep and account for all moneys, or securities, which may come to his hands as Proctor.

Resolved further that the new bond should be made payable to the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia.

Resolved, that the Rector pro tem.be requested to transmit to Mr W. W. Corcoran, the following congratulatory telegram, over his official signature.

The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia now in Session, beg to offer their cordial congratulations upon the occurrence of your Eighty Eighth birth-day, and to join the host of admiring friends in hoping that many years of health and happiness may be added to your useful and honorable life.

Resolved, that it is the sense of this Board that the Schools of Agriculture, Zoology & Botany, Historical Science, English Language & Literature, and Modern Languages shall each be reorganized at the next annual meeting of the Board, and that the Secretary be instructed to communicate this resolution to the Professor in each of the said schools on or about the first day of May 1887.

Ordered, that the Chairman of the Executive Committee confer with Prof. Page and with the Chairman of the Faculty in regard to the matter affecting the studies of Mr Yager mentioned in the communication of Prof. Page, and take such action on the subject as he deems proper.

Resolved, that a committee of three shall be appointed by the Rector who shall consider and report at the next annual meeting a plan for reorganizing the Schools of Modern Languages, of History & Literature, of English and of Agriculture etc, and that the Committee be requested to communicate with the Miller Board and request the appointment of a Committee of that Board to confer with them as to the best plan of organizing the latter school.

The Rector appointed as the Committee of this Board under the foregoing resolution Messrs, Randolph, Conrad & Venable.

On motion Wm H. Payne was appointed Rector pro tempore with authority to perform the duties of the Rector during the absence or disability of the Rector.

Ordered, that the Board adjourn sine die.
