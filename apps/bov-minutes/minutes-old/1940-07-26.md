A Special Meeting of the Board of Visitors was held on this date at 11 o'clock in the office of the President with the Rector, R. Gray Williams and Visitors Garnett, Goolrick, Rinehart and Lewis C. Williams and President Newcomb present.

The President stated to the meeting that the University of Virginia has been requested by the Naval Research Laboratory, of Washington, to conduct certain experiments in connection with the studies of separated uranium isotopes; that he sees no reason why the work should not be done in accordance with the request of the Naval Laboratory. The Navy authorities propose to defray the cost of the necessary experiments, and will pay the sum of $13,000.00 to the University for the work, when it is completed.

Mr. Perkins then submitted to the meeting the following documents heretofore prepared by the Naval Research Laboratory and which have been submitted to the University for execution-

(1) Standard Government Form of Bid as modified for use by the Navy Department on Form 31, approved by the President June 10, 1927.

(2) Contract as modified for use by the Navy Department No. N-17-S3975, upon U. S. Standard Form No. 32 (revised) modified for use by the Navy Department May, 1938.

Mr. Perkins also presented to the Board copy of a letter written by him, under date of July 23, 1940, to Lieutenant Joel D. Parks, Navy Research Laboratory, Anacostia Station, Washington, together with a copy of Lieutenant Park's reply thereto, dated July 24, 1940, and copies of both of these letters were filed as a part of the minutes of this meeting. After some discussion of the situation, although the Board was of the opinion that the bid form and contract form submitted were not well adapted to the purposes to be accomplished, the following resolution was unanimously adopted-

RESOLVED, that Dr. J. L. Newcomb, President of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia be, and is hereby authorized, empowered and directed, in the name and on behalf of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, to execute the Standard Form of Bid, dated July 19, 1940, and the Contract on U. S. Standard Form No. 32 (revised), modified for use by the Navy Department May, 1938, dated July 22, 1940, and numbered N-17 S-3975, which bid form and contract are referred to in the preamble of this resolution, and E. I. Carruthers, Secretary of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, is hereby authorized and directed to affix the corporate seal of this Corporation to this contract, and to execute the certificate with reference to authority of the President, which appears on Page 4 of said contract.

And be it further Resolved, That Corporate Surety shall be given upon the performance bond which will be executed as a part of said contract.

The following resolution was adopted authorizing the Rector to sign applications for permits with the Alcohol Tax Unit of the Internal Revenue Service on behalf of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia:

RESOLVED, by the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that R. Gray Williams, Rector, be, and he is hereby authorized and directed to sign any and all applications for permits, reports and other papers in connection with the Alcohol Tax Unit, Internal Revenue Service, for and on behalf of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia.

The President made a verbal report on the status of flight training under the Civil Aeronautics Authority, including a suggested application to the Public Works Administration for a grant to improve the field. The President was authorized to make application to the Public Works Administration for a grant to make improvements to the flying field.

The New Buildings Committee submitted the following reports, which were read and approved:

The NEW BUILDINGS COMMITTEE met on this date at 11 o'clock in the office of the President to open bids on the furnishings for the West Wing of the Hospital. There were present Hollis Rinehart, and Lewis C. Williams of the Committee, and President Newcomb.

Following the opening of the bids and their tabulation, the following resolution was offered by Mr. Williams and adopted:

RESOLVED, by the New Buildings Committee of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the President be, and he is hereby authorized and directed to certify to the State Purchasing Agent the Committee's recommendation of the award of contracts, as follows:

BE it further RESOLVED, that in the case of bids for Nos. 2,3,7,8,9,10,20,24 and 27-b, where some of the bidders had no bids on the precise item specified, that the President be directed, after investigation, to recommend the award of these contracts to the lowest bidder in each case where the specifications have been satisfactorily met.

The Committee met on July 23, 1940 to open bids on the Internes' Quarters and of the seventeen bids submitted, that of J. F. Barbour and Sons for $67,436.00 base bid was found to be the lowest. It was apparent that this bid, together with the architects fees, incidental construction costs and furnishings would approximate $76,000, whereas the appropriation by the State for the said project was only $60,000. Awarding of the contract was, therefore, deferred until the President could interview the Governor with respect to an additional appropriation, and, in case such supplemental appropriation be secured, he was authorized to award the contract to J. F. Barbour & Sons as above stated.

At the same meeting bids were opened for the metal bookstack construction in the Clark Memorial Law Building. Five bids were submitted, the lowest of which being Snead & Co., Jersey City, N. J., at a base bid of $16,987.00. Awarding of the contract was deferred to this meeting when the whole matter might be gone into. Following a discussion of the matter the President was authorized to award the whole contract to Snead & Co. for the metal stacks and necessary construction incident to their installation, provided he was satisfied with the proposal.

The President made a verbal report on the status of his applications for a Reserve Officers Training Corps Unit and a Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps Unit. Following some discussion of the matter, the President was authorized to make application for a R. O. T. C. and a Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps units.

Mr. R. Gray Williams, Chairman of the Finance Committee, reported that Mr. James H. Scott had recommenced to the Finance Committee the purchase of $100,000 Richmond Terminal Railway Company 3-3/8% bonds, dated September 1, 1940 and maturing September 1, 1965, @ 105 and accrued interest, whereupon the following resolution was adopted:

RESOLVED, That the Finance Committee be authorized to purchase $100,000 of the Richmond Terminal Railway Company 3-3/8% bonds, dated and maturing as set forth above, at 105 and accrued interest.

Mr. Perkins stated to the Board so far as he knows there has never been a formal resolution adopted by this board authorizing either the President or Rector to execute instruments in the name of and on behalf of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia. While it is possible that this power is inherent in both of these officers, it is frequently necessary for a notary's certificate or for the certificate of the secretary to be affixed to instruments executed by the University to include a statement to the effect that the officer executing the instrument does so under express authority conferred upon him by the governing body of the corporation. On numerous occasions in the past it has been necessary for special meetings of the Board of Visitors to be called in order that such specific authority be given to the Rector or to the President. I see no reason why this condition should continue and I, therefore, respectfully request that the following resolution be adopted-

"Resolved, that the Rector and the President of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia be and each of said officers is hereby given full and complete authority to execute in the name and on behalf of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, any instrument which may hereafter require the name of this corporation to be signed thereto; and the secretary of this corporation is hereby authorized to affix the seal of this corporation to any and all such instruments and to deliver any such instrument or instruments to the party or parties entitled to receive the same."

The President then stated that pursuant to authority heretofore given him by the Board, he had entered into a contract with Virginia Cub Distributors, Inc., for the operation by said Corporation of the flying field owned by the University, and situated in Albemarle County, near Milton, said contract being dated January 31, 1940. Said contract contains the following clauses-

"(1) Before this contract shall become effective, said Operator (that is, Virginia Cub Distributors, Inc.) shall enter into a contract with the United States of America............... providing for the flight training of such students as may be assigned to it pursuant to the Civilian Pilot Training Act of 1939........."

"(13) The Contractor shall pay to the University, in consideration of the privileges granted under this contract a sum equivalent to 3.45% of all amounts received by said Contractor from the United States of America, under the provisions of said Contractor's contract aforesaid with United States of America. The amounts payable on this account by said Contractor shall be due and payable to said University as and when such amounts are received by said Contractor from the United States Government, it being understood that the total amount to be paid by the Contractor to the University on this account, during the original term of this contract, shall not be less than $150.00. and not more than $400.00."

Pursuant to said agreement, Virginia Cub Distributors, Inc., entered into a contract with the United States of America for the training of civilian pilots, dated November 25, 1938. The term of said contract has now expired and under date of June 12, 1940, said Virginia Cub Distributors, Inc., entered into a new agreement with the United States for pilot training. In view of the expiration of the original contract and execution of the new contract, it is deemed wise to amend and re-execute Paragraph (13) of the University's contract of January 31, 1940, with Virginia Cub Distributors, Inc.

Mr. Perkins then presented to the meeting the proposed amendment of said Paragraph (13) and after a discussion of the situation, the following resolution was unanimously adopted-

RESOLVED, that Dr. J. L. Newcomb, President, be and is hereby authorized, in the name and on behalf of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, to execute the amendment of Paragraph (13) of said contract between the University of Virginia and Virginia Cub Distributors, Inc., dated January 31, 1940, heretofore presented to this meeting, and that E. I. Carruthers, Secretary, be and is hereby authorized to affix the corporate seal of the University to said amendment and to attest the same, delivering a copy of said amendment to said Virginia Cub Distributors, Inc.

Furthermore, said J. L. Newcomb, President, is further authorized, in the name and on behalf of the University, to execute any extensions or amendments of and to said contract of January 31, 1940, that, in his opinion, may be proper, and to enter into any new contract with reference to the lease, operation or management of said airport or flying field that he may consider proper, and the said E. I. Carruthers, Secretary, is hereby authorized to affix the corporate seal of the University to any instrument so executed and approved by said J. L. Newcomb, President, and to attest and deliver the same.

The meeting then adjourned.
