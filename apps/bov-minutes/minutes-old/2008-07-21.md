**WHEREAS, 20 U.S.C. § 1232g, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, generally defines “dependent student,” consistent with the Internal Revenue Code, as a student who does not provide over one-half of his/her own support for the calendar year in which the taxable year of the taxpayer begins; and**

**WHEREAS, the HB 1058 requires that the governing boards of each institution establish the policies and procedures necessary to comply with the legislation;**

**1\. The University’s Department of Information Technology and Communication shall electronically solicit dependency status from all incoming and returning students and shall store such data on the University’s central student system of record.**

**2\. A parent also may provide his/her tax records to the University to demonstrate a student’s dependent status to ensure that such status is accurately recorded in the central student system of record.**

**3\. The University’s Executive Vice President and Provost shall designate the office under his/her jurisdiction to be primarily responsible for collecting and responding to requests from parents of dependent students for academic records.**

**4\. The University’s Vice President and Chief Student Affairs Officer shall designate the office under his/her jurisdiction to be primarily responsible for collecting and responding to requests from parents of dependent students for non-academic records.**

**5\. Appropriate personnel in these offices shall consult the University’s central student system of record to confirm a student’s dependent status prior to furnishing educational records to parents under this policy.**

**6\. The foregoing is subject at all times to the authority and direction of the University officials charged hereunder to develop and implement specific procedures as may be desirable or necessary, including designating other University offices or personnel to respond to requests for records under this policy, as may be necessary or appropriate under the circumstances.**

**SUBJECT TO**

**THE APPROVAL**

**OF THE BOARD**

**OF VISITORS**

**June 13, 2008**

**The Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia convened in Open Session at 12:45 p.m., Thursday, June 12, 2008, in the Board Room of the Rotunda; W. Heywood Fralin, Rector, presided.**

**Daniel R. Abramson, A. Macdonald Caputo, The Hon. Alan A. Diamonstein, Ms. Susan Y. Dorsey, G. Slaughter Fitz-Hugh, Jr., Ms. Glynn D. Key, Austin Ligon, Vincent J. Mastracco, Jr., The Hon. Lewis F. Payne, Don R. Pippin, Warren M. Thompson, E. Darracott Vaughan, Jr., M.D., John O. Wynne, and Ms. Adom Getachew were present.**

**Present as well were John T. Casteen, III, Leonard W. Sandridge, Alexander G. Gilliam, Jr., Paul J. Forch, Arthur Garson, Jr., M.D., William B. Harvey, James L. Hilton, Sharon L. Hostler, M.D., R. Edward Howell, Ms. Colette Sheehy, David J. Prior, Craig K. Littlepage, and Ms. Jeanne Flippo Bailes.**

**Edmund W. Kitch, Chair of the Faculty Senate, was present as well.**

**At the Rector’s request, Mr. Caputo led the Board in the Pledge of Allegiance.**

**Approval of the Minutes of the Board Meeting of April 10-12**

**On motion, the Board approved the Minutes of the last meeting of the full Board, held April 10-12.**

**Election of the Executive Committee and Appointment of the Standing Committees**

**The Rector reminded the Board that this is the stated Annual Meeting, at which several things are done. Among these are the election of the Executive Committee and the appointment of the Standing Committees of the Board. Because a successor to Mr. Rainey has not yet been appointed, and thus, technically, he continues in office until replaced, the Rector said he would delay nominating a slate for the Executive Committee and would not appoint Standing Committees for the time being.**

**Thus, the Executive Committee and the Standing Committees continue in place as presently constituted.**

**Extension of the Special Committees**

**The Board _Manual_ specifies that all special and _ad-hoc_ committees of the Board be extended – if they are to be continued – each year at the Annual Meeting. Accordingly, the Rector asked for motions to approve resolutions extending the various special committees as follows:**

**Extension of the Special Committee on Diversity, the Special Committee on Foundations, and the Special Committee on Planning**

**The following resolution was approved:**

**WHEREAS, the Manual of the Board of Visitors specifies that Special Committees of the Board be extended each year at the Annual Meeting;**

**RESOLVED, the Special Committee on Diversity, the Special Committee on Foundations, and the Special Committee on Planning are extended to the Annual meeting of 2009.**

**Extension of the Subcommittee on Legislative and Executive Affairs**

**Similarly, the Subcommittee on Legislative and Executive Affairs must be extended at the Annual Meeting. The Rector proposed the following resolution, which was approved:**

**WHEREAS, the _Manual_ of the Board of Visitors specifies that special committees of the Board be extended each year at the Annual Meeting;**

**RESOLVED, the Subcommittee on Legislative and Executive Affairs is extended to the Annual Meeting of 2009.**

**Extension of the Transition Committee and the Committee to Study the Election and Terms of Office of the Rector and the Vice Rector**

**The Rector reminded the Board that at the April meeting, he had appointed two _ad-hoc_ committees, one to consider the transition of key members of the University Administration, and the other to study the election and terms of office of the Rector and the Vice-Rector. The latter committee was charged, too, to identify appropriate occasions when former Members of the Board might be invited back to the University by the sitting Board.**

**These two committees are expected to finish their work and report back to the Board in the fall; nonetheless, they must be renewed at the Annual Meeting in the same way that other Special Committees of the Board are extended. Rather than extend them to the next Annual Meeting, he proposed a resolution extending them to the completion of their work.**

**The Board approved the following resolution:**

**WHEREAS, the _Manual_ of the Board of Visitors specifies that special committees of the Board be extended each year at the Annual Meeting;**

**RESOLVED, the Transition Committee and the Committee to Study the Election and Terms of Office of the Rector and Vice Rector are extended until they complete their assigned work, which will be at a date before the Annual Meeting of 2009. On completion of their work, they will be disbanded.**

**Setting of the Date of the 2009 Annual Meeting**

**The date of the next year’s Annual Meeting is customarily set at the Annual Meeting. For some years, the Board meeting held in late May or early June has been the designated Annual Meeting, though neither the _Manual_ nor the _Code of Virginia_ specify a time – only that there be an Annual Meeting.**

**The Rector pointed out that the General Assembly, at its recent Session, changed the appointment date of Board Members from March 1, to July 1. The Annual Meeting in June thus becomes a kind of “lame ducks’” meeting. The Rector proposed, therefore, that the 2009 Annual Meeting be held in the fall of 2009, on a date that has not yet been determined.**

**The Board adopted the following resolution stating that the first meeting of the Board of Visitors to be held in the fall of 2009 will be designated the 2009 Annual Meeting:**

**RESOLVED, the first meeting of the Board of Visitors in the Fall of 2009 will be designated the 2009 Annual Meeting of the Board.**

**Setting of the Dates of the 2009 and 2010 Meetings of the Board**

**Scheduling conflicts have arisen on several of the dates proposed for the meetings of the Board in 2010 and the second half of 2009 – dates which customarily would be set at this Annual Meeting. The Rector directed the Board Office to poll Members and the President again for new dates so that the meeting schedule may be set at the Retreat in July.**

**Re-Appointment of Randy J. Koporc to the Medical Center Operating Board**

**Mr. Randy J. Koporc of Charlottesville, a citizen Member of the Medical Center Operating Board, is completing his first four-year term on that Board, a term which will expire on June 30th. The Rector proposed the following resolution re-appointing for a second term of four years:**

**WHEREAS, the Board of Visitors may appoint up to five public members of the Medical Center Operating Board, with initial terms not to exceed four years and eligibility for reappointment for an additional term; and**

**WHEREAS, the term of Mr. Randy J. Koporc expires June 30, 2008, and the Board of Visitors desires to reappoint Mr. Koporc to serve an additional four year term;**

**RESOLVED, Mr. Randy J. Koporc is re-appointed to the Medical Center Operating Board as a public member for the period July 1, 2008 through June 30, 2012.**

**Approval to Consider Addenda to the Published Agenda**

**The Board _Manual_ specifies that additions to the published Agenda of a Board meeting may be considered if a majority of the Board so approves. The Rector asked for a motion to approve consideration of addenda. The Board adopted the following resolution:**

**RESOLVED, the Board of Visitors approves the consideration of addenda to the published Agenda.**

**NCAA Orientation**

**The Board has an annual orientation on the NCAA rules governing the conduct of Board Members on Athletic questions. Mr. Steve Flippen, Director of Compliance in the Department of Athletics, conducted the orientation.**

**The Rector then asked the President to give his customary report.**

**President’s Report**

**The President announced two appointments – Vice President and Dean of the School of Medicine, and Vice President for Research.**

**President’s Report – Appointment of Dr. DeKosky**

**The new Vice President and Dean of the School of Medicine will be Dr. Steven DeKosky, whose appointment will take effect on August 1st. He will succeed Dr. Sharon Hostler, who has been Interim Vice President and Dean for the last year. An authority on Alzheimer’s Disease, Dr. DeKosky is Professor and Chair of the Department of Neurology and Director of the Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center at the University of Pittsburgh. He took an A.B. from Bucknell University and the M.D. from the University of Florida, and his first academic appointment was in the Neurology Department of the School of Medicine in 1979.**

**President’s Report – Appointment of Mr. Skalak**

**The President next announced the appointment of Mr. Thomas Skalak as Vice President for Research, also effective August 1st. Mr. Skalak is Professor and Chair of Biomedical Engineering in the School of Engineering and has been a member of the faculty since 1986. He took a bachelor’s degree from Johns Hopkins University and the Ph.D. from the University of California at San Diego. He is an authority on micro-vascular structure and function, and is a respected teacher and researcher.**

**Mr. Skalak replaces Dr. Ariel Gomez, who is returning to full-time teaching and research in the School of Medicine.**

**The President noted that Dr. DeKosky and Mr. Skalak would address the Educational Policy Committee later in the day.**

**President’s Report - Reunions**

**The President went on to report briefly on Reunions, which had taken place the weekend before. He said 3853 people attended, of whom 2525 were alumni – the remainder being family and friends.**

**President’s Report – Deaths of William C. Battle and George Garrett**

**The President noted the deaths of William C. Battle and George Garrett.**

**Mr. Battle, who died on May 31st, was an alumnus of the College and the Law School, a former Member of the Board of Visitors, and most recently the Chair of the Ivy Foundation, which has been a generous supporter of the School of Medicine and the Hospital. He was Ambassador to Australia under President Kennedy, a candidate for Governor in 1969, and CEO of Fieldcrest Mills for a number of years.**

**Mr. Garrett died on May 25th. A superb writer and teacher, he first taught at the University in the 1960s and returned in 1984 to direct the writing program until his retirement in 2000. The President pointed out that Mr. Garrett not only excelled as a writer in every major genre of American literature – novels, poems, and essays – he was a compassionate mentor of young writing students.**

**Mr. Battle and Mr. Garrett, the President said, “were rare and wonderful men – elegant, intelligent, and compassionate.”**

**President’s Report: Gifts and Grants**

**The President reported that philanthropic giving to the University and its related foundations was $241.3million for the fiscal year through April 30th, which is a decrease of $7.7million, or 3.1% over the same period last year.**

**Nevertheless, the Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy, Athletics, The University of Virginia’s College at Wise, the Miller Center, and the University Library all report increases in giving.**

**He reported several significant gifts since the last meeting of the Board: $4million from the estate of Robert C. Hancock to the College at Wise; $2million from the Wallace Foundation for an Executive Leadership Program, to be split equally between the Curry School and the Darden School; a deferred gift of $1.5million to the Law School from Mr. John G. Odom; a gift in kind of sixteen pieces of Aboriginal art from Mr. John W. Kluge and J.W.K. Properties, Inc. to the Kluge-Ruhe Aboriginal Art Collection; $1,203,000 from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to the University Library; $1,034,506.04 to the Medical School from Mrs. Miriam W. Burnett and Mr. Charles R. Burnett, III; $1million from the Wallace H. Coulter Foundation to support translational research.**

**Among significant pledges were $1million to the Jefferson Scholars Foundation for the Jefferson Scholars Anonymous – Hartfield Prize Fund; an anonymous pledge of $750,000 to the Jefferson Scholars Foundation for the Anonymous Rhode Island Jefferson Scholars Fund; and $700,000 to the College Foundation, to be used by the Biology Department for Alzheimer’s Disease research.**

**On motion, the Board accepted the Gifts and Grants Report.**

**\- - - - - - - - - - - -**

**The Board recessed at 1:20 p.m., to go into Committee meetings.**

**Friday, June 13th**

**Committee of the Whole**

**At 11:30 a.m., the Board convened, in Open Session, as a Committee of the Whole with the Rector presiding. All Members who attended the Preliminary Meeting the day before, save Mr. Diamonstein, were present; Mr. Farrell, in addition, was present.**

**Committee of the Whole: Human Resources Restructuring**

**The Board heard a presentation from Ms. Susan Carkeek, Vice President and Chief Human Resource Officer, on a proposed new University staff Human Resources system. The new system, which does not apply to employees of the Medical Center, is a result of the “Restructured Higher Education Financial and Administrative Operations Act,” and the subsequent management agreement between the University and the Commonwealth.**

**On motion, the Board adopted the following resolution approving the proposed policies:**

**ADOPTION OF HUMAN RESOURCE POLICIES GOVERNING UNIVERSITY STAFF UNDER HIGHER EDUCATION RESTRUCTURING**

**WHEREAS, the Restructured Higher Education Financial and Administrative Operations Act provided level three institutions with an opportunity to develop a new human resources system for University staff, the designation of non-faculty employees hired on or after July 1, 2006; and**

**WHEREAS, the Management Agreement entered into by the University and the Commonwealth pursuant to the Restructured Higher Education Financial and Administrative Operations Act, authorizes the President, acting through the Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, in consultation with the Executive Vice President and Provost, to adopt and implement new human resources systems for employees of the Academic Division and the University’s College at Wise, and**

**WHEREAS, the Management Agreement continues the existing human resources system for Medical Center employees previously authorized by the Board in 1996; and**

**WHEREAS, the University is committed to creating a human resources system for University employees designed to recruit, develop, and competitively compensate a superior workforce better prepared to meet the future needs of the University; and**

**WHEREAS, the human resource system for University employees may include different provisions for reasonably different groups or classifications of employees; and**

**WHEREAS, the University established a process that provided for broad input from employees and their supervisors in the design of the new human resources system; and the recommended policies address the most significant findings from these efforts; and**

**WHEREAS, the University is currently engaged in an open comment period on the proposed policies; and any material policy changes resulting from this input will be subject to approval of the Board of Visitors or its Executive Committee; and**

**WHEREAS, with the approval of these policies effective October 1, 2008, the University will commence the 90-day enrollment period during which classified staff and administrative and professional faculty may elect to participate in and be governed by the human resources system established for University staff; and the new human resource system for University staff will be implemented on January 1, 2009;**

**RESOLVED, the proposed human resources policies for University staff, as described below, is adopted by the Board of Visitors to be implemented January 1, 2009.**

**Proposed policies:**

**The University will adopt an employee career development policy that provides for career development opportunities and the support necessary for them, subject to available funding and applicable policies. The career development policy shall include career paths to provide for planned progression, job enrichment opportunities, and ongoing education and training. These policies shall be tightly linked with those policies for performance planning and evaluation, and compensation.**

**The University will adopt a new compensation policy for university staff based on market-relevant salary ranges, replacing the current salary and job classification structure. The compensation policy will allow for differentiation in pay increases based on individual performance and employee development and will be administered in accordance with the Compensation Plan for University Staff to be approved by the Board of Visitors.**

**The University will adopt performance management policy to help managers and employees establish performance goals that are strategically aligned, as well as career development goals. The policy will provide the opportunity for interim reviews to track**

**employee progress. The performance evaluation policy will include a new rating scale; evaluation of performance goals, employee competencies, and career goals; and opportunities for coaching and for multiple sources of feedback.**

**The University will adopt a leave program that provides employees accrued leave benefits and changes the current leave structure for University staff to allow for cash-out of annual leave in excess of the maximum carry-over amount, as well as an initial leave allocation for new employees and those transferring within the University. In addition, the University will continue to explore ways to simplify the current leave program.**

**The University will adopt benefit provisions for University staff that include the following. (1) The University will provide optional retirement plan benefits to eligible University staff. (2) The University will offer part-time salaried University staff a partial employer subsidy toward the cost of health insurance. (3) The University will adopt a supplemental benefit credit, targeted to lower salaried employees. Eligible employees would receive a fixed dollar credit to help offset the cost of benefit deductions.**

**Except for the changes outlined above, other benefit provisions, including health insurance, retirement, and associated life and disability insurance benefits are unchanged by this resolution.**

**The University will adopt the current terms and conditions of employment for University staff, including progressive discipline and due process as found in the current Standards of Conduct and Layoff & Severance policies, with the exception that layoff notification for University staff will be increased to sixty days. These terms and conditions will not be applicable to employees in senior administration and coaching positions, which will continue to be covered by contractual provisions. The University will also adopt enhanced provisions for dispute resolution, and for flexible working arrangements including telecommuting and alternate work schedules.**

**In accordance with the Management Agreement entered into by the University and the Commonwealth pursuant to the Act, future material changes to policies for compensation, benefits or severance will be subject to approval by the Board of Visitors; and**

**RESOLVED FURTHER, the University is committed to providing effective, accessible, and ongoing training for managers and employees on the new human resources system to support successful implementation of these policies; and**

**RESOLVED FURTHER, any material changes resulting from input provided during the open comment period will be subject to the approval of the Board of Visitors or its Executive Committee; and**

**RESOLVED FURTHER, the authority to approve policies for University staff consistent with the statements above, and to engage in further delegation of authority for their oversight and implementation, be delegated to the President, acting through the Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, in consultation with the Executive Vice President and Provost.**

**Committee of the Whole: Plan for a Focused Ultrasound Program**

**Mr. Sandridge and Dr. Garson gave a presentation on the development of a focused ultrasound program, for which the Commonwealth has designated $4million from the Higher Education Equipment Trust Fund. In addition to these funds, another $4million will come from an external foundation, the Focused Ultrasound Foundation, and $680,000 will come from this Foundation, the School of Medicine, and the Medical Center.**

**On motion, the Board adopted the following resolution approving the proposed plan for the development of a focused ultrasound program:**

**(Ms. Key recused herself from voting on this resolution.)**

**APPROVAL OF THE PLAN TO DEVELOP A FOCUSED ULTRASOUND PROGRAM AT THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA, THE FINANCIAL PLAN FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE FOCUSED ULTRASOUND FACILITY, AND THE ADDITION OF THE FOCUSED ULTRASOUND FACILITY TO THE UNIVERSITY’S MAJOR CAPITAL PROJECTS PROGRAM**

**RESOLVED, the Board of Visitors approves the capital and operating plan for the development of a Focused Ultrasound Program at the University of Virginia as outlined in Attachment D; and**

**RESOLVED FURTHER, the Board of Visitors deems the financial plan for the Construction of the Focused Ultrasound Facility to be reasonable and complete, and approves it; and**

**RESOLVED FURTHER, the Construction of the Focused Ultrasound Facility, at an estimated cost of $1.3 million, is approved as an addition to the University’s Major Capital Projects Program; and**

**RESOLVED FURTHER, for each of the next three years, the Executive Vice President and Provost and the Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer shall provide a written annual report to the Board of Visitors describing progress in developing this program.**

**\- - - - - - - - - - - -**

**The meeting was recessed at 12:05 p.m., and the Board adjourned to the Lower West Oval Room of the Rotunda for a lunch in honor of staff members of the University and The University of Virginia’s College at Wise who received this year’s Outstanding Service Awards.**

**The Board resumed Committee meetings after lunch.**

**Executive Session**

**After adopting the following motions, the Board went into Executive Session at 1:45 p.m., in the Board Room of the Rotunda, the Rector presiding:**

**That the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia convene in Closed Session for the purpose of discussing and/or approving personnel actions involving the appointment, reappointment, nomination, evaluation, performance, compensation, and resignation of specific University officers and employees, as provided for in Section 2.2-3711 (A) (1) of the Code of Virginia.**

**That the Board of Visitors go into Closed Session to consult with General Counsel regarding his privileged legal report to the Board on pending litigation affecting the University; also to discuss the privileged opinion of legal counsel concerning the legality of policies governing the University-Related foundations and the existing and proposed agreements with related foundations coordinating gift development and University services, as permitted by Section 2.2-3711 (A) (7) and (8) and (29)  of the Code of Virginia.**

**\- - - - - - - - -**

**The Board resumed its meeting in Open Session at 2:25 p.m., and adopted the following resolution certifying that its discussions in Executive Session had been conducted in accord with the exemptions permitted by the Virginia Freedom of Information Act:**

That we vote on and record our certification that, to the best of each Board member’s knowledge, only public business matters lawfully exempted from open meeting requirements and which were identified in the motion(s) authorizing the closed session, were heard, discussed or considered in closed session.

*   \- - - - - - - -

**The Board then recessed as the full Board and resumed Committee meetings.**

**\- - - - - - - - - -**

**Final Session**

**The Board resumed its meeting as the full Board, in Open Session, at 3:15 p.m., in the Board Room of the Rotunda, the Rector presiding, and adopted the following resolutions:**

**APPROVAL TO GRANT TEMPORARY AND PERMANENT EASEMENTS AND TO ENTER INTO PERMANENT RECIPROCAL PARKING AGREEMENTS FOR IVY ROAD FACILITIES**

**(approved by the Buildings and Grounds Committee on June 13,**

**(2008-2009 PRATT FUND**

**ALLOCATIONS)**

ATTACHMENT C

**2008-2009 PRATT FUND ALLOCATIONS**

**ARTS AND SCIENCES — $3,400,000**

**_Biology_ - The department proposes to allocate $218,520 for graduate fellowships in 2008-2009. Of this amount, $133,698 will be used to provide full support to two outstanding first year graduate students in Biology, and to augment the fellowship packages of five President's Fellows. The remaining $84,822 will be allocated to satisfy the department’s membership in the Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program, an important interschool collaborative effort. Biology proposes to use $31,480 in Pratt funds to augment the salaries of the Director and Associate Director of the Mountain Lake Biological Station. The University has made and continues to make significant investments in the instructional and research capacity of this Appalachian mountain field research and teaching facility which provides summer courses, a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program and hosts researchers from around the world every summer.**

**_Chemistry_ - The department proposes to allocate $100,000 for Undergraduate Summer Fellowships. Funds will be used to provide stipends, health insurance and tuition for a selected group of outstanding graduate students. In addition, these funds will help to maintain a strong summer research program for Chemistry undergraduates. This summer research experience is a component of the research program required for the department's Distinguished Majors Program. The department requests that $60,000 be allocated to provide faculty summer wages to support new faculty (J. Chruma, B. Venton, L. Columbus, C. Mura, and T. Gunnoe) and to support faculty engaged in innovative curriculum development projects. The department proposes to allocate $90,000 for equipment, both for start ups and for new faculty, retention commitments, and cost share commitments on grants.**

**_Mathematics_ - The department requests $118,690 to support its Whyburn Postdoctoral Fellowship program. Internationally recognized for its excellence, this competitive fellowship program brings new Ph.D. recipients in mathematics for three years of teaching and research. The department also requests $21,310 for summer wages for new Assistant Professors T. Melcher and H. Gromoll. Finally, the department requests that $10,000 be allocated for equipment purchases.**

**_Physics_ \- The department proposes to allocate $33,527 to provide summer support for new faculty members K. Paschke, X. Zheng, A. Lamacraft, and D. Vaman. The department proposes to allocate $216,473 in fellowship support to six outstanding students. Attracting the most highly qualified science graduate students requires that we offer competitive fellowships and the Pratt funds are crucial to the recruitment effort.**

**_New Faculty Start-up Fund_ – A total of $2,500,000 is requested by the College to use as components of start-up packages associated with new hires, some of which are still being negotiated, for costs share on grants and other opportunities that may arise in the coming year and for other strategic needs in building the programs in these four departments. It is estimated that this funding will be equally split between equipment, faculty salaries, and fellowships. This $2,500,000 is comprised of a $400,000 reserve managed by the dean; a previously approved annual $500,000 distribution to a New Faculty Start-Up Fund managed by the Executive Vice President and Provost, and an additional $1,600,000 to this fund. This reserve – which will be carefully allocated in accordance with the terms of Mr. Pratt’s will – is critical in the recruitment of faculty members in biology, chemistry, mathematics, and physics.**

**SCHOOL OF MEDICINE — $6,435,000**

_Support and Training of Student Researchers - $293,175 -_ Graduate students and post-doctoral fellows are central to a successful biomedical research program. A modest institutional share from the Pratt bequest supplements funds from federal government training programs and charitable foundations to attract superlative students. These individuals are critical to enhancing the quality of research in the Ph.D. and M.D./Ph.D. programs at the University. The success of these programs has a direct impact on the quality of faculty research at the School of Medicine.
=======================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

_Core Facility Support - $1,039,450 -_ Core facilities – including, but not limited to, the Small Animal Multimodality Imaging Core, Advanced Microscopy Facility, Tissue Culture Facility, and Biomolecular Research Facility – provide access to large, expensive equipment and techniques that otherwise would not be available or cost-effective to individual investigators. They also offer techniques and technologies allowing investigators to move into new, cutting-edge areas of research. Each core serves investigators from a diverse group of departments and centers. These facilities operate on a fee-for-service basis, and, after development costs and other expenses, average a cost recovery of 60-80 percent, with the differential funded by Pratt allocations. These resources provide a competitive advantage to the University’s research programs, provide flexibility to acquire emerging technologies, and are critical to the School of Medicine’s success in recruitment and retention and its ability to continue to grow its externally-funded research programs.

_Vivarium Equipment - $135,000 –_ A one-time additional allocation to purchase equipment for the vivarium in the newly occupied Sheridan G. Snyder Translational Research Building.
===================================================================================================================================================================================

_The Decade Plan - $5,000,000 -_ The School of Medicine proposes a special distribution to continue implementation of the Decade Plan. The funds will be used to retain and recruit outstanding faculty in the basic medical sciences, through laboratory start-up packages, develop new interdisciplinary research centers, and acquisition of equipment for animal research in two new vivaria.

**AT THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA**

**PLAN FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A FOCUSED ULTRASOUND PROGRAM**

**AT THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA**

**The Focused Ultrasound program will be facilitated by the investments provided by the Commonwealth and the Focused Ultrasound Foundation (FUSF). The funds will provide the necessary infrastructure to allow clinical and translational research as well as leverage the provision of clinical procedures as they are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.**

**_Initial Investment_**

**The initial investment will be roughly $8.7 million and will be provided as follows:**

*   **$4.0 million allocated by the Commonwealth - $1.0 million for the modular facility and $3.0 million in Ultrasound equipment;**
*   **$4.0 million from an external foundation, Focused Ultrasound Foundation (FUSF) - $2.5 million for a consigned MRI for 5 years and $1.5 million in operating cash; and**
*   **$0.680 million to be shared by the School of Medicine, Medical Center, and FUSF for facility and other contingencies not provided in the sources above.**

**_Operational Plan_**

**The assumptions used in the model are all based on conservative estimates for both revenues and expenses. We have worked to limit the future risk to the University by using the external funding for the fixed expenses. To the degree that revenue assumptions are not accomplished, the expenses associated with this endeavor will not be incurred. Aside from the initial investment – all expenses are variable. Even the maintenance contract is considered to be a long-term variable expense.**

**As a result, the University and its faculty have an ideal opportunity for a research operation with a strong upside and limited risk exposure.**

**Year One: We plan to initiate research and trials in the areas of fibroids, breast cancer, palliative bone, and the brain. Research funding is assumed to come from the National Institutes of Health, the ultrasound equipment manufacturers, and the FUSF. In addition, we estimate that we will provide 25 uterine fibroid ablations that will be reimbursed by commercial insurance**

**payers. Revenues from these activities will be $403,225. Aside from the research support, an additional $500,000 will be provided by the FUSF for operational cash needs, resulting in a total of $903,225. Expenses in the first year $436,099 and are made up entirely of variable costs associated with the projected research and procedures.**

**Year Two: We plan to continue the studies above and add research in the areas of the liver and prostate. Procedures in all areas grow and the estimated revenues from those procedures will increase from $403,225 to $736,450. Total revenues, including the FUSF support, will grow to $1,236,450. Variable expenses also grow with the increased procedures and in Year Two the maintenance contracts on the equipment ($420,000/year) begin. Total expenses will increase from $436,099 to $1,222,977.**

**Year Three: Research and clinical volumes continue to increase and research involving kidneys is projected to begin. In order to avoid being overly optimistic, we have assumed that one of the clinical trials areas stops. Total revenues are estimated to increase from $1,236,450 to $1,329,675. Expenses grow at a commensurate rate, increasing from $1,222,977 to $1,333,732.**

**Years Four and Five: While we have projected changes in the mix of services, we have not projected growth in total procedure volumes. The major change that occurs in Year Four is that the $500,000 annual commitment from the FUSF will be complete and the program will depend upon reserve cash (from the Year One surplus) and competitive educational and research awards to replace the operating cash commitment.**
