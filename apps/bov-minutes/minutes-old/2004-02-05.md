TENTATIVE MINUTES SUBJECT TO THE APPROVAL OF THE BOARD OF VISITORS February 6-7, 2004
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia met, in Open Session, at 10:15 a.m., Friday, February 6, 2004, in the East Oval Room of the Rotunda; Gordon F. Rainey, Jr., Rector, presided. Thomas F. Farrell, II, Vice Rector, Thomas J. Bliley, Jr., William G. Crutchfield, Jr., Ms. Susan Y. Dorsey, Charles L. Glazer, William H. Goodwin, Jr., Mark J. Kington, Lewis F. Payne, Terence P. Ross, Thomas A. Saunders, III, Warren M. Thompson, E. Darracott Vaughan, Jr., M.D., Ms. Georgia M. Willis, John O. Wynne, and John R.M. Rodney were present.

Present as well were John T. Casteen, III, Leonard W. Sandridge, Alexander G. Gilliam, Jr., Paul J. Forch, Gene D. Block, Arthur Garson, Jr., M.D., R. Edward Howell, Ms. Colette Sheehy, Ms. Patricia M. Lampkin, Robert E. Reynolds, M.D., Ms. Yoke San Reynolds, R. Ariel Gomez, M.D., William W. Harmon, and Ms. Jeanne Flippo Bailes.

CALL TO ORDER AND PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE
--------------------------------------

The Rector called the meeting to order and asked Mr. Glazer to lead the Board in the Pledge of Allegiance.

APPROVAL OF THE MINUTES OF THE OCTOBER MEETING
----------------------------------------------

The Rector asked for a motion to approve the Minutes of the October 3-4 meeting of the Board. The motion was made, seconded and approved.

RESOLUTION FOR ADDITIONS TO THE AGENDA
--------------------------------------

The Manual of the Board of Visitors specifies that "walk- on" items, which is to say items proposed for consideration after the Agenda is published, must be put to the vote of the full Board before they can be considered; two-thirds of the Members present must approve these additions to the Agenda before they can be considered. The Rector asked for a motion to consider two items, one from the Finance Committee and the other a matter to be considered by the full Board in the final session of the Board meeting.

The necessary approval was voted by the Board.

RESOLUTION FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ACCESS UVA
------------------------------------------

The Board approved the addition to the Agenda from the Finance Committee, a resolution authorizing Access UVa, a new concept in student financial aid. The President subsequently that morning announced the plan at a press conference in the Dome Room of the Rotunda.

WHEREAS, need-blind admissions for undergraduate applicants and need-based aid for admitted undergraduate students help ensure access to and affordability of education at the University, regardless of a student's financial circumstances; and

WHEREAS, the continued deterioration of funding from the Commonwealth of Virginia will cause an erosion of the quality of the University's academic program unless there is an increase in other sources of revenue including tuition; and

WHEREAS, artificially restraining tuition below cost results in a financial subsidy for every student regardless of need; and

WHEREAS, the University seeks to ensure access and affordability to students who cannot afford the price of an education by providing financial aid rather than by artificially depressing tuition; and

WHEREAS, the University seeks to attract, enroll and graduate a socio-economically diverse student body; and

WHEREAS, since 1985, the University has offered financial aid in the form of grants, loans and work-study to meet 100 percent of financial need for high-need students; and

WHEREAS, in 2001 the University began to phase-in a program to offer financial aid to meet 100 percent of demonstrated financial need for all qualified undergraduate students by the fall of 2004; and

WHEREAS, students graduating with a high level of indebtedness may be limited in their career and advanced education choices upon graduation;

RESOLVED that the Board of Visitors authorizes the implementation of Access UVa, consisting of the following four components to the University's financial aid program:

RESOLVED FURTHER that it is the intent of the Board to allocate tuition and private funds for this purpose, that such allocation will be considered as part of the annual budget process, and that the Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer will include in the 2004-2005 operating budget a plan to fund the first component of Access UVa.

PRESIDENT'S REPORTREPORT OF GIFTS AND GRANTS
--------------------------------------------

The President gave his customary report.

The majority of the report was a summary of legislation of interest to the University pending in the General Assembly. Of these bills, perhaps the most significant are House Bill 1359 and Senate Bill 638, the so-called "charter agreement" involving the University, Virginia Tech and the College of William and Mary. Both bills have been carried over to the next Session of the General Assembly.

The President reported that in the current Fiscal Year, through November 30, 2003, private gifts to the University and its related foundations amount to $48million, down substantially from $140million for the same period last year. Last year and in previous years, the figures were high because of significant "8-figure" commitments.

Nonetheless, both the College of Arts & Sciences and The University of Virginia's College at Wise report substantial increases in giving.

Among the significant gifts received between July 1 and November 30, are $1.5million in pledge payments from the Community Foundation to The University of Virginia's College at Wise for the football stadium and to the University for the new Marching Band. Mr. Carl W. Smith and Mrs. Hunter J. Smith are associated with these payments.

The Smiths have also pledged $12million to the University for the Performing Arts Center.

Mr. James Edward Manley pledged $3.5million to The College Foundation for the South Lawn Project and the Victor Elmaleh Foundation $1.2million to the School of Architecture for the Campbell Hall additions. Mr. Elmaleh and Mrs. Sono Elmaleh are associated with this latter pledge.

RESOLUTION ON GIFTS AND GRANTS
------------------------------

On motion, the Board adopted a resolution accepting the President's Report on Gifts and Grants.

RESOLVED, the Report of the President on gifts and grants received by the University and its related foundations during the period July 1 â€“ November 30, 2003, is accepted.

Committee Reports
-----------------

At ll:00 a.m., the Board began hearing reports from each of its Committees. These reports are part of the individual Committee Minutes. The reports continued until 11:45 a.m., when the Board recessed for lunch.

VISIT BY THE AUDITOR OF PUBLIC ACCOUNTS
---------------------------------------

The Auditor of Public Accounts of the Commonwealth, Mr. Walter Kucharski, attended the meeting of the Audit and Compliance Committee on February 6th. The Auditor normally visits the University at the Winter Board meeting to report to the Board on his findings in the annual Audit of the University. His report is summarized in the Minutes of the Audit and Compliance Committee.

EXECUTIVE SESSION
-----------------

The Board resumed its meeting at 1:00 p.m., and after adopting the following motions, went into Executive Session:

That the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia go into Executive Session for the purpose of discussing personnel matters pertaining to the appointment, assignment, reappointment, promotion, performance, compensation, discipline, separation and resignation of specific employees of the University of Virginia; as provided for in Section 2.2-3711 (A) (1) of the Code of Virginia.

That the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia go into Executive Session to consider the appointment of a student member to the Board of Visitors in accordance with Section 2.2-3711 (A)(1) of the Code of Virginia.

That the Board of Visitors go into Executive Session to discuss fund-raising and a specific gift with the University's General Counsel, as provided for in Section 2.2-3711 (A) (7) and (8) of the Code of Virginia.

The Board resumed in Open Session at 3:55 p.m., and after adopting the following resolution certifying that its discussions in Executive Session had been conducted in accord with the exemptions permitted by the Virginia Freedom of Information Act, recessed to move its meeting to the Dome Room of the Rotunda:

Mr. Rector, I move that we vote on and record our certification that, to the best of each Board member's knowledge, only public business matters lawfully exempted from open meeting requirements and which were identified in the motion(s) authorizing the closed session, were heard, discussed or considered in closed session.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The President then reported on the following two namings:

The di Benedetto Library is the departmental library of the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation in the School of Medicine. It was named at the request of the Department for Margarete di Benedetto, M.D., who retired on November 26th. Dr. di Benedetto, who has been nationally recognized for her work in electrodiagnosis, was recruited in 1989 from the Walter Reed Army Medical Center to serve as the first Chair of the newly established Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation. She is also the first woman Chair of any department in the Medical School. Dr. di Benedetto retired as Chair in 1995 but continued to teach and conduct research until her retirement last fall.

The Neonatal Intensive Care Unit in the Children's Medical Center has been renovated recently. At the request of the Health System, the Names Committee approved the naming of the Family Education Room in the renovated unit; the Room is to be known as the Sarah Du Bose Fund Family Education Room.

Sarah Du Bose was born at the University Hospital on February 2, 1994; she was 14 weeks early and weighed less than three pounds. She spent almost four months in the Newborn Intensive Care Unit at the Children's Medical Center and received care that her parents believe saved her life. She is now a happy and healthy ten-year old. Her parents, Sally and Charles Du Bose of Charlottesville, established the Sarah Du Bose Fund to provide support for the Children's Medical Center.

Mr. and Mrs. Du Bose have given generously of their time and resources to the Children's Medical Center and have organized a community effort, an effort which includes students at the University, to raise money for the Sarah Du Bose Fund. The naming of the Family Education Room honors the contributions the Fund has made to the support of the Children's Medical Center.

The Board adjourned at 4:25 p.m.

ATTACHMENT ASTUDENT ACTIVITY FEE STATEMENT OF PURPOSE AND FUNDING GUIDELINES
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

ATTACHMENT AUNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA BOARD OF VISITORS STUDENT ACTIVITY FEE STATEMENT OF PURPOSE AND FUNDING GUIDELINES(Adopted on February 1, 1991, revised August 21, 1995, November 10, 1995, and January 16, 2004) Submitted to the full Board of Visitors for approval on February 7, 2004STATEMENT OF PURPOSESTUDENT ACTIVITIES ELIGIBLE FOR FUNDINGSTUDENT ORGANIZATIONS NOT ELIGIBLE FOR FUNDINGSTUDENT EXPENDITURES AND ACTIVITIES NOT ELIGIBLE FOR FUNDINGFUND ALLOCATION AND APPEAL PROCEDURES/PROCESS:DEFINITIONS OF TERMS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

RESOLVED that with respect to the purpose of an allocation from the Fund, unless otherwise directed by the President, the procedure shall be as follows:

The purpose of the student activity fee is to provide financial support for student organizations that are related to the educational purpose of the University of Virginia. As a required student fee the monies collected by the University for funding student activities are public funds which must be administered in a manner consistent with the educational purpose of the University as well as with state and federal law.

The Rector and Visitors of the University have determined that activities of the student organizations in the following categories relate to the educational environment or purposes of the University and are thus eligible for funding.

The Board of Visitors has determined that fraternities, sororities, honor societies, and special status student organizations not charged by the Board of Visitors are ineligible for funds from the student activities fees. An organization is also ineligible when admission is exclusionary in nature and not open to all students or if membership is restricted by reason of race, religion, disability, national origin, political affiliation, or gender. Notwithstanding these requirements, a student organization may restrict membership based on ability to perform the activities related to the organization's purpose. In determining cases of discrimination, it is not sufficient to look merely to the constitution of an organization but to its actual practices and operations.

The Board of Visitors has further determined that the following expenditures and activities do not relate to the educational purpose of the University and thus are not eligible for funding:

The Student Activities Committee chaired by the designee of the Vice President for Student Affairs is charged with the authority and responsibility for supervision of the student activities fee fund. With respect to distributions from the fund, Student Council is responsible for allocations to eligible student organizations. The ceiling on the aggregate amount allocated to all such organizations shall be the current balance in the student activities fees fund. The allocation process follows procedures established by Student Council which are intended to maximize the use of the funds and are consistent with the above guidelines. The Student Council Appropriations Committee is responsible for following these procedures and making the recommendations to the Student Council Representative Body on the funding requests. In providing student organizations with appropriations deemed needed, the Student Council Appropriations Committee shall be further guided by such criteria as the size of the group, the University wide benefit of the group's activities, and the group's level of financial self-sufficiency. The committee is encouraged but is not required to appropriate all of the available fund balance. The Appropriations Committee recommended allocation to a student organization may be appealed to the Student Council Representative Body by any student or student organization. The Student Activities Committee is the next and final appeal for any budget reviewed and, in some cases, adjusted by the Student Council Representative Body. In addition, the Student Activities Committee may examine on its own motion any student organization's allocation request submitted to the Student Council. After the allocations are finalized, the Student Council Vice President for Student Organizations writes the chair of the Student Activities Committee requesting that the allocations for those funded organizations be released to the Student Activities Business Manager. When the Student Activities Business Manager receives the funds, they are deposited into a demand deposit account. Expenditures from the allocations can be made provided the student organization completes the proper authorization forms with the Student Activities Business Manager. The student organizations receive their allocation on a per semester basis for payment of expenses of activities conducted during the, fall and spring semesters only. Any funded student organization alleged to be in violation of the above guidelines is subject to the suspension or loss of student activity fee funding after notice and an opportunity to be heard by Student Council. The Student Activities Committee is the next and final appeal body.

These definitions of terms are intended to provide clarification of the student activity fee fund guidelines. In those cases where further clarification is needed, Student Council and, if necessary, the Student Activities Committee will interpret the guidelines based on the facts presented and the Board of Visitors intent for the student activity fee.

Ability to Perform - a student organization may restrict membership based on ability to perform the activities related to the organization's purpose. For example, a student publication may make requirements based on writing skills. A club sport may restrict membership where selection is based on competitive skill or the activity involved is a contact sport thus resulting in a team of one or predominately one gender. Likewise, ' a choral group may restrict membership based on vocal range or quality which may also result in a chorus or choruses of one or predominantly one gender.

Co-curricular Organization - a group which provides opportunities outside the classroom setting for students to apply classroom theory and/or to acquire knowledge, experience and/or skills.

Cultural Organization - an organization which is primarily concerned with studying, promoting, and/or expressing racial, ethnic, or affinity group traditions, social forms, art, and/or tastes.

Hobby Organization - a group which primarily pursues an activity for relaxation, recreation, or entertainment.

Political Activity - an activity related to: (1) lobbying the principal purpose of which is to influence the passage or defeat of specific legislation, and/or (2) electioneering which encompasses participation or intervention in any political campaign on behalf of or in opposition to any candidate for public office. These restrictions on funding political activities are not intended to preclude funding of any otherwise eligible student organization which: (1) advocates, as an incidental or insubstantial part of its activities, the adoption or rejection of legislation; (2) engages in nonpartisan analysis, study, or research, and makes the results available to the public, or (3) espouses particular positions or ideological viewpoints, including those that may be unpopular or are not generally accepted, or that may coincidentally be prominently held by particular political parties or political candidates.

Political Organization - an organization primarily devoted to political discussion or debate and the organization of meetings to further such interests, and which in advancing such general social and educational interests through its membership does not use student activities fee funding for political activity as defined herein.

Religious Activity - the organized worship of a deity, divine power, or supernatural entity, whether or not such activity is consistent with the precepts of an organized religion or denomination. No student news, information, opinion, entertainment or academic communications media group shall be considered to be engaging in religious activity merely because it expresses ideas or viewpoints that are religious in nature.

Religious Organization - an organization primarily devoted to religious discussion or debate and the organization of meetings to further such interests, and which in advancing such general social and educational interests in a secular context through its membership does not use student activities fee funding for religious activity as defined herein.

Student Activities Committee - the University faculty/student committee charged by the Vice President for Student Affairs to provide oversight to the student activity fee fund and its allocation by Student Council.

Special Status Student Organizations - Student organizations which have University delegated functions to perform are termed special status. These groups which include but are not limited to Student Council, school councils, University Guides, and University Singers, have a University department or a school responsible for each group relative to the delegated functions. Two groups, Student Council and WTJU, are charged by the Board of Visitors. The other Special Status Student Organizations receive their charge from a University department or school. Because of this relationship to a school or department and the concomitant funding available to the group,

Special Status Student Organizations not charged by the Board of Visitors are ineligible for student activity fee fund allocations.

Student Organizations Eligible for Funding - Contracted Independent Organizations which have been Student Council qualified and comply with the Student Council appropriations process guidelines as well as Special Status Student Organizations charged by the Board of Visitors are eligible for student activity fee funding. Currently, Student Council and WTJU are Special Status Organizations eligible for funding.

BE IT FINALLY RESOLVED that the foregoing amendments to the Guidelines for Student Activities Current Fund Allocation shall apply to all student organization funding requests that are pending on, or are made after January 16, 2004.
