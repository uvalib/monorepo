**Leadership Discussion**

Following some introductory comments, President Ryan said the discussion would focus on one piece of good news Visitors might not have heard much about, one challenge that the University is facing, and one thing on which he would like feedback.

**Good news: Community Partnerships**

The President’s Council working groups have been active on affordable housing, the local economy, pipelines and pathways, early childhood education, and public health. They have made progress on the Good Neighbor initiative over the past three years, despite the pandemic, and they opened the Center for Community Partnerships in November 2020 which is meant to be both a front door to the University for community members and a collaborative space for UVA’s existing community efforts.

The Health System has offered Covid-19 testing to the community since the pandemic began. UVA has offered more than 15,000 total tests to the community since the start of the pandemic in 14 different locations, and over 95,000 vaccines were administered. Some details:

1.  UVA Health conducted more than 100 pop-up events in partnership with Blue Ridge Health District and other community partners including the Latino Health Initiative, the Your Life Matters Movement and others.
2.  The Homebound Program, a partnership between UVA Health, BRHD and the Charlottesville Fire Department, has provided 1,185 doses to 846 individuals in their residences, and continues to operate three days weekly.
3.  Southwood Homes, one of the sites coordinated by Dr. Max Luna and the Latino Health Initiative, has hosted a dozen events, providing more than 1,000 doses to this predominantly Latinx mobile home neighborhood, many of which went to children.
4.  WELLaware community health workers program was launched via a partnership between UVA Health and its Office of Diversity and Community Engagement, to address disparities in health outcomes in Charlottesville by deploying community health workers who live in the communities they will serve and already have built-in networks and trust. They will work to make connections with neighbors, discuss their health issues and concerns, provide basic health education, and connect them as needed to health care services.
5.  Appointment of Kevin McDonald and adding community partnerships to his role.

**Challenge: Covid Fatigue**

Two years ago, following Spring Break, UVA moved all classes online and students went home for the semester. The challenge is that it has been two years and there are still restrictions on daily life. The fall semester was fairly normal, and then the Omicron variant hit in the winter and required re-imposing some restrictions.

The spring semester had to begin with many events held virtually and with an indoor mask mandate. President Ryan said the plan is to lift the mask mandate on March 21, a week after students return from spring break. There continue to be significant repercussions from COVID: staffing shortages on the academic division and in the health system, including a nurse turnover rate of more than 20%, and the need to learn how to be together again, as well as students learning for the first time the traditions of UVA. Only the fourth years have a had a year free of COVID. He said there is work to do as we emerge from this latest variant. Some initiatives underway:

1.  The President’s office has started an initiative to surprise a different staff group every Friday with gifts and gratitude.
2.  The annual Staff Appreciation Breakfast is back next week.
3.  UVA has augmented mental health offerings for employees.
4.  The Pipelines and Pathways Working Group is working to increase the number of disadvantaged community residents hired by the University and to support them in advancing their careers.
5.  The plan is to have a normal Finals Weekend, and normal reunion weekends, Arts on the Hill, Run with Jim, and other spring events as a way to celebrate a return to a more familiar and enjoyable working and learning environment.

**Feedback item: Key Initiatives: What’s next?**

President Ryan showed a slide with the four overarching goals of the 2030 Strategic Plan:

1.  To strengthen our foundation, which means supporting our students, faculty, and staff;
2.  To cultivate the most vibrant community in higher education, in order to prepare students to be servant-leaders in a diverse and globally connected world;
3.  To enable discoveries that enrich and improve lives; and
4.  To make UVA synonymous with service.

He then showed the ten key initiatives which were designed to advance multiple goals at once. The initiatives were intended to be modified as conditions warranted. They were hypotheses to be tested and then revised as they learned more. For instance, they could not have foreseen the pandemic, the attack on the Capitol building, the massive protests in the wake of the George Floyd murder, and now a war in Europe. The question is whether those events, or others, mean they ought to modify the orientation toward the 10 initiatives. There has been significant progress over the last two years and he provided a couple of examples including the development of the Emmet-Ivy corridor, including securing a lead gift for a new performing arts center and the gift and plans for the Karsh Institute of Democracy.

He asked the Visitors to tell him if there are some initiatives that deserve more focus in the short term, and perhaps these are different from what they thought was most important two years ago--or maybe they are exactly the same? Visitor comments included the following:

1.  Encourage intellectual diversity and freedom of speech.
2.  Workforce skills cannot be ignored but should be offered in conjunction with a liberal arts education.
3.  Recruit excellent faculty.
4.  Research preeminence—we are not where we need to be.
5.  Be a student-centric university—COVID impacted students may need extra help both academically and socially (including mental health services).
6.  Decreasing number of men accepted—do we need smaller classes?
7.  What is the future of tenure track? Should we be looking for something different in faculty? Board would like to understand the categories of faculty better.
8.  University/Education School should be involved in pre-K and K-12 education.
9.  Free parking for nurses.
10.  Advising: would like to see a specific timetable and pilot program.
11.  COVID will define the next 5 years—possibly 11th item. Steps to make students care about community.  Mental health/advising services
12.  Should UVA take more ownership of student self-governance? There has been a break with students because of COVID and they are not as invested in the community.
13.  Teacher shortage in state—expand teacher training.
14.  Focus on engaging students between acceptance and matriculation. 
15.  Make more progress with consistent leadership.
16.  President Ryan can be a national thought leader on one or more issues.
17.  Tell the story about the progress already made under the 2030 Plan.
18.  Reach out beyond “tribes;” this would be an enormous benefit to citizen leaders and to society.
19.  Maintaining academic rigor is number one!

**Remarks/Reports**

**Remarks by the Rector**

The Rector spoke about plans for a Retreat in August. He wants to focus on a few big issues and do a deeper dive on those. He asked the Board members for any thoughts on topics.

Mr. Clement mentioned the exceptional efforts of Provost Magill during her almost three--year tenure as provost. He said the Board is thrilled to have Ian Baucom join the senior leadership team because he has a great deal of institutional knowledge, and he is a pleasure to work with.

**Remarks by the Student Representative**

Ms. Mehta took a moment to recognize the people of Ukraine during this time of injustice and devastating conflict, and then she gave her remarks.

Ms. Mehta said she is asking the same three questions she asked at her first meeting: _What comprises a true education? What role should a university play in this, at a fundamental level? And Is UVA upholding these tenets?_ She reflected on the past ten months and focused on academic life, community, mental health, and student self-governance.

She quoted James Baldwin on the purpose of education: “The purpose of education, finally, is to create in a person the ability to look at the world for himself, to make his own decisions, to say to himself this is black or this is white, to decide for himself whether there is a God in heaven or not… To ask questions of the universe, and then learn to live with those questions, is the way he achieves his own identity.”

She said she would like to emphasize the ideas of autonomy and certainty, or the ability for students to “make their own decisions,” meaning students should have a feeling that they are in control of their path and time at UVA. Both first years and fourth years have expressed a feeling of uncertainty and a lack of choice in their academic decisions. There are barriers of logistics, major caps, and sign-up times. A student once commented, “Even as a fourth year, It isn’t about the classes I want to take, it’s about the classes that are open.”

Ms. Mehta tied this issue to advising, but also structures separate from advising. Students ought to have the control to determine what they want to do and then to do it, while not being at odds with the structures of the university. A staircase sort of mindset, but the first step is uncertain, and everything past that is uncertain as well. She thought it was worth the time to reconsider the structures, systems, and choice architecture in place which shape and limit student choice and autonomy within academics. Ideally, students from day one should feel like their sole constraint is their own interests, passions, and work ethic. This goes hand in hand with the Strategic Plan’s goal of “ensuring that our systems enable our students, faculty, and staff to do their best work.” Because the best work is the work you genuinely _want_ to do.

She thanked the Board and senior administration for rethinking advising, and said she was grateful to the new provost for hitting the ground running with this initiative and long-standing student grievance. The pandemic has added a sense of urgency to this already long overdue change.

She moved on to the second point in James Baldwin’s quote: what it means to achieve your identity through education. Part of this is in the classroom, but the bulk of this happens outside of the classroom, in the person- to- person interaction that is life at UVA.

College may be the only time in a student's life where they are surrounded by people incredibly different from themselves. UVA must prioritize the structures, practices, and spaces which best capitalize upon this awesome moment of congruence and difference. Ms. Mehta said the second-year housing initiative was a “step forward” in students living with and learning from people who are different from them. The pandemic has made the need to create more of these opportunities urgent.

Ms. Mehta said she thinks the discomfort in having your opinions and beliefs pushed up against is important. Being comfortable and surrounded by the familiar is becoming the new norm, but “to lose the power of confrontation is to lose the power of unity.” She cited the Center for Politics “Common Grounds” film as an example of the kind of thing that should be commonplace at a university. Students should have the ability to engage without resorting to cancel-culture or looking to echo chambers—it is one of the greatest contributions a university can provide to the future of democracy.

Ms. Mehta also spoke about the expanded mental health resources provided by the University and their importance.

Her final topic was student self-governance. She said there were different expectations of what that means among students, and the tradition of student self-governance needs upkeep and vigilance. It cannot be taken for granted.

Ms. Mehta thanked the Visitors for the experience as student representative, and gave a special thank you to Rector Clement, who she said she particularly enjoyed working with. She ended with a quote from Jacob Riis, “When nothing seems to help, I go and look at a stonecutter hammering away at his rock perhaps a hundred times without as much as a crack showing in it. Yet at the hundred and first blow it will split in two, and I know it was not that blow that did it, but all that had gone before.”

**Remarks by the Faculty Senate Chair**

Faculty Senate chair Susan Kirk, M.D, gave remarks. She mentioned that a faculty colleague told her Virginia seasons follow their own unique pattern with 12 distinct seasons:

*   _Winter_
*   _Fool’s Spring_
*   _Second Winter_
*   _Spring of Deception_
*   _Third Winter_
*   _The Pollening_ 
*   _Actual Spring_
*   _Summer_ 
*   _Hell’s Front Porch_
*   _False Fall_
*   _Second Summer_
*   _Actual Fall_

She said they are still in ‘Second Winter’ despite the official start of Spring Break the next day.

Dr. Kirk said the faculty have engaged with two issues recently. One was the rapid selection of a provost following the resignation of Ms. Magill to take the presidency at the University of Pennsylvania. She said the decision to appoint Ian Baucom into the position without consultation and a national search concerned many faculty. She said a meeting with President Ryan on his rationale for the process satisfied most, and they look forward to working with Provost Baucom and the team in the Provost’s office.

The second issue was that UVA has two faculty governing bodies, the Faculty Senate and the General Faculty Council. She gave a history of each body:

The Faculty Senate was created in 1926 by then-President Alderman. He believed that the size of the total faculty, which had grown to 97, was too large to serve as its legislative body, hence a smaller group was elected to serve this purpose. The name ‘Faculty Senate’ wasn’t assigned until 1971, when the Constitution and Bylaws were ratified. The history of the General Faculty Council is much more interesting. I’ve spoken with several of its founding members recently and learned that it came into existence in the late 1980s as an advocacy body for women faculty. At the time, the only group that existed for women at UVA was a club for the wives of faculty. There were very few women faculty at that time, and many had been hired as the ‘trailing spouse’ – a term that is no longer in favor. Often the school that was hiring the male faculty member did not want to hire the wife, and so the Provost’s office offered the appointment with the designation of ‘general faculty’- thankfully we have come a long way since then! But according to one of the founding members, general faculty were not welcome in the Faculty Senate at that time. In 1992, this group took a proposal to then-Provost Thomas Jackson asking for a specific governing body to advocate for their needs. With that request, the General Faculty Council was born. Today, in 2022, academic general faculty can serve in either the Faculty Senate or the General Faculty Council, although only the Council allows other types of faculty such as Professional or Research in their membership.

Dr. Kirk said her research indicates that this is unusual, and many universities are more inclusive with membership in their faculty governing body. They are considering combining the two bodies.

She also spoke about the category “Wage Faculty” who are underrepresented in both bodies. Provost Policy 026 defines these faculty as _those who are hired to complete a short-term and/or part-time academic work assignment, such as teaching one or more courses for one or two academic terms. Moreover, Faculty wage employment is usually less than 0.5 FTE (teaching fewer than 6 credits_[_1_](https://uvapolicy.virginia.edu/policy/prov-026#Footnote1) _or the equivalent of no more than 19 hours per week); is offered for only one or two semesters at a time_. She said the data show that some Wage Faculty do not fall within this definition and are a sizeable minority of the instructional faculty. For the fall semester, 15% (446) were Wage Faculty. She is trying to find ways for the Faculty Senate to represent these faculty.
