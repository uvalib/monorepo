RESOLVED, the Executive Vice President and Provost is authorized and directed to reclassify 113 academic general faculty positions to bring them into alignment with new policy.

**Executive Vice President and Provost Remarks**

Mr. Katsouleas reported on admissions, faculty hiring, and global initiatives. For the Class of 2022, the University received over 37,000 applications for approximately 3,700 openings. This was a record number of applications. The yield increased from 37% to 40%, which reverses the steady drop over the previous 10 years. The yield was higher for in-state students than for out-of-state students. There was an increase in diversity with 34% of the enrolling class being students of color. The University had its highest enrollment of African-American students with 349 African-American or multi-race African-American students enrolling. There will be 418 first generation students; the second highest number ever. SAT scores increased from 1387 to 1399. Mr. Katsouleas said this will be the strongest, most diverse, most talented, and largest class.

Mr. Katsouleas asked Mr. Roberts, Dean of Admission, to respond to a question about where students go when they turn down offers of admission from the University. Mr. Roberts said in addition to the usual schools such as the Ivy League schools, applicants are accepting offers from institutions with full-ride scholarships, such as the University of South Carolina, Alabama, Clemson, and VCU. Mr. Walker suggested the University look at best practices at other institutions. Mr. Roberts said the Office of Admission acknowledges the need to improve its communications with accepted applicants to better convey the University’s interest in them. Mr. Katsouleas said the yield number is good relative to the University’s peers. Some schools achieve artificially high numbers by using early admission as a firm commitment. Mr. Roberts said the University made 200 fewer offers this year, but, because of the higher yield, we ended up enrolling 200 more students than planned.

Mr. Katsouleas highlighted recent faculty hires. He said some of the new junior faculty were the result of cluster hires and a number of the senior faculty hires are in the top five of the faculty.

Mr. Katsouleas reported on the University’s Yamuna River Project, which is in Delhi, India. In May, he represented the University at a launch of the book on the project. This was the culmination of five years of work by University faculty and students. Over 700 students participated in design studios and research, and 70 students traveled to Delhi. There were approximately 12 faculty participants from a number of disciplines. The project has mobilized the nation and the world. The Indian Minister of Urban Development announced that the prime minister will establish a river authority board with governance oversight that will supersede local control. The European Economic Development Bank at the urging of Spain identified 300 million euros to commit to a pilot project to remediate the river.

Mr. Katsouleas announced that Ms. Fried recently made a $3 million gift to the Center for Teaching Excellence to endow the director position. The gift qualifies for the Bicentennial Professorship match and will create a $5 million endowment, which will be called the Barbara Fried Directorship of the Center for Teaching Excellence. The gift will allow the reallocation of resources to support new programs and reach more faculty.

**Report on the Ad Hoc Committee for Innovation in Curriculum and Curriculum Support**

Ms. Fried asked Mr. Holmes to report. Mr. Holmes said the ad hoc committee is focusing on online learning, innovative teaching, and long term student success. There are two new online learning initiatives. The first is the joint master’s degree program in data analytics sponsored by the Darden and McIntire schools. The second is an effort to take the Data Science master’s degree online. Mr. Holmes said the University, which has under- publicized its online programs in the past, has created a website for its online programs.

Mr. Holmes said the Course Design Institute (CDI) offered by the Center for Teaching Excellence (CTE) has the highest penetration in higher education at institutions like UVA. The CTE analyzed the courses taught by its CDI graduates and found that they have higher levels of engagement between students and teachers. The DFW rate (students who receive a D or F grade or Withdraw from a class) has also been reduced in these classes. In response to requests from CDI graduates for additional resources, the CTE developed the SoTL (Scholarship of Teaching and Learning) program.

Mr. Holmes concluded with a report on the College of Arts & Sciences new curriculum. He highlighted the forums, which are comprised of 40 students who conduct research around a topic which can be analyzed using multiple disciplines. Students complete a seminar course in their first semester, and then during their fourth semester, they reconvene for a capstone experience where they revisit the topic.

**Student Success Over the Longer Term**

Mr. Archie Holmes and Ms. Patricia Lampkin led this discussion. Mr. Holmes said the University is committed to providing students with skills for long term success through a combination of academic, extracurricular, and co-curricular programs. Providing this type of education has challenges and opportunities. It is not the least expensive form of education, but it is the most powerful. Mr. Holmes asked the committee how it would define long term success.

Ms. Fried said an education should prepare students for a carrier path, give them the ability to think, to feel part of a greater society, to have the ability to support themselves, and to be able to make decisions and choices.

Dr. Britt said graduates should be able advance in their education and in their careers.

Mr. Walker, referencing the need to transition from ‘just-in-case learning’ to ‘just-in-time learning,’ said graduates should be able to problem solve; to pull a thing together; to evolve in long learning; to understand who you are, where you are going, and what resources you can use; and to self advocate.

Mr. Holmes observed that no one mentioned a particular degree or major, or said that this degree or that degree leads to long term success. Ms. Lampkin said students focus on academics; they define themselves by majors and double majors. Ms. Linney said the University needs to get students to focus on skills beyond academics, to take care of themselves, to build resiliency, and to be present in the moment. Ms. Lampkin said the University tries to give students the skill sets they need to deal with life’s hard measures and she stressed the importance of lasting relationships.

Mr. Holmes asked, how do we teach students to deal with adversity? Ms. Lampkin said involvement in co-curricular and extra-curricular activities, which are student run organizations, helps students acquire the skills needed to be successful and to deal with adversity. When changes need to be made, you don’t give students the answers, you let them figure it out. She referenced the diversification of the University Guide Service. Historically, the guides had selected their friends and people who looked like them, but when confronted with the need to diversify, the guides were able to figure out how to change.

Mr. Griffin said the student run organizations are what makes the University special. He referenced the student press conference held during the Rolling Stone incident as an example. He added that career satisfaction is a large part of well- being.

Dr. Britt suggested the University identify core competencies undergraduates should have by the time they graduate.

Mr. Clement asked how students can identify what they have learned over their four years. Mr. Holmes said the Gallup-Purdue poll index is a good measure. It asks alumni to reflect on those college experiences which led them to be engaged in the work place and to thrive in their personal lives. Responses included participation in extracurricular activities and having a professor who made learning exciting. Ms. Lampkin said the University uses national data and self-reports from students, but the best measure of satisfaction is your view as an alumnus. When you are a student, you are in the middle of an experience and you don’t understand or you don’t fully appreciate what you are learning.

Mr. Murray said change is occurring so rapidly students must learn how to learn. This means being able to find resources to help find a new job because your job has become obsolete.

Mr. Katsouleas asked where the University is in terms of long term student success in comparison to its peers. Mr. Holmes, noting that a number of universities are working to address this issue jointly, said the University is ahead of its peers. UVA students are more engaged in their education than at other institutions.

Dr. Britt asked if the University follows up with students who leave the University. Mr. Holmes said exit surveys are conducted at the departmental and school levels. Ms. Lampkin said the University is expanding its use of data collection and analysis to identify when students are having issues and to initiate interventions. Sometimes student success can be improved through the specific sequencing of when courses are taken.

Mr. Holmes offered several concluding questions and comments:

1.  Is it important that the University has a diverse academic community?
2.  Even though the University has student self-governance, there are people behind the scenes supporting it. Having sufficient resources for this support is important.
3.  Work and coordination between the Provost Office and Student Affairs is critical. It is the “secret sauce”.

**Athletics Director Report**

Ms. Williams introduced Mr. Bronco Mendenhall, Head Football Coach. She and Mr. Mendenhall believe sports can positively influence young people and that these young people can positively influence their communities and the nation. She said the University has the opportunity to take the football program, which is one of its more visible parts, and build something it can be proud of.

Mr. Mendenhall said he considers himself to be a teacher first. His primary job is to help young people identify their purpose, to help them pursue that purpose while they are at the University, and to launch them into life with a clear understanding of that purpose.

Mr. Mendenhall reviewed the state of the football program in some detail. He said the minimum threshold for success is to be eligible for post season play. Last year was the first time in six years the University participated in the post-season. If the University returns to post season play this year, it will be the first time in 12 years. He believes this can be achieved.

He said sports unite people from all races, backgrounds, and socioeconomic status. The in-state perception is that UVA does not value football, and people wonder why an in-state player selects the University. When an out-of-state player selects Virginia, however, he is told he is lucky to get a world-class education and to have the opportunity to build the program with a coaching staff with a history of 12 bowl games in the last 13 years. The program’s culture is strong, and players have confidence in the future. Under Mr. Mendenhall, players are invited into the homes of the 14 assistant coaches. They are seeing what families look like, what leadership looks like, what community service looks like, and what community integration is like. During his first year, not a single player had ever won a road game; this year not a single player had ever been to a post season game. UVA could win the ACC and be aligned with the institution’s values.

When Mr. Mendenhall asks his players about their goals, future, and purpose, almost all say the NFL. His response is “and”? He said 85% of NFL players come from single parent homes. Of the players who make it to their second NFL contract, 78% are divorced, bankrupt, a substance abuser, and disabled when the leave the NFL. He wants University players to pursue the NFL if they will be in the 20%.

Dr. Shannon said athletics teams are the epitome of what it means to be inclusive. Each athlete is given an opportunity to succeed and to be challenged irrespective of his or her origin.

**Student Comment Period**

Ms. Nigro introduced Ms. Francesca Callicotte, a rising fourth year student and president of United for Undergraduate Socioeconomic Diversity (UFUSED). Ms. Callicotte said UFUSED supports low income and first generation students. It is focused on advocacy, outreach, and social accessibility.

She discussed a recent initiative, the CIO (Contracted Independent Organizations) accessibility income pledge. Its purpose was to create an awareness among student leaders and administration of the challenges faced by low income students. There is a misconception that when low income students arrive on Grounds, all of the obstacles are gone. This is not the case. For example, there are dues for memberships in student groups. The CIO pledge called for the waiver of these dues for low income students. It also proposed allocating 5% of all tickets to events sponsored by CIOs for low income students.

While costs or fees can limit access to academic activities and programs, fraternities and sororities are the most restrictive because of their costs. Fraternity memberships cost $800 to $1,000 per semester; sorority memberships cost $800 to $1,200. Fraternities and sororities want to improve accessibility for low income students, and have begun to waive rush dues. Ms. Callicotte said Vanderbilt University provides grants of $500 to $1,000 to the recipients of need-based aid so they can explore fraternity and sorority life. UFUSED will work with the administration to create a similar fund.

Mr. Griffin said he is concerned about students dropping out of school due to cash needs for emergencies. Ms. Sullivan and Ms. Lampkin said their offices have some funding for emergency needs, but it is limited. Ms. Sullivan said hers were exhausted for the year.
