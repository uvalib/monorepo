Mr. R. E. L. Taylor, of the firm of Taylor & Fisher, was present, and conferred with the Board as to the plans and location of the proposed dining hall, and, following a general discussion of the matter, the following motion was adopted:

RESOLVED, that Taylor & Fisher be employed to prepare preliminary plans for the mess hall, at a cost not to exceed $500, and, that if the construction of such mess hall is to be carried out, then to prepare the working drawings at an additional cost not to exceed $1,000, making the cost of such plans not to exceed $1,500.

The President read a letter from Rayford W.

Co. $50.00 Preferred stock, the bonds to be guaranteed by the New York Central Railway Co., to mature in 100 years and to bear interest at 4%. These bonds to be secured by second mortgage on all the property of Harlem Railway Co, including franchises, etc., subject only to the lien of a first mortgage of $12,000,000.00 on these properties. Said properties, a conservative value of between $150,000,000.00 and $200,000,000.00, so it would seem that these second mortgage bonds would be well secured.

On motion, the President was authorized to accept the exchange of the second mortgage 4% 100 year bonds for the 771 shares of preferred stock.
