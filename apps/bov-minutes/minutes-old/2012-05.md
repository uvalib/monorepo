**\- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -**

**Approval of Revisions to the Critical Incident Management Plan**

**The Rector reported that the Critical Incident Management Plan for the University was originally drafted following the September 11 attacks. This is the first major revision of that plan, which is a plan of organization for managing all hazards.**

**The following resolution, which was adopted by the Board, reflects the changes to the Plan. The revised Plan, and a summary of the changes, are attached as Appendix A.**

**APPROVAL OF REVISIONS TO THE CRITICAL INCIDENT MANAGEMENT PLAN**

**WHEREAS, the Board of Visitors and the administration of the University of Virginia are concerned with the health and well-being of their students, faculty, staff, patients, and visitors, and desire that the best possible emergency service be available to them; and**

**WHEREAS, Va. Code §§ 23-9.2:9 and 44-146.13 _et seq_. state that a public institution of higher education shall develop, adopt, and keep current a written crisis and emergency management plan, and every four years, each institution shall conduct a comprehensive review and revision of its crisis and emergency management plan to ensure the plan remains current, and the revised plan shall be adopted formally by the board of visitors or other governing body. Such review shall also be certified in writing to the Department of Emergency Management; and**

**WHEREAS, the University, in coordination with the Virginia Department of Emergency Management and with input from University departments and the Charlottesville-UVA-Albemarle Emergency Management Coordinator, has revised its existing Critical Incident Management Plan;**

**RESOLVED, the Board of Visitors adopts the revised University of Virginia Critical Incident Management Plan dated**

**March 2012, to include plans and procedures for all hazard incidents.**

*   **\- - - - - - - - -**

**NAMING OF THE ART MUSEUM**

**The Rector reported that Heywood and Cynthia Fralin have made a generous bequest of their extensive collection of American art to the University, and in honor of that gift and all that Heywood and Cynthia have done for the University, and for higher education in the Commonwealth, the Board approved naming the Art Museum in honor of the Fralins.**

**NAMING OF THE ART MUSEUM THE W. HEYWOOD FRALIN SR. AND CYNTHIA KERR FRALIN MUSEUM OF ART**

**WHEREAS, Cynthia Kerr Fralin and W. Heywood Fralin Sr., of Roanoke, longtime supporters of the arts in the Commonwealth of Virginia, have committed their extensive collection of American art to the University of Virginia Art Museum; and**

**WHEREAS, the gift of art from Cynthia and Heywood Fralin will enrich the Art Museum’s holdings in American art of the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries and serve as a notable teaching instrument for future generations of faculty and students; and**

**WHEREAS, Cynthia Kerr Fralin, civic leader, serves on the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts Board of Trustees, chairing the Art Acquisition Committee, and on the Roanoke Women’s Foundation, which encourages women in philanthropy in the Roanoke Valley; and**

**WHEREAS, W. Heywood Fralin Sr., a 1962 alumnus of the University, has served the University and the Commonwealth through his exemplary work on the Board of Visitors of the University and Virginia Tech, the Board of Managers of the University of Virginia Alumni Association, the Board of Trustees of the University of Virginia Student Aid Foundation (now the Virginia Athletics Foundation) and the College Foundation, the Virginia Business Higher Education Council, the Council on Virginia’s Future, and in many other capacities;**

**RESOLVED, in honor of their commitment to the arts and their long and dedicated service to the University and the Commonwealth, the University of Virginia Art Museum, which is currently housed in the Thomas H. Bayly Building, is named the W. Heywood Fralin Sr. and Cynthia Kerr Fralin Museum of Art,**

**which for signage and other purposes will be known as the Fralin Museum of Art; and**

**RESOLVED FURTHER, the Board and the University express their deepest gratitude to Cynthia and Heywood Fralin for their ongoing generosity, service, and dedication to the arts and the University.**

*   **\- - - - - - - - -**

**COMMENTS BY THE RECTOR**

**The Rector made brief remarks about the two other members of the Board who will be stepping down in July: Ms. Key and Dr. Overdevest. She said Ms. Key has played an important role on the Board, focusing her keen mind on the academic mission, particularly preserving the “secret sauce” of the student experience, and advocating for empirical data to support all decisions, particularly tuition and fee decisions.**

**The Rector commended Dr. Overdevest for his effectiveness as the student member, not only because of his medical background but also because of his wide circle of student associates — undergraduates and graduate students in the other schools. She indicated more would be said about Ms. Key, Dr. Overdevest, and Mr. Fralin on Tuesday.**

**PRESIDENT’S REPORT**

**The President said the information that will be discussed in the Board meeting covers a wide array of topics connected to a broad range of units within the University. Within the numerous presentations and reports there is a common defining concept: stewardship and accountability. This theme will be threaded throughout the discussions.**

**She said the Board would hear about a range of academic issues related to stewardship and accountability, including the dean of the Curry School of Education on his strategic plan for the future of that school, and a written report about a new dual-degree program involving the Curry School and the Darden School of Business. Also on the agenda is a review of the University’s accreditation process, and the Quality Enhancement Plan that is an integral part of that process. She said the University is accountable for the quality of the education offered to its students, and envisioning the future of the academic enterprise is one of the University’s great stewardship responsibilities.**

**Enterprise risk management will be a topic of discussion throughout the meetings, especially in reviewing the University’s 2012-13 operating budget. The work allows the University to manage risks and also to seize opportunities when they arise, as we strive to steward the University’s resources wisely.**

**Ms. Sullivan said the Board has received a written report from the University of Virginia Investment Management Company (UVIMCO) that assesses the performance of the University’s long-term pool, which includes the endowment. Prudent management of the University’s long-term financial resources is one of the University’s most important stewardship responsibilities.**

**Ms. Sullivan said the University’s audit schedule for 2012-13 is developed based on the requirements of state and other external agencies, as well as risk-assessment models, as the University holds itself accountable for the quality and integrity of operations in every corner of the institution.**

**She mentioned efforts to prepare students for the job market through Career Services programs, and a comparison of data on our students in relation to national trends will be provided. As graduating students continue to face a tight job market, the University wants to do everything it can to help them prepare for employment opportunities.**

**Ms. Sullivan said the Director of Supplier Diversity will speak about the efforts to include small businesses and businesses owned by women and minorities among the companies that contract with the University. She said we are accountable to the state for our supplier diversity.**

**A progress report on the fund-raising campaign and philanthropic cash flow will be given by Mr. Sweeney, as the University continues to seek private funds to strengthen the institution in a prolonged period of economic constraint. Effective stewardship of the University’s donors and their gifts will help solidify the University’s position among the top universities in the nation in the years to come.**

**Stewardship of the buildings and grounds is on the agenda. She said we enjoy a rare privilege in that the University is recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage site, and we are**

**accountable for it. Protecting and sustaining Thomas Jefferson’s original buildings and newer buildings that have been built with state and private support is one of the University’s stewardship responsibilities.**

**The University of Virginia’s College at Wise has a great deal of work underway. Ms. Sullivan said that when the Board gathered for the spring Board meeting in June of last year, David Prior was leading the College. All continue to feel his loss even as a search begins for his successor as Chancellor. Ensuring the future success of the College at Wise is another one of the important stewardship responsibilities.**

**Ms. Sullivan said because the meeting is focused on the theme of stewardship and accountability, it is an appropriate time to recognize one of the University’s great stewards for the past decade — Yoke San Reynolds — who will be stepping down from her duties after the meeting. Ms. Reynolds came to the University as the first Vice President for Finance in 2001. For the past 11 years, she has overseen UVa’s human resources; financial administration; treasury management; business operations; business analysis; policy development; risk management; and the University’s relationship with its 25 related foundations. To the extent that the University has been a model of stewardship and accountability for the past decade — and it has been — a lot of the credit goes to Yoke San Reynolds.**

**Ms. Sullivan also reported on the retirement of Julian Bond, the Civil Rights leader and professor of history, who stepped down this month. Mr. Bond had taught at the University since 1990. On May 14, the General Assembly passed a joint resolution commending him for his distinguished career and his important place in American history. She said the University has created the Julian Bond Professorship in Civil Rights and Social Justice, a permanent position that will extend his legacy, and earlier this month a gala was held in New York City to honor him. All of this is well-deserved recognition for the man the United States Library of Congress named a “Living Legend.”**

**Gifts and Grants Report**

**President Sullivan provided the following report on gifts and grants:**

**Current Fiscal Year through April 30, 2012**

**Summary of Changes to the Critical Incident Management Plan**

**May, 2012**

**The Critical Incident Management Plan is a comprehensive planning and response tool that sets forth in detail the University’s response to crises. The University’s first Critical Incident Management Plan (CIMP) was created in 2001; in response to the tragedy at Virginia Tech, the state in 2008 required that all institutions of higher education adopt an Emergency Operations Plan which our CIMP represents.**

**As required by law, The University reviews its plan annually, adapting to guidelines as mandated. Every fourth year, the Board of Visitors is required to assess and approve the plan. The University has completed its four-year review and has made the following changes to its plan:**

*   **Changes involving formatting and additions to align with requirements mandated by state and federal government;**
    *   **Addition of Emergency Support Functions**
    *   **Added approval of the plan by the President and ExecVP-COO annually and BOV every four years.**
*   **Separation of the University’s annexes from the body of the plan and their re-order as separate addenda**
    *   **Annexes have been added on the following:**
        *   **Annex B- Earthquakes**
        *   **Annex F-Hurricanes**
        *   **Annex J-Terrorism**
    *   **Annex H-Major Demonstrations has been amended to include members of the general public among demonstrators and to reduce the space available for demonstrations during Final Exercises;**
*   **Minor reorganization of Critical Incident Management Team members to provide applicable support;**
    *   **Merged the CIMT and Expanded CIMT**
    *   **Created subgroups streamlining tasks**

*   **The addition of an annex based on the Emergency Support Functions (ESF) to align with federal and state requirements.**

**Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Clinical Staff of the Medical Center**

**SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE BYLAWS OF THE CLINICAL STAFF**

**The Clinical Staff Executive Committee (CSEC) reviewed and approved amendments to the Clinical Staff Bylaws (“Amended Bylaws”) on April 17, 2012. The Amended Bylaws as approved by CSEC were then submitted to Members of the Clinical Staff for review and approval, disapproval, or modification. 167 Members of the Clinical Staff voted on the changes to the Amended Bylaws and virtually all of them voted to approve. Accordingly, the Medical Center Operating Board will be asked to approve, disapprove, or modify the proposed Amended Bylaws on May 21, 2012.**

**Some of the amendments are required by Joint Commission accreditation standards, some are minor clerical changes, and others represent significant changes in membership categories on the Clinical Staff, qualifications for Clinical Staff membership, corrective action procedures, Departmental representation on CSEC, AHP representation on CSEC and identification of Clinical Staff Committees. Following is a summary explanation of each of these significant changes.**

**1\. Article III. NAME, MISSION AND PURPOSES**

**This new section includes a statement of purpose for the Clinical Staff Bylaws and the Clinical Staff Organization, as well responsibilities of the organized Clinical Staff.**

**2\. Article IV. CLINICAL STAFF MEMBERSHIP AND CLASSIFICATION**

**Creation** **of** **a** **new** **category** **of** **Clinical** **Staff** **Membership: In order to develop Bylaws that are consistent with implementation of the University of Virginia’s Strategic Plan for the Medical Center and School of Medicine and the corresponding employment or contracting with physicians who may not practice in the Medical Center acute care hospital/outpatient surgery center, the Amended Bylaws create the new category of Associate Clinical Staff. Associate Clinical Staff hold a UPG employment contract but do not have a School of Medicine faculty appointment.
