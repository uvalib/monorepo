**The Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia met in open session at 2:30 p.m. on Thursday, September 15, 2016, in the Board Room of the Rotunda. William H. Goodwin Jr., Rector, presided.**

**Present were Mark T. Bowles, Frank M. Conner III, Whittington W. Clement, Elizabeth M. Cranwell, Thomas A. DePasquale, Kevin J. Fay, Barbara J. Fried, John A. Griffin, Babur B. Lateef, M.D., John G. Macfarlane III, Tammy S. Murphy, James B. Murray Jr., James V. Reyes, Jeffrey C. Walker, Nina J. Solenski, M.D., and Phoebe A. Willis. Rector Goodwin authorized Dr. L.D.

**BICENTENNIAL CHARTER**

**COMMISSION TO COMMEMORATE THE TWO HUNDREDTH ANNIVERSARY**

**OF THE FOUNDING OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA**

**Establishment of the Commission. The Board of Visitors and the President of the University of Virginia hereby establish a commission to commemorate and celebrate the two hundredth anniversary (the “Bicentennial Celebration”) of the founding of the University of Virginia (the “University”). Such commission shall be known as the Bicentennial Commission, shall be co-chaired by Dr. Robert W. Battle and Thomas F. Farrell II (collectively, the “Co-Chairs”), and shall have such number of members in such capacities as the President shall name with the concurrence of the Rector and the Co-Chairs.**

**Membership of the Commission. The membership of the Bicentennial Commission shall be comprised of representatives of the various constituencies of the University community broadly defined and such other members of the public whose professional training or relationship to the University would enhance the success of the Bicentennial Celebration. Two members of the Bicentennial Commission shall be members of the Board of Visitors at the time of the formation of the Bicentennial Commission as designated by the Rector.**

**Purposes of the Bicentennial Celebration. The primary purposes of the Bicentennial Celebration include (1) engaging, energizing, and unifying existing constituencies of the University community, (2) generating new interest in the University and Thomas Jefferson and related founders of the University within the public at large, (3) raising awareness of the University nationally and globally, (4) defining the University’s mission and role as it embarks on the next two hundred years of its life, and (5) positioning the University for the related third century capital campaign from a messaging and branding perspective.**

**Responsibilities of the Commission. The Bicentennial Commission shall have primary responsibility for planning, organizing, and executing the Bicentennial Celebration to fulfill the purposes of the celebration outlined above. Its functional responsibilities shall include (1) developing and implementing various measures to engage the many constituencies of the University in the Bicentennial Celebration, (2) determining the specific historical moments and elements of the University’s history to be commemorated, (3) identifying, planning, and organizing the various celebratory events, programs, and activities of the Bicentennial Celebration, (4) developing the messaging for the Bicentennial Celebration including making a formal recommendation to the BOV as to the University’s mission and role as it embarks on the next two hundred years of its life, and (5) transitioning the Bicentennial Celebration to the third century capital campaign.**

**Support of the Commission. Appropriate internal and external resources of the University shall be provided by the Office of the President to the Bicentennial Commission to enable the commission to carry out its responsibilities.**

**Duration of the Commission. Subject to amendment by the President, the Bicentennial Commission shall remain in existence until completion of the celebratory events in January 2019.**

**Appointment of Standing Committees**

**Rector Goodwin reminded members they have already received the list of standing committees; no action is necessary.**

**NCAA Orientation**

**The Rector said Board members are boosters under the NCAA rules, and so annually the Board is trained on NCAA compliance issues. He said the lesson here is, if in doubt, ask before you act. The rules are very complex and it would be quite easy inadvertently to cause a violation that would be detrimental to the athletics program. The Rector turned the session over to Eric Baumgartner, Associate Athletics Director for Compliance, to provide training. Mr. Baumgartner spoke about institutional control, stating the President is responsible for the athletics program, and she has delegated day-to-day control to the Athletics Director and himself. He said a “representative of athletic interests” retains that definition forever, and Board members are such. A representative of athletic interests may not recruit student athletes; prospective student athletes should be referred to the coaching staff. He said benefits provided to student athletes cannot be more than what is provided to others.**

**ACC Certification**

**Every year, the Rector and the President are required to certify to the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) that Board members understand the President is responsible for the athletics program and has full authority from the Board to run the program. The certification language was provided to members of the Board in advance of the meeting.**

**Commending Resolutions**

**The Rector said we have exemplary members who left the Board on June 30. Four of them will be celebrated at a dinner, but two were unable to attend, Helen Dragas and Frank Atkinson. Ms. Dragas was honored with a resolution at the June meeting. The Rector said he wanted to thank Frank Atkinson in person and so he invited Mr. Atkinson to attend the meeting; Mr. Atkinson was present for this part of the meeting. Rector Goodwin remarked that Mr. Atkinson has been a very diligent Board member. He was appointed to the Board by Governor McDonnell following a “100-year event” to bring some healing to the Board. He works closely with the state legislature and brought insight to the Board on how the legislature operated. Mr. Griffin thanked Mr. Atkinson for all of his work on affordable excellence. Mr. Clement also made some kind comments about working with Mr. Atkinson over many years. Mr. Clement said he regretted that they overlapped only one year on the Board of Visitors. Mr. Murray added that he regretted they did not overlap at all. The Rector said Mr. Atkinson was one who made sure the Board did not stray unintentionally from the subjects properly discussed in closed session.**

**Mr. Conner read the following commending resolution:**

He acknowledged the presence of Larry Sabato, University Professor and Director of the Center for Politics. He said Mr. Sabato donated $2 million as the anchor gift for the expansion of the Center for Politics, which is not Mr. Sabato’s first major gift to the University — he has also given to many other programs. The Center for Politics plans to raise $30 million for a number of projects. Mr. Goodwin said that beyond his donations, Mr. Sabato should be congratulated on all that he has done for the University. Mr. Sabato said he promised as soon as he earns more, the University will receive it. Mr. Griffin and Mr. Conner made additional remarks; Mr. Conner said in the future looking back on the people who made a difference at the University during this era, Mr. Sabato will be named as one of them.**

**The Rector informed the Board that a summary of the Medical Center Operating Board meeting will be posted on the portal and the website for those who were unable to attend the meeting.**

**Remarks by the President**

**President Sullivan said she knew the Board was excited about being back in the Rotunda. She pointed out that it is a much more student-friendly space with classrooms and study areas. She made the following remarks:**

**Earlier this week, we learned that UVA has risen from the #3 spot to the #2 spot in the U.S. News rankings of the best public universities in the nation.**

**U.S. News also ranked UVA #5 among all public universities in its Best Value rankings — further testament to our success in providing a high-quality education at low cost to families.**

**The U.S. News rankings are based on a combination of factors that include graduation and retention rates; faculty resources; student selectivity; financial resources; graduation rates; and alumni giving. One of the factors that contributed to UVA’s jump in this year’s rankings is faculty resources — and this is a testament to the hard work that all of us have done to improve faculty salaries at UVA.**

**We are continuing our effort to hire an excellent faculty for UVA’s third century. Last year, we hired more than 100 new tenure/tenure-track faculty. This was the most diverse new class of UVA faculty ever – 40% of these hires were women, and 31% were underrepresented minorities.**

**This year, we will continue our pan-University cluster hires and target-of-opportunity searches, known as TOPS. Cluster hires in the past year brought us faculty in areas that include Global Markets; Youth Violence Prevention; Autism Spectrum Disorder; and Neuroscience. Several of these hiring initiatives will continue this year, including new hires in Neuroscience and Autism Spectrum Disorder to complement the launch of the UVA Brain Institute.**

**Having an excellent faculty helps us attract excellent students. This fall’s entering class has 3,685 first-year members, and 675 transfer students. Among the transfer students, 365 are from Virginia’s Community College System.**

**Greg Roberts has just determined that he will drop the SAT requirement for transfer students who apply to UVA beginning with the next set of applicants. He’s doing this because he believes that the college-level work that these students have already completed is sufficient evidence of their aptitude. Dropping the SAT requirement will remove a barrier to UVA for some students, especially older students.**

**In this year’s first-year class, 67% of the students are from Virginia. Several years ago the Board approved an enrollment plan designed for completion by Fall 2017, and we have fulfilled that plan a year early. The Provost has launched a task force to develop proposals to bring to the Board our next enrollment plan. The details are still being developed, but the plan will probably include an increase in the number of Virginians we enroll. The administration will also bring the Board a plan for improving UVA’s access and affordability along with our tuition recommendations. In doing all this, we will take into account conversations that we have had, and will continue to have, with members of the General Assembly.**

**The students that we enroll at UVA are among the brightest in the nation: 88% of this year’s first-year students were in the top 10% of their high school’s graduating class, for high schools that report class rank.**

**In each new entering class we see how UVA remains accessible to students who face financial challenges and those who are the first members of their families to go to college. Preliminary numbers show that 33% of first-year students are participating in our AccessUVa financial-aid program, and more than 400 are first-generation college students.**

**Regardless of our position in the popular rankings, the most reliable indicator of UVA’s continued distinction will be the high quality of the students, faculty, and staff that we attract to our University. More than any ranking, they are the true measure of excellence at UVA.**

**During the course of this Board meeting, we’ll hear about numerous topics that reflect, in various ways, our plans to distinguish UVA in its next century. In today’s Advancement Committee meeting, I’ll talk about our plans for the Bicentennial Celebration and how those events will relate to our upcoming Campaign for UVA’s Third Century.**

**In tomorrow’s Academic and Student Life Committee meeting, you’ll hear from Dean Baucom about the curricular reform effort in the College, and from Archie Holmes and Everette Fortner about Total Advising.**

**During tomorrow’s meeting of the Ad Hoc Committee on Research, you’ll hear about future research plans in the Curry School of Education and the Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy.**

**Many of the efforts you’ll hear about during this meeting have been shaped by our plan for the University’s future — the Cornerstone Plan.**

**President Sullivan provided a brief report on the Cornerstone Plan’s second year of implementation. Visitors also received a written report at their places with details about the second year.**

**Ms. Sullivan said a few words about financing the strategic plan: about $49 million has been put together from a number of sources to fund strategic priorities under the plan.**

**Comments by the Student Representative to the Board**

**Ms. Phoebe Willis made the following remarks:**

**Thank you Rector Goodwin. I’m going to give my remarks today in a very simple structure: what’s happened, what’s happening and what’s coming up.**

**I. What’s Happened**

*   **Student Member Website**
    *   **Over the summer, I created a one-page website that would serve as a quick reference for any students seeking information about my position or my work on the BOV.**
    *   **This website includes information about my position, upcoming events, my personal schedule (yes, I linked my calendar with the one on the site to make it easier for students to schedule meetings with me, invite me to events and see what I’m up to), and a contact portal for students to send me any questions/comments.**
*   **Dorm Talks**
    *   **Once school started, I was able to schedule some events that were passed down from Daniel Judge. I’m pleased to announce that I’ve scheduled 7 dorm talks in the next 2 weeks. And for those of you unfamiliar with dorm talks, these are an informal opportunity for me to meet with first year students to explain my position on the BOV and to discuss the work that the BOV does. (and thanks to Debbie Rinker, also provide them some mellow mushroom pizza)**
*   **SIF Event with Jim Murray just this past Tuesday**
    *   **Jim and I met with ten students to give a more detailed background on the SIF and answer any questions. The event was a hit and the students sought me out before I was even able to ask for feedback to tell me how much they enjoyed the experience and their desire to have Jim’s explanation shared with more students.**

**II. What’s Happening**

*   **Student Interest in the SIF**
    *   **I said this yesterday, so I apologize to those of you who are hearing this twice, but there has been a noticeable shift in the student mindset about the SIF from one of distrust and anger to one of interest and excitement. I’d like to pause here and thank Jim again for participating in the Tuesday event and Melody for her meeting a few weeks ago with the Student Council.**
    *   **Students are interested in having a voice in the process and specifically, they are focused on having a voice in advising on projects that would impact the student experience and academics. I am meeting with student council members on Sunday to work together on this idea. After our meeting, I believe student council intends to submit a proposal to the Board of any changes they would like to see in the SIF process to involve a student voice.**
*   **Communication**
    *   **I have received a great deal of feedback from students that they feel disconnected and sometimes suspicious of the BOV.**
    *   **I want to tell you all that I take responsibility for this sentiment and that it is my goal over the next year to change that perception.**
    *   **In my effort to identify and improve channels of communication between myself and students, I have another meeting on Sunday with student council’s executive committee to brainstorm ways to improve the flow of information both from the myself/BOV to students and from students to the myself/BOV.**

**III. What’s Coming up**

*   **Forums/Events**
    *   **Students would like to see more forums and events with BOV members and administration.**
    *   **I would like to pause and thank Barbara Fried, Elizabeth Cranwell & Pat Hogan for already indicating interest to host forums around Diversity & Inclusion and Safety at UVA. I’d also like to thank President Sullivan for her planned meeting with the student council on Tuesday.**
        *   **I would also like to pause here and note that in addition to our most diverse faculty hiring last year for the entire University, this year’s entering Darden class has the highest percent of women and domestic minority students that they have ever had. And the law school has the highest percent of LGBTQ students in this year’s class.**
    *   **To follow on that point of increasing our diversity, students have indicated that at other forums, they are interested in discussing the support for diverse students once they matriculate at UVA, tuition information and an explanation of how capital projects are established.**
*   **Student Committee for Bicentennial Campaign**
    *   **Before I explain the next item that’s going to happen, I have to say kudos to Mark Luellen who was smart enough to buy me breakfast before he asked for my help, and I’m always more agreeable when I’m not hungry.**
    *   **Mark came to me with an interest of involving students in the Bicentennial Campaign and after our meeting, we came up with the idea of having a student committee that will advise the campaign. This committee will have its first meeting in November and I’m so appreciative of Mark’s willingness to integrate students into the fabric of the Bicentennial Campaign.**
*   **Presidential Senate**
    *   **At the last meeting in June, I told the Board about the Presidential Senate, which is a group of 125 student leaders from all different organizations that the Student Council President, Emily Lodge, brings together to discuss student issues and vote on the issue of the month.**
    *   **The first meeting of the Presidential Senate for this school year will be Sept 25th at 8pm in Newcomb ballroom and any BOV members have an open invitation to attend.**
    *   **The two topics that will be presented at this meeting are DivestUVA and gender neutral housing. I have a one-page description of the history of the Senate and a more in-depth description of the Sept topics that I will have Susan or Debbie email out to the BOV members.**

**In summary I want to conclude my report with 3 main takeaways:**

1.  **I will be working with student council this weekend to discuss a proposal for student involvement in the SIF grant process.**
2.  **I will also be working with student council on ways to establish/improve communication channels between the myself, the BOV and students.**
3.  **I will continue to work on planning forums & events with BOV members and students.**

**If there are any questions, I’m happy to answer them. Thank you.**

**Comments by the Faculty Senate Chair**

**Ms. Margaret “Mimi” Riley made the following comments on behalf of the Faculty Senate:**

**I would like to begin my remarks by thanking you once again for the Visioning Session in which more than 60 faculty members participated during the August Retreat. I’ve now had a chance to speak with many of the participants and can confirm what I think we already knew—it was a resounding success. A lot of credit goes to Mike Lenox—and of course, my colleague, Nina Solenski. And Susan Harris had a lot of organizing to do. But most of the credit probably goes to Mr. Goodwin—and I think Mr. O’Connor--who conceived of the idea and made it happen. The faculty enjoyed getting to know you and having you get to know them. Having Board members, the President and EVPs, the deans (I think Architecture had 2 deans present!) and faculty, all together was a unique experience. I know it will help us help each other.**

**It would be foolish to assume that the results of an informal 1 ½ hour visioning session should govern future strategy, but I think that some of the themes that resulted from our time together are worth noting and thinking a bit about.**

**First, and this resonated across all of the tables: We all care deeply about our students—both undergraduate and graduate. We’re seeking ways to limit their debt and make education affordable. We want to improve their residential experience and make that experience include learning outside the classroom by bringing faculty into many aspects of their lives. We want them to participate in our research. We want to share community service with them. We want them to think hard about what the Jeffersonian ideal of the educated citizen might mean in the twenty-first century.**

**Although many institutions of higher education are drifting away from liberal arts, participants in our session wanted to “double down” on one of our strengths—our liberal arts curriculum. That of course does not mean staying where we are but instead thinking about what a twenty-first century liberal arts education might mean. We talked about breaking down disciplinary boundaries and creating STEM and non-STEM collaborations and integrating liberal arts with professional certifications. We seek more interdisciplinary collaboration. We talked about flexible classrooms and pedagogy that would provide diverse experiences. We emphasized that education in the twenty-first century must include considerable global experience and that we must continue to seek international partnerships.**

**We talked about redefining the role of the faculty and investing in supporting faculty so that they could capitalize on new funding mechanisms and research opportunities as they arise. This may mean building new partnerships with entities like foundations, perhaps crowd-sourcing and other untapped sources. This is a place where faculty can learn a great deal through closer collaboration with Board members.**

**We achieved all of this in a short 1.5 hour session. I think that Mike Lenox said we were prodigies. But I think one reason we could do it is that we’re all thinking about this all the time. It’s in our Cornerstone Plan and we are building on it every day. What was different is that we were given the opportunity to think about it together. And that, these days, is a rare occurrence and one we cannot celebrate enough.**

**Faculty leaders were pleased to be at the hearing in Richmond on the Strategic Investment Fund on August 26. I would have been there myself if I had not had a conflict—but I was there in spirit. We were even more pleased with the result—and we hope that it means that we can now move forward. We have urgent needs and we hope to get started. That said, there is continued confusion among faculty about the Strategic Investment Fund. This confusion tends not to center on the issues that have been in the press but rather on the future—how the funds will be distributed and used. For example, faculty want to know whether there will be funds to build research infrastructure and IT support that are desperately needed now. Who will coordinate these efforts? I have been involved in some of this process myself, so I know how difficult it is, but I hope that we can bring greater clarity soon. I also want to echo something that Nina emphasized last year. While we think about future strategy, I hope that we will not forget the faculty we already have. We have brilliant researchers and gifted teachers who must be recognized and supported even as we welcome new brilliant researchers and new gifted teachers to our Grounds.**

**As we plan for the Bicentennial, I hope that you will think of the faculty as partners in that endeavor. We have amazingly loyal alumni and much of that loyalty is founded on the relationships that they built with faculty sometimes many years ago. Use us as partners as we build on those bonds and explore new opportunities. We hope that we can learn from you in this process and that you will learn from us.**

**Finally, now that you know us better, come and visit us where we work. Come to our laboratories and classrooms. We will welcome you.**

**Closed Session Friday, September 16, 2016**

**After adopting the following motion made by Mr. Macfarlane and duly seconded, the voting members present plus Nina Solenski, M.D., Phoebe Willis, Teresa Sullivan, Patrick Hogan, Thomas C. Katsouleas, Richard P. Shannon, M.D., Susan G. Harris, Roscoe C. Roberts, David W. Martel, Debra D. Rinker, Nancy A. Rivers, and Farnaz F. Thompson participated in a closed session beginning at 8:40 a.m.:**

**I move that the Board of Visitors go into closed session to consult with legal counsel about specific legal matters, namely; (1) University-sponsored retirement plans, such as the University’s 401(a) and 403(b) plans, lawsuits challenging the administration of such plans, and the possibility of litigation against the University with respect to the administration of these plans; (2) a Notice of Claim filed alleging constitutional, statutory and Common Law claims against the University; (3) the application of the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces Final Rule; (4) an NCAA compliance matter involving several athletic coaches; and (5) compliance with the Freedom of Information Act. In addition, to review and discuss with the Provost and other members of the administration proposed personnel actions including faculty and executive staff hires, promotions, special salary actions, and resignations. The relevant exemptions are Sections 2.2-3711(A)(1) and (7) of the Code of Virginia.**

**At 9:05 a.m., the Board left closed session and, on the following motion made by Mr. Macfarlane, all members present certified by roll call vote that the deliberations in closed session had been conducted in accordance with the exemptions permitted by the Virginia Freedom of Information Act. The members voting in the affirmative were Mr. Goodwin, Mr. Conner, Mr. Bowles, Dr. Britt (by telephone), Mr. Clement, Ms. Cranwell, Mr. DePasquale, Mr. Fay, Ms. Fried, Mr. Genovese, Mr. Griffin, Dr. Lateef, Mr. Macfarlane, Ms. Murphy, Mr. Murray, Mr. Reyes, and Mr. Walker.

**Strategic Investment Fund**

**Rector Goodwin opened the meeting. He said the process may not be perfect and not everyone will be pleased, but it is evolving. He mentioned the ad hoc committee meeting that was held on Wednesday to talk about process. He said the proposals on the table pre-dated the Strategic Investment Fund organization, and were related to the budget process. This is unlikely to be the way funding is determined in the future. He mentioned the five-member faculty committee that is screening proposals, with John Jeffries as chair. This group spent a great deal of time over the summer and forwarded the proposals to the advisory committee, which now includes the President, the Rector, the Vice Rector, a former Board member, the Provost, the Chief Operating Officer, and the Executive Vice President for Health Affairs. There is another slot open which may not be filled. Pace Lochte is staffing this committee.**

**The Rector said the University should have the ability to make itself better, and do what is best for the students, the faculty, the staff, and the alumni of the University. He said he hoped that if the Board does the right thing, the press and the legislature will come around and see that they are trying to do what is best for the University.**

**Mr. Goodwin asked Mr. Jeffries to say a few words; he explained the faculty committee’s evaluation process. Mr. Conner then reported on the ad hoc committee’s progress. He said he thought they had developed a good process which will undergo formal review for the next three years. He said that students may make proposals — even one student may make a proposal, and they would develop a mechanism for students to have input.**

**Mr. Conner outlined the requirements for a proposal: the grants are for three years with rigorous review every year, and the projects must be transformational. The grants are not perpetual, so a project must become self-sustaining over three years. There are four “buckets” in which proposals fit, called grant allocation classes. They are Access and Affordability, Research, Research Support Infrastructure, and Academic Experience. Access and Affordability proposals were received and they were good but disparate. He said the committee wanted to make sure they dealt with things on a holistic, consistent basis.**

**Mr. Conner mentioned some messages he received that indicated a lack of understanding about how Access UVA works now. He said the University does not include home equity and retirement savings in determining family assets, but savings for college are included. This will be reviewed further. He said there is also a misunderstanding about the term “philanthropy.” Philanthropy includes permanent philanthropy, i.e. endowment or a permanent funding source, not just annual giving.**

**Mr. Goodwin commented on his interactions with legislators about the Strategic Investment Fund. He said they have differing agendas; some legislators want to keep tuition increases at inflation or below, others want an increase in in-state enrollment, and others want the University to find other ways to raise the $2,000 increase in tuition that is used to fund Access UVA--they are interested in a reduced tuition for everyone and are less focused on financial aid. In general, the legislators have been helpful and supportive of the University.**

**A discussion ensued among Visitors who expressed opinions about the high level performance of the management of the University, which has been perceived by some as a negative; concerns about going ahead with funding when the Strategic Investment Fund program is still evolving and current proposals are from only three of the grant allocation classes; and questions about whether the purpose is to make a transformational change in the University. There was some support for devoting a good part of the discussion of funding in December on the access and affordability grant allocation class. The comment was made that there are some important issues in the pipeline and the Board has yet to address them. The Rector asked that members be open-minded about the process and steps.**

**Mr. Macfarlane reminded the Board that the principal assets in the fund will not be spent, only a percentage of their investment earnings will be available, and that the fund is subject to market risk.**

**President Sullivan reviewed the proposals in some detail. The Advisory Group recommends funding 13 proposals out of the original 39. They touch on Research, Research Support/Infrastructure, and Academic Experience. The proposals are explained in depth in the Strategic Investment Fund — September 2016 binder which is attached to these Minutes.**

**Dr. Lateef recommended adding to the draft resolution a statement that other pillars will be addressed in future meetings, and others wondered if the proposals should be acted on or tabled until December. Ms. Willis would like to see more advertising of the process for making proposals, and an opportunity for students to make proposals.**

**Mr. Goodwin clarified that the $26 million is over three years —they are cumulative amounts. Ms. Fried asked to amend the motion to include a provision that Access and Affordability will be considered in December and that students will have the opportunity to make recommendations.**

**Mr. Macfarlane asked about the costs of waiting until December. Mr. Katsouleas said many of the items on the list are critically important and several of them have limited windows of opportunity because of outside funding and other pending commitments. Mr. Macfarlane expressed reservations about one item on the list, merit scholarships for Darden, because it does not have the same strategic importance as many of the other items. He was concerned about the precedent-setting nature of this first vote. Mr. Goodwin assured members that they will continue to reevaluate and so everything about future proposals is completely open.**

**After some further discussion, a motion was made and duly seconded to approve an amended resolution. Mr. Macfarlane voted against the amended motion; all other members present voted in favor of the following motion:**

**Presentations**

**Two transformational ideas were presented: Dr. Shannon spoke about research at the University seeking a cure for type 1 diabetes, and Mr. Katsouleas addressed research in the area of Cyber Physical Systems.**

**Dr. Shannon presented first: the focus is on regenerating pancreatic cells which produce insulin and are destroyed by the disease through inflammation. Type 1 diabetes is a disease of autoimmunity which requires an environmental trigger and affects 100,000 children in Virginia. A University researcher developed the artificial pancreas, which is the leading new therapeutic approach to treating type 1 diabetes. Another physician researcher has discovered the single locus on a chromosome that predicts half the risk, and the other half of the risk is through a DNA coding mechanism that affects the immune system. The trigger, cytomegalovirus, was also discovered by this physician. The proposal is to screen every child in Virginia under the age of 5 for the risk of type 1 diabetes, and to develop the capability of regenerating beta cells. This will require hiring two new faculty. In answer to a question about fundraising in New York, he said Mt. Sinai is one of the medical centers using University technologies in treating type 1 diabetes.**

**Mr. Katsouleas and Professor Kamin Whitehouse spoke about the University’s opportunity to lead in the area of Cyber Physical Systems, or “the Internet of Things”. The University already has significant presence in this area, Ben Calhoun’s work as an example. Mr. Whitehouse said there is significant federal funding in this area because of its national importance. The Rector pointed out that the Board just authorized some funding.**

**Final Session, Friday, September 16, 2016**

**All voting members, save Mr. Clement, were present. Dr. Britt participated by telephone. Mr. Goodwin reminded the members of the Board that all items were presented in committee and are contained in their materials. Following the reading of the titles of the consent and action items, the Secretary called the roll. All members present voted in the affirmative: Mr. Goodwin, Mr. Conner, Mr. Bowles, Dr. Britt (by telephone), Ms. Cranwell, Mr. DePasquale, Mr. Fay, Ms. Fried, Mr. Genovese, Mr. Griffin, Dr. Lateef, Mr. Macfarlane, Ms. Murphy, Mr. Murray, Mr. Reyes, and Mr. Walker.**
