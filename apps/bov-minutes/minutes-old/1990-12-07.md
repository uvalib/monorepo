THE RECTOR AND VISITORS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA December 7-8, 1990
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia met as a Committee of the Whole at 1:30 p.m., in Open Session on Friday, December 7, 1990, in the East Oval Room of the Rotunda with Edward E. Elson, President John T. Casteen, III, W. L. Lyons Brown, Jr., Robert G. Butcher, Jr., N. Thomas Connally, Hovey S. Dabney, Waller H. Horsley, J. Thomas Hulvey, Evans B. Jessee, Arnold H. Leon, Julie G. Lynn, Leigh B. Middleditch, Jr., Elizabeth D. Morie, Freddie W. Nicholas, Sr., S. Buford Scott, and Jesse B. Wilson, III. Absent: Mrs. Patricia M. Kluge and Thomas E. Worrell, Jr. Messrs. Ernest H. Ern, Don E. Detmer, Hugh P. Kelly, Raymond M. Haas, James J. Mingle, Leonard W. Sandridge, Jr., and Alexander G. Gilliam, Jr., were also present.

The Minutes of the meeting of October 5, 1990, previously distributed, were approved as corrected.

MOTION FOR EXECUTIVE SESSION
----------------------------

The following motion was unanimously adopted: That the Board of Visitors reconvene in Executive Session, following its discussion of University budgetary matters, for the purpose of discussing the condition and value of certain real property identified for possible acquisition and exchange, for the benefit and use of the University, as provided for in Section 2.1-344A (3) of The Code of Virginia.

DISCUSSION OF THE ARTS AND SCIENCES CURRICULUM
----------------------------------------------

Provost Hugh P. Kelly talked briefly about some effects of efforts of the State and the University to provide cost containment for our programs. He advised that in the past some programs which were not sufficiently productive were discontinued.

Mr. Bice then reported on the assignment of Pavilions and Montebello to faculty members for residences. He pointed out the fact that Deans have been reluctant to move to the Pavilions because of financial problems and the restrictive nature of our procedure. He urged the Board to reconsider its present assignment priorities and conditions of assignment, particularly since the age "cap" has been removed from the retirement provisions for faculty. A program of urging furniture donation for the historic buildings was discussed.

Mr. Casteen commended Dean Porter for his plan to use his Pavilion (Pavilion IX) for seminars to be attended by students.

There was a brief discussion of provisions for the handicapped. Mr. Haas advised that there is federal funding for handicapped facilities.

In conclusion, there was an extended discussion of how the Board might oversee the planning of buildings to assure the good character of the architecture.

FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS
------------------------

Vice President Sandridge advised that the budget for 1990-92 is down some $40 million. An additional five percent cut may take effect. He outlined a number of cost containment projects including a two percent across the board salary cut for faculty, stopping faculty travel, leaving faculty slots unfilled (20 to 25 of them), placing a hold on purchase of computers, and others. Mr. Kelly said that though necessary, that this is discouraging.

Dr. Detmer said that though morale of the faculty is still good, it may decline as the result of cuts.

Mr. Sandridge noted that there is a human element which must be considered when dealing with dedicated faculty and staff. Dr. Detmer said that the basic science section of medical education is the most adversely affected. He noted that the high retention rate in nursing has saved on recruitment costs.

RESOLUTION HONORING RAYMOND C. BICE, JR.
----------------------------------------

The following resolution was adopted: WHEREAS, Raymond C. Bice, Jr., has served the Board of Visitors ably and with devotion during the twenty-one years since his election as Secretary of the Board in 1969; andWHEREAS, Mr. Bice has served the University for over forty years as a member of the Faculty, as Dean of Admissions, and as an Administrator, but above all as a friend and advisor to students, faculty, and to Board Members alike; andWHEREAS, Mr. Bice will retire as Secretary at the end of 1990;NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that the Board recognizes and thanks Mr. Bice for his distinguished service to the University, his devoted attention to the Board, and his friendship and guidance to its Members during his term of office. The Board notes with gratitude that although Mr. Bice will retire as Secretary at the end of this year, he will not retire from the Faculty; the Board hopes that the University may continue for many years to benefit from Mr. Bice's wisdom and knowledge.Mr. Bice acknowledged the resolution with thanks.

On motion, the meeting adjourned at 3:05 p.m.
