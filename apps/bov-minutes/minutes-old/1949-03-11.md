The President presented to the Board a request by the Director of the Army ROTC Transportation Unit for instructions concerning the use of the University seal on a flag. It was agreed to be acceptable to the Board for the seal, when so used, to be woven in gold.

The report of the Hospital Accounts Committee recommending the writing off of schedules 10, 12, 17, 19, 25, 27, 28-B, 31, 33, 35, 37, 38, 44, and 46 was approved, in accordance with resolution adopted by the Board on December 10, 1948.

The first monthly report of the Bursar, covering the period July 1, 1948 - February 28, 1949, was presented.

A proposal by the Executive Committee of the Hospital to use approximately $12,000 of the income from the Rucker Fund to provide a new formula room which will insure the sanitary preparation of babies' formulas was approved. This proposal had been recommended by the Executive Committee of the Hospital and the Dean of the Medical School.

The Board authorized the extension of the present hospitalization program for employees of the University to provide coverage for wage and hourly employees who are not now eligible for benefits under this plan.

The report of the Finance Committee for the period January 25, 1948 to January 25, 1949 was presented by Mr. Black, Chairman, and was accepted by the Board. Action on the report was deferred until the next meeting to give the members of the Board an opportunity to study the report. The introductory summary prepared by the Committee is spread below.

The Finance Committee herewith submits a detailed report of all of the actions of the agent, State-Planters Bank and Trust Company, Richmond, Virginia, for the period January 25, 1948, to January 25, 1949.

This attached report speaks for itself as to all of the transactions in connection with the handling of the Consolidated Endowment Funds for the above period.

However, there are certain outstanding features and comparisons which the Committee desires to bring to the attention of the Board.

During 1948 a large amount of inherited securities were turned over to the Consolidated Endowment Fund. It became necessary to sell many of these securities in order to strengthen the portfolio. From these transactions there resulted a book value lose of $35,322.27. However, this book value loss was more than offset by additions to the portfolio. As of January 25, 1948 the book value of all of the securities was $4,560,245.47. As of January 1, 1949, the book value of all of the securities was $5,076,440.00.

The steady process of eliminating small units and those securities which for one reason or another were not considered as proper for retention has continued. In all $504,663.24 of securities have been sold.

They have been replaced by other securities and these replacements have shown an improved yield of 3.94% as compared with a yield of 3.30% on those sold. Some securities of prime quality have been sold such as the large block of City of Baltimore and County of Prince George bonds. But here the purpose has been to recapture a premium of $6,000.00.

There have also been certain issues which have either matured or been called.

The replacements have in the main been additions to units already held. Those new securities added have been of a conservative nature mainly insurance company and utility preferreds with one railroad preferred.

For the period covered by this report (January 25, 1948, to January 25, 1949) there was turned over to the Bursar the sum of $189,183.33 net income, after all deductions and expenses. This compares with $173,397.00 for the corresponding period in the previous year (January 25, 1947 to January 25, 1948) although of course, there were substantial additions to the fund during 1948.

The actual yield improved to a figure of 4.02% (on a monthly weighted average of the book value - giving a weight of 12 to the first month of the year and declining to a weight of 1 to the last month of the year - in order to give proper consideration to the additions to the book value at various times during the year). While we do not have an exact comparison with last year on a similar monthly weighted average, yet the gross yield last year as related to book value was 3.98%.

This improvement in yield has not resulted from any decided shift in the character of the investments. The percentages as to taxes, bonds, stocks, etc., remain only slightly changed. Diversification has been improved.

Attention is called to the fact that restrictions have been placed upon the sale of many of the securities in the portfolio. These have been to a limited extent identified by letters on the margin of the agency report, attached hereto. It is planned to elaborate on the meaning of these identification marks. Of course restrictions placed upon the sale of these securities by the donors, or otherwise must be honored. However, the Finance Committee desires to convey the thought that under certain circumstances in the interest of strengthening the portfolio these securities should be sold, a step which we are barred from taking.

It is the opinion of the Finance Committee that the steps taken during the period covered by this report have strengthened and bettered the position of the Consolidated Endowment Funds.

Upon recommendation of the Dean of the Law School, as a result of a poll of the students, the Board authorized the continued publication of the Virginia Law Weekly and increased the session fee charged from $3.00 to $4.00, effective at the beginning of the session of 1949-50.

The Special Committee of the Board appointed to study regulations of the National Collegiate Athletic Association reported, recommending that no action be taken at this time, pending further study. The President requested the members of the Committee to attend a special meeting concerning this matter, to be held during the early part of April, at which representatives of other Virginia institutions would be present.

The President once again called the attention of the Board to the necessity of having an early decision reached concerning the Development Fund. The Chairman of the Development Fund Committee, Mr. Anderson, stated that he had been absent from the last meeting of the Board and had not had an opportunity to call a meeting of his Committee to consider the matter

The Board approved the awarding of the bid for additions to the Law School Building to the Harry B. Graham Company, as recommended by letter from Mr. Frank E. Hartman, Director of the Department of Buildings and Grounds, set forth below

We hand you herewith Tabulated List of Bids received on the Additions to the Law Building today, both on general construction and library stack equipment, and beg to advise that the low bidder on the general contract, accepting Alternate #2 is Harry B. Graham Company, at their bid of $215,266.00.

We also hand you a Tabulated List showing Appropriation and other pertinent facts, from which you will note that we will have left for the general contract $232,696.00

By accepting this bid there will be a balance of $17,430.00 out of the present Appropriation, which may enable us to do some additional work in the shell of the East Wing

We recommend the Award of the General Contract to the Harry B. Graham Company

There being no further business to come before the meeting, the same was adjourned after a motion to that effect had been made, seconded, and carried
