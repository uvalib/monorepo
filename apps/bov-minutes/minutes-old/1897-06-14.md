Resolved: That the report of the Executive Committee touching the work of building and restoration dated May 14th 1897, be and the same is received and approved, and that said Committee be authorized and requested to proceed with said work of building and restoration as specified in the contract of May 26th 1896 with Chas E. Langley & Co which contract it is understood has been abandoned by said Langley & Co. as shown in said report: and to this end the said Committee may make all such arrangements and contracts as they may deem proper for the completion of the work and may make such modifications in the plans and specifications of the architects as they may deem judicious; and may re-let the whole of said uncompleted work; or may relet the same in part and finish it in part by day labor with materials furnished by them; or may finish the whole thereof by day labor as aforesaid; and any such day labor shall be under such supervision as they may appoint. And said Committee shall obtain from said Architects all such information and advice as they may be able to furnish touching a solution of the questions involved. But nothing herein contained shall be construed as releasing or authorizing the release of any person or persons whomsoever from any demand or claim for damages in favor of this corporation arising or growing out of said contract or any breach thereof or out of any transaction had or work done in connection therewith by any person or persons whomsover, but all such demands and claims are hereby fully reserved.

The Report of the Committee is hereinafter inserted as part of the minutes of this meeting:

To/ The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia:-

Your Executive Committee beg leave to make the following report with respect to the buildings in process of erection and restoration at the University.

The Board is already cognizant of the fact that the whole of this work was let in one contract of May 26th. 1896 for $269,440. to Chas.E.Langley & Co. who were the lowest bidders and came to the Committee well recommended.

Under this contract Langley & Co. were to receive monthly payments of 85 per cent of the value of the work done from month to month as estimated by the Architects in charge and the University was to furnish them certain materials for the work, viz: brick, sand and lime, at a stipulated price.

For the seven months ending Jan'y.31st.1897 the architects had certified this 85 per cent to be $165,945.96, the estimates for the latter part of that period running between 25 and 30,000$ per month. There were furnished to Langley & Co. during this period materials as above stated to the amount of $16,524.03 with which they were chargeable and materials were subsequently furnished them to the amount of $7980.38.. making $24,504.41......... of materials furnished them in all.

The architects failed, however, to allow Langley & Co. any estimates for the months of February and March, alleging that the accounts and requisitions of Langley & Co., were not in proper shapeand that previous estimates needed revision; nor indeed were any further estimates allowed on the work as it progressed until May 13th. In the meantime, however, the work was continued by L. & Co. at about the same rate of expenditure of labor and materials as theretofore.

In this state of affairs Langley & Co., made appeals to your Committee for some advancement on these estimates so withheld, stating that they were wholly unable to carry on the work unless some payment were made them as contemplated in the contract; and the architects by two letters, both of April 2nd. advised your Committee to make such advancement to the amount of $25,000.00, even though it should encroach to some extent upon the 15 per cent reserve, because as the contract approached completion the reserve had accumulated to such an extent that it would be wise to encroach upon it rather than have the contractors stop work, and it was believed that the work to be done for the month of April would much more than restore the reserve, if encroached upon.

But before making any advancement your Committee directed that the account against the contractors, Langley & Co. for materials furnished amounting to $24,504.41............. should be held in abeyance and not be charged up against them in full upon estimates allowed; so that the $25,000.00 which it was proposed to advance or pay the contractors could be applied solely as a payment upon these 85 per cent estimates of the architects; and the amount due for materials applied so as first to cover any balance on said 85 per cent estimates and then the remainder thereof, if any, held against the reserve on final settlement.

Your Committee accordingly under these circumstances made the advancement of $25,000.00 and it was confidently expected by your Committee under the statements and advice of the architects, with whom they had a personal conference on the 8th. May, that the estimates for February, March and April would be some 50 or 60,000.$ and fully restore the reserve, satisfy the account for materials and leave a working fund for the contractors.

Contrary to expectation, however, the estimate which was made for this period and which is dated May 13th. shows only the sum of $14,254.04 for these three months; it having been diminished to this amount, as the Architects state, by reason of over-estimates allowed earlier in the work.

So that by the architects statement the matter would stand as of May 1st as follows.

Work was continued by the contractors until May 15th. but notices having been served upon the University by parties claiming as subcontractors and supply men against Langley & Co. to the amount of about $43,000. under Sec. 2479 of the Code of Virginia no further payment to L. & Co. under the contract was possible; and May 15th. being their pay day and they being wholly unable to meet their pay roll and some 150 laborers being about to be left upon the grounds without means of subsistance or of getting away (they having received no wages since April 1st) and Langley & Co. offering to surrender their contract and tools and materials on the ground, without litigation as threatened, if the University would advance $4,500. to meet their pay rolls, which sum they offered to secure by deed of trust upon all their tools, material and plant on the ground. Your Committee accepted their offer and a surrender of their contract and made the advance upon the deed of trust as stated, all of which is shown by an agreement of May 15th. with the trust deed attached which are of record in Albemarle County. The work done from May 1st. to the 15th. should also be noted in connection with this last advance.

Your Committee took this action under the advice of Counsel and in view of the hopeless insolvency of Langley & Co. they are satisfied it was for the best interests of the University. They will add that the original contract of May 26th. 1896 provided in its 5th. Clause for the University taking possession of the work and completing it upon the Architects' certificate in certain contingencies and they have proceeded strictly in accordance with this provision.

They have made agreements with two of the sub-contractors to complete the work upon which they were engaged, viz: with R. Guastivino for the completion of certain tile roofing and flooring which will amount to probably $1100.00 and with John R. Williams & Co., for the completion of the slate roofs upon the four buildings at the foot of the lawn at an approximate cost of $2,250. This work, however, is at a certain rate per foot, subject to measurement.

Your Committee also deemed it best to at once continue the day work which was being done by Langley & Co., but have employed in this only some 75 instead of 140 or 150 men as formerly. This work is progressing well and satisfactorily.

It will be observed from the foregoing figures that the amount within which the work should be completed, if the original contract be carried out, is approximately $100,000.00. The architects have taken an inventory and had a survey made of the uncompleted work and received some bids for the completion thereof; but these bids, which were coupled with offers from the sub-contractors for the completion of their respective portions of the work, were very considerably in excess of the amount which would have been necessary to complete the work under the original contract and your Committee have refsued to consider them. The Architects are now engaged through their best experts in making the most exhaustive statement possible of the condition of the incomplete work and the best way to deal with it. Your committee scarcely expect that it can be completed in full for the above named $100,000. because the original contract was at very low rates, but they anticipate some loss by reason of Langley & Co's. failure, this, however, they believe should be a very slight one; and, indeed, they hope that by eliminating some portions of the work which can be dispensed with without material inconvenience it may be kept within the contract price.

They recommend that the Rotunda, which is the most nearly finished of any of the buildings, should be pressed to completion first.

And they are also chargeable with the cost of the temporary railroad track laid to the University grounds. And further under the terms of their original contract they are chargeable with all the cost and expense of completing the whole unfinished work undertaken in said contract, no matter what loss may be involved therein.

May 14th. 1897.

Respectfully submitted.

\* \*Pages 160-162 are removed It appearing from the Report of the Proctor that the sum of Thirteen thousand seven hundred and Eighteen 12/100 dollars ($13,718.12) is on deposit in bank belonging to the sinking fund but uninvested, and it further appearing that the Fayerweather bequest has been assured to the University by the decision of the Court of last resort of the State of New York and while the same is invested in interest bearing funds it is not immediately available for distribution; and it further appearing that moneys are needed for the restoration fund to which the Fayerweather bequest would be applicable if collected and in hand, and that the sinking fund would be safely invested if placed in the Fayerweather fund and pro tanto the securities held by and representing the same:

Pages 160-162 are removed

Resolved: That so much of the Fayerweather fund as would fully represent and cover the said sinking fund with 6 per cent interest thereon from date be transferred, set aside and appropriated to the said sinking fund as an investment thereof and the said amount of uninvested money in bank be transferred to said restoration fund; and whenever the amount of the sinking fund so invested in said Fayerweather fund shall be paid in money the same shall be forthwith invested by the Proctor as provided by the regulations of the Board. And it is hereby expressly intended and declared that this shall be an investment of said sinking fund and by no means an infringement thereon or an appropriation thereof to uses not contemplated by law or the regulations of the University. This resolution is passed after advising with the Counsel of the Board.

The Secretary will, and he is hereby directed to record on the Minutes of this meeting the Proctor's report above referred to.

Said report is in the following words and figures, to wit:

I have the honor to submit to you a report of the financial transactions of the University, for the fiscal year ending June 30th, 1897. As preface, permit me to say, that my lamented predecessor and myself were close friends and comrades in arms during the war. Both on the field and in Camp Green Peyton was always, and everywhere a brave and efficient soldier. Wherever placed in life, he proved himself a man of intellect, attainments, energy and force of character. His ill health for many months before his death, together with the increased work incident to the receipt and disbursement of a large restoration fund, caused his accounts to be left in an unfinished condition. Thoroughly conversant with the peculiar character of the University accounts, by a service as Proctor for twenty seven years, he found no need to record many facts which were safely stored in his own mind, but not immediately accessible to a new incumbent. So, too with a memory singularly tenacious, he left no correspondence for he felt the need of none His cash-book and ledger were his letter-press and letter-file.

I took official charge of the Proctor's Office May 1, 1897. A committee appointed by a full Board of Visitors, was instructed to examine thoroughly the accounts to date, and were empowered to employ an expert to assist them. A report by the Committee and expert will doubtless be furnished you.

The same Committee was also instructed to make an inventory of the bonds held by the University, and a list of them is herewith submitted. These bonds are kept in the Bank of Albemarle, and People's National Bank, Charlottesville, under two locks, one key of each being in the hands of the Officers of said banks, and one in the keeping of the Proctor.

As compared with the annual report of last year, 1895-6, the inventory list of bonds shows that the Va 3's, with the exception of those in the John Y. Mason Fellowship Fund, have been sold. It is understood here that Major Peyton's intention was to sell all the Va 3's in the sinking fund, then bearing a good price, and re-invest in Va 2s (Century) bonds at a lower price, in order to anticipate their rise in value and interest, at the beginning of the coming century. The proceeds of these sales are in the Banks in Charlottesville, in which the deposits and accounts are directed by the Board to be kept. No doubt the Board at this meeting will designate the securities in which the money shall be reinvested.

The Richmond & Danville gold 6's, and the Atlanta & Charlotte 7's of the Astronomical Department were sold in accordance with the order of the Board, and reinvested in 153, five hundred dollars bonds ($76,500.) of the 5% new University bonds. Notwithstanding the premium at which the Richmond & Danville 6's, and the Atlanta & Charlotte 7's, were sold, there is a small loss of interest per annum, ($15500) to the Astronomical Department, on account of the lower interest of the 5% new University Bonds. All the 400 new University 5% bonds (500. each) have been sold and interest is paid semi-annually, May 1st, and November 1st, to the Va Trust Company for the holders.

The $7,500. of interest on the $200,000 new University Bonds, prior to July 1, 1896, collected in accordance with the general appropriation bill of March 1896, has been divided in the tabular statement below, and $2000. placed to the Sinking Fund, in accordance with the action of the Board, April 26, 1896. The remaining $5,500. is specified in the table as a Reserve fund, and the Board will doubtless designate its proper application.

The attention of the Board is invited to an inclosed letter from Profr Kent, showing $797.31 due the English Literature school under the specific conditions of the gift made by Mrs Leita Kent in her endowment of the Linden Kent Memorial School of English Literature.

I have examined the ledger of the year mentioned and am of the opinion that the sum should be paid back to the school.

Under the authority of Sec. 242, page 46 of the Laws of the laws of the University of Virginia, 1892, I engaged the services of Mr I. K. Moran, a clerk of experience, from the middle of May till the middle of June, having previously employed him from May 1st, to the middle of the month at my own expense. He has worked most faithfully and efficiently day, and part of the night at times, and I ask that he be liberally rewarded.

Two handsome subscriptions were procured by Profr W. M. Thornton on a recent visit to Boston, one of a thousand dollars from Augustus Hemenway, Esq, and one of five thousand dollars from T. Jefferson Coolidge, Esq.

It will be necessary for the Board to consider and decide the question as to the quantity of fuel for another year. If the new rooms are to be heated, the estimate of previous years will be misleading. I have found Mr Skinner, the Supervising architect, well informed as to the capacity and requirements of the boilers for heating a part, or all of the new rooms, and the quantity of coal required respectively.

Itemized statements of various accounts is appended.

The following is a copy of a special report of the Proctor in regard to the Sinking Fund.

In reply to the resolution of the Board I beg to send herewith a copy from the Ledger showing the record there by Major Peyton in reference to the Sinking Fund accounts, but as there is little information to be gained from this transcript of his Ledger account, I have thought proper to add the following as my understanding of the account referred to.

Old Debt

The sinking fund bonds on hand as shown by the inventory taken by the Committee on May 26th are as follows, (in the Bank of Albemarle):

If the Sinking Fund account of the late Proctor, as shown on page 14 appendix is correct, the cash on hand to the credit of the Old Sinking Fund ought to be what would be represented by the sale of the $10,500. face value Va 3s. Section 1555 Laws of the University of Virginia, 1892, reads as follows: "Out of said appropriation of forty thousand dollars, there shall be first set apart, annually, the sum of seven thousand two hundred and twenty dollars, to pay the interest accruing on the existing interest-bearing debt of the University (amounting to seventy nine thousand dollars), and to constitute a sinking fund for the liquidation of the principal of the same; and the said sum of seven thousand two hundred and twenty dollars shall be applied to no other purpose or object whatever".

As to the credit to which the new debt is entitled, you will find on page 5 of the Deed of Trust from the University of Virginia to Virginia Trust Co. as the action \[sic\] of the Rector and Visitors on the 25th day of April 1896, that it was resolved that "said Trust Deed shall further contain a covenant on the part of this corporation for the establishment, setting apart and maintenance of a Sinking Fund of not less than $2000. per annum out of the current revenues of the University to meet and discharge the principal of said bonds".

Statement of Cash to the credit of the Sinking Fund:

Respectfully submitted,

Thos H. Carter, Proctor.

Resolved, that the alumni be allowed to express their views to the Visitors on the question of the expediency of the election of a President for the University, and that the Alumni be requested to express their views within one hour.

A copy of the foregoing resolution was communicated to the Society of Alumni then in session and thereupon a committee from the Society composed of Rev. R. H. McKim, James P. Harrison, Esq and others and were heard by the Board on the question of the expediency of the election of a President for the University.

Mr Gordon moved the addoption of the following resolutions, and that a recorded vote be taken thereon, which was ordered, and upon a call of the roll the resolutions were adopted, the vote thereon being as follows:

Resolved: That while it is the present sense of this Board that the best interests of the University of Va demand the election of an Executive head of the University; yet in order to give the Faculty, the Alumni and the friends of the University ample opportunity for the full, free and untrammelled consideration and discussion of this very important movement, it is resolved that action upon the report of the Special Committee on such executive officer be deferred to a meeting in November 1897, which it is hereby directed that the Rector shall then call.

Resolved: That the Report aforesaid be spread on the minutes; and that Mr Joseph Bryan, the other member of the Committee be allowed to file for recordation after said report, a minority report.

On motion of Mr Gordon the following resolutions in relation to the reports above referred to were adopted.

Resolved: That the Report of the Special Committee on the election of an Executive head of the University, and any minority report thereon that may be filed, be printed in the Alumni Bulletin.

Resolved: That with such publications, the public be notified at the same time and by the same medium that said report will be acted on by the Board at a special meeting to be called in November 1897.

Report of the Committee on the Presidency

To the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia.

The Special Committee appointed by the Visitors at the meeting in June, 1896, to consider the question of creating an executive department of the University, whose official occupant's duties should be confined exclusively to the administration of the government of the University, beg leave to report as follows:

Since the foundation of the University of Virginia by Mr Jefferson, its executive officer has been a Chairman of the Faculty, annually appointed by the Visitors from among the professors. He is charged with superintending the execution of all laws made for the government of the University, and for the government and discipline of the students. For the past few years, this official has been assisted in the latter direction, under resolution of the Visitors, by a Board of Discipline, composed of professors selected from the several departments of the University, whose functions have been construed to be of an advisory character.

Among his numerous duties and responsibilities, the Chairman is, by law, required, to supervise the work of the Proctor, and of all the other subordinate or co-ordinate administrative officers of the institution, and to act as the medium of communication between them and the Visitors; to convene the Faculty, when requested, and to preside at the meetings; to grant leave of withdrawal from the University to offending students; to give written permission to students who have been expelled, suspended or dismissed to enter the University precincts for good cause shown; to apprise parents or guardians of the withdrawal, suspension or expulsion of students; to send monthly circular reports to the parent or guardian of each student, communicating the student's absence from lecture, and such other derelictions as may occur, and apprising them of the general conduct and progress of their sons or wards; to permit students to change their hotels or mess clubs; to grant in writing the use of the public rooms for meetings of students; to report to the Board in session, or to the Rector, on any Visitor, in writing, any matter which he deems likely to affect seriously the interest of the University; to make written reports to the Board at each regular meeting upon the general condition of the University, with recommendations and suggestions as to the adoption of such measures as may commend themselves to his judgment, and may not have been considered by the Faculty; and to keep a regular journal of his proceedings for the benefit of the Executive Committee of the Board and of the Visitors.

A divided authority, however, is shared with Chairman by the Faculty itself, which is in certain directions the supervisory executive body of the University, possessing powers of government and discipline specifically prescribed, and speaking through the Chairman as its mouthpiece, and in other directions wielding an authority only coordinate with, or subordinate to, that possessed by him. And yet, although thus sharing a divided power and authority with the Faculty, the Chairman has constantly upon his shoulders the onus and responsibility, which the Faculty, in a measure, escapes.

Superadded to his duties as a governing agent, many and various as they are often perplexing and disagreeable, the Chairman must, as professor, devote to the work of his classroom, in justice to himself, no less than to his school, such time, care and attention as are required of each other professor in the University.

The plan of government of the University, which has been briefly outlined above, was based upon and grew out of Mr Jefferson's thoroughly democratic spirit and method of thought. He designed to establish here a government of a great educational institution founded upon the fundamental principle on which he based the state, the principle of individual equality and independence. It is no reflection, however, upon the democratic idea, that the changed conditions existing after the lapse of three quarters of a century point out the fact, that the professor who in this day is charged with official duties outside of, and beyond, those necessarily appertaining to his chair, is no longer on an equality with those of his fellow professors not so burdened.

That the system of government as ordained by the founder of the University of Virginia has not heretofore always and successfully met the requirements of the institution cannot be affirmed; but it is a significant fact that while the peculiar system of Education established for the first time on American soil at this University by Mr Jefferson, viz: the Elective System,- has so conspicuously stood the test of time as to compel its introduction into the other leading institutions of learning, where it flourished and progresses with the years, but few have adopted, and none has retained, the peculiar form and principle of government established here at the same time. The University of Texas being the last to abandon it, about a year ago, after an unsatisfactory trial.

Without derogation of either the principle involved, or of its execution as heretofore illustrated in the history of the University of Virginia, your Committee is of the opinion that the conditions now existing in the educational world, radically differing in many respects from those which confronted Mr Jefferson, while emphasising and accentuating to his undiminished glory the wisdom of his elective plan of education, demand a change in the peculiar system of University government established by him.

The tendency of the age in the activities of life is in the direction of specialization, and insistened upon the Scriptural precept that proper service cannot be rendered unto two masters. The German scholar who on his death bed lamented that he had studied both the Greek propositions and , when the shortness of life proved to him that he should have given his thought only to , is an exaggerated illustration of the tendency of modern Science and scholarship no less than of modern business. The University Professor should stick to the work of his professorship—to the duties growing out of his relations with his students— if he would even hold his own, to say nothing of going forward, in the sunset years of the century

Without undertaking to discuss the good or evil of this tendency, we must recognize its existence as a fact. Modern life presses on us in so many phases that he is Herculean indeed who can be great in more than one thing. Competition in the educational world is no less keen than in that of business; and other conditions being equal, that University will be most successful in the race which adds to the best discipline, the best instruction and the best scholarship, also the best business management. Without trenching further on the time of the Board, than to say in this connection that the argument in favor of an independent executive head of the University is not answered by saying that we seek to subvert a Jeffersonian principle: because progress was the breath of life in Mr. Jefferson's nostrils, and insisting further that the creation of such an office is no more a subversion of the principle of professorial equality than we the establishment of the office of Proctor, or that of Superintendent of Grounds and Buildings, and the filling of the offices from men outside the Faculty: we would respectfully submit that in the opinion of Your Committee the growth of the University of Virginia of late years, in the number of its students, in the development of its schools, and in the character of its instruction requires and demands that its government should be in the hands of an officer, who shall be unhampered in the discharge of his administrative duties by the duties of professor;- and that every professor of the University should be left free to devote all his time, energy and talent to the work of his school, without the let or hinderance of University government or business outside of his class-room

To perform the executive duties and offices now imposed by law upon the Chairman, to familiarize himself with the higher education as taught in the best institutions of the world, to suggest wise administrative and other changes to the Visitors, to visit the great cities of the country and arouse and inspire the interest and enthusiasm of our alumni, - these and many other functions should fall properly to the province of such an officer. It would require talents of a peculiar and distinguished order to properly perform them: and the compensation attached to the position should be commensurate with its dignity and importance.

But in enacting legislation of so radical a character as that now advocated by your Committee, they desire it to be clearly indicated that the discipline of the students should be left with their instructors. Under the influence of a correct and exalted public sentiment emanating from the members of the Faculty in their individual capacities as "guides, philosophers and friends", has grown up a system of disciplinary law and order among the students themselves that is traditional as one of the finest distinguishing features of this institution. This distinctive "honor system", fostered and promoted by the reciprocal relations of teacher and student, should not be interfered with or jeopardized. The academic plan of instruction and of discipline should remain as heretofore, in the hands of those best calculated to continue it successfully, and it is only in the administration of the exacting business requirements of the institution that the services of the executive officer now contemplated are most urgently demanded by the exigencies of its development and growth.

Before concluding this report, your Committee would express the appreciative feelings which they entertain towards the following distinguished gentlemen who have very kindly aided them in their consideration of the question in hand: Presidents D. C. Gilman, of Johns Hopkins, Seth Low, of Columbia, Eliot, of Harvard, Wm R. Harper, of Chicago, Patton, of Princeton, and J. G. Schurman, of Cornell; all of whom have sent your Committee copies of their several rules and regulations bearing upon the relations of the president to the institution under his charge, and several of whom have expressed their interest in the action of our Board by personal letters to the Chairman of this Committee.

Your Committee recommends the passage of the following resolutions, viz:

Resolved I. That there shall be a President of the University of Virginia, who shall be elected by the Board of Visitors, at a salary of $500000 per annum, payable quarterly out of the funds of the University, and who shall be furnished with a dwelling, or commutation for the rent thereof. His term of office shall be four years, and he may be removed by a two-thirds vote of the whole number of Visitors for cause. He shall reside within the University precincts. He shall be the authorized means of communication between the Rector and Visitors and the various officers of instruction and administration employed in the University. It shall be his duty to consult with the Professors in respect to the development of their various departments and with the Faculty and its Chairman with respect to the general interests of the University; and he shall exercise such general superintendence over the buildings, apparatus, books, and other property as will ensure their protection and appropriate use. In respect to these matters and all others which concern the welfare of the University, he shall consult frequently with the Executive Committee, and he shall attend the meetings of the Board of Visitors. He shall regularly inspect and audit the accounts of the Proctor; and he shall, when convenient, attend the meetings of the Faculty. He shall, upon the recommendation of the Faculty, grant leave of withdrawal from the University to offending students; he shall grant to students in writing the use of the public rooms for meetings; and shall make written reports to the Board at each regular meeting upon the general condition of the University, with recommendations and suggestions as to the adoption of such measures as may commend themselves to his judgment; and he shall keep a journal of his proceedings for the benefit of the Executive Committee and of the Visitors.

Resolved II That there shall be a Chairman of the Faculty appointed as heretofore, whose duties shall be to convene the Faculty, when requested, and to preside at the meetings: who shall exercise all the functions heretofore exercised by the Chairman of the Faculty with respect to the discipline of the University, and the instruction in the several departments; but whose powers and duties, other than those of a professor, shall not extend beyond said subjects of discipline and instruction. He shall be the medium of communication between the Faculty and the President; and in the absence of the latter officer from the University, he shall be ex officio, President pro tempore of the University.

Resolved III, That these resolutions shall take effect on the       day of       189 .

Resolved: That this Committee recommend the following names to the consideration of the Visitors for the office of President:

The Committee appointed at the meeting in April last to prepare resolutions in regard to the death of Major Green Peyton, late Proctor, submitted its report through Mr Gordon its chairman, which was read to the Board and is as follows:

Memorial.

The Committee of the Visitors appointed at the meeting in April last to report suitable resolutions in regard to the death of the late Proctor of the University, Major Green Peyton, submit following:

The announcement of the death of Major Peyton has come with peculiar sorrow to the Visitors. For a period of more than twenty five years he was a faithful and trusted officer of the University, giving to the discharge of the duties of the office he so ably filled, all the energy and talents with which he was so remarkably endowed. In his intercourse with this Board as a wise counsellor and friend in the matters of University finance, he exhibited an interest, an ability, and a kindly consideration that were as marked as they were acceptable to the Visitors. In his death the University has lost an admirable and efficient officer, and each member of the Board a personal friend. His work is ineffacably stamped upon the history of the University as most beneficent and valuable, and his memory will live in the hearts of all those with whom he was ever brought in personal contact.

The Visitors desire to spread this testimonial upon their record, and ask that it may be printed in the Alumni Bulletin; and that the Secretary of the Board send a copy to the family of our friend.

Mr Harmon moved that the report be adopted and that a recorded vote be taken thereon which was ordered, and on a call of the roll all of the members voted for the adoption of the report, viz: The Rector, McCormick, Gordon, Harmon, Irvine, Bryan & McIlwaine.

Resolved: That the Faculty be requested to furnish to the Visitors at their meeting in November next a scheme of prize scholarships to be offered to the University Schools in Virginia and the South based upon the idea of the exemption from all fees, matriculation and other in Virginia, and upon the idea of the exemption from tuition fees in other Southern states to students in the academic departments. Said scholarships to be awarded such University schools as may have sent to the University a certain number of academic students in the previous sessions.

But this resolution shall not exclude the presentation by the Faculty of any other scheme of University school prize scholarships, which may tend to draw the University and the said schools throughout the south in closer contact.

Resolved, that the Faculty be requested to suggest to the meeting of the Board to be held in November next a plan for the selection of 5 scholarships in the academic schools of the University of Virginia to be filled upon completion from the pupils of the Public Free-schools in the State, each scholarship to be for the term of three years and to include the payment of $200.00 per annum to the successful applicant while a student in the academical schools of the University. And the Secretary of this Board is directed to forward a printed copy of this resolution to each of the County and City Superintendents of Schools in the state with the request that he make suggestions as to a plan for carrying the proposed arrangement into effect.

Resolved, that the Board appreciates the efforts of the Faculty during the last vacation to add to the attendance of the University, and hopes that similar work, with equally good results, may be done during the coming vacation.

Resolved, that a Committee of three be appointed to take into consideration and report to a special meeting what, if any, retrenchments can be made in the expensds of the University particularly to consider the number and salaries of the professors and instructors. Action on the part of this committee will be considered at the November meeting, but any result reached shall not take effect until Sept. 15th 1898.

The Rector appointed Messrs McCormick, Gordon and McIlwaine as the committee.

Resolved: That a committee of three, to be chosen by the Rector, be appointed to examine and report upon the revision of the laws of the University made by the Secretary, pursuant to the resolution of the Board; and that said Committee report what sum will be a proper compensation for said Secretaries services in compiling said revision.

The Rector appointed as said Committee, Messrs Gordon, Harmon and McIlwaine.

Whereas the qualifications and large personal acquaintance of the Proctor are such as to enable him to do efficient work towards increasing the attendance at the University,

Resolved: That the Proctor be requested to do what he can to add to the number of students.

Learning that an effort is being made by friends of the University, both here and in the North to gather together a Poe Memorial Library for the Library of the University of Virginia, at the suggestion of friends of the movement here, it is resolved that an alcove of the University Library be set aside as a Poe Memorial Alcove for the reception of said Memorial Library; said alcove to be selected by the Library Committee of the Faculty.

Resolved: That the Professor of Astronomy be authorized to nominate to the Visitors for appointment by them the Fellows in the Astronomical Department, provided for by the Board at its June meeting, 1896.

Resolved: That Section I (page 9), of the Faculty Report be approved so far as the recommendations therein contained are concerned; and that in accordance with the said recommendations the Professors in the several schools in which there are assistants or Instructors be severally authorized to nominate to the Visitors for appointment by them, the said several assistant instructors.

\[Inserted here pages 9 and 10 from the Annual Report of the Faculty for 1896-97, Section I of which is as follows:

I                 Report on Fellowships.

In response to the desire of the Visitors for a report from the Faculty in regard to the first recommendation of the executive committee's report on the proposed establishment of of five fellowships, to be awarded upon competitive examination, the fellows to act as Instructors in their several departments, the Faculty beg leave to suggest:

First. That it is desirable that all Instructors or Assistants to Professors shall, as far as their duties to the University, for which they are paid, will permit, devote their time to advanced study, especially in the direction of original research, to this extent carrying out the object, and themselves deriving the advantage, of the institution of fellowships. An order to this effect has already been suggested by the Faculty and approved by the Visitors.

Second. That in the choice of Instructors it is desirable that, as far as possible, preference be given to young men engaged in, or desirous of engaging in, advanced and especially research work.

Third. That in the choice of Instructors it is indispensable that not only scholarship but also teaching ability, general character and tact on the part of the candidates for these positions be considered. A man may be admirably well suited to hold the position of a fellow or advanced student and yet quite unfitted to perform the duties of an Instructor with advantage to the students whom he is to aid in teaching. In other words, an Instructor should have the qualifications of a fellow and other no less important qualifications besides.

Fourth. That in view of these considerations it is not feasible to select proper men for the positions of Instructors by means of competitive examinations, and that their selection should, as formerly, be left to the Professors in charge of the several schools concerned, such Professors (or Heads of Schools) to be held responsible for the good judgment of their selections, and the Instructors or Assistants to be in turn held responsible for the proper performance of their duties to the several Professors.

Fifth. That in some at least of the Schools or Departments named for the proposed fellowships it is not possible to procure competent instructors or assistants at the compensation proposed. The duties involved are different in character as well as extent, and the positions require separate consideration.

Sixth. That Professor Harrison wishes to draw attention to the case of his assistant as similar to those of the other Schools named, though, owing to the late date at which his assistant was authorized, no mention was made of him in the paper to the Visitors.\]

Resolved: That it is at present deemed inexpedient to consider the recommendation of the Faculty (K, page 10, Faculty report) with reference to the erection of a building for the Law Department.

\[Section K, page 10, of the Annual Report of the Faculty, reads as follows:

K                 Report on a Law Building.

Resolved, That the Faculty wish to present for consideration by the Visitors the fact that the space accommodation for carrying on the work of the University, as provided for in the arrangement of the new buildings, is insufficient.

It is, therefore, recommended that the Visitors consider the advisability of erecting a Law Department building, to cost about $20,000, to be used exclusively for the Law Department.\]

Resolved: That the nominations of the following Assistant instructors made by the Faculty for the Session of 1897-1898 be approved, and the instructors named be elected. They are as follows:

Physics: J. H. Corbett

Latin: C. C. Wright

English: H. M. Blain

Demonstrator of Anatomy: A. C. Jones

Demonstrator of Pathology & Medl Biology: L. Skeen, Jr.

Resolved: That as suggested in the Faculty report on page 14, the instructorship in Chemistry be abolished; and that for the present the services of the Assistant in Engineering be dispensed with.

Resolved, that the salary of the instructor in Latin be placed at $700. pe annum; that of the instructor in Physics at $800., that of the instructor in English at $300, that of the two in Biology at $300. each, that of Demonstrator of Anatomy at $800., that of the Demonstrator of Pathology and Medical Biology $800., and that the salaries of the Professors, Associate Professors and Adjunct Professors remain for the session 1897-98 as stated on page 18 of said Faculty report.

Resolved: That $600. be appropriated to establish a hospital for the next session, to be expended under the direction of the Executive Committee.

Resolved: that it is inexpedient at this time to increase \* \*On page 180, information from the Annual Report of the Faculty (1896-1897) has been inserted. the salary of the Secretary of the Faculty.

On page 180, information from the Annual Report of the Faculty (1896-1897) has been inserted.

Resolved: That applicants for the Degree of Ph.D. who may not be in attendance at the University shall never theless pay the usual matriculation fees.

Resolved: that the settlement made by the Chairman of the Faculty with Mr E. S. Vass for fees in the medical department by taking his note for $100.00, be and the same is hereby ratified and approved.

Resolved: That the appropriation for the Bulletin be diminished to $300. as requested in the Report of the Faculty, page 15.

Resolved: That the appropriation for the annals of Mathematics be increased to $500. as requested by the Faculty on page 16 of the Report.

Resolved: That under the circumstances of the case the tuition fees of Mr James A. Lyon be returned to him, it being understood that the requirements of the Law touching citizenship have been fully complied with.

Resolved: That in all cases of students applying for exemption from tuition fees on the ground of citizenship, about which there may be any doubt, the Chairman of the Faculty shall report the facts of the case to the Law Faculty, and such exemption shall be allowed upon his advice, when the citizenship of the student shall be such as is required by law.

Resolved: That the Proctor be directed to press the collection of all unpaid tuition fees, in such manner as in his judgment may be expedient, after full consultation and conference with the Chairman of the Faculty.

Resolved: That the Proctor pay to Dr Buckmaster $35.15 amount expended by him for rent of rooms opposite the Dispensary for the occupancy of patients.

Resolved: That the request of Mrs Elsom to have restored to her the room opening on the back porch of the Hotel and House now occupied by her, be granted, said room having been last year used as a dormitory, but properly belonging to said house.

Resolved: That the classified summary of Expenditures of the Building Committee, from Nov. 15th, 1897, as checked and corrected by Robert Robertson, Superintendent of Grounds & Buildings, be spread on the records. The following is a copy thereof:

Classified Summary of Expenditures of the Building Committee, from Nov. 15th 1895 to June 15th 1897.

"Checked & correct within 0.44 cts." signed, Robert Robertson, Supt

Resolved: That as requested by the Professor of Astronomy, two of the fellows in Astronomy hereafter receive $350.00 per annum, and the other fellowship remain as heretofore at $400.00 per annum.

Resolved: That as requested by Profr Tuttle and concurred in by the Miller Board, the assistants in Biology & Agriculture be known as Fellows, and that their salaries be as recommended by the Miller Board.

The Rector having laid before the Board a letter from Profr Charles W. Kent to Col. Thomas H. Carter, Proctor, dated June 3d 1897 states that there was a balance of $797.31 in the general account of the University which properly belongs to the specific Endowment of the Linden Kent Memorial School of English Literature.

Resolved: that Profr Kent is invited to present to the Board such suggestions of expenditures for the benefit of said school as he may think the school requires.

Resolved: That the fee deposited by Mr R. M. Bruns of $30.00 for the course in Materia Medica, which course was not attended by him, be refunded, as recommended by the Faculty.

Resolved: That $50.00, the matriculation fee of Mr W. J. McNair for the current session and for the session of 1897-1898 be remitted to the Committee on Religious Exercises, as approved by the Faculty.

Resolved: That as requested by Mr. Mann Page, and approved by the Chairman of the Faculty, the sum of $28.50 due him on account of withdrawal for sickness, from the University during the session of $1895-96 be refunded to him by the Proctor.

Resolved: That it is at this time inexpedient to consider the application of Messrs Sykes, Cochrane and Bowen, for the establishment of twelve additional scholarships out of the Fayerweather fund.

Resolved: That the Report of the Superintendent of Grounds & Buildings dated June 7th, 1897, be referred to the Executive Committee with authority to act.

Resolved: That the Report of the Librarian be received and filed.

Resolved: That the bill of W. P. Smith for work in examining the Proctor's Office and his expenses in the same behalf, the whole amounting to $293.80 be paid, less any amount already paid.

Resolved: That the donation of Profr James A. Harrison to the Library, standing to the credit of the Library Fund on the books of the Proctor, and amounting to $100. be at Profr Harrison's request, applied to that portion of the Library to be known as the Poe Memorial Alcove, heretofore at this meeting provided for, and that the same be paid over to Profr Harrison by the Proctor, as said Profr Harrison may require, to be expended by him for the purchase of books, connected with Edgar Allen Poe, for said Alcove.

Whereas, the Hon. William Jennings Bryan of Lincoln, Nebraska has offered to give to the University of Virginia, $250.00 on condition that said sum be permanently invested and the annual proceeds used as a prize to stimulate the students of the University to study and understand the principles which underlie our forms of government. Therefore, be it Resolved, that the Proctor of the University of Virginia, who is its financial agent, be authorized to receive and be the custodian of said sum, the income of this money as invested to be used annually in the purchase of a medal to be won by open competition in the University Magazine for the best original article on the Theory of Government, the chairman of the Faculty being authorized to appoint the Committee whose decision shall be final.

Resolved: That the Medal shall be known as the William Jennings Bryan Medal; and that the thanks of the Rector and Visitors be returned Mr Bryan for his generous donation.

Resolved, that the compensation of the Demonstrator of Anatomy shall be $1000.00 per annum, and the resolution heretofore passed fixing the sum at $800. be and is hereby repealed.

Resolved, that authority is hereby given the Proctor to lease to Mrs Mary E. Towles for one year and thereafter from year to year the tract of land containing 10 or 12 acres lying south of the farm of the said Mrs Towles and between said farm and the road to the Cemetery, for the annual sum of $5.00,-the tenant to keep the land fenced.

The report of the Committee appointed to examine the accounts and securities in the hands of the late Proctor, Major Green Peyton decd, having been read and considered on motion the following resolution was adopted:

Resolved: That the report of the Special Committee to examine the accounts and securities in the hands of the late Proctor be and the same is received and approved; and the Secretary of the Board is directed to record on the minutes of the Board the said report, and also the Report of W. P. Smith the Expert Accountant and the statements marked A. C. D. E. filed therewith and shall also record on the minutes the receipt of Thomas H. Carter, Proctor, for the Cash and securities turned over to him.

Said reports and receipt here follow:

To the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia.

Your Committee appointed to examine the accounts & securities in the hands of the late Proctor respectfully report.

After some difficulty in securing the services of a competent expert they succeeded in employing Mr W. P. Smith of Richmond, after a thorough research and with considerable labor he has made his report, which is returned herewith, from which it appears that the cash on hand apparently exceeds the amount to be accounted for by the Proctor's books by $164.57.

Your Committee had also taken an inventory of the cash and securities in the Proctor's Office and herewith returns the receipt of Col Thomas H. Carter, Proctor, for the same.

The accounts kept by the Chairman of the Faculty during the interval between the death of the late Proctor and the appointment of his successor were also examined and found correct, as were also the accounts of the Superintendent of Grounds and Buildings.

While the Proctor's books were in an unfinished condition, owing to his death, his accounts were found to be correct.

The Special Committee on investigation of the Proctor's office, University of Virginia.

Gentlemen: I respectfully beg to report that in accordance with your directions, I have thoroughly examined the books and accounts in the office of the Proctor, and while the accounts are kept in the old fashioned system of single entry, where there are no checks or proofs by balancing, so far the postings, additions, transfers and transactions in cash are concerned they are with the exception of a few errors, which are plainly clerical, correct.

I enclose herewith, statements of the most important accounts, to which I invite your attention, but all of the books have been examined and corrected, and an inspection of the Ledger will fully inform you as to any other accounts, which I deem it unnecessary to make up in detail.

Appendix "A." showing to the credit of the late Proctor $164.57

Appendix "B." presents status of Restoration Fund.

Appendix C. Cash transactions in Bonds.

Appendix D. Inventory of bonds on hand May 26th 1897.

Appendix E. Account of sales of bonds.

Appendix F. Income derived from payment of students.

Appendix G. Memo of salaries paid professors.

I also enclose some original data which I have used in the compilation of the accounts, and which may be useful to you in future. At your suggestion I be to recommend a change in your Cash Book ( a copy of which I have furnished to Col Thos H. Carter, Proctor.) so arranged that the postings to the different accounts may be made monthly, and a reference to which, at any time, will show the receipts and disbursements without the long and laborious work of referring and condensing. I think this change will save great time and labor to the Proctor, and be much more satisfactory to all the officers and all concerned.

I further recommend that all the cash business, as far as possible, be done through the Banks by checks and deposits, and to this end that the Fuel Account be so arranged and kept as to prevent the necessity of carrying an amount of cash tickets in the cash drawer.

The collection of interest or dividends on any securities held by the institution, when collected, if credited to its peculiar fund, before being passed into income account (which should be done when closing the books at the end of the session), would save much trouble and research to the officers and others in determining the standing of any of the accounts at any time during the session.

I further respectfully recommend that the Double Entry or check system be adopted in the work wherever it can be applied.

The regulations governing the books of the University require that they shall run continuously from the beginning to the end of the session, and I therefore omit to enclose some other reports, which I cannot do without some changes in the books; but an examination of the accounts which I have fully audited, examined and corrected, will give you any desired information.

I beg to further report that I have examined all the accounts of the Superintendent of Grounds & Buildings as also the accounts of the Proctor's office embracing the time between the death of the Proctor and the appointment of his successor and found the same to be correct.

W. P. Smith.

Subject to any oustanding, unsettled coal tickets or other cash tickets.

In addition to the above there was received from C. E. Langley & Co for 5 U. of Va Bonds, (which was deducted from his Pay Roll, and therefore did not pass through the cash account) $5,108.83.

Resolved: That after the transactions of the present session are fully closed the Proctor shall settle with the Executrix of Green Peyton the $164.57, appearing to be due him, subject to such deductions as may appear to be necessary in closing up the years business, and the Proctor shall also pay to said Executrix the amount of salary due at the date of Major Peyton's death.

The resolution heretofore made by the Executive Committee directing the last quarters salary to be paid to his widow is approved.

The Finance Committee submitted its report which upon being read and considered was on motion ordered to be received, adopted and spread upon the minutes.

Said report is in the following words and figures:

To the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia.

Minority report of the Special Committee of the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia on the expediency of having an Executive head of the University.

I am unable to concur in the recommendations of the Committee (majority) to whom was referred the resolution of June 16, 1896, directing them to consider the "expediency of electing a chairman of the faculty, who shall not only preside over the faculty meetings, but shall be the executive officer in charge of and at the head of University affairs."

The resolution, submitted by the Committee at the conclusion of their report, provides that there shall be a President of the University of Virginia, as well as a chairman of the faculty, appointed as heretofore.

The report of the Committee states that the nature of their proposed legislation is "radical," and the statement is not too strong. The proposition is to change in toto the whole theory and practice of the administration of the University of Virginia. The movement towards this change seems to have been accelerated between the time of the resolution of the Board and the report of the Committee. The Board seemed to contemplate the election of a chairman of the faculty as an executive head.

The report plainly proposes the election of a president in addition to the chairman of the faculty, and proposes a plan of organization under the headship of this President entirely inconsistent with the organization and management of the University as it has existed from its foundation.

That the idea of having a President is not new is apparent from the action of the Board while Mr Jefferson was rector, when William Wirt, then Attorney General of the United States, was proposed as President and Professor of Law, and for reasons which are as good today as they were then, Mr Jefferson entered his protest, a copy of which, is appended to this minority report.

Among the reasons why the organization of the University should not be changed to that proposed, the following appear to be worthy of consideration: First, it violates the fundamental theory of the organization of the University, which has worked successfully for seventy years, and has vindicated the wisdom of its author.

The government of the University is in the hands of the faculty, all of whom share the responsibility and are under obligation to promote its welfare and orderly conduct with their best endeavors. A member of the faculty is chosen by the Board of Visitors from year to year, as chairman and executive head of the University. He is the mouth-piece of the Faculty, and his duties, which are laid down by law, are simple and plain. Heretofore some member of the faculty has been found who was able and willing to perform the duties of chairman as well as to fill his chair as professor. Many years ago, it was customary for the chairman to hold his office for a short time, and then to be succeeded by some other member of the faculty, so that a partial rotation was established. The choice of chairman was always governed by the aptitude of the professor for executive duties. After the war, the chairman, though elected from year to year, was kept in office for a period so protracted that the idea of rotation or of a limited period of service was obscured or lost. The plan under which the University is managed utterly rejects the idea of one man power, and does not commit to the chance of choosing a possibly unsuitable person, the great interests which are ordinarily lodged in the hands of the President of an University. It was thought that from so large a body of eminent educators as constitute the faculty of the University, it would be easy to choose some one who clould administer the functions of executive head for a limited time, and who could retire to his exclusive professorial duties, and be succeeded by another without any breach whatever of the continuity of organization and management. That a suitable man may be had for this purpose, from the faculty, is proven conclusively by the experience of the seventy years of life of the Institution.

It has been said that "the American College President, as the functions of the office have developed, is an anomolous figure. It is a place which requires both a scholar and a man of affairs; an impossible thing, to fill it." But, even should this extraordinary person be discovered, and the theory under which he would be elected be conceded to be good in practice for other Universities, it would be a serious question whether the rule that might properly prevail elsewhere, for Universities not under political control, as is the University of Virginia, would be applicable in our case. The report proposes to pay this President $5,000. and provide him with a residence; and as he would be expected "to familiarize himself with the higher education as had in the best institutions in the world, to suggest wise administrative and other changes to the Visitors, to visit the great cities of the Country, and arouse and inspire the interest and enthusiasm of our alumni," there would necessarily be other considerable expenses incident to the performance of these functions, which would have to be performed in a manner commensurate with that adopted by the Presidents of other great and highly endowed Universities.

If the proposed President is to meet these other great Universities on the same plane of liberal expense, which they allow their Presidents, then an extraordinary fund for entertainment would have to be allowed by us.

A position like this new creation, would be one of the most attractive and desirable in the State of Virginia, second only to that of the office of Governor itself. That this place could be kept out of politics would be almost an impossibility. There are many gentlemen of imposing presence, elegant manners, general culture, and acknowledged eloquence, who might well aspire to fill the place of President of the University, who would not for an instant desire the laboring ore or possess the precise and scientific knowledge required of a professor.

If, however, a non-political President is chosen, no one with a desirable prestige or eminence could be gotten, except with the expectation that it would be for practicallay a life service. The suggestion that an acceptable one could be elected for only four years is most probably impracticable. In the event, therefore, of the election of a President under the terms of the resolution of the Committee, it would be impliedly for life, though he could be "removed only by two thirds of the vote of the entire Visitors". Should an unsuitable person be elected, it would be with the greatest difficulty that any change could be made, and if made, would impair the reputation of the University, as its fortunes would have been deliberately committed in very large measure to the hands of a single person.

If, on the other hand, in the light of a knowledge of all the members of the faculty, an unsuitable chairman is chosen, a change may be made without disturbance or injurious publication, and the affairs of the University continued without impairment.

It is well known that the position of professor at the University is one of singular dignity and independence. He is responsible only to the Board of Visitors, and is recognized as the peer of any man. He is a Senator who does not have to record the rescripts of any emperor or President. He is sovereign in his own department, subject alone to the Board of Visitors. The theory and principle of the Presidency, now only as it exists elsewhere, but as is proposed in the resolution of the Committee, involve a supervision by the President of the conduct of their respective schools by the professors. The resolution requires that, "it shall be his (the President's) duty to consult with the professors in respect to the development of their various departments" and the report proposes that "he shall suggest wise administrative and other changes to the Visitors," a duty which the President may make most objectionable to any professor, and as the proposed plan also requires that this President "shall attend the meetings of the Board of Visitors", he will have the opportunity, and indeed it will be his duty, to report to the Board his opinion of the several professors, and of the manner in which they discharge their duties. It is plain that this will put the professors at a disadvantage in their dealings with the President. They will feel all the time a sense of their dependence upon his good will, and while the brave and strong may be proof against this powerful influence, there are others who could not withstand its humiliating effect, and none who could escape would endure it.

The theory that the University is a collection of schools, each presided over by a distinguished and independent master, will be gone, and a monarch will be substituted for the republic of letters. It will be difficult under such conditions to secure the services of the distinguished men of independent character, who have made the schools of the University famous.

It is true that since its foundation there have been professors at the University whose character as men, or capacity as teachers were below the high standard of the faculty, but these men were eventually eliminated by the Visitors, without the intervention of a President, and without affecting the feeling of security and independence of those professors who were in every respect worthy of their positions. The Visitors have, heretofore, been equal to the occasion, and will doubtless be so again, should such an emergency arise.

The duties which have been assigned the professors at the University in the general management of the students, both in instruction and in discipline, have been so well performed that the report of the Committee declares "that they desire it to be clearly indicated that the discipline of the students should be left with their instructors". Under the influence of a correct and exalted public sentiment emanating from the members of the faculty, in their individual capacities as "guides philosophers and friends", has grown up a system of disciplinary law and order among the students themselves that is recognized as one of the finest distinguishing features in this Institution This distinctive "honor system", fostered and promoted by the reciprocal relations of teacher and students, should not be interfered with or jeopardized.

Among the duties especially reserved to the chairman of the faculty, under the resolution of the Committee, are "that he shall exercise all the functions heretofore exercised by the chairman of the faculty with respect to the discipline of the University" and the instruction in the several departments.

The Committee thus admirably state the reason and arrive at the just conclusion that the discipline of the students has already been lodged in the best hands, and that there is no need for a President on this very important account.

Among the duties to be performed by this proposed President is "to visit the great cities of the country, and arouse and inspire the interest and enthusiasm of our Alumni". This would seem naturally to involve the presentation of the claims of the University of Virginia upon the support, not merely of its Alumni, but of any other persons who could be induced to contribute to its endowment. It is a fact, however, that on all occasions where the University has needed a representative, one has been found generally among her faculty, but sometimes among her Visitors, chosen for his special fitness for the principal work to be done, whose culture would equal that of any one he would meet, and who, with force but simplicity, would present the claims of the most Democratic University in America.

That the University as a State Institution should have received such numerous benefactions, not only from Virginians, as Dawson, McCormick, Miller, and others, but from men who are not Virginians, as from Austin, from Corcoran, from Brooks, from Vanderbilt, and from Fayerweather, is proof that there is something in the character of the University itself, and its own peculiar organization, which appeals to the generous and nobleminded, irrespective of their state or denomination.

It would seem, therefore, that the services of a President are not required for the acquisition of endowments.

Under the proposed plan, the President is required "to exercise a general superintendence over the buildings, apparatus, books and other property" and "to regularly inspect and audit the accounts of the Proctor". It is proper in this connection to say that the business affairs of the University are committed to the hands of a proctor, who is also superintendent of grounds and buildings, and to this end is allowed by the Board of Visitors a special assistant. The accounts of the Proctor are regularly audited by a Commissioner of accounts appointed for the purpose, who is an expert in such matters, and may reasonably supposed to be more competent and diligent in auditing these accounts, than would be a President, who perchance may have no aptitude whatever for such business, and in any event would be very likely to delegate the duty to some one chosen for the purpose.

The simple fact is that the organization of the University of Virginia is to-day as perfect as it can well be made. If there is any failure to accomplish the results which should reasonably be expected, the responsibility lies at the door of some of those who are already in office, and it would be wiser and easier to stimulate new energy in the present personnel, than to disrupt and rebuild with no reasonable hope of bettering it. Upon the Board of Visitors appointed by the Governor rest the heaviest duties, and the most solemn responsibilities of anybody connected with the University. They have at their hands the whole faculty, who are conceded to be competent instructors and efficient disciplinarians of the students.

The business of the University in the hands of a thorough and active business man, with ample assistants, enables the Visitors to have any plans they may devise for the good of the University thoroughly executed. How the introduction of a President will add to the efficiency of the organization of the University is not seen, but it is very plain that a new spirit and sentiment would have to be created around the institution, which would be dissimilar to that which has been formed since its foundation.

It is not improbable that a chairman may be elected whose professorial duties might conflict with the full and energetic discharge of his duties as chairman, though this is not necessarily true in every case, as all the members of the faculty are not alike burdened with the duties of their chairs. In any case where a chairman is elected who cannot vigerously perform the duties of chairman without, in some measure, slackening his hand in the lecture room, it is perfectly competent to and advisable for the Visitors to give him an assistant for the term of his chairmanship, without, however, releasing him from the duty of directing in every particular the instruction of his school.

Nor should any chairman be elected under any circumstances from more than four successive terms of one year. At the expiration of this period, his successor should be elected, also from year to year, but not to hold the office for more than four years.

A vice-chairman should always be in office, with the expectation of being elected chairman, so that he may inform himself of the duties of the office, and be prepared to go in at once equipped for their discharge.

These are mere details which the Board of Visitors can carry out, without, in the slightest degree, affecting the organization of the University, but only administering it in what seems to be a wise manner.

It is not pretended that the reasons for dissent from the conclusions of the majority of the Committee have been fully set forth in this minority report, but perhaps enough have been given to justify the Board in defering indefinitely any favorable action on the resolutions submitted by the Committee.

Respectfully submitted, signed. Jos Bryan.

The protest of Mr Jefferson against the establishment of the office of President of the University of Virginia.

Following is an extract from the minutes of the Board of Visitors: At a meeting of the Board of Visitors of the University held on on the 3d and 4th of April, 1826, at which were present Thomas Jefferson, Joseph C. Cabell, John H. Cocke, Chapman Johnson, and James Madison, the following appears of record in the minutes of the meeting:

"Resolved, That there be established the office of president of the University with a salary of $1,500. per annum to be paid out of the annuity of the University, in the manner in which the salaries of the professors are paid.

"The president shall be the chief executive officer of the University and as such charged with a general superintendence of the execution of all laws made for its government.

"The proctor and all subordinate agents shall be subject to his control and direction in the execution of their respective duties.

"He shall convene the faculty whenever he may think the interests of the institution require it and whenenver else any two professors shall request it.

"He shall preside at all meetings of the faculty, when present and having a vote as professor, he shall have a casting vote as president, when the votes of professors, pro and con, are equally divided.

"In his absence from the meetings of the faculty, a chairman pro tempore shall be appointed; in the absence of the president from the University, and in case of his disability by sickness, or otherwise, the faculty may be convened and may act as at present.

"When the president shall believe that a student has committed any offence requiring trial before the faculty he shall have power to suspend such student, and in case of emergency, forbid him access within the precincts till a board can be convened for his trial; provided, that no such suspension shall be for a longer time than two weeks, if a board can be convened within that time. Any Student violating the order of the president made pursuant to the authority hereby vested in him shall be deemed guilty of contumacy and punished accordingly.

"Resolved, That William Wirt, at present Attorney General of the United States, be appointed president of the University and professor of law, and that if he decline the appointment, the resolution establishing the office of president be null and void."

"From the enactments establishing the office of president the rector (Mr Jefferson) dissented, his dissent is ordered to be entered in the journal, and in the words following:

"The subscriber, rector of the University, fully and expressly concurring in the appointment of William Wirt to be professor of the Scholl of law, dissents from and protests against so much of these enactments as go to the establishment of the office of president of the University, for these reasons.

1\. Because the law establishing the University, delineating the organization of the authorities by which it should be directed and governed, and placing at its head a Board of Rector and Visitors, has enunciated with precision the special powers it meant to give that Board, in which enumeration is not to be found that of creating a president, making him a member of the faculty of professors, and with controlling powers over the faculty; and it is not conceivable that, while descending in their enumeration, to give specifically the power of appointing officers of the minutest grade, they should have omitted to name him of the highest who was to govern and preside over the whole, if this is not among the enumerated powers, it is believed it cannot be legitimately inferred by construction from the words giving a general authority to all things expedient for promoting the purposes of the institution, for, so construed, it would render nugatory the whole enumeration, and confer on the board powers unrestrained within any limits.

"2. Because he is of the opinion that every function ascribed to the president by this enactment can be performed, and is now as well performed by the faculty, as now established by law.

"3. Because we owe debts at this time of at least $11,000. beyond what can be paid by any means we have in possession or may command within any definite period of time, and fixes on us permanently an additional expense of $1,500.00 a year.

"4. Because he thinks that so fundamental a change in the organization of the institution ought not to be made by a thin board, two of the seven constituting it, being now absent.

"For these reasons the subscriber protests against both the expediency and the validity of the establishment of this office.

signed. Th: Jefferson.

On motion the Board adjourned to be convened by a call of the Rector, during the month of November next, to further consider the question of having a president or executive head of the University according to a resolution in relation to said call hereinbefore entered. (p 169 \[156\])

Report of the Proctor,

Report of the Superintendent of Grounds & Buildings,

Report of the Librarian,

School Reports.

The Special Committee appointed by the Board at the meeting in June 1896 to consider the question of creating an Executive department of the University submitted its report through its Chairman, Mr Gordon.

The Executive Committee submitted its Report.

The Committee to examine and report upon the condition of the books and accounts of the late Proctor, Major Green Peyton, decd and as to the cash and securities belonging to the University in his charge at the date of his death or with which he was chargeable, made its report to the Board.

Profr Barringer, Chairman of the Faculty, who acted as Proctor in the interim between the death of Major Peyton, Proctor, and the election and qualification of his successor laid before the Board his report of his acts as acting Proctor as aforesaid.

The following was enacted by the Board:

Resolved: That the recommendations of the Faculty with reference to the Ph. D. degree be approved: and that the resolutions prepared by the Faculty with reference thereto, as incorporated in their report on pages 10 & 11 be adopted as the resolutions of the Board, and that said resolutions be spread upon the records. Said resolutions are as follows:

Resolved, First. That the degree of Doctor of Philosophy of the University of Virginia shall in all cases embrace three subjects, viz, a major subject, in which a dissertation is to be prepared, a cognate minor, and an independent minor.

Second - That no time limit be set for the acquisition of this degree, except a minimum time limit of three years of study therefor, after the acquisition of the B. A. degree. The major subject shall be pursued during the whole time, the first minor during at least two years, and the second minor during at least one year.

Third - That each candidate for the degree be required to possess a reading knowledge of French and German, and such knowledge of subjects considered fundamental as may be prescribed by the individual departments.

Fourth - Each candidate shall be required to stand a final examination upon the whole course covered in both major and minor studies.

Fifth - Graduate work done in other Universities of high standing shall be accepted in lieu of resident work done here, provided sufficient evidence is furnished that such work has been of a similar grade to that required here, and has been satisfactorily performed; and provided furthermore, that the last year of graduate work is done here.

But a candidate must obtain the special permission of the Faculty to apply for this degree after only one year of resident study.

Resolved: That English Language in Group B. (Modern Languages), page 65 of Catalogue, be transferred to Group C. (History and English Literature) and that the latter read, History and English; in accordance with the recommendation of the Faculty as presented on page 11 of their report.

Resolved; That until otherwise ordered there shall be a Christmas vacation, and suspension of lectures of five days duration from December 23d to December 28th.

Resolved: That the recommendation of the Faculty with regard to water closets (pp 12 & 13 of Faculty Report) be and the same is hereby approved and is referred to the Building Committee, with authority to act; provided there is money in hand to pay for the work.

Resolved: That as to insurance on the new Buildings, recommended by the Faculty, it is referred to the Proctor with authority to secure such insurance as may be necessary and an appropriation is now made to carry out this resolution, subject to the approval of the Executive Committee.

Resolved: That in response to the recommendation of the Faculty as to the urgent need of repairs to the dormitories, the Visitors have not sufficient information on which to act. The Proctor will, as soon as possible, report to the Visitors a detailed statement of what repairs are necessary and the probable cost of the same and the matter is now deferred until further information can be gotten.

Resolved: That the Proctor be requested to furnish the Board a statement of the amount of the Sinking Fund, old and new.

Resolved: That the application of Profr Wm M. Thornton, to be seen on pages 4 & 5 Sec. C. of the Faculty's report be for the present deferred, but the Rector and Visitors recognize the necessity of an improvement in the equipment of this school (Applied Mathematics) and will provide for it when the finances of the University will justify it, but the special donation of Mrs Sinclair shall and is hereby applied to the purchase of equipments for the Engineering Building under the direction of Profr Thornton.

Resolved: That the proposed assignment of rooms to the several professors, set out on page 5 section D. of the Faculty's Report be referred to the Building Committee with authority to make such assignment of rooms as they may deem proper.

On the invitation of the Board a Committee of the Faculty composed of Profrs N. K. Davis, Mallet, Barringer, Tuttle and W. D. Dabney appeared before the Board and were severally heard, upon the question pending before the Board, of creating an Executive department of the University for the administration of its government.

After hearing these gentlemen, on motion

The Board at 12 P. M. adjourned to 930 A. M. of 15th inst.

The Board of Visitors met pursuant to adjournment on yesterday. Present:

The Rector, and Visitors McCormick, Gordon, Irvine, Harmon, Bryan and McIlwaine.

Absent: Visitors, Watts and Patteson.

The following was enacted:

Resolved, that the recommendation of the Faculty's report (p 3. Sec A.) be referred to the Executive Committee with full power and authority to act.

The Committee to confer with the Miller Board submitted its report which reads as follows:

To the Rector and Visitors of the University:

Your Committee have conferred with the Miller Board & return herewith the suggestions and recommendations of that Board in which Your Committee concurs.

I have the honor to submit to you a report of the financial transactions of the University, for the fiscal year ending June 30th, 1897. As preface, permit me to say, that my lamented predecessor and myself were close friends and comrades in arms during the war. Both on the field and in Camp Green Peyton was always, and everywhere a brave and efficient soldier. Wherever placed in life, he proved himself a man of intellect, attainments, energy and force of character. His ill health for many months before his death, together with the increased work incident to the receipt and disbursement of a large restoration fund, caused his accounts to be left in an unfinished condition. Thoroughly conversant with the peculiar character of the University accounts, by a service as Proctor for twenty seven years, he found no need to record many facts which were safely stored in his own mind, but not immediately accessible to a new incumbent. So, too with a memory singularly tenacious, he left no correspondence for he felt the need of none His cash-book and ledger were his letter-press and letter-file.

I took official charge of the Proctor's Office May 1, 1897. A committee appointed by a full Board of Visitors, was instructed to examine thoroughly the accounts to date, and were empowered to employ an expert to assist them. A report by the Committee and expert will doubtless be furnished you.

The same Committee was also instructed to make an inventory of the bonds held by the University, and a list of them is herewith submitted. These bonds are kept in the Bank of Albemarle, and People's National Bank, Charlottesville, under two locks, one key of each being in the hands of the Officers of said banks, and one in the keeping of the Proctor.

As compared with the annual report of last year, 1895-6, the inventory list of bonds shows that the Va 3's, with the exception of those in the John Y. Mason Fellowship Fund, have been sold. It is understood here that Major Peyton's intention was to sell all the Va 3's in the sinking fund, then bearing a good price, and re-invest in Va 2s (Century) bonds at a lower price, in order to anticipate their rise in value and interest, at the beginning of the coming century. The proceeds of these sales are in the Banks in Charlottesville, in which the deposits and accounts are directed by the Board to be kept. No doubt the Board at this meeting will designate the securities in which the money shall be reinvested.

The Richmond & Danville gold 6's, and the Atlanta & Charlotte 7's of the Astronomical Department were sold in accordance with the order of the Board, and reinvested in 153, five hundred dollars bonds ($76,500.) of the 5% new University bonds. Notwithstanding the premium at which the Richmond & Danville 6's, and the Atlanta & Charlotte 7's, were sold, there is a small loss of interest per annum, ($15500) to the Astronomical Department, on account of the lower interest of the 5% new University Bonds. All the 400 new University 5% bonds (500. each) have been sold and interest is paid semi-annually, May 1st, and November 1st, to the Va Trust Company for the holders.

The $7,500. of interest on the $200,000 new University Bonds, prior to July 1, 1896, collected in accordance with the general appropriation bill of March 1896, has been divided in the tabular statement below, and $2000. placed to the Sinking Fund, in accordance with the action of the Board, April 26, 1896. The remaining $5,500. is specified in the table as a Reserve fund, and the Board will doubtless designate its proper application.

The attention of the Board is invited to an inclosed letter from Profr Kent, showing $797.31 due the English Literature school under the specific conditions of the gift made by Mrs Leita Kent in her endowment of the Linden Kent Memorial School of English Literature.

I have examined the ledger of the year mentioned and am of the opinion that the sum should be paid back to the school.

Under the authority of Sec. 242, page 46 of the Laws of the laws of the University of Virginia, 1892, I engaged the services of Mr I. K. Moran, a clerk of experience, from the middle of May till the middle of June, having previously employed him from May 1st, to the middle of the month at my own expense. He has worked most faithfully and efficiently day, and part of the night at times, and I ask that he be liberally rewarded.

Two handsome subscriptions were procured by Profr W. M. Thornton on a recent visit to Boston, one of a thousand dollars from Augustus Hemenway, Esq, and one of five thousand dollars from T. Jefferson Coolidge, Esq.

It will be necessary for the Board to consider and decide the question as to the quantity of fuel for another year. If the new rooms are to be heated, the estimate of previous years will be misleading. I have found Mr Skinner, the Supervising architect, well informed as to the capacity and requirements of the boilers for heating a part, or all of the new rooms, and the quantity of coal required respectively.

Itemized statements of various accounts is appended.

Ayes - The Rector, Harmon, McCormick, Irvine & Bryan

Nos - Mr McIlwaine

Resolved: That in view of the unusually onerous duties imposed upon the Secretary of the Board since the destruction of the University Buildings by fire in the fall of 1895, the said Secretary be paid the sum of $150. in addition to his regular salary.

Mr Gordon moved the adoption of the foregoing resolution and upon this motion Mr Mc Ilwaine called for a recorded vote which was ordered and on call of the roll the following was the result.

On announcement of the result Mr McIlwaine moved that the vote in favor of the adoption of the resolution be made unanimous, which was done.

On motion the Board adjourned to meet tomorrow morning at 10 oclock.

The Board of Visitors met in pursuance of adjournment on yesterday.

Present the same members as on yesterday, viz: The Rector, and Visitors, McCormick, Gordon, Irvine, Harmon, Bryan and McIlwaine.

The following was enacted

Resolved: That the thanks of the Rector and Visitors be extended to Messrs T. Jefferson Coolidge and Augustus Hemenway for their recent donations to the University.

Resolved: That the Rector and Visitors approve of the communication of Profr Wm M. Thornton to the Trustees of the Balinda Randall fund; and the Rector be clothed with authority to do whatever may be necessary to forward the success of said petition.

Resolved: That Profr Buckmaster be elected to the chair in the Medical Faculty now occupied by him.

Resolved: That the thanks of the Rector and Visitors be extended to Profr Wm M. Thornton for his services in endeavoring to secure a donation to the University from the Trustees of the Balinda Randall Fund.

Resolved: That Dr P. B. Barringer be re-elected Chairman of the Faculty for the ensuing session. This resolution was adopted by call of the ayes and nos and on call of the roll all of the members voted aye, but Mr McIlwaine, who voted no.: he having called for the vote by ayes & nos.

Resolved: That the present Executive Committee be continued for the ensuing year with Mr Harmon as Chairman, the Rector having requested that he be relieved of the duties of Chairman of the Committee.

Resolved: That the Faculty be requested to furnish the Visitors at their meeting in November next a sheme of entrance examinations for academic students in the University of Virginia

The Committee appointed at the meeting in April last to prepare resolutions in regard to the death of Major Green Peyton, late Proctor, submitted its report through Mr Gordon its chairman, which was read to the Board and is as follows:

Memorial.

The Committee of the Visitors appointed at the meeting in April last to report suitable resolutions in regard to the death of the late Proctor of the University, Major Green Peyton, submit following:

The announcement of the death of Major Peyton has come with peculiar sorrow to the Visitors. For a period of more than twenty five years he was a faithful and trusted officer of the University, giving to the discharge of the duties of the office he so ably filled, all the energy and talents with which he was so remarkably endowed. In his intercourse with this Board as a wise counsellor and friend in the matters of University finance, he exhibited an interest, an ability, and a kindly consideration that were as marked as they were acceptable to the Visitors. In his death the University has lost an admirable and efficient officer, and each member of the Board a personal friend. His work is ineffacably stamped upon the history of the University as most beneficent and valuable, and his memory will live in the hearts of all those with whom he was ever brought in personal contact.

The Visitors desire to spread this testimonial upon their record, and ask that it may be printed in the Alumni Bulletin; and that the Secretary of the Board send a copy to the family of our friend.

Mr Harmon moved that the report be adopted and that a recorded vote be taken thereon which was ordered, and on a call of the roll all of the members voted for the adoption of the report, viz: The Rector, McCormick, Gordon, Harmon, Irvine, Bryan & McIlwaine.

Resolved: That the Faculty be requested to furnish to the Visitors at their meeting in November next a scheme of prize scholarships to be offered to the University Schools in Virginia and the South based upon the idea of the exemption from all fees, matriculation and other in Virginia, and upon the idea of the exemption from tuition fees in other Southern states to students in the academic departments. Said scholarships to be awarded such University schools as may have sent to the University a certain number of academic students in the previous sessions.

But this resolution shall not exclude the presentation by the Faculty of any other scheme of University school prize scholarships, which may tend to draw the University and the said schools throughout the south in closer contact.

Resolved, that the Faculty be requested to suggest to the meeting of the Board to be held in November next a plan for the selection of 5 scholarships in the academic schools of the University of Virginia to be filled upon completion from the pupils of the Public Free-schools in the State, each scholarship to be for the term of three years and to include the payment of $200.00 per annum to the successful applicant while a student in the academical schools of the University. And the Secretary of this Board is directed to forward a printed copy of this resolution to each of the County and City Superintendents of Schools in the state with the request that he make suggestions as to a plan for carrying the proposed arrangement into effect.

Resolved, that the Board appreciates the efforts of the Faculty during the last vacation to add to the attendance of the University, and hopes that similar work, with equally good results, may be done during the coming vacation.

Resolved, that a Committee of three be appointed to take into consideration and report to a special meeting what, if any, retrenchments can be made in the expensds of the University particularly to consider the number and salaries of the professors and instructors. Action on the part of this committee will be considered at the November meeting, but any result reached shall not take effect until Sept. 15th 1898.

The Rector appointed Messrs McCormick, Gordon and McIlwaine as the committee.

Resolved: That a committee of three, to be chosen by the Rector, be appointed to examine and report upon the revision of the laws of the University made by the Secretary, pursuant to the resolution of the Board; and that said Committee report what sum will be a proper compensation for said Secretaries services in compiling said revision.

The Rector appointed as said Committee, Messrs Gordon, Harmon and McIlwaine.

Whereas the qualifications and large personal acquaintance of the Proctor are such as to enable him to do efficient work towards increasing the attendance at the University,

Resolved: That the Proctor be requested to do what he can to add to the number of students.

Learning that an effort is being made by friends of the University, both here and in the North to gather together a Poe Memorial Library for the Library of the University of Virginia, at the suggestion of friends of the movement here, it is resolved that an alcove of the University Library be set aside as a Poe Memorial Alcove for the reception of said Memorial Library; said alcove to be selected by the Library Committee of the Faculty.

Resolved: That the Professor of Astronomy be authorized to nominate to the Visitors for appointment by them the Fellows in the Astronomical Department, provided for by the Board at its June meeting, 1896.

Resolved: That Section I (page 9), of the Faculty Report be approved so far as the recommendations therein contained are concerned; and that in accordance with the said recommendations the Professors in the several schools in which there are assistants or Instructors be severally authorized to nominate to the Visitors for appointment by them, the said several assistant instructors.

\[Inserted here pages 9 and 10 from the Annual Report of the Faculty for 1896-97, Section I of which is as follows:

I                 Report on Fellowships.

In response to the desire of the Visitors for a report from the Faculty in regard to the first recommendation of the executive committee's report on the proposed establishment of of five fellowships, to be awarded upon competitive examination, the fellows to act as Instructors in their several departments, the Faculty beg leave to suggest:

First. That it is desirable that all Instructors or Assistants to Professors shall, as far as their duties to the University, for which they are paid, will permit, devote their time to advanced study, especially in the direction of original research, to this extent carrying out the object, and themselves deriving the advantage, of the institution of fellowships. An order to this effect has already been suggested by the Faculty and approved by the Visitors.

Second. That in the choice of Instructors it is desirable that, as far as possible, preference be given to young men engaged in, or desirous of engaging in, advanced and especially research work.

Third. That in the choice of Instructors it is indispensable that not only scholarship but also teaching ability, general character and tact on the part of the candidates for these positions be considered. A man may be admirably well suited to hold the position of a fellow or advanced student and yet quite unfitted to perform the duties of an Instructor with advantage to the students whom he is to aid in teaching. In other words, an Instructor should have the qualifications of a fellow and other no less important qualifications besides.

Fourth. That in view of these considerations it is not feasible to select proper men for the positions of Instructors by means of competitive examinations, and that their selection should, as formerly, be left to the Professors in charge of the several schools concerned, such Professors (or Heads of Schools) to be held responsible for the good judgment of their selections, and the Instructors or Assistants to be in turn held responsible for the proper performance of their duties to the several Professors.

Fifth. That in some at least of the Schools or Departments named for the proposed fellowships it is not possible to procure competent instructors or assistants at the compensation proposed. The duties involved are different in character as well as extent, and the positions require separate consideration.

Sixth. That Professor Harrison wishes to draw attention to the case of his assistant as similar to those of the other Schools named, though, owing to the late date at which his assistant was authorized, no mention was made of him in the paper to the Visitors.\]

Resolved: That it is at present deemed inexpedient to consider the recommendation of the Faculty (K, page 10, Faculty report) with reference to the erection of a building for the Law Department.

\[Section K, page 10, of the Annual Report of the Faculty, reads as follows:

K                 Report on a Law Building.

Resolved, That the Faculty wish to present for consideration by the Visitors the fact that the space accommodation for carrying on the work of the University, as provided for in the arrangement of the new buildings, is insufficient.

It is, therefore, recommended that the Visitors consider the advisability of erecting a Law Department building, to cost about $20,000, to be used exclusively for the Law Department.\]

Resolved: That the nominations of the following Assistant instructors made by the Faculty for the Session of 1897-1898 be approved, and the instructors named be elected. They are as follows:

Physics: J. H. Corbett

Latin: C. C. Wright

English: H. M. Blain

Demonstrator of Anatomy: A. C. Jones

Demonstrator of Pathology & Medl Biology: L. Skeen, Jr.

Resolved: That as suggested in the Faculty report on page 14, the instructorship in Chemistry be abolished; and that for the present the services of the Assistant in Engineering be dispensed with.

Resolved, that the salary of the instructor in Latin be placed at $700. pe annum; that of the instructor in Physics at $800., that of the instructor in English at $300, that of the two in Biology at $300. each, that of Demonstrator of Anatomy at $800., that of the Demonstrator of Pathology and Medical Biology $800., and that the salaries of the Professors, Associate Professors and Adjunct Professors remain for the session 1897-98 as stated on page 18 of said Faculty report.

Resolved: That $600. be appropriated to establish a hospital for the next session, to be expended under the direction of the Executive Committee.

Resolved: that it is inexpedient at this time to increase \* \*On page 180, information from the Annual Report of the Faculty (1896-1897) has been inserted. the salary of the Secretary of the Faculty.

On page 180, information from the Annual Report of the Faculty (1896-1897) has been inserted.

Resolved: That applicants for the Degree of Ph.D. who may not be in attendance at the University shall never theless pay the usual matriculation fees.

Resolved: that the settlement made by the Chairman of the Faculty with Mr E. S. Vass for fees in the medical department by taking his note for $100.00, be and the same is hereby ratified and approved.

Resolved: That the appropriation for the Bulletin be diminished to $300. as requested in the Report of the Faculty, page 15.

Resolved: That the appropriation for the annals of Mathematics be increased to $500. as requested by the Faculty on page 16 of the Report.

Resolved: That under the circumstances of the case the tuition fees of Mr James A. Lyon be returned to him, it being understood that the requirements of the Law touching citizenship have been fully complied with.

Resolved: That in all cases of students applying for exemption from tuition fees on the ground of citizenship, about which there may be any doubt, the Chairman of the Faculty shall report the facts of the case to the Law Faculty, and such exemption shall be allowed upon his advice, when the citizenship of the student shall be such as is required by law.

Resolved: That the Proctor be directed to press the collection of all unpaid tuition fees, in such manner as in his judgment may be expedient, after full consultation and conference with the Chairman of the Faculty.

Resolved: That the Proctor pay to Dr Buckmaster $35.15 amount expended by him for rent of rooms opposite the Dispensary for the occupancy of patients.

Resolved: That the request of Mrs Elsom to have restored to her the room opening on the back porch of the Hotel and House now occupied by her, be granted, said room having been last year used as a dormitory, but properly belonging to said house.

Resolved: That the classified summary of Expenditures of the Building Committee, from Nov. 15th, 1897, as checked and corrected by Robert Robertson, Superintendent of Grounds & Buildings, be spread on the records. The following is a copy thereof:

Classified Summary of Expenditures of the Building Committee, from Nov. 15th 1895 to June 15th 1897.

"Checked & correct within 0.44 cts." signed, Robert Robertson, Supt

Resolved: That as requested by the Professor of Astronomy, two of the fellows in Astronomy hereafter receive $350.00 per annum, and the other fellowship remain as heretofore at $400.00 per annum.

Resolved: That as requested by Profr Tuttle and concurred in by the Miller Board, the assistants in Biology & Agriculture be known as Fellows, and that their salaries be as recommended by the Miller Board.

The Rector having laid before the Board a letter from Profr Charles W. Kent to Col. Thomas H. Carter, Proctor, dated June 3d 1897 states that there was a balance of $797.31 in the general account of the University which properly belongs to the specific Endowment of the Linden Kent Memorial School of English Literature.

Resolved: that Profr Kent is invited to present to the Board such suggestions of expenditures for the benefit of said school as he may think the school requires.

Resolved: That the fee deposited by Mr R. M. Bruns of $30.00 for the course in Materia Medica, which course was not attended by him, be refunded, as recommended by the Faculty.

Resolved: That $50.00, the matriculation fee of Mr W. J. McNair for the current session and for the session of 1897-1898 be remitted to the Committee on Religious Exercises, as approved by the Faculty.

Resolved: That as requested by Mr. Mann Page, and approved by the Chairman of the Faculty, the sum of $28.50 due him on account of withdrawal for sickness, from the University during the session of $1895-96 be refunded to him by the Proctor.

Resolved: That it is at this time inexpedient to consider the application of Messrs Sykes, Cochrane and Bowen, for the establishment of twelve additional scholarships out of the Fayerweather fund.

Resolved: That the Report of the Superintendent of Grounds & Buildings dated June 7th, 1897, be referred to the Executive Committee with authority to act.

Resolved: That the Report of the Librarian be received and filed.

Resolved: That the bill of W. P. Smith for work in examining the Proctor's Office and his expenses in the same behalf, the whole amounting to $293.80 be paid, less any amount already paid.

Resolved: That the donation of Profr James A. Harrison to the Library, standing to the credit of the Library Fund on the books of the Proctor, and amounting to $100. be at Profr Harrison's request, applied to that portion of the Library to be known as the Poe Memorial Alcove, heretofore at this meeting provided for, and that the same be paid over to Profr Harrison by the Proctor, as said Profr Harrison may require, to be expended by him for the purchase of books, connected with Edgar Allen Poe, for said Alcove.

Whereas, the Hon. William Jennings Bryan of Lincoln, Nebraska has offered to give to the University of Virginia, $250.00 on condition that said sum be permanently invested and the annual proceeds used as a prize to stimulate the students of the University to study and understand the principles which underlie our forms of government. Therefore, be it Resolved, that the Proctor of the University of Virginia, who is its financial agent, be authorized to receive and be the custodian of said sum, the income of this money as invested to be used annually in the purchase of a medal to be won by open competition in the University Magazine for the best original article on the Theory of Government, the chairman of the Faculty being authorized to appoint the Committee whose decision shall be final.

Resolved: That the Medal shall be known as the William Jennings Bryan Medal; and that the thanks of the Rector and Visitors be returned Mr Bryan for his generous donation.

Resolved, that the compensation of the Demonstrator of Anatomy shall be $1000.00 per annum, and the resolution heretofore passed fixing the sum at $800. be and is hereby repealed.

Resolved, that authority is hereby given the Proctor to lease to Mrs Mary E. Towles for one year and thereafter from year to year the tract of land containing 10 or 12 acres lying south of the farm of the said Mrs Towles and between said farm and the road to the Cemetery, for the annual sum of $5.00,-the tenant to keep the land fenced.

The report of the Committee appointed to examine the accounts and securities in the hands of the late Proctor, Major Green Peyton decd, having been read and considered on motion the following resolution was adopted:

Resolved: That the report of the Special Committee to examine the accounts and securities in the hands of the late Proctor be and the same is received and approved; and the Secretary of the Board is directed to record on the minutes of the Board the said report, and also the Report of W. P. Smith the Expert Accountant and the statements marked A. C. D. E. filed therewith and shall also record on the minutes the receipt of Thomas H. Carter, Proctor, for the Cash and securities turned over to him.

Said reports and receipt here follow:

To the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia.

Your Committee appointed to examine the accounts & securities in the hands of the late Proctor respectfully report.

After some difficulty in securing the services of a competent expert they succeeded in employing Mr W. P. Smith of Richmond, after a thorough research and with considerable labor he has made his report, which is returned herewith, from which it appears that the cash on hand apparently exceeds the amount to be accounted for by the Proctor's books by $164.57.

Your Committee had also taken an inventory of the cash and securities in the Proctor's Office and herewith returns the receipt of Col Thomas H. Carter, Proctor, for the same.

The accounts kept by the Chairman of the Faculty during the interval between the death of the late Proctor and the appointment of his successor were also examined and found correct, as were also the accounts of the Superintendent of Grounds and Buildings.

While the Proctor's books were in an unfinished condition, owing to his death, his accounts were found to be correct.

The Special Committee on investigation of the Proctor's office, University of Virginia.

Gentlemen: I respectfully beg to report that in accordance with your directions, I have thoroughly examined the books and accounts in the office of the Proctor, and while the accounts are kept in the old fashioned system of single entry, where there are no checks or proofs by balancing, so far the postings, additions, transfers and transactions in cash are concerned they are with the exception of a few errors, which are plainly clerical, correct.

I enclose herewith, statements of the most important accounts, to which I invite your attention, but all of the books have been examined and corrected, and an inspection of the Ledger will fully inform you as to any other accounts, which I deem it unnecessary to make up in detail.

Appendix "A." showing to the credit of the late Proctor $164.57

Appendix "B." presents status of Restoration Fund.

Appendix C. Cash transactions in Bonds.

Appendix D. Inventory of bonds on hand May 26th 1897.

Appendix E. Account of sales of bonds.

Appendix F. Income derived from payment of students.

Appendix G. Memo of salaries paid professors.

I also enclose some original data which I have used in the compilation of the accounts, and which may be useful to you in future. At your suggestion I be to recommend a change in your Cash Book ( a copy of which I have furnished to Col Thos H. Carter, Proctor.) so arranged that the postings to the different accounts may be made monthly, and a reference to which, at any time, will show the receipts and disbursements without the long and laborious work of referring and condensing. I think this change will save great time and labor to the Proctor, and be much more satisfactory to all the officers and all concerned.

I further recommend that all the cash business, as far as possible, be done through the Banks by checks and deposits, and to this end that the Fuel Account be so arranged and kept as to prevent the necessity of carrying an amount of cash tickets in the cash drawer.

The collection of interest or dividends on any securities held by the institution, when collected, if credited to its peculiar fund, before being passed into income account (which should be done when closing the books at the end of the session), would save much trouble and research to the officers and others in determining the standing of any of the accounts at any time during the session.

I further respectfully recommend that the Double Entry or check system be adopted in the work wherever it can be applied.

The regulations governing the books of the University require that they shall run continuously from the beginning to the end of the session, and I therefore omit to enclose some other reports, which I cannot do without some changes in the books; but an examination of the accounts which I have fully audited, examined and corrected, will give you any desired information.

At the regular meeting of the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia held on the 14th day of June 1897.

Present,

W. C. N. Randolph, Rector, and Visitors Watts, McCormick, Gordon, Irvine, Harmon and McIlwaine.

After hearing these gentlemen, on motion

The Board at 12 P. M. adjourned to 930 A. M. of 15th inst.

The Board of Visitors met pursuant to adjournment on yesterday. Present:

The Rector, and Visitors McCormick, Gordon, Irvine, Harmon, Bryan and McIlwaine.

Absent: Visitors, Watts and Patteson.

The following was enacted:

Resolved, that the recommendation of the Faculty's report (p 3. Sec A.) be referred to the Executive Committee with full power and authority to act.

The Committee to confer with the Miller Board submitted its report which reads as follows:

To the Rector and Visitors of the University:

Your Committee have conferred with the Miller Board & return herewith the suggestions and recommendations of that Board in which Your Committee concurs.

I have the honor to submit to you a report of the financial transactions of the University, for the fiscal year ending June 30th, 1897. As preface, permit me to say, that my lamented predecessor and myself were close friends and comrades in arms during the war. Both on the field and in Camp Green Peyton was always, and everywhere a brave and efficient soldier. Wherever placed in life, he proved himself a man of intellect, attainments, energy and force of character. His ill health for many months before his death, together with the increased work incident to the receipt and disbursement of a large restoration fund, caused his accounts to be left in an unfinished condition. Thoroughly conversant with the peculiar character of the University accounts, by a service as Proctor for twenty seven years, he found no need to record many facts which were safely stored in his own mind, but not immediately accessible to a new incumbent. So, too with a memory singularly tenacious, he left no correspondence for he felt the need of none His cash-book and ledger were his letter-press and letter-file.

I took official charge of the Proctor's Office May 1, 1897. A committee appointed by a full Board of Visitors, was instructed to examine thoroughly the accounts to date, and were empowered to employ an expert to assist them. A report by the Committee and expert will doubtless be furnished you.

The same Committee was also instructed to make an inventory of the bonds held by the University, and a list of them is herewith submitted. These bonds are kept in the Bank of Albemarle, and People's National Bank, Charlottesville, under two locks, one key of each being in the hands of the Officers of said banks, and one in the keeping of the Proctor.

As compared with the annual report of last year, 1895-6, the inventory list of bonds shows that the Va 3's, with the exception of those in the John Y. Mason Fellowship Fund, have been sold. It is understood here that Major Peyton's intention was to sell all the Va 3's in the sinking fund, then bearing a good price, and re-invest in Va 2s (Century) bonds at a lower price, in order to anticipate their rise in value and interest, at the beginning of the coming century. The proceeds of these sales are in the Banks in Charlottesville, in which the deposits and accounts are directed by the Board to be kept. No doubt the Board at this meeting will designate the securities in which the money shall be reinvested.

The Richmond & Danville gold 6's, and the Atlanta & Charlotte 7's of the Astronomical Department were sold in accordance with the order of the Board, and reinvested in 153, five hundred dollars bonds ($76,500.) of the 5% new University bonds. Notwithstanding the premium at which the Richmond & Danville 6's, and the Atlanta & Charlotte 7's, were sold, there is a small loss of interest per annum, ($15500) to the Astronomical Department, on account of the lower interest of the 5% new University Bonds. All the 400 new University 5% bonds (500. each) have been sold and interest is paid semi-annually, May 1st, and November 1st, to the Va Trust Company for the holders.

The $7,500. of interest on the $200,000 new University Bonds, prior to July 1, 1896, collected in accordance with the general appropriation bill of March 1896, has been divided in the tabular statement below, and $2000. placed to the Sinking Fund, in accordance with the action of the Board, April 26, 1896. The remaining $5,500. is specified in the table as a Reserve fund, and the Board will doubtless designate its proper application.

The attention of the Board is invited to an inclosed letter from Profr Kent, showing $797.31 due the English Literature school under the specific conditions of the gift made by Mrs Leita Kent in her endowment of the Linden Kent Memorial School of English Literature.

I have examined the ledger of the year mentioned and am of the opinion that the sum should be paid back to the school.

Under the authority of Sec. 242, page 46 of the Laws of the laws of the University of Virginia, 1892, I engaged the services of Mr I. K. Moran, a clerk of experience, from the middle of May till the middle of June, having previously employed him from May 1st, to the middle of the month at my own expense. He has worked most faithfully and efficiently day, and part of the night at times, and I ask that he be liberally rewarded.

Two handsome subscriptions were procured by Profr W. M. Thornton on a recent visit to Boston, one of a thousand dollars from Augustus Hemenway, Esq, and one of five thousand dollars from T. Jefferson Coolidge, Esq.

It will be necessary for the Board to consider and decide the question as to the quantity of fuel for another year. If the new rooms are to be heated, the estimate of previous years will be misleading. I have found Mr Skinner, the Supervising architect, well informed as to the capacity and requirements of the boilers for heating a part, or all of the new rooms, and the quantity of coal required respectively.

Itemized statements of various accounts is appended.

Resolved: That in view of the unusually onerous duties imposed upon the Secretary of the Board since the destruction of the University Buildings by fire in the fall of 1895, the said Secretary be paid the sum of $150. in addition to his regular salary.

Mr Gordon moved the adoption of the foregoing resolution and upon this motion Mr Mc Ilwaine called for a recorded vote which was ordered and on call of the roll the following was the result.

On announcement of the result Mr McIlwaine moved that the vote in favor of the adoption of the resolution be made unanimous, which was done.

On motion the Board adjourned to meet tomorrow morning at 10 oclock.

The Board of Visitors met in pursuance of adjournment on yesterday.

Present the same members as on yesterday, viz: The Rector, and Visitors, McCormick, Gordon, Irvine, Harmon, Bryan and McIlwaine.

The following was enacted

Resolved: That the thanks of the Rector and Visitors be extended to Messrs T. Jefferson Coolidge and Augustus Hemenway for their recent donations to the University.

Resolved: That the Rector and Visitors approve of the communication of Profr Wm M. Thornton to the Trustees of the Balinda Randall fund; and the Rector be clothed with authority to do whatever may be necessary to forward the success of said petition.

Resolved: That Profr Buckmaster be elected to the chair in the Medical Faculty now occupied by him.

Resolved: That the thanks of the Rector and Visitors be extended to Profr Wm M. Thornton for his services in endeavoring to secure a donation to the University from the Trustees of the Balinda Randall Fund.

Resolved: That Dr P. B. Barringer be re-elected Chairman of the Faculty for the ensuing session. This resolution was adopted by call of the ayes and nos and on call of the roll all of the members voted aye, but Mr McIlwaine, who voted no.: he having called for the vote by ayes & nos.

Resolved: That the present Executive Committee be continued for the ensuing year with Mr Harmon as Chairman, the Rector having requested that he be relieved of the duties of Chairman of the Committee.

Resolved: That the Faculty be requested to furnish the Visitors at their meeting in November next a sheme of entrance examinations for academic students in the University of Virginia

The Committee appointed at the meeting in April last to prepare resolutions in regard to the death of Major Green Peyton, late Proctor, submitted its report through Mr Gordon its chairman, which was read to the Board and is as follows:

Memorial.

The Committee of the Visitors appointed at the meeting in April last to report suitable resolutions in regard to the death of the late Proctor of the University, Major Green Peyton, submit following:

The announcement of the death of Major Peyton has come with peculiar sorrow to the Visitors. For a period of more than twenty five years he was a faithful and trusted officer of the University, giving to the discharge of the duties of the office he so ably filled, all the energy and talents with which he was so remarkably endowed. In his intercourse with this Board as a wise counsellor and friend in the matters of University finance, he exhibited an interest, an ability, and a kindly consideration that were as marked as they were acceptable to the Visitors. In his death the University has lost an admirable and efficient officer, and each member of the Board a personal friend. His work is ineffacably stamped upon the history of the University as most beneficent and valuable, and his memory will live in the hearts of all those with whom he was ever brought in personal contact.

The Visitors desire to spread this testimonial upon their record, and ask that it may be printed in the Alumni Bulletin; and that the Secretary of the Board send a copy to the family of our friend.

Mr Harmon moved that the report be adopted and that a recorded vote be taken thereon which was ordered, and on a call of the roll all of the members voted for the adoption of the report, viz: The Rector, McCormick, Gordon, Harmon, Irvine, Bryan & McIlwaine.

Resolved: That the Faculty be requested to furnish to the Visitors at their meeting in November next a scheme of prize scholarships to be offered to the University Schools in Virginia and the South based upon the idea of the exemption from all fees, matriculation and other in Virginia, and upon the idea of the exemption from tuition fees in other Southern states to students in the academic departments. Said scholarships to be awarded such University schools as may have sent to the University a certain number of academic students in the previous sessions.

But this resolution shall not exclude the presentation by the Faculty of any other scheme of University school prize scholarships, which may tend to draw the University and the said schools throughout the south in closer contact.

Resolved, that the Faculty be requested to suggest to the meeting of the Board to be held in November next a plan for the selection of 5 scholarships in the academic schools of the University of Virginia to be filled upon completion from the pupils of the Public Free-schools in the State, each scholarship to be for the term of three years and to include the payment of $200.00 per annum to the successful applicant while a student in the academical schools of the University. And the Secretary of this Board is directed to forward a printed copy of this resolution to each of the County and City Superintendents of Schools in the state with the request that he make suggestions as to a plan for carrying the proposed arrangement into effect.

Resolved, that the Board appreciates the efforts of the Faculty during the last vacation to add to the attendance of the University, and hopes that similar work, with equally good results, may be done during the coming vacation.

Resolved, that a Committee of three be appointed to take into consideration and report to a special meeting what, if any, retrenchments can be made in the expensds of the University particularly to consider the number and salaries of the professors and instructors. Action on the part of this committee will be considered at the November meeting, but any result reached shall not take effect until Sept. 15th 1898.

The Rector appointed Messrs McCormick, Gordon and McIlwaine as the committee.

Resolved: That a committee of three, to be chosen by the Rector, be appointed to examine and report upon the revision of the laws of the University made by the Secretary, pursuant to the resolution of the Board; and that said Committee report what sum will be a proper compensation for said Secretaries services in compiling said revision.

The Rector appointed as said Committee, Messrs Gordon, Harmon and McIlwaine.

Whereas the qualifications and large personal acquaintance of the Proctor are such as to enable him to do efficient work towards increasing the attendance at the University,

Resolved: That the Proctor be requested to do what he can to add to the number of students.

Learning that an effort is being made by friends of the University, both here and in the North to gather together a Poe Memorial Library for the Library of the University of Virginia, at the suggestion of friends of the movement here, it is resolved that an alcove of the University Library be set aside as a Poe Memorial Alcove for the reception of said Memorial Library; said alcove to be selected by the Library Committee of the Faculty.

Resolved: That the Professor of Astronomy be authorized to nominate to the Visitors for appointment by them the Fellows in the Astronomical Department, provided for by the Board at its June meeting, 1896.

Resolved: That Section I (page 9), of the Faculty Report be approved so far as the recommendations therein contained are concerned; and that in accordance with the said recommendations the Professors in the several schools in which there are assistants or Instructors be severally authorized to nominate to the Visitors for appointment by them, the said several assistant instructors.

\[Inserted here pages 9 and 10 from the Annual Report of the Faculty for 1896-97, Section I of which is as follows:

I                 Report on Fellowships.

In response to the desire of the Visitors for a report from the Faculty in regard to the first recommendation of the executive committee's report on the proposed establishment of of five fellowships, to be awarded upon competitive examination, the fellows to act as Instructors in their several departments, the Faculty beg leave to suggest:

First. That it is desirable that all Instructors or Assistants to Professors shall, as far as their duties to the University, for which they are paid, will permit, devote their time to advanced study, especially in the direction of original research, to this extent carrying out the object, and themselves deriving the advantage, of the institution of fellowships. An order to this effect has already been suggested by the Faculty and approved by the Visitors.

Second. That in the choice of Instructors it is desirable that, as far as possible, preference be given to young men engaged in, or desirous of engaging in, advanced and especially research work.

Third. That in the choice of Instructors it is indispensable that not only scholarship but also teaching ability, general character and tact on the part of the candidates for these positions be considered. A man may be admirably well suited to hold the position of a fellow or advanced student and yet quite unfitted to perform the duties of an Instructor with advantage to the students whom he is to aid in teaching. In other words, an Instructor should have the qualifications of a fellow and other no less important qualifications besides.

Fourth. That in view of these considerations it is not feasible to select proper men for the positions of Instructors by means of competitive examinations, and that their selection should, as formerly, be left to the Professors in charge of the several schools concerned, such Professors (or Heads of Schools) to be held responsible for the good judgment of their selections, and the Instructors or Assistants to be in turn held responsible for the proper performance of their duties to the several Professors.

Fifth. That in some at least of the Schools or Departments named for the proposed fellowships it is not possible to procure competent instructors or assistants at the compensation proposed. The duties involved are different in character as well as extent, and the positions require separate consideration.

Sixth. That Professor Harrison wishes to draw attention to the case of his assistant as similar to those of the other Schools named, though, owing to the late date at which his assistant was authorized, no mention was made of him in the paper to the Visitors.\]

Resolved: That it is at present deemed inexpedient to consider the recommendation of the Faculty (K, page 10, Faculty report) with reference to the erection of a building for the Law Department.

\[Section K, page 10, of the Annual Report of the Faculty, reads as follows:

K                 Report on a Law Building.

Resolved, That the Faculty wish to present for consideration by the Visitors the fact that the space accommodation for carrying on the work of the University, as provided for in the arrangement of the new buildings, is insufficient.

It is, therefore, recommended that the Visitors consider the advisability of erecting a Law Department building, to cost about $20,000, to be used exclusively for the Law Department.\]

Resolved: That the nominations of the following Assistant instructors made by the Faculty for the Session of 1897-1898 be approved, and the instructors named be elected. They are as follows:

Physics: J. H. Corbett

Latin: C. C. Wright

English: H. M. Blain

Demonstrator of Anatomy: A. C. Jones

Demonstrator of Pathology & Medl Biology: L. Skeen, Jr.

Resolved: That as suggested in the Faculty report on page 14, the instructorship in Chemistry be abolished; and that for the present the services of the Assistant in Engineering be dispensed with.

Resolved, that the salary of the instructor in Latin be placed at $700. pe annum; that of the instructor in Physics at $800., that of the instructor in English at $300, that of the two in Biology at $300. each, that of Demonstrator of Anatomy at $800., that of the Demonstrator of Pathology and Medical Biology $800., and that the salaries of the Professors, Associate Professors and Adjunct Professors remain for the session 1897-98 as stated on page 18 of said Faculty report.

Resolved: That $600. be appropriated to establish a hospital for the next session, to be expended under the direction of the Executive Committee.

Resolved: that it is inexpedient at this time to increase \* \*On page 180, information from the Annual Report of the Faculty (1896-1897) has been inserted. the salary of the Secretary of the Faculty.

On page 180, information from the Annual Report of the Faculty (1896-1897) has been inserted.

Resolved: That applicants for the Degree of Ph.D. who may not be in attendance at the University shall never theless pay the usual matriculation fees.

Resolved: that the settlement made by the Chairman of the Faculty with Mr E. S. Vass for fees in the medical department by taking his note for $100.00, be and the same is hereby ratified and approved.

Resolved: That the appropriation for the Bulletin be diminished to $300. as requested in the Report of the Faculty, page 15.

Resolved: That the appropriation for the annals of Mathematics be increased to $500. as requested by the Faculty on page 16 of the Report.

Resolved: That under the circumstances of the case the tuition fees of Mr James A. Lyon be returned to him, it being understood that the requirements of the Law touching citizenship have been fully complied with.

Resolved: That in all cases of students applying for exemption from tuition fees on the ground of citizenship, about which there may be any doubt, the Chairman of the Faculty shall report the facts of the case to the Law Faculty, and such exemption shall be allowed upon his advice, when the citizenship of the student shall be such as is required by law.

Resolved: That the Proctor be directed to press the collection of all unpaid tuition fees, in such manner as in his judgment may be expedient, after full consultation and conference with the Chairman of the Faculty.

Resolved: That the Proctor pay to Dr Buckmaster $35.15 amount expended by him for rent of rooms opposite the Dispensary for the occupancy of patients.

Resolved: That the request of Mrs Elsom to have restored to her the room opening on the back porch of the Hotel and House now occupied by her, be granted, said room having been last year used as a dormitory, but properly belonging to said house.

Resolved: That the classified summary of Expenditures of the Building Committee, from Nov. 15th, 1897, as checked and corrected by Robert Robertson, Superintendent of Grounds & Buildings, be spread on the records. The following is a copy thereof:

Classified Summary of Expenditures of the Building Committee, from Nov. 15th 1895 to June 15th 1897.

"Checked & correct within 0.44 cts." signed, Robert Robertson, Supt

Resolved: That as requested by the Professor of Astronomy, two of the fellows in Astronomy hereafter receive $350.00 per annum, and the other fellowship remain as heretofore at $400.00 per annum.

Resolved: That as requested by Profr Tuttle and concurred in by the Miller Board, the assistants in Biology & Agriculture be known as Fellows, and that their salaries be as recommended by the Miller Board.

The Rector having laid before the Board a letter from Profr Charles W. Kent to Col. Thomas H. Carter, Proctor, dated June 3d 1897 states that there was a balance of $797.31 in the general account of the University which properly belongs to the specific Endowment of the Linden Kent Memorial School of English Literature.

Resolved: that Profr Kent is invited to present to the Board such suggestions of expenditures for the benefit of said school as he may think the school requires.

Resolved: That the fee deposited by Mr R. M. Bruns of $30.00 for the course in Materia Medica, which course was not attended by him, be refunded, as recommended by the Faculty.

Resolved: That $50.00, the matriculation fee of Mr W. J. McNair for the current session and for the session of 1897-1898 be remitted to the Committee on Religious Exercises, as approved by the Faculty.

Resolved: That as requested by Mr. Mann Page, and approved by the Chairman of the Faculty, the sum of $28.50 due him on account of withdrawal for sickness, from the University during the session of $1895-96 be refunded to him by the Proctor.

Resolved: That it is at this time inexpedient to consider the application of Messrs Sykes, Cochrane and Bowen, for the establishment of twelve additional scholarships out of the Fayerweather fund.

Resolved: That the Report of the Superintendent of Grounds & Buildings dated June 7th, 1897, be referred to the Executive Committee with authority to act.

Resolved: That the Report of the Librarian be received and filed.

Resolved: That the bill of W. P. Smith for work in examining the Proctor's Office and his expenses in the same behalf, the whole amounting to $293.80 be paid, less any amount already paid.

Resolved: That the donation of Profr James A. Harrison to the Library, standing to the credit of the Library Fund on the books of the Proctor, and amounting to $100. be at Profr Harrison's request, applied to that portion of the Library to be known as the Poe Memorial Alcove, heretofore at this meeting provided for, and that the same be paid over to Profr Harrison by the Proctor, as said Profr Harrison may require, to be expended by him for the purchase of books, connected with Edgar Allen Poe, for said Alcove.

Whereas, the Hon. William Jennings Bryan of Lincoln, Nebraska has offered to give to the University of Virginia, $250.00 on condition that said sum be permanently invested and the annual proceeds used as a prize to stimulate the students of the University to study and understand the principles which underlie our forms of government. Therefore, be it Resolved, that the Proctor of the University of Virginia, who is its financial agent, be authorized to receive and be the custodian of said sum, the income of this money as invested to be used annually in the purchase of a medal to be won by open competition in the University Magazine for the best original article on the Theory of Government, the chairman of the Faculty being authorized to appoint the Committee whose decision shall be final.

Resolved: That the Medal shall be known as the William Jennings Bryan Medal; and that the thanks of the Rector and Visitors be returned Mr Bryan for his generous donation.

Resolved, that the compensation of the Demonstrator of Anatomy shall be $1000.00 per annum, and the resolution heretofore passed fixing the sum at $800. be and is hereby repealed.

Resolved, that authority is hereby given the Proctor to lease to Mrs Mary E. Towles for one year and thereafter from year to year the tract of land containing 10 or 12 acres lying south of the farm of the said Mrs Towles and between said farm and the road to the Cemetery, for the annual sum of $5.00,-the tenant to keep the land fenced.

The report of the Committee appointed to examine the accounts and securities in the hands of the late Proctor, Major Green Peyton decd, having been read and considered on motion the following resolution was adopted:

Resolved: That the report of the Special Committee to examine the accounts and securities in the hands of the late Proctor be and the same is received and approved; and the Secretary of the Board is directed to record on the minutes of the Board the said report, and also the Report of W. P. Smith the Expert Accountant and the statements marked A. C. D. E. filed therewith and shall also record on the minutes the receipt of Thomas H. Carter, Proctor, for the Cash and securities turned over to him.

Said reports and receipt here follow:

To the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia.

Your Committee appointed to examine the accounts & securities in the hands of the late Proctor respectfully report.

After some difficulty in securing the services of a competent expert they succeeded in employing Mr W. P. Smith of Richmond, after a thorough research and with considerable labor he has made his report, which is returned herewith, from which it appears that the cash on hand apparently exceeds the amount to be accounted for by the Proctor's books by $164.57.

Your Committee had also taken an inventory of the cash and securities in the Proctor's Office and herewith returns the receipt of Col Thomas H. Carter, Proctor, for the same.

The accounts kept by the Chairman of the Faculty during the interval between the death of the late Proctor and the appointment of his successor were also examined and found correct, as were also the accounts of the Superintendent of Grounds and Buildings.

While the Proctor's books were in an unfinished condition, owing to his death, his accounts were found to be correct.

The Special Committee on investigation of the Proctor's office, University of Virginia.

Gentlemen: I respectfully beg to report that in accordance with your directions, I have thoroughly examined the books and accounts in the office of the Proctor, and while the accounts are kept in the old fashioned system of single entry, where there are no checks or proofs by balancing, so far the postings, additions, transfers and transactions in cash are concerned they are with the exception of a few errors, which are plainly clerical, correct.

I enclose herewith, statements of the most important accounts, to which I invite your attention, but all of the books have been examined and corrected, and an inspection of the Ledger will fully inform you as to any other accounts, which I deem it unnecessary to make up in detail.

Appendix "A." showing to the credit of the late Proctor $164.57

Appendix "B." presents status of Restoration Fund.

Appendix C. Cash transactions in Bonds.

Appendix D. Inventory of bonds on hand May 26th 1897.

Appendix E. Account of sales of bonds.

Appendix F. Income derived from payment of students.

Appendix G. Memo of salaries paid professors.

I also enclose some original data which I have used in the compilation of the accounts, and which may be useful to you in future. At your suggestion I be to recommend a change in your Cash Book ( a copy of which I have furnished to Col Thos H. Carter, Proctor.) so arranged that the postings to the different accounts may be made monthly, and a reference to which, at any time, will show the receipts and disbursements without the long and laborious work of referring and condensing. I think this change will save great time and labor to the Proctor, and be much more satisfactory to all the officers and all concerned.

I further recommend that all the cash business, as far as possible, be done through the Banks by checks and deposits, and to this end that the Fuel Account be so arranged and kept as to prevent the necessity of carrying an amount of cash tickets in the cash drawer.

The collection of interest or dividends on any securities held by the institution, when collected, if credited to its peculiar fund, before being passed into income account (which should be done when closing the books at the end of the session), would save much trouble and research to the officers and others in determining the standing of any of the accounts at any time during the session.

I further respectfully recommend that the Double Entry or check system be adopted in the work wherever it can be applied.

The regulations governing the books of the University require that they shall run continuously from the beginning to the end of the session, and I therefore omit to enclose some other reports, which I cannot do without some changes in the books; but an examination of the accounts which I have fully audited, examined and corrected, will give you any desired information.
