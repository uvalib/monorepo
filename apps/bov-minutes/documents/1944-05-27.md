MEMORIAL ADOPTED BY THE BOARD OF VISITORS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA TO THE HONORABLE AUBREY GARDNER WEAVER

At the high point of his leadership in the Senate of Virginia, at the peak of his prominence as a lawyer, surrounded by troops of friends, Aubrey G. Weaver died, about midnight, March 10, 1944, after reaching the lobby of the Jefferson Hotel, Richmond, Virginia, from the effects of the hot smoke that drove him from his room and overstrained a weakened heart.

While still in love with life and full of ambition for the future, tragedy, unannounced and unsuspected, took from the State this useful servant and from his admirers this valued friend.

Few public men have touched the life of the State at so many points. Aubrey Weaver had a rare talent for politics. He displayed remarkable poise and good sense. Session after session, he led the Finance Committee of the Senate in the making of a budget that preserved a balance between income and outgo and, at the same time, afforded sufficient funds to permit the State to progress.

Aubrey Weaver was appointed by Governor Colgate W. Darden, Jr. a member of the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia on the 1st day of March, 1942, and has served faithfully since that time.

A successful student in the University of Virginia Law School, Aubrey Weaver was awarded, in 1902, the degree of Bachelor of Law. He was very proud of his class and usually returned to the University to class reunions. For the University, itself, Aubrey Weaver cherished an admiring affection, and he was always anxious to serve his Alma Mater. He spent many weeks as a patient in the University Hospital, and was successful in obtaining certain appropriations for the improvement of the hospital buildings. In the meetings of this Board, he was active and his wide experience in the public life of the State gave both authority and effectiveness to his recommendations.

Born at Front Royal, Virginia, in 1882, Aubrey Weaver prepared at Randolph Macon Academy for the University of Virginia. When he obtained his law degree in 1902 he was not yet twenty-one and he was enabled, only by a special Act, to take his examination for admission to the bar. While awaiting the opportunity to practice, he served The Chesapeake and Ohio Railway, as an Assistant Claim Agent. His office was at Clifton Forge, and here he remained until February, 1905, when he resigned to become a partner with Henry H. Downing, a leader of the Front Royal Bar, in the practice of law.

When Mr. Downing died, in January, 1919, Aubrey Weaver formed a law partnership with the late W. C. Armstrong, former Clerk of the Circuit Court of Rappahannock County. In December, 1936, this firm was dissolved by the death of Mr. Armstrong, and the new firm of Weaver, Armstrong and Marshall was formed to endure until the untimely death of the senior partner.

Aubrey Weaver's firm enjoyed a large practice, including the work of Division Counsel for The Norfolk and Western Railway, Assistant Division Counsel for the Southern Railway, counsel at Front Royal for the American Viscose Corporation, counsel for the Citizens National Bank of Front Royal, and solicitor for the town of Front Royal.

In his practice Aubrey Weaver was particularly good as a jury lawyer, and was skilful in the examination of witnesses.

In the General Assembly his services included four years in the House of Delegates, from 1912 to 1916, one-half of which time he was chairman of the Finance Committee of the House.

In 1915 he was appointed to the State Tax Commission and here he contributed to the development of Virginia's system of tax segregation. Senator Weaver was proud of his joint sponsorship with the late Lieutenant Governor B. F. Buchanan of a bill embodying changes suggested by the State Tax Commission.

Prominent as Aubrey Weaver was, however, in the House, it was not until he became well seated in the Senate that he was recognized as an outstanding legislative leader.

It was in 1931, that he was elected to the Virginia Senate after a close contest with the late John J. Morrison, of Harrisonburg. This district is composed of the City of Harrisonburg, and the counties of Warren, Rockingham, Page and Rappahannock.

Senator Weaver was already familiar with the work of the Senate Finance Committee when he was made chairman of this powerful committee in 1940. When it is noted that the Bill that was enacted only a few hours after his death carried appropriations for the biennium of two hundred and thirty-five million dollars, one may realize the magnitude of the work that Senator Weaver did.

For many years Senator Weaver was chairman of the Governor's Budget Advisory Committee, and toured the State in the study of the needs of the various institutions.

Senator Weaver served in the Senate under Governors Pollard, Peery, Price and Darden.

In addition to the chairmanship of the Finance Committee, Senator Weaver was also chairman of the important Steering Committee, which is a committee on committees.

He was especially proud of his successful work as patron of the old age assistance bill.

It was in June, 1912, that Governor Mann appointed Aubrey Weaver to the State Board of Law Examiners. He was proud of the service he rendered on this Board, and appreciated his election as President of this Board.

Aubrey G. Weaver was the son of the late W. Cass Weaver and Mrs. Weaver, of Warren County. He is survived by his wife, who was before her marriage Miss Pearl Davis Kenner; three daughters, Mrs. Joseph M. Carson, Jr., of Front Royal; Mrs. Alexander Craig Livingston, of New York City, and Mrs. Walter Allan Nichols, of Camp Cooke, California, and a brother, Henry B. Weaver, of Front Royal.

He was a member of the Methodist Church, and was active in many clubs, fraternal organizations and associations. He was prominent in the Masonic Order. He was a happy companion for his wife, children and grandchildren. When asked by a reporter to confess his hobbies, he replied; "My grandchildren." His tolerance his good humor, and his democratic love of people, his broad sympathies, made him a delightful host and an inspiring companion.

Upon this Board, where he once sat as one of us, we shall remember his kindness, his tolerance, his genius for friendship, his freedom from hypocrisy, and his readiness to serve the University he loved. If he had had time to reflect before his strong, bright mind was overcome by a weakened heart, he could have truthfully said, "I have done some service to the State; the brief candle of my life is burnt out; it is God's will that I go hence."

The meeting then adjourned.
