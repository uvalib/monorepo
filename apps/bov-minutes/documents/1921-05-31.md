I have pleasure in informing you that the General Education Board, at the meeting held May 26th, took the following action:

Resolved, That the executive officers of the General Education Board be, and they hereby are, authorized in their discretion to commit the Board to an amount not to exceed One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) to the University of Virginia, University, Virginia, made or to be made for the five years beginning July 1, 1921, to be distributed as follows:

20,000 for the year 1923-24

15,000 for the year 1924-25

in place of the appropriation of Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000) for the three years beginning July 1, 1921, made February 24, 1921 for the same purpose, which is hereby cancelled.

The above appropriation will be paid in cash on October 1st and April 1st of each year, unless you are advised to the contrary. Shortly before October 1st a form of requisition will be sent you for you to kindly fill out and return to us.

The President was requested to convey to the General Education Board their expressions of appreciation and gratitude, which he did as per the following letter:

Please pardon my delay in making formal answer to your telegram of May 31st, but I have been in the midst of Centennial, and this is the morning after.

It is difficult for me to express to you and, through you, to the Board, the appreciation the University has for the action taken May 26th. It was a handsome action which this institution will never forget, and I am authorized to extend, on behalf of the Board of Visitors, as well as the alumni, the grateful appreciation of the University of Virginia for their action. I understand perfectly the nature of the gift as set forth in detail in your letter of June 1st, I approve heartily of that method of giving, and of the purpose involved in the gift. I shall cause your letter to be spread upon our minutes, in order that the money given shall be used for precisely the purpose indicated.

I was able to announce a total of $1,500,000 as the net result of our strivings during the spring months. $200,000 of this sum was given as an independent gift for specific reasons, but given for endowment. This is not so bad for this period of deflation and depression.

Assuring you of our gratitude and good will, I am,

A gift from Paul Goodloe McIntire of the sum of $200,000 for the establishment and maintenance of a school or department of Commerce and Finance, as per the following letter:

In pursuance of our conference, I beg you will convey to the Rector and Visitors my purpose, if it be in accord with their wishes, to give the sum of $200,000 for the establishment and maintenance within the University of Virginia of a School or Department of Commerce and Finance, utilizing as far as possible the basis of such School or Department now in existence. The purpose of this school or department shall be to give such training for the career of business as will give our youth knowledge and skill in that field, and will inculcate in them those habits of economy and integrity upon which our whole economic life depends. The conditions I deem it wise to put upon this gift are the following:-

1\. This capital sum of $200,000 shall be setaside solely for the endowment for the School or Department designated, and the interest on it shall be used for the support of this school or department and for no other purpose.

2\. This endowment of $200,000 shall be treated as a gift independent of the Centennial Endowment Fund, and not subject to any charges falling upon or connected with that fund.

3\. This endowment shall be placed in trust for the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia in the United States Trust Company of 45 Wall St., New York, and the interest on the capital sum shall be paid by the United States Trust Company of New York, to the Rector and Visitors for the purposes indicated.

Assuring you of my unfailing interest in the growth of of the University of Virginia, and of my particular interest in the developments of well organized courses for the teaching of commerce and finance and for the proper preparation of young men for the opportunities, duties, and responsibilities of business life, I am,

The foregoing gift was accepted with sincere thanks, and the President was requested to express to Mr. McIntire the appreciation and gratitude of the Board for this new manifestation of his wisdom and benevolence, which the President conveyed in the following letter:

I had the honor to transmit your communication of May 30th, to the Rector and Visitors at their annual meeting on May 31st, 1921. The farseeing gift which it announces was accepted by them unanimously and with deep appreciation of the wisdom of the purpose for which the endowment is intended. I was directed by them to express to you their apprediation and gratitude for this new manifestation of your wisdon and beneficence. They begged me to assure you that they were accepting this gift mindful of all the conditions named by you which they consider wise and helpful conditions. It will be their purpose to carry out your wishes rigidly and to seek by all just means to develop the great new department which this endowment makes possible in the life of the University. I need not assure you of my own personal appreciation of the greatness and wisdom of your services to this institution in its effort to serve the youth of this and other generations.

The President presented the following report of the Committee on the site of the proposed new gymnasium:

The Committee appointed by the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia to investigate and report upon a site and plans for the proposed new gymnasium met at the president's office at 3 P. M., April 30th, the following gentlemen being present: Dr. Alderman, Dr. Lambeth, Mr. Robertson, Mr. Duke and Mr. Michie. Mr. Bryan and Dr. Warren were unable to attend. Dr. Lambeth was asked to act as chairman of the committee and Mr. Michie as secretary.

After some discussion of various possible methods of selecting an architect, a motion was adopted to the effect that several distinguished Virginia alumni who were architects should be invited to act as a commission, along with an outside, preferably Mr. Peadbody, of New York, and Professor Kimball of the University, in deciding upon the general plans for the building, the detail work and drafting to be done by the University School of Architecture under the direction of Professor Kimball. It was further resolved that a nominal fee, of perhaps $500, should be offered each of the gentlemen on the commission, and a somewhat larger fee to Professor Kimball in view of the more extensive work which he would be required to do under the plan. Dr. Lambeth was instructed to communicate with the architect to see if they would assent to the plan.

The subject of the site was then taken up and after discussion of several different possibilities, a committee consisting of Dr. Alderman, Dr. Lambeth, Mr. Duke and Mr. Michie was appointed to meet the Board of Trustees of the Y. M. C. A. to consult with them as to the possibility of securing the site now used by the Y. M. C. A. for Tennis courts. Dr. Lambeth as asked to arrange this meeting.

The Committee then adjourned.

The President stated that a meeting had been held by the Board of Directors of the Y. M. C. A. for the purpose of securing a site on the land now used for tennis courts, and presented the following paper drawn up by the Board of Directors with respect to transfer of apart of its land for the aforesaid purpose:

The Board of Directors of the Y. M. C. A. of the University of Virginia, Inc., hereby resolves to convey to the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that parcel of land extending from Rugby Road to Madison Lane and from the north boundry of the Association property to the line of the northern-most backstop of the tennis courts, being a rectangular strip of land approximately 300 × 100 ft. for the following consideration and under the following donditions, to wit:

1\. Cash consideration of ($5,000) Five Thousand Dollars.

2\. Condition that this land be used for the erection and maintenance of a gymnasium or other University purpose.

3\. Condition that the Rector and Visitors assume the responsibility for the operation of the present Y. M. C. A. tennis courts, collecting such fees for the use of these courts as they may deem it necessary to impose.

4\. Condition that if the Y. M. C. A. of the University of Virginia, Inc. desires the use of that portion of its property now used for tennis courts for any other purpose the Rector and Visitors of the University agree to give up this land on one years notice.

5\. Condition that the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia guarantee to the Y. M. C. A. of the University of Virginia, Inc. the perpetual right of way for a sewer line across said property to be conveyed and also assume financial responsibility for making any change in the present sewer which may be rendered necessary by the erection of the proposed building.

This transfer is not complete until and unless these conditions are complied with.

After due consideration of the conditions contained in the foregoing paper, it was deemed inexpedient to close the bargain, and in view of the fact that President Alderman is President of the Board of Directors of the Y. M. C. A. and preferred that some one else should act as a representative of the University, the Rector was requested to meet with the Board of Directors and take up certain of the conditions which it is felt shoould be changed before any final action is taken by the Board.

The following resolution was adopted with reference to the new heating plant:

WHEREAS the Committee on Heating, consisting of John Stewart Bryan, Fred W. Scott, W. R. Duke, has carefully considered on May 27th, 1921 the various reports and p;ans for heating the University submitted by Wiley and Wilson, Whitehurst, Professor Hancock, and E. J. Willis, chairman of the Governor's Board of Mechanical Survey, and

WHEREAS the Committee is of the opinion that the site for future development should be located at the present new site and that supervision of the plant and choice of the system should be put under the Department of Engineering subject to the ratification of the Rector and Board of Visitors, now therefore be it

RESOLVED, That the Rector and Board of Visitors approve the choice of the new site for the development of a Central Heating Plant, and further that the Engineering Department, to-wit: Messrs. Thornton, Newcomb, Rodman, Miller and Hancock, be appointed as the committee in charge of such development, subject to the approval of the Board, and further in the specific case before the Rector and Board of Visitors be it resolved that the committee above designated be authorized to expend the sum of $60,000 in the development of the new site as a Central Heating Plant subject to the approval of the details of such extension by the Committed on Heating, with further authority to said committee to retain such expert assistance as to such committee may seem desirable.

The following resolution offered by Mr. Robertson was adopted:

WHEREAS, By Act of March 26, 1918, the General Assembly of Virginia authorized the presentation to the Government of Great Britain by the Commonwealth of Virginia of a replica, or copy in bronze, of the Houdon statue of George Washington, to be made from moulds owned by the State, under the direction of and to be presented by a commission composed of the Governor, Lieutenant-Governor, and Speaker of the House of Delegates, or such person or persons as they might designate to represent them, and the Clerk of the House of Delegates, who should act as Secretary of said commission, and made an appropriation for that purpose; and

WHEREAS the Governor of Virginia appointed as Chairman of said commission, in his room and stead, Dr. Edwin A. Alderman, the President of the University of Virginia; and

WHEREAS, at the time contemplated for the presentation of the statue, by reason of circumstances which in his opinion required that he should give his whole strength and time to the services of the University of Virginia in connection with the raising of the Centennial Endowment Fund, and to the duties demanded of him by the celebration of the One Hundredth anniversary of the foundation of the University, President Alderman unselfishly and patriotically has declined the distinguished and honorable office thus conferred on him, and has surrendered the opportunity of making the voyage to Great Britain and of presenting this gift of the Old Dominion to the Mother country:

RESOLVED, by the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, that they make record on their minutes of the deep regret which they feel of the deprivation on the part of the Commonwealth of the services of President Alderman in the performance of this notable function, and their profound appreciation of his selfsacrifice in declining through a sense of unselfish devotion and patriotic loylaty to the interests of this University an office which he would have conspicuously adorned.

RESOLVED, That this resolution be spread on the minutes of the Board, and that a copy signed by the Rector and attested by the Secretary be presented to Dr. Alderman with the assurance of the admiration and affectionate regard of the Rector and Visitors.
