At a called meeting of the Rector and Visitors held on this date at 8 o'clock there were present the Rector, R. Tate Irvine, and Visitors John Stewart Bryan, H. D. Dillard, Harris Hart, Goodrich Hatton, G. R. B. Michie, and Alexander F. Robertson.

The minutes of the meeting of March 4th, copies of which had been mailed to the several Visitors, were approved.

The President announced the following gifts:

From Paul G. McIntire the sum of $155,000 to establish a School of Fine Arts.

Following is the correspondence between Mr. McIntire and President Alderman:

I am sending you be registered mail (fully insured, for $102,000), a United States Certificate of Indebtedness No. 647 for $100,000. dated January 2, and due June 3, 1919, the interest of which amounts to $1,873.97 and my cheque for $48,126.03 and including the cheque for $5,000. that I handed you in Charlottesville makes a total of $155,000.

The purpose of this gift is to establish in the University of Virginia a School of Fine Arts to comprise first, a School of Art and Architecture, second, a School of Music, and the income from these funds is tobe used in perpetuity for the use and development of these schools.

The sum of $75,000. of this amount I desire to be allotted to the School of Art, consisting of Art and Architecture, and the sum of $80,000. to the School of Music.

I sincerely hope that the University will see its way clear to give many lectures and concerts on the above subjects so that the people will appreciate more than ever before that the University belongs to them and that it exists for them.

I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of March 14th. I have also received, by registered mail, the United States Certificate of Indebtedness No. 647 for $100,000. dated January 2, and due June 3, 1919, the interest of which amounts to $1,873.97. I have also received your check for $48,126.03. I have previously received from your hands a check for $5,000. The total of all these receipts, as you state in your letter, is $155,000.

I note that the purpose of this splendid gift is designated by you to found at the University of Virginia a School of Fine Arts, comprising, first, a School of Art and Architecture; secondly, a School of Music.

I further note that you desire the income from these funds to be used in perpetuity for the use and development of these schools and for no other purpose.

I beg to renew my expression of profound gratitude, on behalf of the University for this wise and far-seeing gift, and to assure you that its purposes will be carried out by the Rector and Visitors with strict adherence to the wishes of the donor.

I shall bring the whole matter, for formal consideration, to the Rector and Visitors at their next meeting, and will than communicate to you what I am sure they will command me to do, the expression of their gratitude for the immense new strength that your foresight has given to the University of Virginia in increasing its ability to serve and strengthen the people of the commonwealth and of the nation.

In connection with the foregoing gift, the following resolution was adopted:

RESOLVED, That the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia acknowledge, with gratitude and appreciation, the great gift of $155,000, made by Mr. Paul Goodloe McIntire, '79, of New York City and Charlottesville, for the purpose of establishing and endowing in the University, a School of Fine Arts, embracing Art, Architecture, and Music. It will be the duty of the Rector and Visitors to see that this great gift is applied exclusively to the purposes indicated in the letter of gift. The Rector and Visitors will take immediate action in the matter of the inauguration of this new school.

A resolution establishing a School of Fine Arts was adopted as follows:

RESOLVED, by the Rector and Visitors of the University, That, in accordance with the terms of a gift of $155,000, made by Mr. Paul Goodloe McIntire, of New York City, a School of Fine Arts, embracing Art, Architecture, and Music, is hereby established in the University of Virginia, to be known as the McIntire School of Fine Arts.

From Mr. and Mrs. F. D. Minor, of Beaumont, Texas, a gift of $10,000 as an endowment for the Law Library.

Following is the correspondence between Mr. Minor and President Alderman:

As the parents of the late Farrell Dabney Minor, Jr., who graduated from the Law School of the University of Virginia in June, 1911, and who died in France on August 29, 1918 from wounds received in battle, it is our desire to erect some usefull and enduring memorial which will permanently associate his name with the University of Virginia, - his, as well as his father's, Alma Mater. This motive springs not alone from the promptings of parental affection for the memory of an only son, - and an only child, - but from the wish to give some outward expression to the love and loyalty that he cherished for the University.

We are, therefore, transmitting to the Bursar of the University, through the hands of our kinsman, Professor Raleigh C. Minor, Ten Thousand Dollars, par value, of United States Liberty Bonds, of the following description:

Eleven Bonds (being nine of the denomination of $1,000.00 each and two of the denomination of $500.00 each) with the proper transfers duly authenticated endorsed on each bond, and more particularly described as follows:

(a) Five Bonds, each of the par value of $1,000.00, numbered 35473 to 35477, both inclusive, Second Liberty Loan, converted, interest payable semi-annually on May 15th and November 15th, each bond registered in the name of Farrell D. Minor.

(b) Four Bonds, each of the par value of $1,000.00, numbered, respectively, 91548 to 91551, both inclusive, Third Liberty Loan, converted, interest payable semiannually on March 15th and September 15th, Bonds numbered 91548 and 91549 registered in the name of Mrs. Eleanor S. Minor, and Bonds numbered 91550 and 91551 registered in the name of Farrell D. Minor.

(c) Two Bonds, each of the par value of $500.00, numbered, respectively, 112516 and 112517, Third Liberty Loan, converted, interest payable semi-annually on March 15th and September 15th, each Bond registered in the name of Mrs. Eleanor S. Minor.

We desire that these Bonds, or the securities into which they may hereafter be converted, be held in perpetual trust by the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, for the uses and purposes following:

1\. This donation is to be entitled and known as the "Farrell Dabney Minor, Jr., Donation".

2\. The principal of this fund (including additions thereto, hereinafter provided for) is to be preserved intact in securities approved by the financial authorities of the University.

Of the net income in each year, corresponding with the fiscal year of the University, seventy-five per cent (subject to the provisions of the paragraph next succeeding) is to be devoted to the upkeep and the promotion of the general usefulness of the University Law School Library, chiefly in the purchase of books, other library conveniences and accessories, but exclusive of salaries to employes or permanent housing or preservation. The object of the donation is rather the enlargement of the facilities and resources of the Law Library, that as a relief to the general financial budget of the Law School. In expressing these purposes, however, it is not the desire of the donors to limit the reasonable discretion of the Rector and Visitors in arranging their annual appropriations.

The remaining twenty-five per cent of the net income in each fiscal year we desire to be turned back into the principal account and deposited promptly in a Savings Bank, at interest, until a sufficient amount is collected to be conveniently invested in other securities, to be added to the principal securities held to the credit of the donation. The entire interest accruing upon the funds thus deposited in the Savings Bank while they are deposited there, is to be considered as part of the twenty-five per cent of income and with it is to be turned back into the principal fund. But after it has been invested in other securities, as in the case of other interest, seventy-five per cent of the interest thereon shall be for the use of the Law Library, as above indicated, and only twenty-five per cent thereof is to be turned back into the principal account, in the manner before described.

3\. The Rectorand Visitors are empowered to convert the securities mentioned, from time to time, into such other securities or forms of investment, as they may deem wise, such substituted securities or investments to be held on similar trusts.

4\. The donors should desire that there be placed on the front inside cover of volumes purchased under this trust, a simple book-plate, making reference to the donation. The donors ask the privilege of providing, at their own expense, an engraved plate for this purpose.

5\. The donors request that this letter of donation, along with the accompanying brief sketch of Lieutenant Minor's life, be entered in the permanent records of the University, and that a certified copy of this letter be delivered to the Dean of the Law School.

In the hope that the acceptance of this trust may be agreeable to the Rector and Visitors, and with the expression of high regard for yourself and of deep affection for the University, we are, dear Sir,

I have this day received your letter of the 28th inst., with the enclosure, giving so moving and interesting an account of the life and service of your son, Farrell Dabney Minor, Jr. I have read with the greatest interest and approval the communication in which you give to the University of Virginia the sum of $10,000 to be known as the Farrell Dabney Minor, Jr., donation, and to be used for the general purpose of the enrichment of the Law Library through the purchase of books and other accessories. I note, of course, the conditions of the use of the fund set forth so clearly by you, the wisdom of which I sincerely subscribe to. I can, in advance, accept for the Rector and Visitors this noble gift, and can, in advance, assure you of their profound gratification and appreciation of the great service you have done to the University and of their pride that so brave and noble a youth shall be here commemorated.

I shall bring your communication before the Board at their first meeting in the latter part of April, and shall take care that every detail of the bequest be understood, the sketch of Lieutenant Minor's life entered upon the permanent records of the University and your whole communication made a part of our records. I hope we shall have the liberty to print in our publications as well the brief sketch of Lieutenant Minor. I shall want to make public announcement of this gift at our Founder's Day ceremony, April 12, prior to the actual meeting of the Board.

Assuring you of my own deep appreciation of this splendid act and of my desire to see that the purposes herein indicated be carried out, I am,

My wife and I appreciate your kind letter of the 31st ult. I have written my kinsman, Prof. R. C. Minor, consenting to the publication of the sketch.

In connection with the foregoing gift the following resolution was adopted:

RESOLVED, That the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia acknowledge with deep gratitude and appreciation a gift of $10,000, from Mr. and Mrs. Farrell Dabney Minor, of Beaumont, Texas, for the purpose of endowing the Law Library of the University, in memory of their son, Farrell Dabney minor, Jr., who illustrated in his character the best traditions of the University. The Rector and Visitors will take care that this noble gift is applied exclusively to the uses named in the letter of gift. It is a matter of great happiness and pride to them that a noble and gallant young soldier is thus commemorated here.

From the Seven Society a gift of $777.77 for the erection of a memorial tablet to the memory of all the sons of the University who have lost their lives in the service of the allied cause.

In connection with the foregoing gift the following resolution was adopted:

RESOLVED, That the Rector and Visitors appreciate the generosity and wisdom of the Seven Society, as expressed in their handsome gift of $777.77, and authorize the President of the University to extend to the Society their cordial thanks.

Through Col. W. H. Goodwin a check for $123 from members of the Seven Society in France, to be devoted to the above named purpose.

In connection with the Oliver H. Payne bequest, which had been under consideration for sometime, President Alderman stated that, in compliance with the direction of the board, he had procured from Dean Lile an opinion in writing concerning the University's rights with said bequest, in view of certain facts in connection with his will which came to light after his death, and that copies of this opinion had been mailed to each member of the Board. After some discussion of the matter, it was disposed of in the following resolution offered by Mr. Hatton, and adopted.

The written opinion of Dean Lile under date of March 20, 1919, in relation to the bequest of the late Col. Oliver H. Payne, was submitted to the Board and on motion was ordered spread on the minutes of this meeting.

The following resolution was offered and adopted:

WHEREAS, The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia being of the opinion that the gift of $250,000 made by the late Col. Oliver H. Payne to this University through its President, Dr. E. A. Alderman, according to the statements made by the donor to Dr. Alderman at the time of the gift and according to the memoranda in the handwriting of the donor and found among his papers at his death, was intended by the donor to be in satisfaction of a legacy of $200,000 to this University in the last will and testament of Col. Payne, therefore be it

RESOLVED, That the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia make no claim to said bequest and acknowledge full satisfaction thereof by the gift aforesaid. Further RESOLVED, That the Rector be and is authorized to execute and deliver in the name and on behalf of this corporation under its seal duly attested such legal documents as may be necessary under the law of New York to carry into effect this resolution, filing copies of such documents with the records of this board.

Following is Dean Lile's opinion concerning the bequest:

Responding to your request for the expression of a further opinion in connection with the matter of the Oliver H. Payne bequest to the University, in view of supposed new evidence, I beg to submit as follows:

As gathered from your oral statement to me of the additional facts developed since the preparation of my former opinion, they are these:

After the death of the testator there was found, among his private papers, a typewritten list of the legatees mentioned in the will, with the amounts of their respective bequests set opposite their names; the name of the University of Virginia, in this list showing a legacy of $200,000.00 appears to have a pencil line drawn through it, extended also through the figures $200,000.00, and in the margin opposite the erasure appears the entry, in pencil, "Paid $250,000.00;" and this entry is conceded to be in the handwriting of the testator.

The question upon which I am asked to submit an opinion is: Do these additional facts, assuming them conclusively extablished, so alter the legal situation as to require a modicication of the opinion already submitted in this connection?

It does not appear when this alteration in the list was made, as it is without date, and I presume that the date cannot be established. It may have been made before, or subsequently to the gift inter vivos. The strong probabilities are, however, that it was done subsequently, as it is scarcely conceivable that the testator should have ear marked the legacy as paid before the actual consummation of the gift.

Anterior to these recently discovered facts, the situation was this:

The testator, in his will, made a bequest of $200,000.00 to the University; subsequently he handed to Dr. Alderman, President of the University; a sealed envelope, in which was enclosed a check for $250,000 ($50,000. more than the amount of the legacy), accompanied by a letter of gift, in which the purposes of the gift were named, but with no reference therein to the legacy, and no indication that the gift was intended as a satisfaction of the legacy. Such intention, however, was plainly expressed in an oral statement to President Alderman, made contemporaneously with the act of handing over the letter and check.

On this state of facts, I have heretofore expressed the opinion that the question whether or not this gift was meant in satisfaction of the legacy rests solely on the testator's intention; that, unexplained, there is no legal presumption of such an intention; that where the gift is made by written documents, as in this case, the intention of the testator to make the gift substitutional must likewise be expressed in writing—or, otherwise stated, that parol declarations, though made contemporaneously, are inadmissible to import into the written documents an intention not properly appearing therein. And that, therefore, the University is legally entitled to the legacy in addition to the gift already received.

Is this result alteres by the circumstance that, after the gift was thus complete and in the donee's possession— and after donor and donee have separated (we are without information as to the interval of time) the testator made an unsigned pencil entry in his private papers, indicating an intention not found in the written documents of gift delivered to the donee?

The question is not without difficulty. It is perfectly clear that after the gift was complete by delivery to the donee, and the separation of the parties, it was not competent for the donor, by his sole act, to alter the legal effect of the gift purely as such—that is, as vesting complete and unconditional ownership in the donee. The gift itself was complete from the moment of delivery, and no question is now made, or can be made, as to the donee's absolute right to it. What is in question is, the legacy. That remained under the sole control of the testator until his death. So that the real question here is not what was the testator's intention as to the gift, but his intention as to the effect of the gift in satisfying, or not satisfying, the legacy.

As already shown, where the gift is made by a written document, as here, the intention that it shall operate in satisfaction of the previous legacy cannot be established by parol testimony—since this would violate the rule that written instruments may not be contradicted or altered by parol evidence. Hence there must be written evidence of testator's intention to overcome the effect of the written documents of gift. Written evidence of what character? Obviously declarations written by the testator himself. But written when? Must these written declarations be contemporaneous with the gift, or would declarations written subsequently temporaneous with the gift, or would subsequently suffice? Undoubtedly to effect the gift itself, these declarations must be not only written, but contemporaneous, and communicated to and accepted by the donee. But our question is not one of a bilateral transaction—in which the written documents are to be interpreted according to what Mr. Wigmore terms the "integrated" intention of both parties— but ours is a purely unilateral transaction, and its effect dependent solely on the intention of one actor with respect to a res (i.e. the legacy) in his sole control and ownership. It is his intention solely that is the object of our search; and that intention must be expressed in writing. The intention or willingness of the donee to receive the gift in satisfaction is immaterial, and not in question.

The pencil entry made by Col. Payne undoubtedly and clearly expressed an intention existing in his mind at the time the entry was made (whenever that was) that the gift should go, or had gone, in payment or satisfaction of the legacy. But assuming that the entry was made at a time subsequent to the gift, is this competent written evidence to establish the required intention? The time at which the required intention must have existed is, of course, the moment of making the gift. If the intention that the gift should satisfy the legacy did not exist at that moment, clearly no intention formed subsequently could affect the past completed transaction. If, therefore, the pencil entry indicated the existence of an intention of satisfaction, existing only at the time of the entry, the entry would be incompetent evidence. The intention cannot operate ex post facto. But this pencil entry may very reasonably be interpreted as a record and a written confirmation of the existing intention, orally expressed at the time of the gift —or, excluding the oral testimony, of an intention existing, but unexpressed (I know of no rule requiring intention to satisy a legacy by a gift to be communicated to the donee) at the time of the gift made. Suppose Col. Payne had made, in his own handwriting, the day after the gift made—or at any later date—an entry in hid diary to the effect that he had satisfied the legacy in his will to the University by a gift of a larger amount, would such an entry be admissible to establish the necessary intention to satisfy the legacy: I was at first disposed to regard the absence of Col. Payne's signature to this pencil entry as relegating the writing to the level of a mere parol declaration; but on subsequent reflection and conference with Prof. Graves, I have reached the conclusion that it is a written and not a parol declaration.

We have then reached this situation: An act done, the effect of which on an existing will of the actor, depends on the intention with which the first act was done— and this intention, under the rule of law applicable to the circumstances here, must be established by written declarations of the actor. Written but unsigned declarations of the actor, made subsequent to the act in question, are offered in evidence. I see no escape from the admission of this evidence, unless the rule involved requires that such written declarations must have been contemporaneous with the act. In my opinion this rule does not require that such declarations shall be contemporaneous. The intention must have been contemporaneous with the act, buth the declarations may have been subsequent, provided they establish the intention previously existing.

Certainly in those cases where parol declarations of a testator are properly admitted to prove the intention with which an act was done, as affecting legacies in a previous will, such declarations are not confined to those made contemporaneously. The pencil entry here is expressed in the past tense "Paid $250,000." Written at large, the entry would read "I have already paid this legacy by a gift of $250,000." "Paid" here can mean nothing else but "satisfied"— and this conclusion is reinforced, if it needs reinforcement, by the erasure of the name of the legatee and the amount of the legacy, in the typewritten list. Hence, the entrymay be read thus: "Having paid the University of Virginia $250,000. in my life time, I declare that my intention in making the gift was to satisfy the legacy, an intention of which I have not repented at the date of this entry."

If these premises are sound, I see no escape from the conclusion that this pencil memorandum is admissible in evidence to establish the testator's intention to satisfy the legacy by the gift—and, if admitted, that it is sufficient evidence to establish that intention. If so, the conclusion is inevitable that the University is not legally entitled to the legacy.

The only hope of avoiding this conclusion is to assail the legal premises on which it is based. They seem sound to me.

Under recommendation of the President, the application of Prof. F. P. Dunnington for retirement upon the Carnegie Foundation was granted in the following resolution:

RESOLVED, That the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia accept the resignation of Professor Francis P. Dunnington with very sincere acknowledgment of his long, capable and faithful service to the University.

The following preamble and resolutions, which had been prepared by Mr. Ledyard at the request of the Rector, were offered as an amendment to the resolution prepared by Mr. Hatton, as shown on page 135, \[page 283\] and adopted as part thereof:

Whereas Oliver H. Payne, late of the City of New York, died on the 27th day of June, 1917, leaving a Last Will and Testament dated the 7th day of September, 1915, and the same was thereafter duly admitted to probate by the Surrogate's Court of the County of New York, and letters testamentary thereon were issued out of said court to the Executors named in said Will; and

Whereas the said will contained a legacy of two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000.) to the University of Virginia; and

Whereas on or about the 10th day of July, 1916, said Oliver H. Payne gave to Dr. Edwin A. Alderman, President of the University of Virginia, the sum of Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars ($250,000.) to be held by him for account of the University, and stated, in substance, that he had made in his then existing will a legacy to the University of Virginia but that he did not wish the University to wait until his death to receive said legacy and therefore proposed to make a present gift thereof; and

Whereas the question arose after the death of the said Oliver H. Payne as to whether said gift of Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars ($250,000.) did not operate as an ademption or satisfaction of said legacy of Two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000.), and the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, having examined into the facts and being advised upon said facts as they then appeared that they were legally entitled to the legacy, passed a resolution at a meeting of the Board held November 27th, 1917, to the effect that they would not be justified in renouncing said legacy; and

Whereas further investigation of said facts and the presentation of additional evidence, including among other things a notation found in the papers of the said Oliver H. Payne and in his handwriting, to the effect that said legacy to the University of Virginia had been "paid", have satisfied the Board that the said Oliver H. Payne intended that said gift of Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars ($250,000.) to the University of Virginia should be in lieu of and in satisfaction of his said legacy of Two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000) to said University, and the Board is now satisfied that the said gift did operate as an ademption or satisfaction of said legacy and that the University is not legally entitled to said legacy, and that it is its duty to renounce the same;

NOW, THEREFORE, be it

RESOLVED, That the University of Virginia, acting through the Rector and Visitors of the University, does hereby renounce and disclaim the said legacy of Two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000.) bequeathed to it in and by the said Last Will and Testament of the said Oliver H. Payne, and all right, title and interest therein, and that the officers of the University be and they are hereby authorized to execute a formal renunciation of said legacy under the seal of the University and to deliver the same to the Executors of said will.

And RESOLVED FURTHER that the officers of the University be and they hereby are authorized to execute in the name and under the seal of the University, a waiver of the issue and service of a citation in any proceeding which may hereafter be instituted by the Executors of the Last Will and Testament of said Oliver H. Payne for the judicial settlement of their accounts, and to deliver the same to said Executors.

Upon motion the meeting adjourned,

Addendum:

In connection with the letter of gift from Paul G. McIntire, spread on pages 130 and 131 \[275 and 276\] of these minutes, the following letter is entered:

It was my intention and understanding in making the gift of $155,000. for the establishment of a School of Fine Arts, that $5,000. or as much thereof as might be necessary, should be used outright for the purchase of equipping the School of Art and Architecture.

I am sending you be registered mail (fully insured, for $102,000), a United States Certificate of Indebtedness No. 647 for $100,000. dated January 2, and due June 3, 1919, the interest of which amounts to $1,873.97 and my cheque for $48,126.03 and including the cheque for $5,000. that I handed you in Charlottesville makes a total of $155,000.

The purpose of this gift is to establish in the University of Virginia a School of Fine Arts to comprise first, a School of Art and Architecture, second, a School of Music, and the income from these funds is tobe used in perpetuity for the use and development of these schools.

The sum of $75,000. of this amount I desire to be allotted to the School of Art, consisting of Art and Architecture, and the sum of $80,000. to the School of Music.

I sincerely hope that the University will see its way clear to give many lectures and concerts on the above subjects so that the people will appreciate more than ever before that the University belongs to them and that it exists for them.

I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of March 14th. I have also received, by registered mail, the United States Certificate of Indebtedness No. 647 for $100,000. dated January 2, and due June 3, 1919, the interest of which amounts to $1,873.97. I have also received your check for $48,126.03. I have previously received from your hands a check for $5,000. The total of all these receipts, as you state in your letter, is $155,000.

I note that the purpose of this splendid gift is designated by you to found at the University of Virginia a School of Fine Arts, comprising, first, a School of Art and Architecture; secondly, a School of Music.

I further note that you desire the income from these funds to be used in perpetuity for the use and development of these schools and for no other purpose.

I beg to renew my expression of profound gratitude, on behalf of the University for this wise and far-seeing gift, and to assure you that its purposes will be carried out by the Rector and Visitors with strict adherence to the wishes of the donor.

I shall bring the whole matter, for formal consideration, to the Rector and Visitors at their next meeting, and will than communicate to you what I am sure they will command me to do, the expression of their gratitude for the immense new strength that your foresight has given to the University of Virginia in increasing its ability to serve and strengthen the people of the commonwealth and of the nation.

As the parents of the late Farrell Dabney Minor, Jr., who graduated from the Law School of the University of Virginia in June, 1911, and who died in France on August 29, 1918 from wounds received in battle, it is our desire to erect some usefull and enduring memorial which will permanently associate his name with the University of Virginia, - his, as well as his father's, Alma Mater. This motive springs not alone from the promptings of parental affection for the memory of an only son, - and an only child, - but from the wish to give some outward expression to the love and loyalty that he cherished for the University.

We are, therefore, transmitting to the Bursar of the University, through the hands of our kinsman, Professor Raleigh C. Minor, Ten Thousand Dollars, par value, of United States Liberty Bonds, of the following description:

Eleven Bonds (being nine of the denomination of $1,000.00 each and two of the denomination of $500.00 each) with the proper transfers duly authenticated endorsed on each bond, and more particularly described as follows:

(a) Five Bonds, each of the par value of $1,000.00, numbered 35473 to 35477, both inclusive, Second Liberty Loan, converted, interest payable semi-annually on May 15th and November 15th, each bond registered in the name of Farrell D. Minor.

(b) Four Bonds, each of the par value of $1,000.00, numbered, respectively, 91548 to 91551, both inclusive, Third Liberty Loan, converted, interest payable semiannually on March 15th and September 15th, Bonds numbered 91548 and 91549 registered in the name of Mrs. Eleanor S. Minor, and Bonds numbered 91550 and 91551 registered in the name of Farrell D. Minor.

(c) Two Bonds, each of the par value of $500.00, numbered, respectively, 112516 and 112517, Third Liberty Loan, converted, interest payable semi-annually on March 15th and September 15th, each Bond registered in the name of Mrs. Eleanor S. Minor.

We desire that these Bonds, or the securities into which they may hereafter be converted, be held in perpetual trust by the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, for the uses and purposes following:

1\. This donation is to be entitled and known as the "Farrell Dabney Minor, Jr., Donation".

2\. The principal of this fund (including additions thereto, hereinafter provided for) is to be preserved intact in securities approved by the financial authorities of the University.

Of the net income in each year, corresponding with the fiscal year of the University, seventy-five per cent (subject to the provisions of the paragraph next succeeding) is to be devoted to the upkeep and the promotion of the general usefulness of the University Law School Library, chiefly in the purchase of books, other library conveniences and accessories, but exclusive of salaries to employes or permanent housing or preservation. The object of the donation is rather the enlargement of the facilities and resources of the Law Library, that as a relief to the general financial budget of the Law School. In expressing these purposes, however, it is not the desire of the donors to limit the reasonable discretion of the Rector and Visitors in arranging their annual appropriations.

The remaining twenty-five per cent of the net income in each fiscal year we desire to be turned back into the principal account and deposited promptly in a Savings Bank, at interest, until a sufficient amount is collected to be conveniently invested in other securities, to be added to the principal securities held to the credit of the donation. The entire interest accruing upon the funds thus deposited in the Savings Bank while they are deposited there, is to be considered as part of the twenty-five per cent of income and with it is to be turned back into the principal fund. But after it has been invested in other securities, as in the case of other interest, seventy-five per cent of the interest thereon shall be for the use of the Law Library, as above indicated, and only twenty-five per cent thereof is to be turned back into the principal account, in the manner before described.

3\. The Rectorand Visitors are empowered to convert the securities mentioned, from time to time, into such other securities or forms of investment, as they may deem wise, such substituted securities or investments to be held on similar trusts.

4\. The donors should desire that there be placed on the front inside cover of volumes purchased under this trust, a simple book-plate, making reference to the donation. The donors ask the privilege of providing, at their own expense, an engraved plate for this purpose.

5\. The donors request that this letter of donation, along with the accompanying brief sketch of Lieutenant Minor's life, be entered in the permanent records of the University, and that a certified copy of this letter be delivered to the Dean of the Law School.

In the hope that the acceptance of this trust may be agreeable to the Rector and Visitors, and with the expression of high regard for yourself and of deep affection for the University, we are, dear Sir,

I have this day received your letter of the 28th inst., with the enclosure, giving so moving and interesting an account of the life and service of your son, Farrell Dabney Minor, Jr. I have read with the greatest interest and approval the communication in which you give to the University of Virginia the sum of $10,000 to be known as the Farrell Dabney Minor, Jr., donation, and to be used for the general purpose of the enrichment of the Law Library through the purchase of books and other accessories. I note, of course, the conditions of the use of the fund set forth so clearly by you, the wisdom of which I sincerely subscribe to. I can, in advance, accept for the Rector and Visitors this noble gift, and can, in advance, assure you of their profound gratification and appreciation of the great service you have done to the University and of their pride that so brave and noble a youth shall be here commemorated.

I shall bring your communication before the Board at their first meeting in the latter part of April, and shall take care that every detail of the bequest be understood, the sketch of Lieutenant Minor's life entered upon the permanent records of the University and your whole communication made a part of our records. I hope we shall have the liberty to print in our publications as well the brief sketch of Lieutenant Minor. I shall want to make public announcement of this gift at our Founder's Day ceremony, April 12, prior to the actual meeting of the Board.

Assuring you of my own deep appreciation of this splendid act and of my desire to see that the purposes herein indicated be carried out, I am,

My wife and I appreciate your kind letter of the 31st ult. I have written my kinsman, Prof. R. C. Minor, consenting to the publication of the sketch.

Responding to your request for the expression of a further opinion in connection with the matter of the Oliver H. Payne bequest to the University, in view of supposed new evidence, I beg to submit as follows:

As gathered from your oral statement to me of the additional facts developed since the preparation of my former opinion, they are these:

After the death of the testator there was found, among his private papers, a typewritten list of the legatees mentioned in the will, with the amounts of their respective bequests set opposite their names; the name of the University of Virginia, in this list showing a legacy of $200,000.00 appears to have a pencil line drawn through it, extended also through the figures $200,000.00, and in the margin opposite the erasure appears the entry, in pencil, "Paid $250,000.00;" and this entry is conceded to be in the handwriting of the testator.

The question upon which I am asked to submit an opinion is: Do these additional facts, assuming them conclusively extablished, so alter the legal situation as to require a modicication of the opinion already submitted in this connection?

It does not appear when this alteration in the list was made, as it is without date, and I presume that the date cannot be established. It may have been made before, or subsequently to the gift inter vivos. The strong probabilities are, however, that it was done subsequently, as it is scarcely conceivable that the testator should have ear marked the legacy as paid before the actual consummation of the gift.

Anterior to these recently discovered facts, the situation was this:

The testator, in his will, made a bequest of $200,000.00 to the University; subsequently he handed to Dr. Alderman, President of the University; a sealed envelope, in which was enclosed a check for $250,000 ($50,000. more than the amount of the legacy), accompanied by a letter of gift, in which the purposes of the gift were named, but with no reference therein to the legacy, and no indication that the gift was intended as a satisfaction of the legacy. Such intention, however, was plainly expressed in an oral statement to President Alderman, made contemporaneously with the act of handing over the letter and check.

On this state of facts, I have heretofore expressed the opinion that the question whether or not this gift was meant in satisfaction of the legacy rests solely on the testator's intention; that, unexplained, there is no legal presumption of such an intention; that where the gift is made by written documents, as in this case, the intention of the testator to make the gift substitutional must likewise be expressed in writing—or, otherwise stated, that parol declarations, though made contemporaneously, are inadmissible to import into the written documents an intention not properly appearing therein. And that, therefore, the University is legally entitled to the legacy in addition to the gift already received.

Is this result alteres by the circumstance that, after the gift was thus complete and in the donee's possession— and after donor and donee have separated (we are without information as to the interval of time) the testator made an unsigned pencil entry in his private papers, indicating an intention not found in the written documents of gift delivered to the donee?

The question is not without difficulty. It is perfectly clear that after the gift was complete by delivery to the donee, and the separation of the parties, it was not competent for the donor, by his sole act, to alter the legal effect of the gift purely as such—that is, as vesting complete and unconditional ownership in the donee. The gift itself was complete from the moment of delivery, and no question is now made, or can be made, as to the donee's absolute right to it. What is in question is, the legacy. That remained under the sole control of the testator until his death. So that the real question here is not what was the testator's intention as to the gift, but his intention as to the effect of the gift in satisfying, or not satisfying, the legacy.

As already shown, where the gift is made by a written document, as here, the intention that it shall operate in satisfaction of the previous legacy cannot be established by parol testimony—since this would violate the rule that written instruments may not be contradicted or altered by parol evidence. Hence there must be written evidence of testator's intention to overcome the effect of the written documents of gift. Written evidence of what character? Obviously declarations written by the testator himself. But written when? Must these written declarations be contemporaneous with the gift, or would declarations written subsequently temporaneous with the gift, or would subsequently suffice? Undoubtedly to effect the gift itself, these declarations must be not only written, but contemporaneous, and communicated to and accepted by the donee. But our question is not one of a bilateral transaction—in which the written documents are to be interpreted according to what Mr. Wigmore terms the "integrated" intention of both parties— but ours is a purely unilateral transaction, and its effect dependent solely on the intention of one actor with respect to a res (i.e. the legacy) in his sole control and ownership. It is his intention solely that is the object of our search; and that intention must be expressed in writing. The intention or willingness of the donee to receive the gift in satisfaction is immaterial, and not in question.

The pencil entry made by Col. Payne undoubtedly and clearly expressed an intention existing in his mind at the time the entry was made (whenever that was) that the gift should go, or had gone, in payment or satisfaction of the legacy. But assuming that the entry was made at a time subsequent to the gift, is this competent written evidence to establish the required intention? The time at which the required intention must have existed is, of course, the moment of making the gift. If the intention that the gift should satisfy the legacy did not exist at that moment, clearly no intention formed subsequently could affect the past completed transaction. If, therefore, the pencil entry indicated the existence of an intention of satisfaction, existing only at the time of the entry, the entry would be incompetent evidence. The intention cannot operate ex post facto. But this pencil entry may very reasonably be interpreted as a record and a written confirmation of the existing intention, orally expressed at the time of the gift —or, excluding the oral testimony, of an intention existing, but unexpressed (I know of no rule requiring intention to satisy a legacy by a gift to be communicated to the donee) at the time of the gift made. Suppose Col. Payne had made, in his own handwriting, the day after the gift made—or at any later date—an entry in hid diary to the effect that he had satisfied the legacy in his will to the University by a gift of a larger amount, would such an entry be admissible to establish the necessary intention to satisfy the legacy: I was at first disposed to regard the absence of Col. Payne's signature to this pencil entry as relegating the writing to the level of a mere parol declaration; but on subsequent reflection and conference with Prof. Graves, I have reached the conclusion that it is a written and not a parol declaration.

We have then reached this situation: An act done, the effect of which on an existing will of the actor, depends on the intention with which the first act was done— and this intention, under the rule of law applicable to the circumstances here, must be established by written declarations of the actor. Written but unsigned declarations of the actor, made subsequent to the act in question, are offered in evidence. I see no escape from the admission of this evidence, unless the rule involved requires that such written declarations must have been contemporaneous with the act. In my opinion this rule does not require that such declarations shall be contemporaneous. The intention must have been contemporaneous with the act, buth the declarations may have been subsequent, provided they establish the intention previously existing.

Certainly in those cases where parol declarations of a testator are properly admitted to prove the intention with which an act was done, as affecting legacies in a previous will, such declarations are not confined to those made contemporaneously. The pencil entry here is expressed in the past tense "Paid $250,000." Written at large, the entry would read "I have already paid this legacy by a gift of $250,000." "Paid" here can mean nothing else but "satisfied"— and this conclusion is reinforced, if it needs reinforcement, by the erasure of the name of the legatee and the amount of the legacy, in the typewritten list. Hence, the entrymay be read thus: "Having paid the University of Virginia $250,000. in my life time, I declare that my intention in making the gift was to satisfy the legacy, an intention of which I have not repented at the date of this entry."

If these premises are sound, I see no escape from the conclusion that this pencil memorandum is admissible in evidence to establish the testator's intention to satisfy the legacy by the gift—and, if admitted, that it is sufficient evidence to establish that intention. If so, the conclusion is inevitable that the University is not legally entitled to the legacy.

The only hope of avoiding this conclusion is to assail the legal premises on which it is based. They seem sound to me.

Whereas Oliver H. Payne, late of the City of New York, died on the 27th day of June, 1917, leaving a Last Will and Testament dated the 7th day of September, 1915, and the same was thereafter duly admitted to probate by the Surrogate's Court of the County of New York, and letters testamentary thereon were issued out of said court to the Executors named in said Will; and

Whereas the said will contained a legacy of two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000.) to the University of Virginia; and

Whereas on or about the 10th day of July, 1916, said Oliver H. Payne gave to Dr. Edwin A. Alderman, President of the University of Virginia, the sum of Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars ($250,000.) to be held by him for account of the University, and stated, in substance, that he had made in his then existing will a legacy to the University of Virginia but that he did not wish the University to wait until his death to receive said legacy and therefore proposed to make a present gift thereof; and

Whereas the question arose after the death of the said Oliver H. Payne as to whether said gift of Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars ($250,000.) did not operate as an ademption or satisfaction of said legacy of Two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000.), and the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, having examined into the facts and being advised upon said facts as they then appeared that they were legally entitled to the legacy, passed a resolution at a meeting of the Board held November 27th, 1917, to the effect that they would not be justified in renouncing said legacy; and

Whereas further investigation of said facts and the presentation of additional evidence, including among other things a notation found in the papers of the said Oliver H. Payne and in his handwriting, to the effect that said legacy to the University of Virginia had been "paid", have satisfied the Board that the said Oliver H. Payne intended that said gift of Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars ($250,000.) to the University of Virginia should be in lieu of and in satisfaction of his said legacy of Two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000) to said University, and the Board is now satisfied that the said gift did operate as an ademption or satisfaction of said legacy and that the University is not legally entitled to said legacy, and that it is its duty to renounce the same;

NOW, THEREFORE, be it

RESOLVED, That the University of Virginia, acting through the Rector and Visitors of the University, does hereby renounce and disclaim the said legacy of Two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000.) bequeathed to it in and by the said Last Will and Testament of the said Oliver H. Payne, and all right, title and interest therein, and that the officers of the University be and they are hereby authorized to execute a formal renunciation of said legacy under the seal of the University and to deliver the same to the Executors of said will.

And RESOLVED FURTHER that the officers of the University be and they hereby are authorized to execute in the name and under the seal of the University, a waiver of the issue and service of a citation in any proceeding which may hereafter be instituted by the Executors of the Last Will and Testament of said Oliver H. Payne for the judicial settlement of their accounts, and to deliver the same to said Executors.

Upon motion the meeting adjourned,

It was my intention and understanding in making the gift of $155,000. for the establishment of a School of Fine Arts, that $5,000. or as much thereof as might be necessary, should be used outright for the purchase of equipping the School of Art and Architecture.

I am sending you be registered mail (fully insured, for $102,000), a United States Certificate of Indebtedness No. 647 for $100,000. dated January 2, and due June 3, 1919, the interest of which amounts to $1,873.97 and my cheque for $48,126.03 and including the cheque for $5,000. that I handed you in Charlottesville makes a total of $155,000.

The purpose of this gift is to establish in the University of Virginia a School of Fine Arts to comprise first, a School of Art and Architecture, second, a School of Music, and the income from these funds is tobe used in perpetuity for the use and development of these schools.

The sum of $75,000. of this amount I desire to be allotted to the School of Art, consisting of Art and Architecture, and the sum of $80,000. to the School of Music.

I sincerely hope that the University will see its way clear to give many lectures and concerts on the above subjects so that the people will appreciate more than ever before that the University belongs to them and that it exists for them.

I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of March 14th. I have also received, by registered mail, the United States Certificate of Indebtedness No. 647 for $100,000. dated January 2, and due June 3, 1919, the interest of which amounts to $1,873.97. I have also received your check for $48,126.03. I have previously received from your hands a check for $5,000. The total of all these receipts, as you state in your letter, is $155,000.

I note that the purpose of this splendid gift is designated by you to found at the University of Virginia a School of Fine Arts, comprising, first, a School of Art and Architecture; secondly, a School of Music.

I further note that you desire the income from these funds to be used in perpetuity for the use and development of these schools and for no other purpose.

I beg to renew my expression of profound gratitude, on behalf of the University for this wise and far-seeing gift, and to assure you that its purposes will be carried out by the Rector and Visitors with strict adherence to the wishes of the donor.

I shall bring the whole matter, for formal consideration, to the Rector and Visitors at their next meeting, and will than communicate to you what I am sure they will command me to do, the expression of their gratitude for the immense new strength that your foresight has given to the University of Virginia in increasing its ability to serve and strengthen the people of the commonwealth and of the nation.

As the parents of the late Farrell Dabney Minor, Jr., who graduated from the Law School of the University of Virginia in June, 1911, and who died in France on August 29, 1918 from wounds received in battle, it is our desire to erect some usefull and enduring memorial which will permanently associate his name with the University of Virginia, - his, as well as his father's, Alma Mater. This motive springs not alone from the promptings of parental affection for the memory of an only son, - and an only child, - but from the wish to give some outward expression to the love and loyalty that he cherished for the University.

We are, therefore, transmitting to the Bursar of the University, through the hands of our kinsman, Professor Raleigh C. Minor, Ten Thousand Dollars, par value, of United States Liberty Bonds, of the following description:

Eleven Bonds (being nine of the denomination of $1,000.00 each and two of the denomination of $500.00 each) with the proper transfers duly authenticated endorsed on each bond, and more particularly described as follows:

(a) Five Bonds, each of the par value of $1,000.00, numbered 35473 to 35477, both inclusive, Second Liberty Loan, converted, interest payable semi-annually on May 15th and November 15th, each bond registered in the name of Farrell D. Minor.

(b) Four Bonds, each of the par value of $1,000.00, numbered, respectively, 91548 to 91551, both inclusive, Third Liberty Loan, converted, interest payable semiannually on March 15th and September 15th, Bonds numbered 91548 and 91549 registered in the name of Mrs. Eleanor S. Minor, and Bonds numbered 91550 and 91551 registered in the name of Farrell D. Minor.

(c) Two Bonds, each of the par value of $500.00, numbered, respectively, 112516 and 112517, Third Liberty Loan, converted, interest payable semi-annually on March 15th and September 15th, each Bond registered in the name of Mrs. Eleanor S. Minor.

We desire that these Bonds, or the securities into which they may hereafter be converted, be held in perpetual trust by the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, for the uses and purposes following:

1\. This donation is to be entitled and known as the "Farrell Dabney Minor, Jr., Donation".

2\. The principal of this fund (including additions thereto, hereinafter provided for) is to be preserved intact in securities approved by the financial authorities of the University.

Of the net income in each year, corresponding with the fiscal year of the University, seventy-five per cent (subject to the provisions of the paragraph next succeeding) is to be devoted to the upkeep and the promotion of the general usefulness of the University Law School Library, chiefly in the purchase of books, other library conveniences and accessories, but exclusive of salaries to employes or permanent housing or preservation. The object of the donation is rather the enlargement of the facilities and resources of the Law Library, that as a relief to the general financial budget of the Law School. In expressing these purposes, however, it is not the desire of the donors to limit the reasonable discretion of the Rector and Visitors in arranging their annual appropriations.

The remaining twenty-five per cent of the net income in each fiscal year we desire to be turned back into the principal account and deposited promptly in a Savings Bank, at interest, until a sufficient amount is collected to be conveniently invested in other securities, to be added to the principal securities held to the credit of the donation. The entire interest accruing upon the funds thus deposited in the Savings Bank while they are deposited there, is to be considered as part of the twenty-five per cent of income and with it is to be turned back into the principal fund. But after it has been invested in other securities, as in the case of other interest, seventy-five per cent of the interest thereon shall be for the use of the Law Library, as above indicated, and only twenty-five per cent thereof is to be turned back into the principal account, in the manner before described.

3\. The Rectorand Visitors are empowered to convert the securities mentioned, from time to time, into such other securities or forms of investment, as they may deem wise, such substituted securities or investments to be held on similar trusts.

4\. The donors should desire that there be placed on the front inside cover of volumes purchased under this trust, a simple book-plate, making reference to the donation. The donors ask the privilege of providing, at their own expense, an engraved plate for this purpose.

5\. The donors request that this letter of donation, along with the accompanying brief sketch of Lieutenant Minor's life, be entered in the permanent records of the University, and that a certified copy of this letter be delivered to the Dean of the Law School.

In the hope that the acceptance of this trust may be agreeable to the Rector and Visitors, and with the expression of high regard for yourself and of deep affection for the University, we are, dear Sir,

I have this day received your letter of the 28th inst., with the enclosure, giving so moving and interesting an account of the life and service of your son, Farrell Dabney Minor, Jr. I have read with the greatest interest and approval the communication in which you give to the University of Virginia the sum of $10,000 to be known as the Farrell Dabney Minor, Jr., donation, and to be used for the general purpose of the enrichment of the Law Library through the purchase of books and other accessories. I note, of course, the conditions of the use of the fund set forth so clearly by you, the wisdom of which I sincerely subscribe to. I can, in advance, accept for the Rector and Visitors this noble gift, and can, in advance, assure you of their profound gratification and appreciation of the great service you have done to the University and of their pride that so brave and noble a youth shall be here commemorated.

I shall bring your communication before the Board at their first meeting in the latter part of April, and shall take care that every detail of the bequest be understood, the sketch of Lieutenant Minor's life entered upon the permanent records of the University and your whole communication made a part of our records. I hope we shall have the liberty to print in our publications as well the brief sketch of Lieutenant Minor. I shall want to make public announcement of this gift at our Founder's Day ceremony, April 12, prior to the actual meeting of the Board.

Assuring you of my own deep appreciation of this splendid act and of my desire to see that the purposes herein indicated be carried out, I am,

My wife and I appreciate your kind letter of the 31st ult. I have written my kinsman, Prof. R. C. Minor, consenting to the publication of the sketch.

Responding to your request for the expression of a further opinion in connection with the matter of the Oliver H. Payne bequest to the University, in view of supposed new evidence, I beg to submit as follows:

As gathered from your oral statement to me of the additional facts developed since the preparation of my former opinion, they are these:

After the death of the testator there was found, among his private papers, a typewritten list of the legatees mentioned in the will, with the amounts of their respective bequests set opposite their names; the name of the University of Virginia, in this list showing a legacy of $200,000.00 appears to have a pencil line drawn through it, extended also through the figures $200,000.00, and in the margin opposite the erasure appears the entry, in pencil, "Paid $250,000.00;" and this entry is conceded to be in the handwriting of the testator.

The question upon which I am asked to submit an opinion is: Do these additional facts, assuming them conclusively extablished, so alter the legal situation as to require a modicication of the opinion already submitted in this connection?

It does not appear when this alteration in the list was made, as it is without date, and I presume that the date cannot be established. It may have been made before, or subsequently to the gift inter vivos. The strong probabilities are, however, that it was done subsequently, as it is scarcely conceivable that the testator should have ear marked the legacy as paid before the actual consummation of the gift.

Anterior to these recently discovered facts, the situation was this:

The testator, in his will, made a bequest of $200,000.00 to the University; subsequently he handed to Dr. Alderman, President of the University; a sealed envelope, in which was enclosed a check for $250,000 ($50,000. more than the amount of the legacy), accompanied by a letter of gift, in which the purposes of the gift were named, but with no reference therein to the legacy, and no indication that the gift was intended as a satisfaction of the legacy. Such intention, however, was plainly expressed in an oral statement to President Alderman, made contemporaneously with the act of handing over the letter and check.

On this state of facts, I have heretofore expressed the opinion that the question whether or not this gift was meant in satisfaction of the legacy rests solely on the testator's intention; that, unexplained, there is no legal presumption of such an intention; that where the gift is made by written documents, as in this case, the intention of the testator to make the gift substitutional must likewise be expressed in writing—or, otherwise stated, that parol declarations, though made contemporaneously, are inadmissible to import into the written documents an intention not properly appearing therein. And that, therefore, the University is legally entitled to the legacy in addition to the gift already received.

Is this result alteres by the circumstance that, after the gift was thus complete and in the donee's possession— and after donor and donee have separated (we are without information as to the interval of time) the testator made an unsigned pencil entry in his private papers, indicating an intention not found in the written documents of gift delivered to the donee?

The question is not without difficulty. It is perfectly clear that after the gift was complete by delivery to the donee, and the separation of the parties, it was not competent for the donor, by his sole act, to alter the legal effect of the gift purely as such—that is, as vesting complete and unconditional ownership in the donee. The gift itself was complete from the moment of delivery, and no question is now made, or can be made, as to the donee's absolute right to it. What is in question is, the legacy. That remained under the sole control of the testator until his death. So that the real question here is not what was the testator's intention as to the gift, but his intention as to the effect of the gift in satisfying, or not satisfying, the legacy.

As already shown, where the gift is made by a written document, as here, the intention that it shall operate in satisfaction of the previous legacy cannot be established by parol testimony—since this would violate the rule that written instruments may not be contradicted or altered by parol evidence. Hence there must be written evidence of testator's intention to overcome the effect of the written documents of gift. Written evidence of what character? Obviously declarations written by the testator himself. But written when? Must these written declarations be contemporaneous with the gift, or would declarations written subsequently temporaneous with the gift, or would subsequently suffice? Undoubtedly to effect the gift itself, these declarations must be not only written, but contemporaneous, and communicated to and accepted by the donee. But our question is not one of a bilateral transaction—in which the written documents are to be interpreted according to what Mr. Wigmore terms the "integrated" intention of both parties— but ours is a purely unilateral transaction, and its effect dependent solely on the intention of one actor with respect to a res (i.e. the legacy) in his sole control and ownership. It is his intention solely that is the object of our search; and that intention must be expressed in writing. The intention or willingness of the donee to receive the gift in satisfaction is immaterial, and not in question.

The pencil entry made by Col. Payne undoubtedly and clearly expressed an intention existing in his mind at the time the entry was made (whenever that was) that the gift should go, or had gone, in payment or satisfaction of the legacy. But assuming that the entry was made at a time subsequent to the gift, is this competent written evidence to establish the required intention? The time at which the required intention must have existed is, of course, the moment of making the gift. If the intention that the gift should satisfy the legacy did not exist at that moment, clearly no intention formed subsequently could affect the past completed transaction. If, therefore, the pencil entry indicated the existence of an intention of satisfaction, existing only at the time of the entry, the entry would be incompetent evidence. The intention cannot operate ex post facto. But this pencil entry may very reasonably be interpreted as a record and a written confirmation of the existing intention, orally expressed at the time of the gift —or, excluding the oral testimony, of an intention existing, but unexpressed (I know of no rule requiring intention to satisy a legacy by a gift to be communicated to the donee) at the time of the gift made. Suppose Col. Payne had made, in his own handwriting, the day after the gift made—or at any later date—an entry in hid diary to the effect that he had satisfied the legacy in his will to the University by a gift of a larger amount, would such an entry be admissible to establish the necessary intention to satisfy the legacy: I was at first disposed to regard the absence of Col. Payne's signature to this pencil entry as relegating the writing to the level of a mere parol declaration; but on subsequent reflection and conference with Prof. Graves, I have reached the conclusion that it is a written and not a parol declaration.

We have then reached this situation: An act done, the effect of which on an existing will of the actor, depends on the intention with which the first act was done— and this intention, under the rule of law applicable to the circumstances here, must be established by written declarations of the actor. Written but unsigned declarations of the actor, made subsequent to the act in question, are offered in evidence. I see no escape from the admission of this evidence, unless the rule involved requires that such written declarations must have been contemporaneous with the act. In my opinion this rule does not require that such declarations shall be contemporaneous. The intention must have been contemporaneous with the act, buth the declarations may have been subsequent, provided they establish the intention previously existing.

Certainly in those cases where parol declarations of a testator are properly admitted to prove the intention with which an act was done, as affecting legacies in a previous will, such declarations are not confined to those made contemporaneously. The pencil entry here is expressed in the past tense "Paid $250,000." Written at large, the entry would read "I have already paid this legacy by a gift of $250,000." "Paid" here can mean nothing else but "satisfied"— and this conclusion is reinforced, if it needs reinforcement, by the erasure of the name of the legatee and the amount of the legacy, in the typewritten list. Hence, the entrymay be read thus: "Having paid the University of Virginia $250,000. in my life time, I declare that my intention in making the gift was to satisfy the legacy, an intention of which I have not repented at the date of this entry."

If these premises are sound, I see no escape from the conclusion that this pencil memorandum is admissible in evidence to establish the testator's intention to satisfy the legacy by the gift—and, if admitted, that it is sufficient evidence to establish that intention. If so, the conclusion is inevitable that the University is not legally entitled to the legacy.

The only hope of avoiding this conclusion is to assail the legal premises on which it is based. They seem sound to me.

Whereas Oliver H. Payne, late of the City of New York, died on the 27th day of June, 1917, leaving a Last Will and Testament dated the 7th day of September, 1915, and the same was thereafter duly admitted to probate by the Surrogate's Court of the County of New York, and letters testamentary thereon were issued out of said court to the Executors named in said Will; and

Whereas the said will contained a legacy of two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000.) to the University of Virginia; and

Whereas on or about the 10th day of July, 1916, said Oliver H. Payne gave to Dr. Edwin A. Alderman, President of the University of Virginia, the sum of Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars ($250,000.) to be held by him for account of the University, and stated, in substance, that he had made in his then existing will a legacy to the University of Virginia but that he did not wish the University to wait until his death to receive said legacy and therefore proposed to make a present gift thereof; and

Whereas the question arose after the death of the said Oliver H. Payne as to whether said gift of Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars ($250,000.) did not operate as an ademption or satisfaction of said legacy of Two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000.), and the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, having examined into the facts and being advised upon said facts as they then appeared that they were legally entitled to the legacy, passed a resolution at a meeting of the Board held November 27th, 1917, to the effect that they would not be justified in renouncing said legacy; and

Whereas further investigation of said facts and the presentation of additional evidence, including among other things a notation found in the papers of the said Oliver H. Payne and in his handwriting, to the effect that said legacy to the University of Virginia had been "paid", have satisfied the Board that the said Oliver H. Payne intended that said gift of Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars ($250,000.) to the University of Virginia should be in lieu of and in satisfaction of his said legacy of Two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000) to said University, and the Board is now satisfied that the said gift did operate as an ademption or satisfaction of said legacy and that the University is not legally entitled to said legacy, and that it is its duty to renounce the same;

NOW, THEREFORE, be it

RESOLVED, That the University of Virginia, acting through the Rector and Visitors of the University, does hereby renounce and disclaim the said legacy of Two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000.) bequeathed to it in and by the said Last Will and Testament of the said Oliver H. Payne, and all right, title and interest therein, and that the officers of the University be and they are hereby authorized to execute a formal renunciation of said legacy under the seal of the University and to deliver the same to the Executors of said will.

And RESOLVED FURTHER that the officers of the University be and they hereby are authorized to execute in the name and under the seal of the University, a waiver of the issue and service of a citation in any proceeding which may hereafter be instituted by the Executors of the Last Will and Testament of said Oliver H. Payne for the judicial settlement of their accounts, and to deliver the same to said Executors.

Upon motion the meeting adjourned,

It was my intention and understanding in making the gift of $155,000. for the establishment of a School of Fine Arts, that $5,000. or as much thereof as might be necessary, should be used outright for the purchase of equipping the School of Art and Architecture.
