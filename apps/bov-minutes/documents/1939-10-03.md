A called meeting of the Rector and Visitors was held on this date at 10:30 o'clock in the office of the President, with the following Visitors present: James H. Corbitt, Robert W. Daniel, Christopher B. Garnett, C. O'Conor Goolrick, Miss Bessie C. Randolph, Hollis Rinehart, Lewis C. Williams and R. Gray Williams.

The President called the meeting to order and informed the meeting of the death of Frederic W. Scott, Rector, on September 24, 1939. He then advised that it would be necessary for the meeting to elect a Rector pro tem, whereupon Mr. James H. Corbitt was placed in nomination and elected.

Miss Bessie C. Randolph, of Hollins College, appointed to fill the unexpired term of Mrs. M. C. B. Munford, and Senator Robert W. Daniel, of Brandon, appointed to fill the unexpired term of Frederic W. Scott, presented their credentials and were duly qualified before the Clerk of the Court of Albemarle County.

Messrs. R. Gray Williams and Lewis C. Williams were appointed a special committee to draft resolutions with respect to the death of Mr. Frederic W. Scott, Rector.

The President made the following announcements:

Enrollment 2,878

The President presented the resignations of Dr. R. C. Hollowell, and William S. Mundy, Jr., which were accepted and the following resolutions adopted:

RESOLVED, by the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the resignation of Dr. R. C. Hollowell, Associate Professor of Preventive Medicine, be and the same is hereby accepted. De. Hollowell has carried forward his work with devotion and skill and The Rector and Visitors wish for him continued success in his new field.

RESOLVED, by The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the resignation of Mr. William S. Mundy, Jr., Assistant Professor of Law, be and the same is hereby accepted. The Rector and Visitors wish for him continued success in his new field.

Upon the recommendation of the President, the leave of absence heretofore granted Dr. Rowland A. Egger, Director of the Bureau of Public Administration, was extended from January 1, 1940 to July 1, 1940, and to Mr. John W. Wheeler-Bennett, Visiting lecturer in International Law, leave for the session of 1939-40.

Upon the recommendation of the President, the following were elected to the faculty:

Dr. Thomas Shepherd Engler, Associate Professor of Preventive Medicine, at $1,500 per year.

Mr. Virgil Clifford Williams, Assistant Professor of Chemical Engineering, incumbency to begin September 15, 1939, at a salary of $2,800 per session.

Dr. Rudolph Freund, Acting Professor of Rural Economics, for the session of 1939-40, at a salary of $3,000.

Mr. Edwin Crockin, Research Assistant in the Bureau of Public Administration for the period of September 1, 1939 through June 30, 1940, at a salary of $1,250.00 for the ten months.

Dr. Riggs McConnell, Acting Assistant Professor of Law for the session of 1939-40, at a salary of $3,000 for the session.

Dr. Thomas H. Vance, Instructor in English, at $2,500.00 for the session.

Mr. Louis Long, Jr., Research Assistant in Medicinal Chemistry, for the session of 1939-40, at a salary of $1,000. (Funds for this work made available by Smith, Kline & French Laboratories, Philadelphia, Pa.)

An appropriation, not to exceed $2,500, for equipment in the Department of Urology, including two cystoscopic tables and a resection apparatus, to be purchased from surplus earnings of the Urology Department, was voted.

The President stated to the Board that by her will, recently admitted to probate in the Clerk's Office of the Circuit Court of Prince William County, Virginia, Mrs. Johanna Marshall gave to the University and to the District Mission Board of the Church of the Brethren for the Eastern District of Virginia, and Mrs. L. L. Sandaal, jointly, a parcel of land in Prince William County containing about 30 acres, with no buildings thereon, but on which is situated certain timber of some small value; also the interest of Mrs. Marshall in another tract of some 20 acres, upon which there is a dwelling house in which tract Mrs. Marshall was joint tenant with other parties whose names we are not advised of. The value of this devise is undoubtedly quite small.

The President also reminded the Board of the fact that in the settlement of the Estate of Dr. Walter M. Seward the University obtained title to a one-half undivided interest in a tract of land in Dinwiddie County, Virginia, known as the Brown Farm, containing some 342 acres, the other one-half interest being owned by Mrs. Mary C. Boisseau; that from time to time tentative offers have been made to us and to Mrs. Boisseau for the purchase of this property at prices around $2,000.00. No offer has been accepted and we still own this property. It is now rented to a colored man upon a crop-sharing basis and we have been receiving an average of about $20.00 a year for the past few years from this rental.

It is possible that at any time an acceptable offer may be made for the University's interest in the Marshall properties and in the Brown Farm, and it is desirable that if such offer or offers should be received that prompt action may be taken to effect a sale or sales. It was, thereupon-

RESOLVED that a special committee, composed of the President, and of Mr. Rinehart, be and is hereby appointed with full power to accept or reject any or all offers made for either or for both of said properties, and if an offer is received for either one of said pro erties which is accepteble to this committee, the President, Dr. J. L. Newcomb, is hereby authorized and directed to execute a deed conveying said property to the purchaser, with general warranty of title. Mr. E. I. Carruthers, Secretary, is hereby authorized to affix the corporate seal to such deed or deeds and to attest the same, and to deliver said deed or deeds to said purchaser upon compliance by the purchaser with the terms of sale agreed upon by said committee.

The President recalled to the Board that in the settlement of the Estate of Dr. W. M. Seward, the University obtained title to certain vacant lots in the City of Petersburg, among others, 30 lots in the subdivision known as "Hillcrest"; that in 1935, E. I. Carruthers, and W. Allan Perkins went to Petersburg, inspected these properties, and after careful examination of local conditions made a report that these lots, in their opinion, were worth at least $50.00 apiece.

An offer has recently been received for two of these lots at the price of $150.00 cash for the two, the lots in question being Lots Nos. 9 and 10 in Block D, as shown upon a plat of the property, dated January 27, 1916, and recorded in the Clerk's Office of the Hustings Court for the City of Petersburg, in D. B. 86, p. 566. A considerable amount of correspondence with reference to this sale has passed between the Attorney for the University and Mr. M. H. Guthrie, the real estate agent in Petersburg who has been handling the University's property there, and it is recommended to the Board that the offer be accepted.

A deed was, thereupon, presented to the Board by which said Lots Nos. 9 and 10 of Block D in "Hillcrest", are conveyed to J. C. Cheeley, Jr., Pauline Cheeley, and Alice Virginia Cheeley, parties making said offer, and it was, thereupon-

RESOLVED that the President be and is hereby authorized and requested to execute said deed in the name and on behalf of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, and E. I. Carruthers, Secretary, is hereby authorized to affix the corporate seal thereto, attest the same, and deliver said deed to the purchasers upon payment of the purchase price, from which it is understood, that a commission of 5% shall be paid to M. H. Guthrie, the real estate agent making said sale.

The President recalled the fact to the Board that in the settlement of the Estate of Whitmell T. Taliaferro, of Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey, the University has become the owner of a house and lot situated in Glen Ridge, New Jersey, by virtue of a conveyance thereof from Alfred D. Cooper and wife, dated October 18, 1938, which conveyance was accepted by the University in satisfaction of a mortgage given by said Cooper and wife to Mr. Taliaferro during his lifetime, which mortgage passed to the University under Mr. Taliaferro's will; that an offer of $8,000.00 was recently received for this property through Arthur E. Marsters, Inc., a real estate agency in Bloomfield, New Jersey, and being unable to obtain any satisfactory information as to the true condition of the house and the actual value of the property, Mr. Frank E. Hartman was sent to Glen Ridge to make a personal inspection of the premises and report upon the value thereof. Mr. Hartman made a thorough examination of the property and reported that, in his opinion, the house was rapidly deteriorating and was already in need of very extensive repairs, and that, in his opinion, the University would do well to sell the property as promptly as possible and that $7500.00 would be a fair price thereof. Almost immediately after Mr. Hartman's report was made we received a form of contract prepared by said real estate agents, under which the University agrees to sell said property to Robert E. O'Donovan and Ella M. O'Donovan for the sum of $8,000.00, of which $800.00 is to be paid in cash upon execution and delivery of the contract, an additional amount of cash of not less than $800.00 upon delivery of deed, and the residue of purchase money to be secured by bond and mortgage upon the property, and to be paid by the mortgagors in minimum monthly payments of $8.00 per month per $1000.00 of original principal sum, with interest at the rate of 5% upon the unpaid balance.

After conferring with the Rector and with Mr. Hollis Rinehart, this contract was executed by the President and has been delivered to the purchasers. A copy of said contract, which is dated August 16, 1939, is herewith presented to the Board, said copy being one of the original copies executed by the three parties to this transaction. Among other things it will be seen that under this contract we agree to make conveyance of said property to the purchasers on or before the 1st day of October, 1939.

A deed by which said conveyanace is made by the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia to the said Robert E. O'Donovan and Ella M. O'Donovan, his wife, prepared by Messrs. Pitney, Hardin & Skinner, our Attorneys in New Jersey, was then presented to the meeting, W. Allan Perkins, Attorney for the University, stating that said deed, in his opinion, when properly executed and acknowledged on behalf of the University, would convey said property to said purchasers in accordance with the terms of said contract.

It was, thereupon, RESOLVED-

(1) That this Board approves the sale of the premises conveyed by Alfred D. Cooper and wife to the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, by deed recorded December 21, 1938, in Book p-94, pp. 573-574 of Deeds for Essex County, upon the terms set out in the articles of agreement dated August 16, 1939, between the University of Virginia and Robert E. O'Donovan and Ella M. O'Donovan, his wife;

(2) That this Board further approved the form of the deed submitted to this meeting, and dated September 21, 1939, between The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, of the first part, and said Robert E. O'Donovan and Ella M. O'Donovan, his wife, of the second part, by which said property is conveyed to said parties of the second part, and J. L. Newcomb, President of this corporation, is hereby authorized and empowered to execute said deed in the name and on behalf of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, E. I. Carruthers, Secretary of this Board, being hereby authorized to affix the corporate seal thereto, and to attest the same;

(3) And Messrs. Pitney, Hardin & Skinner, Attorneys, of Newark, New Jersey, are hereby authorized and empowered to deliver said deed to said purchasers upon compliance by said purchasers with the terms of said contract of purchase, or if said purchasers should prefer to pay the whole of the purchase money, namely, $8000.00, in cash, upon delivery of said deed, then said Pitney, Hardin & Skinner are hereby expressly authorized to deliver said deed to said purchasers upon payment of said purchase price in full, less 5%, or $400.00, which is the commission due Arthur E. Marsters, Inc., the real estate agents through whom this sale was negotiated,

(4) And said E. I. Carruthers, Secretary of this Board, is hereby authorized and empowered to deliver to Messrs. Pitney, Hardin & Skinner, for delivery by said Attorneys to said purchasers, a copy of these resolutions, certifying the same under the seal of this Corporation, attaching to said certified copy of these resolutions the signed articles of agreement presented to this meeting and hereinbefore referred to, and also the deed of conveyance presented to this meeting, the execution of which is hereinbefore authorized, certifying that said articles of agreement and said deed of donveyance are the same papers that were submitted to this meeting and approved by the foregoing resolutions.

An affidavit was then presented to the meeting, prepared for execution by E. I. Carruthers, secretary, under which said Carruthers, deposes on oath, among other things, that the persons executing the deed of conveyance are persons duly authorized by proper resolution of this Board at a proper and lawful meeting of said Board, also that so far as he knows, title to the said property has never been questioned or disputed, and that said title is now free and clear of all taxes and other encumbrances of any kind. Upon consideration of said affidavit, it was, thereupon,

RESOLVED, that said E. I. Carruthers be and he is hereby authorized to execute said affidavit, and to deliver same to Messrs. Pitney, Hardin & Skinner for delivery to said purchasers along with said deed of conveyance.

Application was made to the Board by E. O. McCue, Jr., and Jesse B. Wilson to refinance their indebtedness to the University secured by deed of trust upon an office building on Fifth Street, Charlottesville, by allowing said parties to pay $1000.00 of the principal of $6000.00 now owed by them, and to deliver to the University, in evidence of the remaining $5000.00, their seven bonds, one of which shall be for $500.00, the remaining bonds to be for $750.00 each, all of said bonds to be payable five years after date, with interest at 4% per annum payable semi-annually, leave being reserved to anticipate payment of any of said bonds at any date when interest is payable, provided sixty days prior notice in writing has been given the University of such anticipation.

It was-

RESOLVED that the Attorney for the University advise Mr. McCue and Mr. Wilson that the University is willing to refinance this loan upon the terms above set out, provided five per cent is paid upon said bonds instead of four per cent.

The President presented this matter for consideration and action by the Board, during the consideration of which Mr. R. Gray Williams withdrew. The matter was disposed of in the following preambles and resolution adopted:

At a former meeting of the Executive Committee of the Board, held on March 8, 1939, the following Resolution was adopted:

"RESOLVED, by The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that approval be and the same is hereby given to the State Highway Department to re-locate a new highway along the old Blandy Camp Road, which is the northern end of the University property known as The Blandy Experimental Farm."

Up to the present time no further action has been taken with reference to conveyance of the Right-of-Way in question.

A contract prepared by the State Highway Department to convey said Right-of-Way was presented to the meeting, and it was thereupon\*

RESOLVED, by the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the President be and he is hereby authorized to execute this agreement on behalf of the Rector and Visitors of the University, and deliver the same, and it was

RESOLVED, FURTHER, that if desired by the State Highway Department the President shall also execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of this corporation, a deed conveying said Right-of-Way to the Commonwealth of Virginia, and E. I. Carruthers, Secretary of this Board, is hereby authorized to affix the corporate seal of the University, both to said agreement and to such deed as may hereafter be executed by the President pursuant the authority of this resolution.

The President then presented to the meeting an application upon a form promulgated by the Division of Aeronautics of the State Corporation Commission for permit for the establishment, maintenance, operation and conduct of an airport and/or landing field for landing and departure of civil aircraft engaged in commercial aviation, under and in accordance with provisions of Sections 3775a to 3775n and 3074a to 3074i of The Code of Virginia.

Discussion of the propriety of making this application developed the fact that application in the form submitted is necessary if the University is to obtain a permit for operation of such a flying field as is necessary in connection with our aeronautical training program. After a full consideration of the whole situation, during which Captain Royal, representing a group of citizens of the Shadwell and Keswick communities, was heard in opposition to its location on the proposed site, the following resolution was adopted:

RESOLVED, by the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the President be and he is hereby authorized and directed to execute said application in the name and on behalf of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, and to take such steps as may be necessary to file said application with the State Corporation Commission, and to authorize and direct such further action on behalf of the University as may be necessary in and about securing the permit applied for.

The President presented to the meeting the following letter from Governor James H. Price, dated September 19, 1939 and addressed to the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia:

Under date of September 19, 1939, President J. L. Newcomb has requested the Governor's approval of the creation of a deficit in the amount of $17,800 for the purchase of a tract of land of 178 acres extent just south of Shadwell, Virginia, to be used by the University as a landing field for students receiving instruction in aeronautics.

In support of this request President Newcomb has pointed out that the University of Virginia now offers comprehensive ground training in aeronautics, and that accessibility of a landing field meeting standard requirements of the Civil Aeronautics Authority will permit University participation in the training program sponsored by that agency.

President Newcomb writes further as follows:

"It is understood that the Rector and Visitors will apply to the State Corporation Commission for a permit to operate this field and that the Corporation Commission will agree to carry forward the necessary grading operations, the reseeding, and the building of hangars at their (the Commission's) expense, which will serve to place this field in a condition to meet all the requirements of the Civil Aeronautics Authority in Washington."

An examination of the evidence submitted in support of this application indicates the existence of an emergency which justifies the incurrence of deficit, and that the price to be paid for the proposed landing field is a reasonable one.

Permission is accordingly granted for the incurrence of a deficit for the purchase of a tract of 178 acres just south of Shadwell, Virginia, according to the map of such tract on file in the offices of the Corporation Commission. The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia are authorized to borrow from such sources and on such terms as the Treasurer of Virginia may approve not to exceed $17,800.00. An appropriation for the repayment of this loan will be recommended in the next budget.

and after the above letter was read and fully considered, the following resolution was adopted:

RESOLVED, by the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the President be and he is hereby authorized to negotiate a loan from such source as he may deem best, not to exceed $17,800 which sum shall be used to pay the purchase price for the property known as "The Hughes Farm" now owned by W. D. Haden and wife.

The President is further authorized to conclude the purchase of said property, accept deed thereto, and to all things which may be necessary to effect the purposes for which this purchase is being made.

A list of the contracts on said Dockets was presented, read and approved, and the President authorized to sign the same on behalf of the Board.

GOVERNOR'S OFFICE
-----------------

Under date of September 19, 1939, President J. L. Newcomb has requested the Governor's approval of the creation of a deficit in the amount of $17,800 for the purchase of a tract of land of 178 acres extent just south of Shadwell, Virginia, to be used by the University as a landing field for students receiving instruction in aeronautics.

In support of this request President Newcomb has pointed out that the University of Virginia now offers comprehensive ground training in aeronautics, and that accessibility of a landing field meeting standard requirements of the Civil Aeronautics Authority will permit University participation in the training program sponsored by that agency.

President Newcomb writes further as follows:

"It is understood that the Rector and Visitors will apply to the State Corporation Commission for a permit to operate this field and that the Corporation Commission will agree to carry forward the necessary grading operations, the reseeding, and the building of hangars at their (the Commission's) expense, which will serve to place this field in a condition to meet all the requirements of the Civil Aeronautics Authority in Washington."

An examination of the evidence submitted in support of this application indicates the existence of an emergency which justifies the incurrence of deficit, and that the price to be paid for the proposed landing field is a reasonable one.

Permission is accordingly granted for the incurrence of a deficit for the purchase of a tract of 178 acres just south of Shadwell, Virginia, according to the map of such tract on file in the offices of the Corporation Commission. The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia are authorized to borrow from such sources and on such terms as the Treasurer of Virginia may approve not to exceed $17,800.00. An appropriation for the repayment of this loan will be recommended in the next budget.
