The Rector and Board of Visitors of the University has learned that President Alderman has been tendered the Chancellorship of the University of Georgia and after consideration has declined in order to continue his work as President of this University.

RESOLVED, first; That the Rector and Visitors is conscious of the distinct recognition which has so justly come to President Alderman,

RESOLVED, second; That the Rector and Visitors appreciate in the highest degree the decision of President Alderman to remain at the University. His distinguished service to the University and through it to the State and to the nation is fully recognized by the Board.

The Rector and Board, therefore, records its great satisfaction that President Alderman has declined this distinct honor and will continue his constructive service for this Institution.

The Rector presented the following letter from Miss Emilie W. McVea with respect to her resignation as a member of the Board.

I am today sending to Governor Trinkle my formal resignation as a member of the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia. I cannot refrain from writing at the same time to express to you and the other members of the Board my heartfelt appreciation of the delightful way in which you welcomed me and made me so completely one of yourselves. I value more than I can tell you the association in so high a duty with men like those on our Board. The meetings have been a pleasure and a privilege.

I wish that my health had permitted me to continue my work at Sweet Briar and on the Board. I am going to be well again, but the process is slow.

The University will always have my deepest interest and I trust that in the future I may find some practical way of evincing that interest.

With sincere regard for every member of the Board, I am,

Following the reading of the foregoing communication from the Rector appointed Messrs. McIntire, Williams, and Hall a Special Committee to prepare and send to Miss McVea a resolution setting forth the Board's appreciation of her service to the University, the same to be spread upon the minutes.

RESOLVED, That the Rector and Visitors having learned with regret, of Dr. Emilie W. McVea's ill health and resignation, deeply sensible of the loss to the Board, and appreciating her many kindnesses and courtesies, have appointed the undersigned committee to express their sincere hope that she will speedily recover her health.

The President announced the attendence and gifts, as follows:

Total enrollment for the year 1946.

Through the generous gift of Mr. William Andrews Clark, Jr., alumnus, of Los Angeles, Calif., the University has been made a sustaining member of the American Academy in Rome. $250.00 annually is the gift. This provides our art graduates opportunity in advanced work without cost of tuition:- (use of libraries and studios and instruction in fine arts. â€” music, painting, sculpture, architecture, archaeology, and classical studies).

Mr. Rinehart announced it his intention to endow a scholarship by a gift of $5,000 in either cash or bonds to provide an annual income of $300; the said scholarship to be known as the RINEHART SCHOLARSHIP, to be awarded to a needy boy of Albemarle County or the City of Charlottesville.

Mr. McIntire stated that if the Board would establish two additional Rector and Visitors Scholarships for the session of 1925-26 with remission of University fee and tuition in any department of the University, he would donate the sum of $200 to be divided equally between the two holders. Such action was taken by the Board and will be found spread in these minutes.

Mr. Scott announced that in view of the uncertainty of the income for the Woodrow Wilson Scholarship to be established by the Virginia Division of the Daughters of the Confederacy with an annual income of $500, being received during the session of 1925-26, he would guarantee said sum for the session.

The President was authorized to express the thanks of the Board to the foregoing donors.

The resignation of Prof. L. Tucker Jones was presented and accepted in the following motion, adopted:

RESOLVED, That the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia accept with regret the resignation of Mr. Leigh Tucker Jones, Associate Professor of Physical Education. Mr. Jones has discharged his duties in the Department of Physical Education with great ability and devotion to duty.

The President was empowered by the Board to make the appointment in case Dr. Leathers could be secured.

On motion, duly made and seconded, the following Special Appropriations were made for the fiscal year 1925-26:

The Committee from the Medical Department appointed by the President to formulate rules and regulations for awarding the Dr. J. Shelton Horsley Memorial Prize in Medicine presented its recommendations which, on motion, duly made and seconded, were adopted as follows:

THE JOHN HORSLEY MEMORIAL PRIZE.

University of Virginia.

This prize was established in February, 1925, by Dr. J. Shelton Horsley of Richmond, Virginia, a distinguished alumnus, as a memorial to his father, Mr. John Horsley of Nelson County, Virginia.

The Prize consists of two years' interest on $10,000 in 5% bonds and will therefore be presumptively $1,000. It is to be awarded every two years by a committee of the Medical Faculty of the University of Virginia for a thesis upon some subject in general surgery. The term "general surgery" is used in a broad way and includes the specialties commonly associated with general surgery such as orthopedic surgery, urology and gynecology but not the specialties of the surgery of the eye, ear, nose and throat which have developed along lines which differentiate them markedly from general surgery.

The object of the prize is to stimulate an interest in the scientific aspects of surgery. In the past there has been some tendency to glorify the mechanical technic of surgery, and perhaps some neglect of its underlying scientific features. The donor wishes particularly to stimulate an interest in the underlying biologic principles with the hope that surgeons may not become mere operators but be imbued with a scientific spirit which will contribute to the advancement of surgical knowledge.

With this view the essay should be on surgical problem, the solution of which depends solely or in large part upon research work, (preferably original research) in some branch of pathology, bacteriology, physiology, biochemistry or embryology.

All graduates of the Medical Department of the University of Virginia of not more than fifteen years standing are eligible for this prize and are invited to submit theses. In the discretion of the committee the prize may be awarded for work done by a medical graduate of the University of Virginia in collaboration with a non-alumnus of this institution but in such case the award will be given to the Virginia graduate alone.

The prize is to be awarded bi-ennially at the final exercises of the University of Virginia, by a committee consisting of the Dean of the Medical School of the University of Virginia, the professor of surgery, the professor of pathology, the professor of physiology, the professor of biochemistry and the professor of histology and embryology. The decision will be made by a majority vote. In no instance shall a thesis be awarded a prize unless it contains work that is deemed worthy. If no essay is considered worthy the prize shall not be awarded and the accumulated interest will be added to the principal. After two years theses will again be examined for an award but it is not at present intended that the prize shall exceed one thousand dollars.

The theses must be submitted to the committee in typewritten form and work that has not been previously published will be preferred. If the work has been previously published it must be presented in a new form. The committee will make suitable arrangements for the publication of the theses.

All theses entered in this competition must be in the hands of the committee on February 1st, of the year in which the prize is to be awarded. They should be addressed to the Dean of the Medical School of the University of Virginia

The prize is to be awarded for the first time in June 1927, therefore the theses should be presented not later then February 1st, of that year.

Upon the recommendation of Dr. W. A. Lambeth, Director of Physical Education the following was adopted:

RESOLVED, That beginning with the session of 192526 a fee of $1.00 be charged for lockers at the Memorial Gymnasium, which fee shall not be returnable.

Applications for sites for fraternity houses by the Omicron Chapter of Beta Theta Pi; the Beta Chapter of Sigma Nu, and the Delta Sigma Phi were referred to the Committee on Buildings and Grounds.

Petition of the Kappa Alpha Fraternity for an extension of one year from June 15th, 1925 in which to raise the required $25,000 to fulfill the requirement of the University for site for its chapter house, was granted.

The report of the Bursar on his investigation of the two tracts of land and the deed of trust belonging to the Coffinberry Estate bequeathed to the University of Virginia, having been presented and considered it is

RESOLVED, That the report be received and filed and that upon the delivery of the said estate to the University, the Bursar's recommendations contained therein be adopted and that he be directed to communicate with the J. T. Silver Real Estate Agency at Minneapolis, Kansas, placing the tract of 160 acres located near that town with the said agency for sale at $60 per acre, and that until sale is made the said agency be employed to look after the interest of the University in leasing the land and collecting the rentals at their charge of 10% on the cash received from said rentals.

That the Colorado land be not sold until further orders from the Board, and pending such time, G. A. Austin, of Crook, Colo., be engaged at $25 per year to look after leasing the land, collecting the rent, etc.

That in the matter of the deed of trust secured on land at Peabody, Kansas, the debtor, J. E. Tressler be given until January 1, 1926 to effect sale of the property, after which he shall have same made over to the University of Virginia, if deemed advisable by the Chairman of the Finance Committee and the Attorney for the University.

The Committee appointed by the President to formulate plans of co-operation between the University of Virginia and the Charlottesville Public Schools with reference to professional matters in the field of Education, submitted its report which, on motion, duly made and seconded was adopted in the following form:

The Committee is of the opinion that there should be two types of co-operation between the University of Virginia and the Charlottesville School Board, one with reference to practice teaching and observation for students in education and the other with reference to co-operation between the city school authorities and the professors of education at the University concerning professional matters.

1\. An officer to be in charge of directed teaching and observation from the Department of Education of the University of Virginia in the Charlottesville City Schools and to act as supervisor of instruction in the Charlottesville High School.

2\. Said officer to be selected through the joint action of the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia and the Charlottesville School Board, the chosen officer to be elected by the Board of Visitors as an Assistant Professor of Education with a salary of $1,500 and to be elected by the Charlottesville School Board as a Supervisor of Instruction in the Charlottesville High School at a salary of $1,000.00.

3\. The duties of said officer to be a matter of agreement between the University of Virginia and the Charlottesville City School Board. The committee would suggest that said officer be held responsible for the following duties;

(a). To teach Education Bill (Directed Teaching) to all candidates for baccalaureate degrees who expect to apply for state certificates to teach in Virginia secondary schools. This of course will involve arranging schedules for observation and teaching for these students.

(b). To co-operate with the instructors of the various sections of Education B10 (Methods of teaching High School Subjects). This will involve the arrangement of schedules for observation in the secondary schools in order that the students may observe instruction in their major academic subject.

(c). To co-operate with the high school principal in general supervision of high school work, plans for this phase of the work to be agreed upon in conference and approved by the City School Board.

The Professor of Educational Psychology, (1) upon request of the school authorities, to study and report upon problems of the school system which present psychological aspects, and (2) to examine children referred to him by the school authorities, with a view to diagnosing their abilities or disabilities.

(To carry out No. 2, an examining room should be provided in one of the school buildings, and the work would probably be facilitated if the Professor of Educational Psychology were officially designated Special Examiner of the Schools.)

The work of the Professor of Educational Psychology in the schools to be attended and participated in by advanced students of spychology, at his direction, with a view to training such students in psychological methods.

Permission for and plans of co-operation with school authorities with reference to the program of studies in the Charlottesville High School. Professional students in Secondary Education should have the opportunity of carrying on research studies in the city schools that meet with the approval of the Superintendent of Schools and the Professor of Secondary Education.

It should be of advantage to the School of Educational Administration to co-operate with the public schools of Charlottesville in acquainting the students in Education with the technical aspects of the administration and management of the city school system. Likewise, it should be of advantage to the city school system to confer and advise with the School of Educational Administration concerning these matters. Professional students in school administration should be afforded an opportunity of carrying on research studies in the city schools on such problems of administration and supervision as the city superintendent from time to time wishes studied

It is agreed that the foregoing general plan of co-operation applies also to the Summer Quarter.

The Committee to which was referred the proposed changes in the registrations concerning registration as a Virginia student, submitted its recommendation in the following, which, on motion, duly seconded, was adopted:

RESOLVED, That the regulations now carried in the catalog with reference to registering as Virginia students be amended to read as follows:

In order to be considered a Virginia student, it is necessary that the applicant's parents be domiciled in the State if he be under twenty-one years of age; or if he has attained his majority, that he himself be domiciled in said State; and that either his parents or the applicant for admission shall have been bona fide taxpayers in the State of Virginia for at least two years prior to said application.

The President submitted statements for Dr. Lambeth and Prof. Hudnut concerning reconstruction of Medical Building. Following a general discussion of the matter, the following motion, duly made and seconded, was adopted:

RESOLVED, That a Special Committee consisting of Messrs. Rinehart, Newcomb and Lambeth be appointed to investigate the condition of the old Medical Hall, and if in their judgment the building can be made safe at a cost not to exceed $3,000, they be and are hereby empowered to have the necessary work done, and report to the Board.

The question of providing fire escapes at Cabell Hall was referred to the above special committee for report.

The suggestions by Dean Maphis of the Summer Quarter for Convocation or Graduating Exercises at the close of the Summer Quarter, as embodied in the following motion, duly made and seconded, was adopted:

RESOLVED, That the following plan for Convocation or Graduating Exercises at the close of Summer Quarter is approved for the session of 1925-26:

1\. That the President request authority from the Board of Visitors to hold such Convocation for the conferring of degrees completed in the Summer Quarter.

2\. That the President be empowered in case of his absence from the University to authorize the Dean of the Summer Quarter to confer the degrees.

3\. That each applicant for a degree in the Summer Quarter be required to submit for approval to the proper committee on Degrees in the Summer Quarter the program of work leading to the degree sought, not later than April first of the year in which the degree is to be obtained. If the committee approves the program, it should be submitted to the proper faculty for recommendation to the general faculty and finally approved by the general faculty at the meeting at which the other degrees are approved.

4\. The Convocation should be a dignified exercise to which all of the members of the regular faculty in residence at the time as well as all members of the faculty of the Summer Quarter should be expected to be present.

The details should be worked out and agreed upon by the Dean of the Summer Quarter, the Dean of the University and the Dean of the Graduate Department acting as a committee for this purpose.

The following communication received from Dr. W. E. Brown, was considered and on motion, duly made and seconded, the suggested division of the appropriation heretofore made to the Blue Ridge Sanatorium was approved:

At the forty-ninth meeting of the State Board of Health Committee for Blue Ridge Sanatorium, held at Blue Ridge Sanatorium, Charlottesville, Virginia, February 4, 1925; the following resolution was adopted:

"Moved by Dr. Smith, duly seconded and carried, that after February 1, 1925, the Blue Ridge Sanatorium Committee decline the $3,000 annually appropriated by the University of Virginia for the instruction of students of the University in tuberculosis work with the understanding that the University shall pay Dr. William E. Brown, Medical Director of Blue Ridge Sanatorium, $700 annually for his services as instructor, and $300 annually for transportation expenses of students to the Sanatorium; and, with the hope that the remaining $2,000 of this fund be given by the University for the development of the children's clinic by Professor Lawrence T. Royster."

It is my understanding that it was the intent of the Committee that the $300 per year for transportation be made in monthly payments directly by check to Blue Ridge Sanatorium and that the $700 set aside as compensation for giving instruction to the medical students be made payable to me in monthly payments.

On motion, duly made and seconded, the following was adopted:

RESOLVED, That the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia accord to Miss Mary Eppes the privilege of naming the incumbent of the scholarship established by her and her two sisters, in 1921, in memory of her father, and to be known as "THE RICHARD EPPES MEMORIAL SCHOLARSHIP". It is understood that the incumbent of this scholarship is to come from Hopewell, Virginia.

The Rector and Visitors renew their expression of appreciation to Miss Eppes for her contribution of five thousand dollars to the Centennial Endowment Fund.

Petition of Mr. Russell Bradford, Secretary of the Collonnade Club, to be allowed to buy a lot in the University Cemetery was granted.

The Rector read a letter which he had received from Mrs. Josie W. Rhodes in which she again asserted her claim to some further payment on account of her services as Manager of the University Cafeteria. The letter was tabled and ordered filed.

The Rector stated that a friend of Mrs. Theodore Hough had approached him in the matter of further payments to her on account of Prof. Theodore Hough's salary. The President advised the Board that the salary of Prof. Hough had been continued to his widow for four months from November 30, 1924, the date of Prof. Hough's death, which it was thought would be fair and just. Following some discussion of the matter the following motion, duly made and seconded, was adopted:

RESOLVED, That it is the sense of the Board that it will give due consideration to any request or petition presented by Mrs. Hough through the President with reference to further payments on account of her husband's salary.

W. Allen Perkins, Attorney for the University, reported that leases had been prepared with Mrs. Elizabeth Glinn for the two houses for use as nurses Home, in accordance with the resolution of the Board at the meeting April 19th, 1925, Said leases expire April 30, 1928, with the right to renew them for two years.

Mr. Perkins called attention to the fact that the statute laws effecting the University of Virginia, prepared by Mr. Berkeley Minor and his son, Jas. F. Minor, were now ready for printing, whereupon the following motion, duly made and seconded, was adopted:

RESOLVED, That the "Statute Laws Effecting the University of Virginia". prepared by Mr. Berkeley Minor and his son, Jas. F. Minor, be printed as an issue of the Extension Bulletin.

The President was requested to prepare a resolution of appreciation of the services of the State Nurses Association in raising a fund to endow a chair of Nursing at the University of Virginia.

Upon motion duly made and seconded, and after discussion it was

RESOLVED, That the Rector is hereby authorized to execute and acknowledge, and the Secretary is hereby authorized to attest for and in behalf of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, a certain waiver appended to a certain Deed of Gift dated October 22, 1924 by and between H. C. Stuart and Emory and Henry College, said waiver being in the words and figures following, to-wit:

"The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, a Corporation, hereby release and waive any and all rights, if any, that they have or may have under and by virtue of a certain Deed of Gift dated June 14, 1922, by and between H. C. Stuart of Elk Garden, Virginia, and Emory & Henry College, a Corporation, said Deed of Gift being of record in the Clerk's Office of the Circuit Court of Washington County, Virginia, in Deed Book 103 page 159, and being also of record in the Clerk's Office of the Circuit Court of Albemarle County, Virginia, in Deed Book 182 page 64, to which deed so of record reference is here made."

Upon the recommendation of the Chairman of the Finance Committee that a further loan be granted the Chi Phi Fraternity to complete the financing of its chapter house located on the grounds of the University, the following, being duly seconded, was adopted:

RESOLVED, That an additional loan of $4,000 be made to the Alpha Home Association for the completion of the financing of the erection of the Chi Phi Chapter house; said loan to be made for a term of ten years with the privilege of payment at any interest date upon 30 days notice of their intention to so pay the debt, and that the attorney for the University be directed to draw a supplimental lease covering the additional loan, and that the Rector be and is hereby authorized to sign same on behalf of this Board.

The Chairman of the Finance Committee stated to the Board that in the B. W. Green Estate and the R. L. Parrish Estate there were five lots of bank stock aggregating 602 shares with book value of $116,580, the present market value of which is $135,415 with a profit to the said funds of $18,835, and that in his judgment the said stock should be disposes of and the proceeds reinvested in bonds, whereupon it was

RESOLVED, That the Chairman of the Finance Committee be and is hereby authorized to dispose of the following bank stock belonging to the B. W. Green Estate and the R. L. Parrish Estate, and that the Rector be and is hereby authorized to transfer same on behalf of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia:

On motion the meeting then adjourned to Wednesday evening, June 24th, 1925, when the resignations of Professors Lefevre and Pott and Dr. Howze would be the special order of business.

I am today sending to Governor Trinkle my formal resignation as a member of the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia. I cannot refrain from writing at the same time to express to you and the other members of the Board my heartfelt appreciation of the delightful way in which you welcomed me and made me so completely one of yourselves. I value more than I can tell you the association in so high a duty with men like those on our Board. The meetings have been a pleasure and a privilege.

I wish that my health had permitted me to continue my work at Sweet Briar and on the Board. I am going to be well again, but the process is slow.

The University will always have my deepest interest and I trust that in the future I may find some practical way of evincing that interest.

With sincere regard for every member of the Board, I am,

RESOLVED, That the Rector and Visitors having learned with regret, of Dr. Emilie W. McVea's ill health and resignation, deeply sensible of the loss to the Board, and appreciating her many kindnesses and courtesies, have appointed the undersigned committee to express their sincere hope that she will speedily recover her health.

At the forty-ninth meeting of the State Board of Health Committee for Blue Ridge Sanatorium, held at Blue Ridge Sanatorium, Charlottesville, Virginia, February 4, 1925; the following resolution was adopted:

"Moved by Dr. Smith, duly seconded and carried, that after February 1, 1925, the Blue Ridge Sanatorium Committee decline the $3,000 annually appropriated by the University of Virginia for the instruction of students of the University in tuberculosis work with the understanding that the University shall pay Dr. William E. Brown, Medical Director of Blue Ridge Sanatorium, $700 annually for his services as instructor, and $300 annually for transportation expenses of students to the Sanatorium; and, with the hope that the remaining $2,000 of this fund be given by the University for the development of the children's clinic by Professor Lawrence T. Royster."

It is my understanding that it was the intent of the Committee that the $300 per year for transportation be made in monthly payments directly by check to Blue Ridge Sanatorium and that the $700 set aside as compensation for giving instruction to the medical students be made payable to me in monthly payments.
