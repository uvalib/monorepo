CONSIDERATION OF APPEAL BY THE CAVALIER DAILY
---------------------------------------------

The Cavalier Daily requested the Board to consider an appeal from the decision of the President to uphold a ruling of the Student Activities Committee to preclude the Cavalier Daily from paying staff salaries while using funds provided by student fees. Statements prepared by the Cavalier Daily were mailed to the members of the Board prior to the meeting. Under Section 5.1 of the Manual, which states that the Board at its discretion shall hear such appeals as are provided for in the University Regulations, the Board accepted the Cavalier Daily's appeal for consideration, determined that a hearing be held, and directed the Rector to appoint a committee to conduct the hearing, with instruction to report its findings to the full Board at the March 1979 meeting if possible.

CONSIDERATION OF APPEAL BY THE JEFFERSON SOCIETY
------------------------------------------------

The Jefferson Society requested the Board to consider an appeal from the decision of the President to uphold the Student Activities Committee's decision to deny funding to the Jefferson Society because the Society was determined to be "primarily social" and also to have restricted membership. Under Section 5.1 of the Manual which states that the Board, at its discretion shall hear such appeals as are provided for in the University regulations, accepted the Jefferson Society's appeal. Statements supporting this appeal prepared by the Jefferson Society were mailed to the members of the Board prior to the meeting.

The Board voted to uphold the action of the President which concurred with the decision of the Student Activities Committee to deny funding to the Jefferson Society. The Board encouraged the Jefferson Society to bring requests for future funding to the Student Council's Appropriation Committee.

These are (1) the public release of the agenda before each meeting and (2) permission for discussion of the agenda by Student Council before each meeting.
