ATTACHMENT A 1995 HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS (HCPs) -- SALARY INCREASES
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The proposed effective date of the HCP structure adjustment is December 3, 1995. This date coincides with the beginning of a biweekly payroll period.

The proposed structure (range) adjustment for the majority of HCP classes is 2.25 percent.

HCPs will not receive across-the-board salary increases this year. The 2.25 percent will be pooled by Medical Center budget units and awarded based on merit using a variable pay plan.

This merit plan will allow for variable pay increases from 0 percent to 10 percent staying within the total allotted 2.25 percent dollars. HCPs rated higher on individual performance evaluations must receive a higher percentage merit increase than those rated lower.

Three class series will have from 7 percent to 10 percent adjustments to implement a new clinical ladder for the following health care groups: physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech pathology and audiology. The three groups have been identified as lagging further behind market rates and the Medical Center is vulnerable to the loss of these essential employees.

The proposed structure adjustments are based on the semi-annual salary survey dated the spring of 1995 that the Department of Human Resources conducts of comparable health care institutions.
