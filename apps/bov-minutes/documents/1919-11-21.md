A special meeting of the Rector and Visitors was held on the above date at 10 o'clock A. M. in the office of the President. There were present R. Tate Irvine, Rector, and Visitors Harris Hart, Goodrich Hatton, Geo. R. B. Michis, Alexander F. Robertson, C. Harding Walker, and the President.

The minutes of the meeting of October 14th, copies of which had been sent to each member of the Board and found correct, were approved.

The Rector presented the following report:

The special committee appointed at the meeting of the Rector and Visitors October 14, 1919, to consider the question of increase of salaries of the professors, associate professors, adjunct professors and administrative officers met on this date at 8 o'clock P.M. in the office of the President. There were present the President, and Messrs. Irvine, Hart, Walker and Michie. Visitors Robertson and Hatton were present by invitation of the committee.

The following motion made at the meeting of the Board on October 14th by Mr. Michie, and referred to this special committee, was discussed, and it was unanimously resolved that the following be recommended to the Board for its adoption:

RESOLVED, That the salaries of all members of the Faculty of the rank of professor, associate professor and adjunct professor who have been with the University for three years or more; and the salaries of administrative officers who have been with the University three years or more shall be increased 25% as of September 15th, 1919.

RESOLVED, That a similar increase of 25% shall be made in the salary of each member of the faculty and administrative officer, who has been with the University for less than three years, when he has been with the University for three years.

President Alderman presented the following petition from members of the faculty praying for an immediate increase of 25% in salaries:

The professors of the University of Virginia, in special conference assembled, desire to call your attention to the following facts, too well known to require argument:

1\. The cost of the necessaries of life in this community has increased 100 per cent in the past three years;

2\. As a consequence the great majority of the faculty, in spite of all economies, are facing financial distress, if not disaster, and are in urgent need of immediate relief;

3\. This position of economic inferiority to other professions of like training and standing and the consequent financial anxieties, result inevitably in lowered efficiency of teaching and in decreased influence with the student-body and the public;

4\. These conditions will make it impossible to attract to the University the type of teacher, which has given it its prestige in the past.

The members of the faculty have been face to face with these hardships for two years past. They have borne them without complaint. The conditions have now become intolerable. We have learned with interest and deep appreciation of a resolution introduced at a recent meeting of the Rector and Visitors, looking to a partial and temporary relief of the financial distress of the faculty by means of a 25 per cent increase of salaries, effective from the opening of the current session. We also rejoice to hear that the University has in hand a present surplus sufficient to care for this proposed partial relief during the session of 1919-1920, and may reasonably look forward to such increase of income in the future as will afford permanent and more adequate relief.

We therefore respectfully address to you the following resolutions:

RESOLVED by the professors of the University of Virginia, in special conference assembled, That the President of the University be and is hereby requested.

1\. To present this communication to the special committee of the Rector and Visitors which will consider this subject, and to bring to bear the great influence of his position and intimate knowledge of the needs of this faculty and institution in advocacy of the immediate adoption of the 25 per cent increase of salaries as a measure of partial relief for the present session;

2\. To labor to make it the fixed policy of the University to devote all funds now and hereafter to become available to the payment of adequate salaries to the teaching staff, before any further enlargement or expansion of the institution is undertaken in any direction whatever, not demanded by the necessities of efficient instruction in the existing schools or by the increasing numbers of students.

And be it further RESOLVED, That we make these requests the more confidently because the professors fully recognize and genuinely appreciate the cordial relation and sympathetic understanding which the President of the University of Virginia has ever manifested toward them.

The President read to the Board his reply to the members of the faculty, which was as follows:

I beg to acknowledge the receipt of a preamble and resolutions presented to me on November 3rd and again signed on November 5th by a committee representing a conference of the gentlemen of the faculties of the University. I need hardly say that I am in enthusiastic accord with the general purport of these resolutions both as regards the substantial increase of salaries and the policy of not attempting further new expansion in the University until a just and adequate salary arrangement for the present staff is attained. The purpose to bring about this increase is the most steadfast purpose in my mind, and has been all along for twelve years as I have seen the staff increase from twenty-eight to seventy-eight by process of promotion rather than succession, and particularly since last April when with then no certainty of surplus funds I recommended and the Board added some $8000 to be appropriated for salary increases. I shall, therefore, both as your colleague and as a member of a committee appointed by the Board for the purpose, give to these resolutions my most earnest and sympathetic consideration, and I shall take pains to see that the committee of the Board and the Board itself see and consider them. I confess to some disquiet and some unhappiness in the matter. Naturally, I would desire not only to support but to lead in a movement to grant a petition containing so much of justice and signed by so many thoughtful and unselfish men. I am determined whether the Legislature grants the request contained in the budget or any part of it or none of it, to recommend with insistence that a new salary basis of 25% increase be entered upon here this year effective for the current session, and it is my judgment that the Rector and Visitors also hold this purpose quite definitely, though, of course, I have no authority to forecast their action. With me the necessity for such action is a matter of supreme educational policy.

Whether it shall take place in the manner and at the time set forth in the resolutions, that is to say, immediately and effective from the opening of the current session and in anticipation of any consideration by the Governor or Legislature, I respectfully submit is a question of practical judgment for the Rector and Visitors with the President acting in advisory capacity. Though this is not the time or place for canvassing or discussing this matter, the opportunity of seeing all of you is so rare that I take this opportunity to say that so far as I am concerned, this judgment will be formed, after patient and sympathetic reflection rounded on an experience of thirty years with legislative bodies, as to whether the immediate action asked for will endanger or promote or merely leave unaffected the legislative request herein presented asking definite increased appropriation for reasonable salaries for the teaching staff.

If the immediate action requested in advance of legislative consideration or action shall seem to me to threaten defeat to the legislative request for $47,000 for this very purpose, I shall consider it my duty, with great regret, to record my judgment against it, though, as I have hitherto said, if defeat should come to the budget request for any cause, I should insist nevertheless that the action be subsequently taken by the Pector and Visitors.

If the immediate action requested shall seem to me to promote or simply to leave unaffected the legislative situation, I shall with great pleasure record my judgment in favor of it. I have a fancy my colleagues would not wish me to act otherwise than in the manner indicated.

I shall be very glad to be shown that the immediate action requested will not result in any hindrance or embarrassment to the vital interests of the University or those responsible for those interests, the chiefest of which I think to be the establishment and permanent maintenance of an increased and juster salary scale for its professors, and I invite conference and analysis of the subject from any gentlemen or group of gentlemen to the end that I may do my duty in the matter with a maximum of wisdom and the whole problem be settled as justly and speedily as possible.

The report of the special committee was then taken up, discussed at length and disposed of in the following resolutions which were unanimously adopted:

RESOLVED, That salaries of all members of the Faculty of the rank of professor, associate professor and adjunct professor who have been with the University for three years or more; and the salaries of administrative officers who have been with the University three years or more shall be increased 25% as of September 15, 1919.

RESOLVED, That a similar increase of 25% shall be made in the salary of each member of the faculty and administrative officer, who has been with the University for less than three years, when he has been with the University for three years.

RESOLVED, That the term "Administrative Officers" shall include the President, the Deans, the Librarian, the Bursar, the Registrar and the Superintendent of Grounds and Buildings.

RESOLVED, That the rental of University houses occupied by professors receiving the above increase of salary shall be $375. per year.

In connection with the above matter, the following motion by Mr. Hatton was adopted:

RESOLVED, That the letters from J. K. M. Norton and John Steward Bryan dated November 11 and 14, 1919 respectively, and indicating their inability to be present at this meeting and that they favor the adoption of the resolution of Mr. Michie offered at the last meeting, to be acted on at this meeting, providing for an increase in the salaries of the faculty and administrative officers be placed on file.

Upon recommendation of the President, Professor Fiske Kimball was nominated to the Governor for appointment to fill a vacancy on the State Art Commission.

The sum of $192.50 was appropriated to the Jefferson Literary Society to restore chairs lost or destroyed during the occupancy of its room by S.A.T.C. classes.

The President advised the Board of a bequest in the will of the late Richard B. Tunstall, of Norfolk, Virginia, as set forth in the fourth clause of the will, as follows:

"FOURTH: I desire and direct that my sons Pobert and Cuthbert shall set apart and invest the sum of Five Thousand Dollars ($5000.00) in some good safe interest bearing security or securities, and I give and bequeath said securities unto the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia in trust, to hold the same and annually to invest the income derived therefrom in the purchase of books for the \`Isabel Mercein Tunstall Library of Poetry' which I started during my life."

In connection with the above bequest, the following resolution was adopted:

RESOLVED, That the Rector and Visitors of the University acknowledge with gratitude and appreciation the gift of $5,000 contained in the will of Richard B. Tunstall, of Norfolk, Virginia, for the Isabel Mercein Tunstall Library of Poetry. The Rector and Visitors recall the former gift of Mr. Tunstall and realize what a permanent contribution to the strength of the library the whole handsome gift constitutes. They are unanimous in expressing their thanks and appreciation, and desire that a copy of this resolution be forwarded to Mr. Robert B. Tunstall and Mr. Cuthbert Tunstall with their respect and esteem.

The Bursar reported the receipt of a letter from Kirkpatrick and Howard, of Lynchburg, Virginia, stating that a $10,000 policy upon the life of L. P. Stearnes in the New York Life Insurance Company, which policy had been assigned to Kirkpatrick and Howard, Trustees, along with $40,000 of other life insurance at the time a $50,000 loan was made by the University to Bentley K. Stearnes and L. P. Stearnes, had matured and that it was the desire of Mr. L. P. Stearnes to draw the cash dividend, leaving the face of the policy still in force. The Bursar reported that a similar request had been made and granted to Mr. Stearnes. The matter was disposed of in the following resolution, and adopted:

RESOLVED, That the request of L. P. Stearnes through Kirkpatrick and Howard, Trustees, for permission to receive from the New York Life Insurance Company the cash dividend accrued and due on Policy #992.932 in the New York Life Insurance Company for $10,000 be granted.

A communication from the State Accountant addressed to the Bursar under date of November 10, 1919 was submitted, advising that an examination of the accounts of the University for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1919 disclosed no irregularities, and that the records correctly set up the revenue of the University and the disbursements were found to be sustained by proper vouchers.

The President read a letter which he had received from Mrs. M. C. B. Munford, Chairman, with reference to having the University admit women to its graduate and professional schools. After some discussion of the matter, Mr. Hatton moved, and it was adopted, That the letter from Mrs. Munford be laid on the table and the Secretary be directed to have a copy of said letter mailed to each member of the Board, and that the President be requested to call a meeting of the Board early in January to consider the question of admitting women, and the supreme object of the meeting be stated in the notices when the meeting is called.

On motion the meeting then adjourned.

The special committee appointed at the meeting of the Rector and Visitors October 14, 1919, to consider the question of increase of salaries of the professors, associate professors, adjunct professors and administrative officers met on this date at 8 o'clock P.M. in the office of the President. There were present the President, and Messrs. Irvine, Hart, Walker and Michie. Visitors Robertson and Hatton were present by invitation of the committee.

The following motion made at the meeting of the Board on October 14th by Mr. Michie, and referred to this special committee, was discussed, and it was unanimously resolved that the following be recommended to the Board for its adoption:

RESOLVED, That a similar increase of 25% shall be made in the salary of each member of the faculty and administrative officer, who has been with the University for less than three years, when he has been with the University for three years.
