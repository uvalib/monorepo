Resolved 3.

"The Committee on finance begs leave respectfully to report, that no report from the Commissioner of accounts has been received, in consequence, as is supposed, of family affliction - It is therefore suggested that the Executive Committee be instructed to make a special examination of the finances without delay. From such examination as we have been able to make we think the books, accounts & moneys of University are properly kept according to the enactments.

The Committee on the Library made the following report which was received & ordered to be recorded, to wit-

"The Committee on the Library begs leave that they have given the Library such examination as their limited time & the absence of the Librarian would allow. The Library has every appearance of being kept with neatness, system & care, & is, we think, in good condition. There is a bad leak in the room from the sky-light which ought to be promptly attended to. No additions are being made to the Library; but while we recognize the propriety of a temporary diversion of the funds for the use of the library for the general uses of the University, it will, in our opinion be proper to keep a fair account of all funds thus diverted, & refund them as soon as the condition of the Treasury will allow. We are of opinion that one hour each week will be time enough to keep the Library open during the next session for the purpose of taking out returning books.

July 4th /63

respectfully

A. T. Caperton

John B. Baldwin"

The Committee on chemical & philosophical apparatus offered the following report, which was adopted & ordered to be put on record, to wit

"The Committee on philosophical & chemical apparatus ask leave respectfully to report— The Committee have been unable to make any satisfactory examination of the state of the Apparatus under the controul & in the custody & use of each of the Professors, by reason of the failure of the Professors to make the reports required by the resolution passed June 30th 1857, & renewed by the minutes of the Board Feb. 9, 1860. The Committee think it proper to recommend to the Board the adoption of the following resolution.

Resolved that the Board of Visitors again call the attention of the Professors of the University to the necessity of their regular & strict compliance with the requisitions of the resolution of the Board passed June 30th, 1857, & having failed to make their reports to this meeting of the Board, be requested to make & return the same to the Executive Committee, to be laid before the Board at its next meeting - All which is respectfully submitted.

A. T. Caperton

J. R. Tucker"

The Committee on Buildings & Grounds make the following report, which was received & ordered to be recorded—to wit—

"The committee on Grounds & Buildings beg to report, that they have made a pretty general examination, & find that much injury has taken place from dilapidation & other causes which might be hereafter prevented by more active supervision & the immediate expenditure of a limited amount in repairs. The Dawson Buildings, in addition to the injury received by their occupation by the soldiers, are suffering from an extensive leak in the roof of one of them, & from the destruction of the gutters of several. The Committee would suggest that immediate steps be taken to have these repairs attended to. The Dormitories are many of them left open, & in the precise condition in which they were left by the soldiers - loose straw on the floors makes them peculiarly liable to fire. In some instances the windows have been entirely removed, & in many the glass destroyed. The enclosures are, we are informed, frequently destroyed, & cattle allowed to graze on the lawns. The trees, evergreens & shrubbery are also suffering from want of more regular attention. The conclusion to which the committee has arrived is that the University will suffer much loss unless some immediate step is taken to repair the injuries already inflicted & to prevent a recurrence of them. All which is respectfully submitted.
