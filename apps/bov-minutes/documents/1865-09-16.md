--------------

A special meeting having been ordered for this day-the following members appeared. Viz.

Alex: Rives, Rector, and Messrs Woods, Johnson, Hughes, Pretlow, Tabb, Barbour & Lewis.

The Rector laid before the Board the following report from the Executive Committee.

"The Executive Committee of the board of Visitors beg leave to report that in pursuance of the authority given them, they employed William Wertenbaker as the Secretary of the board, at the Salary of his predecessor.

On examination of the recently erected dining rooms of the two hotels at the Southern ends of the ranges, your Committee found the roofs in too ruinous a condition, to admit of repair and de med it essential for safety and permanency to contract for the removal of them and the substitution of roofs of a different Jescription to be covered with tin at the expense of $500 for each house."

On motion

Resolved that the report of the Executive Committee be adopted.

On motion

Resolved that Charles S. Venable be appointed Professor of Mathematics. (Nem: con:)

On motion

Resolved that the Board regret that the financial condition of the University, puts it out of their power to grant the prayer of the petition of Robert R. Prentis late Proctor & Patron, to be restored to his former position, but that he be allowed to occupy until the first of January next, the house in which Wm. A. Pratt now resides.

Resolved that the limited financial resources of the Commonwealth and the University, and the unsettled condition of public affairs make it inexpedient at this time to inaugurate the Statue of Thomas Jefferson the founder of this University; but that the Board fully sensible of its duty in this regard pledges itself to execute this high trust with appropriate Cerimonies at the earliest practicable moment.

Resolved that in the judgment of the Board it is not only temporarily inexpedient, but erroneous in principle to establish a maximum of compensation to the Professors of the University.

Resolved that William Jeffries be appointed Hotel Keeper in place of Dr. W. W. Hamner resigned and that he be allowed to charge each student for board, the use of all necessary room furniture & servants attendance one hundred & eighty dollars a session payable in current funds.

Resolved that the subjects to which the attention of the Board has been called in a communication from Prof. Minor acting (in the absence of Dr. Maupin) as Chairman of the Faculty, except such as have been already acted on by the Board, be referred to the Executive Committee.

Resolved that the letter of William A. Pratt late Superintendent of Grounds & Buildings and the claims preferred by him against the University, be referred to the Executive Committee confiding in the continuation of the annuity, which has been granted for many years by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth to the University; the Board of Visitors advise the Faculty to receive State Students as heretofore.

On Motionâ€”The Board then adjourned.
