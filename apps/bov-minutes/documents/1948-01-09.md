The report of the Finance Committee was approved as submitted and is as follows:

The Finance Committee respectfully represents that it has received a schedule of the estate held by the Safe Deposit and Trust Company of Baltimore, Trustee, under Item 6 of the will of Evelyn M. B. Tiffany, showing the estate on hand June 22, 1947 which was the date of the death of Florence B. B. Turlington, the changes which have since taken place, the proposed partial distribution to the University of Virginia, and the balance of estate retained by the trustee to provide for the remaining annuities; that your committee has carefully considered this proposed distribution and approves of it in every respect. In addition, there was exhibited to the committee by W. Allan Perkins, attorney for the University, the form of receipt which the trustee in this trust, the Safe Deposit and Trust Company of Baltimore, desired the President of the University to execute in return for delivery to him of the securities proposed to be distributed to the University, and that this form of receipt has been approved by your committee.

There is attached hereto the schedule above referred to and the form of receipt approved.

KNOW ALL MEN BY THESE PRESENTS: That whereas by Item Sixth of the Last Will and Testament of Evelyn May Bayly Tiffany, which Will was duly probated in the Orphans' Court of Baltimore City and is of record in the Office of the Register of Wills of said City in "Wills" Liber E.R.D. 164, folio 331, she gave to the Safe Deposit and Trust Company of Baltimore upon trust so much of her estate as might be necessary, in its opinion, to provide for the payment of the following annuities over and above all taxes (excepting income taxes) and other charges against said fund, which annuities she directed said Trustee to pay in quarterly installments, accounting from the date of her death during the life of each annuitant, apportioning same to the date of the respective deaths of said annuitants, viz:

and said Will provided upon the death of each of said annuitants, other than Florence B. B. Turlington, the annuity payable to the said annuitant so dying should be paid to the said Florence B. B. Turlington during her life, so that her annuity of $2,000. should be increased from time to time by the amount paid to the annuitants predeceasing her, and said Will further provided that if the said Florence B. B. Turlington should survive all of the other annuitants, then upon her death, the trust fund should fall into the residue of the testatrix's estate, but should she die during the life of any of said annuitants, then there should pass into the residue of the Testatrix's estate, upon the death of any annuitant, including the said Florence B. B. Turlington, so much of the principal of the trust fund as might be estimated by said Trustee to have produced the annuity paid to the annuitant so dying; and

WHEREAS by Item Seventh of said Will, the Testatrix devised and bequeathed the residue of her estate to the undersigned, with the request that it use the income for the support of Fellowships for persons from Northampton and Accomac Counties - said Fellowships to be known as "The Thomas Henry Bayly Fellowships" and "The Evelyn and Louis McLane Tiffany Fellowships" and to be in Academic, Law and Medical Schools, and should there at any time be any vacancies in said Fellowships not availed of by persons from either of said Counties in Virginia, they may be awarded to persons from other portions of Virginia, or from the State of Maryland; and

WHEREAS the said Florence B. B. Turlington died June 22, 1947, and the following annuitants who had received the following annuities, predeceased her, viz:

so that at the time of her death, the said Florence B. B. Turlington was receiving a total annuity of $6,000.; and

WHEREAS by reason of the death of the said Florence B. B. Turlington, it is now possible for the Trustee to make a distribution of a portion of the assets of said trust estate, after reserving sufficient which, in its opinion, will produce income sufficient to pay the remaining annuities; and

WHEREAS there has been submitted to and approved by the undersigned, a schedule showing the assets of the trust estate in the hands of said Trustee as of June 22, 1947, the date of death of the said Florence B. B. Turlington, the changes since, the retention of certain securities, the income from which is to be used in paying the remaining annuities, and the distribution of the balance of the estate to the undersigned; and

WHEREAS, as shown by said schedule, there were distributed to the undersigned on account of said trust estate, the following securities, viz:

which securities said Trustee has transferred and delivered to the undersigned, the receipt of which it doth hereby admit and acknowledge, and agrees to use the same in accordance with the provisions of the Will of said Testatrix above set forth; and in consideration thereof, it doth hereby Release, Acquit, Exonerate and Discharge the said Safe Deposit and Trust Company of Baltimore and its successors of and from all and every action, suit, claim, or demand which could or might possibly be brought exhibited or prosecuted against it, them, or any of them, for or on account of said securities or the payment thereof, hereby declaring itself fully satisfied, contented and paid as above specified.

IN TESTIMONY WHEREOF, the said body corporate hath caused this Release to be subscribed by the President thereof, and its corporate seal to be hereto affixed, this \_\_\_ day of \_\_\_\_\_, nineteen hundred and forty-eight.

The Interfraternity Council was represented by Mr. Joseph C. Carter, Jr., President. Mr. Carter stated that he was disturbed that the Board had taken such summary action without giving the IFC an opportunity to pass on the rules approved by the Board. He then presented a petition from the

The Inter-fraternity Council of the University of Virginia respectfully represents unto The Rector and Visitors, the following:

(1) That the Inter-fraternity Council is a voluntary association of the Greek Letter social fraternities of the University deriving its authority under and by virtue of a constitution adopted by the Greek Letter social fraternities and approved by the Dean of the University, a copy of which is now, and has been for several years past, on file in the Dean's office. A copy is also hereto attached;

(2) That Article III, Sections 1-7 of said constitution cover the powers granted to Your Petitioner or its Governing Board to control the Greek Letter social fraternities at the University, and, more specifically, to act upon cases that involve the breaking of rules governing conduct in fraternity houses;

(3) That in view of the fact that said constitution had been approved by the Dean of the University, Your Petitioner believed it was its duty to make and enforce rules governing conduct in fraternity houses, the actions of Your Petitioner, in this regard, being subject, of course, to the approval of the Administrative officers of the University and of the Rector and Visitors;

(4) That Your Petitioner recognizes the necessity of proper rules governing conduct in fraternity houses, and it is the earnest desire of Your Petitioner that proper rules be adopted to assure such conduct;

(5) Your Petitioner respectfully calls to the attention of The Rector and Visitors that the rules governing conduct in fraternity houses approved by resolution of the Board on the 12th day of December, 1947, places the duty of enforcing such rules, not upon Your Petitioner who has the power and authority by virtue of its constitution, to enforce such rules and to punish infractions thereof, but upon the officers of each fraternity who are in no position to punish infractions of such rules. This will result, in Your Petitioner's opinion, in the burden of enforcement falling upon the administrative officers of the University.

Your Petitioner further is of the opinion that the only practical and satisfactory method of enforcement of rules of conduct in fraternity houses is by self government and not through action by the administrative officers of the University and that it will constitute a step backward in student self government to take away from Your Petitioner its jurisdiction in this regard.

(6) It is further the earnest desire of Your Petitioner that rules of conduct be established that will constitute standard rules which in the main will remain unchanged from year to year and which will be susceptible of enforcement.

(7) Your Petitioner, while it realizes that The Rector and Visitors has already given careful thought and consideration to the question, believes that the Board did not have before it all of the necessary facts having to do with enforcement of rules of conduct in the past, and that the Board possibly did not foresee the unfortunate consequences that may occur as a result of the rules in their present form.

Your Petitioner therefore requests that the Board reconsider its previous action in regard to such rules of conduct and that Your Petitioner be granted the privilege of presenting to the Board its views upon jurisdiction to enforce rules of conduct and upon modification of the present rules.

Upon motion duly made and seconded, it was, by a 2/3 majority vote of the Council,

RESOLVED, that Article I, Sections 2 and 3 of the Constitution of the Interfraternity Council be and the same hereby are amended to read as follows:

Each active fraternity shall be allowed one representative to sit on the Interfraternity Council.

The representative of each such fraternity shall be the President thereof and no other. In the event the President of a fraternity is not able to be present at a meeting of the Interfraternity Council, such fraternity may send another member of such fraternity to the meeting as an observer, but he shall not be entitled to a vote.

Be it further -

RESOLVED, that Article III, Section 3 of said Constitution be amended to read as follows:

The trial of any infractions of any rules adopted by the Interfraternity Council or for the enforcement of which it is responsible shall be before the Governing Board.

It shall be the duty of the President of the Interfraternity Council to convene the Governing Board at the earliest possible date to hold such trial. A fraternity or an individual member of a fraternity may appeal from a decision of the Governing Board penalising such fraternity or a member thereof, to the Interfraternity Council as a whole. A decision of the Governing Board cannot be reversed by the Council as a whole except by a 2/3 vote of the membership of the Interfraternity Council.

The decisions of the Governing Board and of the Council shall be subject to the approval of the University authorities.

Be it further -

RESOLVED, that these amendments shall be in full force and effect from the 6th day of January, 1948.

Mr. Anderson pointed out that a Committee of the Board had met with the Interfraternity Council last spring, and that proposals then submitted by the IFC almost identical to those presented by the IFC at the December 1947 meeting of the Board had been rejected.

He further reminded Mr. Carter that he (Mr. Carter) had stated to the Board at its December 1947 meeting that the proposals submitted at that time by the Interfraternity Council were the most stringent that the IFC would approve.

Mr. Carter pointed out that the major objection held by the fraternities to the rules passed by the Board was to Rule 6, requiring the officers of the fraternities to enforce these rules. He stated that at other institutions where such a method of enforcement had been tried it has failed. He then submitted proposed modifications of the present rules governing the conduct of fraternities.

(PROPOSED MODIFICATIONS OF RULES GOVERNING FRATERNITIES)

Upon motion duly made and seconded, it was, by a 2/3 majority vote of the council,

RESOLVED THAT,

(1) Fraternity houses shall be conducted in an orderly and gentlemanly manner. Decent, upright conduct shall be maintained at all times, and no conduct shall be tolerated that reflects in any way upon the good name of the fraternity or of the University. Disturbances objectionable to neighbors and to the community at large will not be tolerated.

(2) Women of bad character shall not be permitted in a fraternity house at any time.

(3a) Ladies are to be entertained in living and recreation rooms only.

(b) No ladies shall be permitted in fraternity houses on Monday through Friday before 3:00 p.m. nor after 8:00 p.m. except as hereinafter provided;

(c) No ladies shall be permitted in fraternity houses on Saturday and Sunday before 11:00 a.m. nor after 8:00 p.m. except as hereinafter provided;

(d) On nights of authorized University dances, upon application made to the Dean of Students, in writing at least twenty-four (24) hours in advance, the Dean may extend the night hours to one hour after the dance provided suitable chaperons approved by him are present in the fraternity house from 8:00 p.m. until one hour after the dance.

(e) On Friday and Saturday nights ladies shall be permitted in fraternity houses until 1:00 a.m., if chaperons approved by the Dean of Students are present.

(f) On special occasions, upon application made to the Dean of Students, in writing at least twenty-four (24) hours in advance, the Dean may extend the night hours until 1:00 a.m., provided suitable chaperons approved by him are present in the fraternity house from 8:00 p.m. until 1:00 a.m.

(g) The provisions of subsection (b) and (c) shall not apply to mothers, sisters or wives of members of the fraternity when accompanied by that member nor shall subsection (b) or (c) apply to servants regularly employed in the fraternity house.

(4) Each fraternity, through its officers, shall be responsible to the Interfraternity Council, for the enforcement of these rules and for the conduct of its members. The Interfraternity Council shall have full jurisdiction over the enforcement of these rules, and over the punishment for any violations thereof, subject to the approval of the administrative officers of the University.

(5) No change may be made in these rules except by resolution of The Rector and Visitors.

Mr. Carter pointed out that the IFC is a body subordinate to the Student Council; that the IFC would punish the fraternity for a violation and that it would turn over to the Student Council for trial the individual violators of the rules.

He stated that the proposed modifications would satisfy the desires of the students to be a self-governing body.

A letter to the Rector and Visitors from the University of Virginia Fraternity Advisors Association was presented.

The Fraternity Advisors Association, organized in September of 1947, presents its respects to the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia.

The Association was organized for the main purposes of cooperating with the University Administration and the fraternities on matters of common interest to both and, acting as a group rather than only as individuals, in advising the fraternities on matters of proper interest to all of them. The Association is composed of University Alumni, residents of Charlottesville and Albemarle County, who are members of the faculty, professional and business men, of mature age and experience. There is one representative for each fraternity and a few alternates.

We have studied with care the rules adopted by the Board on December 12, 1947, dealing specifically with visiting hours for ladies in fraternity houses. We have discussed their effect with representative undergraduates and have arrived at grave doubts as to their workability in some respects, under present conditions. On this account we beg to submit some observations and conclusions on this subject.

The provisions of section (3) and (4) of the rules as previously adopted fail to take into consideration the case of mother, wife, or sister of a member. It would seem proper that a mother, wife, or sister of a member should be allowed to visit a fraternity house at hours other than those specifically allowed, provided, of course, she is accompanied by such member.

A number of the fraternities, due to the high cost of food and the lack of a sufficient number of suitable eating places are serving meals. Colored women are employed as servants. To apply the rules as they presently exist to such servants seems unnecessary and certainly not within the real meaning of the rules.

It is therefore suggested that mothers, wives, and sisters of members, when accompanied by such member be excepted from the application of the rules and that domestic servants be excepted.

The provisions of section (5) limits the presence of women in fraternity houses to 1:00 a.m. provided chaperons approved by the Dean of Students are present. This provision fails to take into consideration the fact that some of the authorized University dances are not over until after 1:00 a.m. and that some of them may be held on nights other than Friday or Saturday. The girls from college and boarding schools who are permitted to attend these dances are allowed by their school authorities one hour after the dance ends in which to reach the place where they are staying. It would seem preferable that the girls who attend the University dances have a place to go with their escorts which will be under proper chaperonage rather than be left to the uncertainties of unchaperoned parked cars, road houses and tourist camps. It is therefore suggested that the rule limiting the time to 1:00 a.m. be slightly relaxed on nights of authorized University dances to include one hour after the dance ends, provided the Administration is assured that proper chaperonage will be maintained.

The provisions of Section (5) further limit the 1:00 a.m. time to Fridays and Saturdays.

It is pointed out that there are official University holidays such as Founders Day, Thanksgiving Day, etc., which do not necessarily fall upon a Friday or Saturday and that it would seem proper that members of a fraternity could entertain on such a holiday or upon the night preceding such a holiday. It is therefore suggested that Section (5) be further slightly modified to take care of such eventualities and for others that cannot now be foreseen by providing that on special occasions, upon application made to the Dean of Students, at least twenty-four (24) hours in advance, the Dean may extend the night hours until 1:00 a.m., provided proper chaperonage is maintained.

Section (6) provides that the officers of each fraternity shall be held responsible for enforcing the rules.

It is submitted that, with the best of intentions, the officers of a fraternity are in no position to punish any infraction of the rules and that they would have no recourse but to report infractions to the Administrative authorities. This puts these officers in an impossible position, making policemen of them for the benefit of the Administrative authorities. Such a course of action has never worked satisfactorily in any school or college and will not do so now. In the final analysis the burden of enforcement as well as of punishment will fall upon the Administrative officers of the University who, in turn, are not equipped to carry out the enforcement of these rules without the assistance and cooperation of the students.

It would seem far preferable for the rules to be enforced and infractions punished by the students themselves through a body which is sufficiently detached to punish infractions by the constituent members. The Interfraternity Council occupies this position and in years past, with the approval of the University Administrative officers, has undertaken to enforce rules of conduct and to punish infractions of them. It, therefore, seems logical that this body now be made responsible and that each fraternity, through its officers, be, in turn, responsible to the Council.

The suggested changes in the rules which have been outlined above are embodied in a set of suggested rules prepared by a committee of this Association and submitted to the Interfraternity Council for its approval.

The Association has further suggested to the Interfraternity Council that it be strengthened and its prestige increased by amending its Constitution to require that the representative of each fraternity to the Interfraternity Council be the President of such fraternity.

Much thought has been given to the rules governing conduct in fraternity houses. We feel that the suggested changes are reasonable and that the rules with these changes will be enforceable.

Mr. J. H. Newman, Dean of Students, was asked to express his views regarding proposals of the Interfraternity Council. He was asked by Mr. Gay to summarize the reaction of the fraternities to the regulations passed by the Board.

Mr. Newman reported that he had sent to each fraternity an official notice of the Board's action. All but four fraternities replied that the rules had been read and explained to their members and that they realized the new rules were a part of the governing rules and regulations of the University.

Dean Newman stated that in his opinion the suggested modifications were quite reasonable. He said that there might be some administrative difficulties in enforcing the exception of mothers and sisters in the application of the rules, but that he believed it advisable to accept these modifications. He suggested that the rules be relaxed in any house which employs a housemother.

The President stated that he believed that the action taken by the Board at this meeting would determine the future administration of the University.

The President stated he believed that if the newly constituted IFC is willing to work with the administration, the proposals of the IFC will work. He suggested that the Board refer to the President the proposed modifications of the rules, and that he confer with the newly reorganized IFC to see if they are willing to enforce the rules of the Board. Judge Barksdale moved the adoption of the following resolution, which was unanimously adopted:

RESOLVED that the Interfraternity Council and the University of Virginia Fraternity Advisors Association be thanked for their proposals and that these proposals be referred to the administration for study and recommendations for action by the Board at its next meeting.

Dean Newman was recalled and asked what he thought would be the effect on the student body of the adoption of the above resolution. He stated that he believed it was an excellent proposal and was far better than the Board's modifying at this time the resolutions passed at the last meeting.

A communication from the Student Council, proposing regulations governing student conduct which they are willing to enforce, was presented.

In view of the present situation and the fact that representatives of the fraternities are appearing before the Board on Friday, we thought it best that you be informed in some manner of the desired plans of the Student Council.

Attached is a rather rough draft of the plans which we wished to discuss with you next week. We felt that possibly these plans might have some effect on the Board's decisions.

As this is the only copy of the plan, we would appreciate its return to us.

The Student Council on behalf of the students formally protests the recent action of the Board of Visitors in forcing a group of rules upon the student body without consultation with the students.

It has been rumored that the Student Council is to be responsible for the enforcement of these rules and for the punishment of infractions. The Student Council wishes to inform the students and the administration that it has no intention of enforcing any rules in the framing of which it has had no voice. The Student Council is willing to accept the responsibility for student government if the rules to be enforced are promulgated by the Student Council in cooperation with the administration and the student groups concerned.

(The following was written in longhand:)

This letter was written primarily to let the students know our position at this time.

WHEREAS the STUDENT COUNCIL of the University of Virginia, being the duly elected representatives of the Student Body, has, by unanimous vote, gone on record as desiring to administer the discipline of the University, with the cooperation of the Administration it is hereby set forth the terms under which such a system is acceptable, and the details of such a plan for consideration:

PART ONE: The Student Council has no desire to become involved in the enforcement of any rules or regulation in which it did not have an active, or consultory part in formulating. As the elected representatives of the students, the first duty of the council is to the students, and the council cannot accept any rules that are contrary to the best interests of the students or will in any way destroy the principles of self-government. However, the Council realizes the need for improvement in several phases of student conduct and is prepared to take immediate steps to rectify these defects. The attached plans, which are a part of an overall plan, are the plans acceptable to the council, and we feel will be acceptable to the students themselves. If satisfactory to both, the success of these plans is relatively assured and the desired changes will be effected that the Rector, Visitors, and Administration has in mind. They represent an attempt on the part of the council to fact the issue squarely and to correct any deficiencies that may exist, without causing the destruction of self-government and the loss of confidence of the student body in the council and in the administration.

PART TWO: The council firmly believes that any plan for regulation of Student conduct should emanate from the council and be submitted to the proper authorities for approval. The council further states that the FINAL and ABSOLUTE control over the administration of any plans for improved conduct should reside with the council and not be in any part lodged with any other agent or agency of the Administration or college.

PART THREE: To begin with the council feels that the problem of student conduct belongs to the council in all cases of student conduct regardless of social affiliations, etc. With this in mind the council plans that the INTERFRATERNITY COUNCIL be a subordinate body to the council to work with the council as outlined in one of the attachments.

PART FOUR: Attached to this sheet are enclosures that will partly explain how the council contemplates the overall organization of this plan; how to deal with all students in general; and how to deal with the fraternity "problem."

PART FIVE: It is to be realized that this prospectus is the work of many individuals and a great deal of careful study and thought. It is by no means the final draft, but it is essentially what this council believes will correct the deficiencies and at the same time not bring about absolute government by administration at this institution. Above all, these plans WILL WORK which is a merit that cannot be attributed to all rules and regulations that can be promulgated.

1\. It is not the intent of this plan to set up a "police" system at the University but rather it is designed to protect the individual student and to protect and preserve the reputation of the University.

2\. It is contemplated that we have a group of men to be known as "groundsmen" who will be agents necessary to insure the success of this plan.

3\. The number of groundsmen may change after experiment but it is believed that to begin with the administration of the University should furnish six (6) men.

4\. The duties of these groundsmen shall be as set down by the council. They will be full-time employees of the University and their specific hours of use shall be determined at a later date. However, it is known that they will be used daily.

THESE GROUNDSMEN WILL:

a. Enforce the general rule that is the primary purpose of the overall plan, to wit: Prevent any actions that reflect discredit on the University or conduct that is unbecoming a gentleman and student of this University.

also to achieve goals desired by the administration b. The student council may from time to time, as it sees necessary, issue other rules or regulations for the groundsmen to enforce to fit the occasion.

also to achieve goals desired by the administration

c. Violations of the general rule, or specific rules laid down by the council will be reported to the council for disciplinary action subject to part "d" below.

d. The groundsmen shall be accorded discretion as to what offenses are serious enough to warrant a report. They will be thoroughly instructed in this matter by the council.

5\. The council shall have ORIGINAL judicial jurisdiction in all cases that arises and the defendant has the right of appeal to the administrative organs of the University if he so desires.

6\. The main issue on which the success of this plan will hinge is that the Student Council shall have ABSOLUTE and FINAL CONTROL over the GROUNDSMEN, THEIR DUTIES, THE RULES THEY WILL ENFORCE, AND THE JUDICIAL ACTION THAT FOLLOWS ARRAIGNMENT OF OFFENDERS. If the council is not accorded these things it is in no position to attempt to put the plan in at all.

(On a separate sheet was the following:)

5\. The Student Council feels that these rules will rectify whatever activities may have occurred to cause the recent action by the Visitors and requests that these be approved by the Visitors. If this is done the Council WILL ENFORCE THESE RULES. Further, there follows in the next paragraph how this enforcement will be done and it is further illustrated on the attached diagram.

6\. It is the intention of the council to have the Interfraternity Council as a subordinate body to work under the council in dealing with problems that arise concerning fraternities. Under our plan the fraternities will undertake the enforcement of these rules themselves and violations will be judged by the Interfraternity Council. HOWEVER, any and all action taken by the IFC shall be subject to review by the council. Or, rather than subject to review, it WILL be reviewed and wherever the punishment if any is felt to be too lenient or harsh as the case may be it will be readjudged by the Student Council.

7\. The groundsmen will not be called upon by the council to ever enter fraternity houses unless there is a disturbance that warrants such an investigation. Rather, the groundsman will report to the council any irregularities that he observes and the council will order the house concerned to appear before the IFC for a hearing. The IFC will then deal with the house as a whole with the action reviewed by the Student Council. In the case of individuals involved they will be attended to by the Student Council just as any other student under the groundsmen plan. This will enable the council to keep control over all student conduct wherever it may be and will establish the IFC as a subordinate organ accountable to the Student Council for its actions.

8\. It is earnestly believed by this council that this plan will rectify any and all undesirable incidents that may have a tendency to occur.

Mr. Gay expressed the view that the statement of the Student Council should be answered. Whereupon the following resolution was unanimously adopted:

BE IT RESOLVED that the communication received from the Student Council be returned to it with the following statement: that the Board of Visitors will not consider any communication addressed to it which has been previously given to the press.

The President presented a letter which he had received from the Memphis Alumni Association.

At a meeting of the Memphis Chapter of the University of Virginia Alumni Association, the action of the Visitors in undertaking to codify and set up specific rules to regulate the gentlemanly behavior of the Student Body was considered.

I, as the President, was directed to address this communication to the Visitors setting forth the views of the Memphis Chapter unanimously expressed as follows:

I. We feel that it would be unfortunate indeed to take away from the Student Body or in any way impair the long standing and traditional prerogatives of that Body to establish and to administer its own code of gentlemanly behavior. We believe that any current difficulties could and will be righted by the Student Governing Body.

II. We feel keenly the inappropriateness and the damage done to the University by the publicity given to the resolution of December 9th.

The Memphis Chapter, as one of the largest Chapters in the Country and the Sponsoring Chapter of more than sixty Memphis Students now at the University is prompted to this action by our pride in and our devotion to those distinctive attributes which until now have always set the University apart from and above any other institution of learning.

The President was asked to reply to this letter, giving some historical background of the case.

A letter from Mr. John D. Haxall, President of the Sigma Phi Epsilon Fraternity, was presented.

In view of the recent regulations passed by you concerning this chapter, it is requested that you reconsider part of section three of your resolution. The part in question states, "That the four members of the SPE fraternity directly involved or who had knowledge of the occurrence be prohibited from living in the SPE house . . ."

It is the feeling of this chapter that to permit this regulation to go unquestioned would be a betrayal of fraternal ideals which make our organization meaningful to us.

To us, this request has deeper implications than the casual reader may observe, for without the sincere spirit of brotherhood, any fraternity would soon become a meaningless gathering of people. We feel confident that you will consider this matter in the spirit in which we make this request.

The following resolution was adopted, Mr. Mears casting the only negative vote:

RESOLVED that an appeal of the Sigma Phi Epsilon Fraternity for a reconsideration of a part of a resolution passed at the December 12, 1947 meeting of the Board, to wit: "that the four members of the SPE Fraternity directly involved or who had knowledge of the occurrence be prohibited from living in the SPE house . . ." be denied.

The Buildings and Grounds Committee reported that the house on East Range formerly occupied by Mr. E. I. Carruthers had been assigned to Dr. C. S. Lentz.

Mr. Anderson reported that the total collections of the Development Fund had passed the $400,000 mark.

He presented the proposed changes in the objectives of the University of Virginia Development Fund, which were unanimously adopted. These changes are as follows:

The reading has been changed from "The costs are $300,000 for estimated construction, $200,000 for equipment and initial operation; a total of $500,000." - to read "The estimated need for building, endowment, and equipment is $500,000."

Has been changed from "For supplementary faculty salaries, an endowment fund of at least $5,000,000, to be sought over a 20-year period, is now projected. For the first year's needs the amount is one-twentieth, or $250,000." - to read "For the first year of a long-term period it is proposed to utilize gifts totaling $250,000 to supplement faculty salaries."

The change is from "For the University Press there is needed $500,000." - to "To establish the Press will require a $500,000 endowment."

Mr. Anderson pointed out that the Board should make some decision as to who will handle money raised by the Development Fund.

Mr. Gay stated that he had talked to Mr. Robert B. Tunstall, a member of the Alumni Board of Trustees, who told him that the Alumni Board of Trustees was not equipped to handle funds to be expended for buildings - that the Alumni Board of Trustees was organized to invest funds and that he did not believe moneys raised by the Development Fund should be turned over to the Alumni Board of Trustees.

Mr. Black offered the following resolution:

BE IT RESOLVED, that the language of that part of Part II of the original report of the Committee appointed by Chairman Halsey as revised and submitted to the Board of Visitors as the recommendations of the Executive Committee in this respect, and as spread upon the minutes of the meeting of November 14, 1947, be revised to conform to the language of the report as originally drafted and submitted by such Special Committee, when further revised so as to confer upon the Board of Visitors final authority in determining the disposition of the principal and/or income from funds donated to the Development Fund, in respect to which the donors shall have given no specific direction as to use, such report, when so revised, to read as follows:

The undersigned Committee, appointed by Chairman Halsey at the meeting of the Executive Committee held September 11, 1947, to investigate and report upon the best method to be employed in the handling and administration of funds obtained through the efforts of the Development Fund Campaign, respectfully advises as follows:

I. The Committee is unanimously of opinion that the Alumni Association of the University of Virginia is presently without power to constitute a new and separate Board of Trustees to hold and administer funds that may now be obtaining through the efforts of the Development Fund Campaign. Its reasons for entertaining this view are as follows:

The Society of Alumni of the University of Virginia was incorporated by an Act of the General Assembly of this State, adopted February 6, 1873. By an amendment approved March 7, 1903, the name of the Society was changed to the General Alumni Association of the University of Virginia. By Section Seven of this Act, the Association was given "power to raise an endowment fund for the use and benefit of the University, to be held by the Treasurer of the State, in Virginia registered century bonds, and all funds belonging to said Association in excess of $1,000, and all those donated for the purpose of building a public hall, shall be similarly invested and only disposed of as they may be deemed for the purposes of the Association or the University." By Section Eight of the Act the Association was given power to receive and hold property and donations passing by grant, conveyance, demise or bequest, "under the general powers of endowment created in the Seventh Section of this Act . . ."

It is thus seen that under the charter of the Association at that time in effect any endowment fund raised by it for the use and benefit of the University had to be held by "the Treasurer of the State, in Virginia registered century bonds." Your Committee is informed that when the Association interested itself in the raising of an endowment in 1907 and 1908 at least one large donor refused to give funds which would be subject to the political control of the State of Virginia. The aforementioned sections Seven and Eight of the charter of the Association were therefore amended as of December 5, 1907, so as to authorize the Association to appoint by deed of trust a Board of seven Trustees, to be known and designated as "The Alumni Board of Trustees of the University of Virginia Endowment Fund." It was provided that this "Board and its successors shall be perpetual and its duties, powers, rights, privileges and responsibilities shall be irrevocable, to hold, manage, invest and expend the funds now raised, or hereafter to be raised, or any gift or grant heretofore or hereafter made to the General Alumni Association for the use and benefit of the University of Virginia under the terms of this charter and the provisions of said deed of trust herein authorized to be executed, which deed shall define the duties, powers, rights, privileges and responsibilities of said Board."

Pursuant to the foregoing provisions of the charter of the Association, as amended, it executed on February 15, 1908, a deed to Joseph Bryan, Thomas Nelson Page, Thomas F. Ryan, Alexander P. Humphrey, Charles J. Faulkner and Williamson W. Fuller, and Edwin A. Alderman, President of the University of Virginia, ex officio, Trustees, to be known as "The Alumni Board of Trustees of the University of Virginia Endowment Fund" transferring and conveying "all gifts, funds, moneys, investments or subscriptions now made or which may hereafter be made, to the said Trustees for the use and benefit of the University of Virginia," together with "all such grants, gifts, funds, moneys, investments, interest, credit, bonds, notes, or subscriptions that may hereafter be made of every character or description whatsoever, including income, revenues, issues and profits thereof, either directly to the Trustees, parties of the second part, or to this Association for the benefit of the University of Virginia."

While the charter of the Association has since three times been amended, on August 4, 1922, January 24, 1929 and September 9, 1933, the rights, powers and duties of the Trustees and their successors, appointed by the aforesaid deed of trust of February 15, 1908, have been fully preserved, it having been expressly provided in the amendment of September 9, 1933, that -

"It (the Alumni Board) shall hold, manage, invest and expend, the funds raised or hereafter to be raised, or any gifts or grants heretofore or hereafter made by will, deed or otherwise, to it, or to the Alumni Association for the use and benefit of the said Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia under the terms of this charter."

It seems to your Committee, therefore, that title to any funds presently solicited by, or obtained as a result of the efforts of the Alumni Association of the University of Virginia would necessarily pass to "The Alumni Board of Trustees of the University of Virginia Endowment Fund" created by the deed of February 15, 1908, and their successors presently in office. The execution of a further or additional deed of trust at this time, whereby a new board of trustees would be created for the purpose of receiving title to, possession and control of funds likely to be raised in the present campaign would not, therefore, in the opinion of the Committee, be presently within the power of the Association.

II. In this situation a majority of your Committee, Messrs. Scott and Hildreth, are of opinion that a new non-profit, non-stock corporation should be organized under the provisions of Chapter 151 of the Code of Virginia, to be designated as "The University of Virginia Development Fund," that there be seven Trustees presently selected and named to manage the affairs and investments of the corporation, and that the President of the University be at all times, ex officio, a Trustee of the corporation; that the first seven Trustees be selected by this Executive Committee to serve for terms of one to seven years, respectively, the term of each Trustee to be determined by lot after their selection by the Executive Committee; that no Trustee drawing a term of more than three years shall be eligible for re-election but that any Trustee drawing a term of three years or less shall be eligible for election for one additional term of seven years; that the first seven Trustees be selected without reference to their respective ages, but that all successor Trustees shall be of the age of 57 years or less, so that upon the expiration of their respective seven year terms of service they would have attained an age of not to exceed 65 years; that all successor Trustees be nominated by a majority vote of the Trustees then in office, such nominations to receive the approval of the majority of the Board of Managers of the Alumni Association of the University of Virginia in attendance upon any meeting at which the selection of a successor Trustee shall come before the Board of Managers for consideration and action, that for each vacancy the Trustees then in office shall nominate three persons, one of whom shall be selected by the Board of Managers in the manner stated; that the charter of the corporation provide that all securities held by it shall be placed in the possession, as custodian, of some trust company or bank having trust powers, organized under the laws of the State of Virginia and/or of the United States and doing business in Virginia, with capital, surplus and undivided profits of not less than $2,000,000.00, and that the corporation may in its discretion employ the services of some corporation or individual, or duly accredited officer of the University, as investment counsel; that the corporation shall apply faithfully the principal and/or any income from any gifts or grants to the objects or purposes designated by the donor or grantor, but when no direction, condition or limitation is attached to such gifts or grants, the corporation shall hold the same with full power to invest and reinvest such principal and/or income in accordance with the discretion of its Trustees who shall employ and apply such principal and/or income to the needs of the University of Virginia after full conference with the President, Rector and Visitors of the University, and upon agreement with them as to the expenditure of all or a part of such principal and/or income, the corporation shall pay the same, or the part as to which an agreement has been reached, to the Bursar of the University, to be expended as agreed upon, but in the absence of any such agreement, all such principal and/or income shall be paid over to the Bursar to be expended as the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia may direct; that the corporation, acting through its Board of Trustees, shall have the broadest investment discretion and special care should be taken in the preparation of its charter to see that its powers are expressed in terms in conformity with modern investment practice.

If such development fund corporation is organized, Mr. Gay concurs in the statements in this report as to the manner of its creation, the selection of its director-trustees and the manner in which they and the corporation shall function, but reserves for further consideration any expression of opinion upon the question whether, in the over-all interest of the University, it is wise and expedient to create at this time a new agency for holding and administering funds procured through the conduct of the campaign presently being undertaken.

After full consideration and discussion the foregoing motion was adopted, Mr. Garnett casting the only negative vote.

There being no further business to come before the meeting, the same was adjourned after a motion to that effect had been made, seconded, and carried.

The Finance Committee respectfully represents that it has received a schedule of the estate held by the Safe Deposit and Trust Company of Baltimore, Trustee, under Item 6 of the will of Evelyn M. B. Tiffany, showing the estate on hand June 22, 1947 which was the date of the death of Florence B. B. Turlington, the changes which have since taken place, the proposed partial distribution to the University of Virginia, and the balance of estate retained by the trustee to provide for the remaining annuities; that your committee has carefully considered this proposed distribution and approves of it in every respect. In addition, there was exhibited to the committee by W. Allan Perkins, attorney for the University, the form of receipt which the trustee in this trust, the Safe Deposit and Trust Company of Baltimore, desired the President of the University to execute in return for delivery to him of the securities proposed to be distributed to the University, and that this form of receipt has been approved by your committee.

There is attached hereto the schedule above referred to and the form of receipt approved.

TURLINGTON, THE CHANGES WHICH HAVE SINCE TAKEN PLACE, THE PARTIAL DISTRIBUTION TO THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA AND THE BALANCE OF ESTATE RETAINED BY THE TRUSTEE TO PROVIDE FOR THE REMAINING ANNUITIES.

KNOW ALL MEN BY THESE PRESENTS: That whereas by Item Sixth of the Last Will and Testament of Evelyn May Bayly Tiffany, which Will was duly probated in the Orphans' Court of Baltimore City and is of record in the Office of the Register of Wills of said City in "Wills" Liber E.R.D. 164, folio 331, she gave to the Safe Deposit and Trust Company of Baltimore upon trust so much of her estate as might be necessary, in its opinion, to provide for the payment of the following annuities over and above all taxes (excepting income taxes) and other charges against said fund, which annuities she directed said Trustee to pay in quarterly installments, accounting from the date of her death during the life of each annuitant, apportioning same to the date of the respective deaths of said annuitants, viz:

and said Will provided upon the death of each of said annuitants, other than Florence B. B. Turlington, the annuity payable to the said annuitant so dying should be paid to the said Florence B. B. Turlington during her life, so that her annuity of $2,000. should be increased from time to time by the amount paid to the annuitants predeceasing her, and said Will further provided that if the said Florence B. B. Turlington should survive all of the other annuitants, then upon her death, the trust fund should fall into the residue of the testatrix's estate, but should she die during the life of any of said annuitants, then there should pass into the residue of the Testatrix's estate, upon the death of any annuitant, including the said Florence B. B. Turlington, so much of the principal of the trust fund as might be estimated by said Trustee to have produced the annuity paid to the annuitant so dying; and

WHEREAS by Item Seventh of said Will, the Testatrix devised and bequeathed the residue of her estate to the undersigned, with the request that it use the income for the support of Fellowships for persons from Northampton and Accomac Counties - said Fellowships to be known as "The Thomas Henry Bayly Fellowships" and "The Evelyn and Louis McLane Tiffany Fellowships" and to be in Academic, Law and Medical Schools, and should there at any time be any vacancies in said Fellowships not availed of by persons from either of said Counties in Virginia, they may be awarded to persons from other portions of Virginia, or from the State of Maryland; and

WHEREAS the said Florence B. B. Turlington died June 22, 1947, and the following annuitants who had received the following annuities, predeceased her, viz:

so that at the time of her death, the said Florence B. B. Turlington was receiving a total annuity of $6,000.; and

WHEREAS by reason of the death of the said Florence B. B. Turlington, it is now possible for the Trustee to make a distribution of a portion of the assets of said trust estate, after reserving sufficient which, in its opinion, will produce income sufficient to pay the remaining annuities; and

WHEREAS there has been submitted to and approved by the undersigned, a schedule showing the assets of the trust estate in the hands of said Trustee as of June 22, 1947, the date of death of the said Florence B. B. Turlington, the changes since, the retention of certain securities, the income from which is to be used in paying the remaining annuities, and the distribution of the balance of the estate to the undersigned; and

WHEREAS, as shown by said schedule, there were distributed to the undersigned on account of said trust estate, the following securities, viz:

which securities said Trustee has transferred and delivered to the undersigned, the receipt of which it doth hereby admit and acknowledge, and agrees to use the same in accordance with the provisions of the Will of said Testatrix above set forth; and in consideration thereof, it doth hereby Release, Acquit, Exonerate and Discharge the said Safe Deposit and Trust Company of Baltimore and its successors of and from all and every action, suit, claim, or demand which could or might possibly be brought exhibited or prosecuted against it, them, or any of them, for or on account of said securities or the payment thereof, hereby declaring itself fully satisfied, contented and paid as above specified.

IN TESTIMONY WHEREOF, the said body corporate hath caused this Release to be subscribed by the President thereof, and its corporate seal to be hereto affixed, this \_\_\_ day of \_\_\_\_\_, nineteen hundred and forty-eight.

The Inter-fraternity Council of the University of Virginia respectfully represents unto The Rector and Visitors, the following:

(1) That the Inter-fraternity Council is a voluntary association of the Greek Letter social fraternities of the University deriving its authority under and by virtue of a constitution adopted by the Greek Letter social fraternities and approved by the Dean of the University, a copy of which is now, and has been for several years past, on file in the Dean's office. A copy is also hereto attached;

(2) That Article III, Sections 1-7 of said constitution cover the powers granted to Your Petitioner or its Governing Board to control the Greek Letter social fraternities at the University, and, more specifically, to act upon cases that involve the breaking of rules governing conduct in fraternity houses;

(3) That in view of the fact that said constitution had been approved by the Dean of the University, Your Petitioner believed it was its duty to make and enforce rules governing conduct in fraternity houses, the actions of Your Petitioner, in this regard, being subject, of course, to the approval of the Administrative officers of the University and of the Rector and Visitors;

(4) That Your Petitioner recognizes the necessity of proper rules governing conduct in fraternity houses, and it is the earnest desire of Your Petitioner that proper rules be adopted to assure such conduct;

(5) Your Petitioner respectfully calls to the attention of The Rector and Visitors that the rules governing conduct in fraternity houses approved by resolution of the Board on the 12th day of December, 1947, places the duty of enforcing such rules, not upon Your Petitioner who has the power and authority by virtue of its constitution, to enforce such rules and to punish infractions thereof, but upon the officers of each fraternity who are in no position to punish infractions of such rules. This will result, in Your Petitioner's opinion, in the burden of enforcement falling upon the administrative officers of the University.

Your Petitioner further is of the opinion that the only practical and satisfactory method of enforcement of rules of conduct in fraternity houses is by self government and not through action by the administrative officers of the University and that it will constitute a step backward in student self government to take away from Your Petitioner its jurisdiction in this regard.

(6) It is further the earnest desire of Your Petitioner that rules of conduct be established that will constitute standard rules which in the main will remain unchanged from year to year and which will be susceptible of enforcement.

(7) Your Petitioner, while it realizes that The Rector and Visitors has already given careful thought and consideration to the question, believes that the Board did not have before it all of the necessary facts having to do with enforcement of rules of conduct in the past, and that the Board possibly did not foresee the unfortunate consequences that may occur as a result of the rules in their present form.

Your Petitioner therefore requests that the Board reconsider its previous action in regard to such rules of conduct and that Your Petitioner be granted the privilege of presenting to the Board its views upon jurisdiction to enforce rules of conduct and upon modification of the present rules.

The Fraternity Advisors Association, organized in September of 1947, presents its respects to the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia.

The Association was organized for the main purposes of cooperating with the University Administration and the fraternities on matters of common interest to both and, acting as a group rather than only as individuals, in advising the fraternities on matters of proper interest to all of them. The Association is composed of University Alumni, residents of Charlottesville and Albemarle County, who are members of the faculty, professional and business men, of mature age and experience. There is one representative for each fraternity and a few alternates.

We have studied with care the rules adopted by the Board on December 12, 1947, dealing specifically with visiting hours for ladies in fraternity houses. We have discussed their effect with representative undergraduates and have arrived at grave doubts as to their workability in some respects, under present conditions. On this account we beg to submit some observations and conclusions on this subject.

The provisions of section (3) and (4) of the rules as previously adopted fail to take into consideration the case of mother, wife, or sister of a member. It would seem proper that a mother, wife, or sister of a member should be allowed to visit a fraternity house at hours other than those specifically allowed, provided, of course, she is accompanied by such member.

A number of the fraternities, due to the high cost of food and the lack of a sufficient number of suitable eating places are serving meals. Colored women are employed as servants. To apply the rules as they presently exist to such servants seems unnecessary and certainly not within the real meaning of the rules.

It is therefore suggested that mothers, wives, and sisters of members, when accompanied by such member be excepted from the application of the rules and that domestic servants be excepted.

The provisions of section (5) limits the presence of women in fraternity houses to 1:00 a.m. provided chaperons approved by the Dean of Students are present. This provision fails to take into consideration the fact that some of the authorized University dances are not over until after 1:00 a.m. and that some of them may be held on nights other than Friday or Saturday. The girls from college and boarding schools who are permitted to attend these dances are allowed by their school authorities one hour after the dance ends in which to reach the place where they are staying. It would seem preferable that the girls who attend the University dances have a place to go with their escorts which will be under proper chaperonage rather than be left to the uncertainties of unchaperoned parked cars, road houses and tourist camps. It is therefore suggested that the rule limiting the time to 1:00 a.m. be slightly relaxed on nights of authorized University dances to include one hour after the dance ends, provided the Administration is assured that proper chaperonage will be maintained.

The provisions of Section (5) further limit the 1:00 a.m. time to Fridays and Saturdays.

It is pointed out that there are official University holidays such as Founders Day, Thanksgiving Day, etc., which do not necessarily fall upon a Friday or Saturday and that it would seem proper that members of a fraternity could entertain on such a holiday or upon the night preceding such a holiday. It is therefore suggested that Section (5) be further slightly modified to take care of such eventualities and for others that cannot now be foreseen by providing that on special occasions, upon application made to the Dean of Students, at least twenty-four (24) hours in advance, the Dean may extend the night hours until 1:00 a.m., provided proper chaperonage is maintained.

Section (6) provides that the officers of each fraternity shall be held responsible for enforcing the rules.

It is submitted that, with the best of intentions, the officers of a fraternity are in no position to punish any infraction of the rules and that they would have no recourse but to report infractions to the Administrative authorities. This puts these officers in an impossible position, making policemen of them for the benefit of the Administrative authorities. Such a course of action has never worked satisfactorily in any school or college and will not do so now. In the final analysis the burden of enforcement as well as of punishment will fall upon the Administrative officers of the University who, in turn, are not equipped to carry out the enforcement of these rules without the assistance and cooperation of the students.

It would seem far preferable for the rules to be enforced and infractions punished by the students themselves through a body which is sufficiently detached to punish infractions by the constituent members. The Interfraternity Council occupies this position and in years past, with the approval of the University Administrative officers, has undertaken to enforce rules of conduct and to punish infractions of them. It, therefore, seems logical that this body now be made responsible and that each fraternity, through its officers, be, in turn, responsible to the Council.

The suggested changes in the rules which have been outlined above are embodied in a set of suggested rules prepared by a committee of this Association and submitted to the Interfraternity Council for its approval.

The Association has further suggested to the Interfraternity Council that it be strengthened and its prestige increased by amending its Constitution to require that the representative of each fraternity to the Interfraternity Council be the President of such fraternity.

Much thought has been given to the rules governing conduct in fraternity houses. We feel that the suggested changes are reasonable and that the rules with these changes will be enforceable.

In view of the present situation and the fact that representatives of the fraternities are appearing before the Board on Friday, we thought it best that you be informed in some manner of the desired plans of the Student Council.

Attached is a rather rough draft of the plans which we wished to discuss with you next week. We felt that possibly these plans might have some effect on the Board's decisions.

As this is the only copy of the plan, we would appreciate its return to us.

The Student Council on behalf of the students formally protests the recent action of the Board of Visitors in forcing a group of rules upon the student body without consultation with the students.

It has been rumored that the Student Council is to be responsible for the enforcement of these rules and for the punishment of infractions. The Student Council wishes to inform the students and the administration that it has no intention of enforcing any rules in the framing of which it has had no voice. The Student Council is willing to accept the responsibility for student government if the rules to be enforced are promulgated by the Student Council in cooperation with the administration and the student groups concerned.

At a meeting of the Memphis Chapter of the University of Virginia Alumni Association, the action of the Visitors in undertaking to codify and set up specific rules to regulate the gentlemanly behavior of the Student Body was considered.

I, as the President, was directed to address this communication to the Visitors setting forth the views of the Memphis Chapter unanimously expressed as follows:

I. We feel that it would be unfortunate indeed to take away from the Student Body or in any way impair the long standing and traditional prerogatives of that Body to establish and to administer its own code of gentlemanly behavior. We believe that any current difficulties could and will be righted by the Student Governing Body.

II. We feel keenly the inappropriateness and the damage done to the University by the publicity given to the resolution of December 9th.

The Memphis Chapter, as one of the largest Chapters in the Country and the Sponsoring Chapter of more than sixty Memphis Students now at the University is prompted to this action by our pride in and our devotion to those distinctive attributes which until now have always set the University apart from and above any other institution of learning.

In view of the recent regulations passed by you concerning this chapter, it is requested that you reconsider part of section three of your resolution. The part in question states, "That the four members of the SPE fraternity directly involved or who had knowledge of the occurrence be prohibited from living in the SPE house . . ."

It is the feeling of this chapter that to permit this regulation to go unquestioned would be a betrayal of fraternal ideals which make our organization meaningful to us.

To us, this request has deeper implications than the casual reader may observe, for without the sincere spirit of brotherhood, any fraternity would soon become a meaningless gathering of people. We feel confident that you will consider this matter in the spirit in which we make this request.

The undersigned Committee, appointed by Chairman Halsey at the meeting of the Executive Committee held September 11, 1947, to investigate and report upon the best method to be employed in the handling and administration of funds obtained through the efforts of the Development Fund Campaign, respectfully advises as follows:

I. The Committee is unanimously of opinion that the Alumni Association of the University of Virginia is presently without power to constitute a new and separate Board of Trustees to hold and administer funds that may now be obtaining through the efforts of the Development Fund Campaign. Its reasons for entertaining this view are as follows:

The Society of Alumni of the University of Virginia was incorporated by an Act of the General Assembly of this State, adopted February 6, 1873. By an amendment approved March 7, 1903, the name of the Society was changed to the General Alumni Association of the University of Virginia. By Section Seven of this Act, the Association was given "power to raise an endowment fund for the use and benefit of the University, to be held by the Treasurer of the State, in Virginia registered century bonds, and all funds belonging to said Association in excess of $1,000, and all those donated for the purpose of building a public hall, shall be similarly invested and only disposed of as they may be deemed for the purposes of the Association or the University." By Section Eight of the Act the Association was given power to receive and hold property and donations passing by grant, conveyance, demise or bequest, "under the general powers of endowment created in the Seventh Section of this Act . . ."

It is thus seen that under the charter of the Association at that time in effect any endowment fund raised by it for the use and benefit of the University had to be held by "the Treasurer of the State, in Virginia registered century bonds." Your Committee is informed that when the Association interested itself in the raising of an endowment in 1907 and 1908 at least one large donor refused to give funds which would be subject to the political control of the State of Virginia. The aforementioned sections Seven and Eight of the charter of the Association were therefore amended as of December 5, 1907, so as to authorize the Association to appoint by deed of trust a Board of seven Trustees, to be known and designated as "The Alumni Board of Trustees of the University of Virginia Endowment Fund." It was provided that this "Board and its successors shall be perpetual and its duties, powers, rights, privileges and responsibilities shall be irrevocable, to hold, manage, invest and expend the funds now raised, or hereafter to be raised, or any gift or grant heretofore or hereafter made to the General Alumni Association for the use and benefit of the University of Virginia under the terms of this charter and the provisions of said deed of trust herein authorized to be executed, which deed shall define the duties, powers, rights, privileges and responsibilities of said Board."

Pursuant to the foregoing provisions of the charter of the Association, as amended, it executed on February 15, 1908, a deed to Joseph Bryan, Thomas Nelson Page, Thomas F. Ryan, Alexander P. Humphrey, Charles J. Faulkner and Williamson W. Fuller, and Edwin A. Alderman, President of the University of Virginia, ex officio, Trustees, to be known as "The Alumni Board of Trustees of the University of Virginia Endowment Fund" transferring and conveying "all gifts, funds, moneys, investments or subscriptions now made or which may hereafter be made, to the said Trustees for the use and benefit of the University of Virginia," together with "all such grants, gifts, funds, moneys, investments, interest, credit, bonds, notes, or subscriptions that may hereafter be made of every character or description whatsoever, including income, revenues, issues and profits thereof, either directly to the Trustees, parties of the second part, or to this Association for the benefit of the University of Virginia."

While the charter of the Association has since three times been amended, on August 4, 1922, January 24, 1929 and September 9, 1933, the rights, powers and duties of the Trustees and their successors, appointed by the aforesaid deed of trust of February 15, 1908, have been fully preserved, it having been expressly provided in the amendment of September 9, 1933, that -

"It (the Alumni Board) shall hold, manage, invest and expend, the funds raised or hereafter to be raised, or any gifts or grants heretofore or hereafter made by will, deed or otherwise, to it, or to the Alumni Association for the use and benefit of the said Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia under the terms of this charter."

It seems to your Committee, therefore, that title to any funds presently solicited by, or obtained as a result of the efforts of the Alumni Association of the University of Virginia would necessarily pass to "The Alumni Board of Trustees of the University of Virginia Endowment Fund" created by the deed of February 15, 1908, and their successors presently in office. The execution of a further or additional deed of trust at this time, whereby a new board of trustees would be created for the purpose of receiving title to, possession and control of funds likely to be raised in the present campaign would not, therefore, in the opinion of the Committee, be presently within the power of the Association.

II. In this situation a majority of your Committee, Messrs. Scott and Hildreth, are of opinion that a new non-profit, non-stock corporation should be organized under the provisions of Chapter 151 of the Code of Virginia, to be designated as "The University of Virginia Development Fund," that there be seven Trustees presently selected and named to manage the affairs and investments of the corporation, and that the President of the University be at all times, ex officio, a Trustee of the corporation; that the first seven Trustees be selected by this Executive Committee to serve for terms of one to seven years, respectively, the term of each Trustee to be determined by lot after their selection by the Executive Committee; that no Trustee drawing a term of more than three years shall be eligible for re-election but that any Trustee drawing a term of three years or less shall be eligible for election for one additional term of seven years; that the first seven Trustees be selected without reference to their respective ages, but that all successor Trustees shall be of the age of 57 years or less, so that upon the expiration of their respective seven year terms of service they would have attained an age of not to exceed 65 years; that all successor Trustees be nominated by a majority vote of the Trustees then in office, such nominations to receive the approval of the majority of the Board of Managers of the Alumni Association of the University of Virginia in attendance upon any meeting at which the selection of a successor Trustee shall come before the Board of Managers for consideration and action, that for each vacancy the Trustees then in office shall nominate three persons, one of whom shall be selected by the Board of Managers in the manner stated; that the charter of the corporation provide that all securities held by it shall be placed in the possession, as custodian, of some trust company or bank having trust powers, organized under the laws of the State of Virginia and/or of the United States and doing business in Virginia, with capital, surplus and undivided profits of not less than $2,000,000.00, and that the corporation may in its discretion employ the services of some corporation or individual, or duly accredited officer of the University, as investment counsel; that the corporation shall apply faithfully the principal and/or any income from any gifts or grants to the objects or purposes designated by the donor or grantor, but when no direction, condition or limitation is attached to such gifts or grants, the corporation shall hold the same with full power to invest and reinvest such principal and/or income in accordance with the discretion of its Trustees who shall employ and apply such principal and/or income to the needs of the University of Virginia after full conference with the President, Rector and Visitors of the University, and upon agreement with them as to the expenditure of all or a part of such principal and/or income, the corporation shall pay the same, or the part as to which an agreement has been reached, to the Bursar of the University, to be expended as agreed upon, but in the absence of any such agreement, all such principal and/or income shall be paid over to the Bursar to be expended as the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia may direct; that the corporation, acting through its Board of Trustees, shall have the broadest investment discretion and special care should be taken in the preparation of its charter to see that its powers are expressed in terms in conformity with modern investment practice.

If such development fund corporation is organized, Mr. Gay concurs in the statements in this report as to the manner of its creation, the selection of its director-trustees and the manner in which they and the corporation shall function, but reserves for further consideration any expression of opinion upon the question whether, in the over-all interest of the University, it is wise and expedient to create at this time a new agency for holding and administering funds procured through the conduct of the campaign presently being undertaken.

The Finance Committee respectfully represents that it has received a schedule of the estate held by the Safe Deposit and Trust Company of Baltimore, Trustee, under Item 6 of the will of Evelyn M. B. Tiffany, showing the estate on hand June 22, 1947 which was the date of the death of Florence B. B. Turlington, the changes which have since taken place, the proposed partial distribution to the University of Virginia, and the balance of estate retained by the trustee to provide for the remaining annuities; that your committee has carefully considered this proposed distribution and approves of it in every respect. In addition, there was exhibited to the committee by W. Allan Perkins, attorney for the University, the form of receipt which the trustee in this trust, the Safe Deposit and Trust Company of Baltimore, desired the President of the University to execute in return for delivery to him of the securities proposed to be distributed to the University, and that this form of receipt has been approved by your committee.

There is attached hereto the schedule above referred to and the form of receipt approved.

SCHEDULE OF ESTATE HELD BY SAFE DEPOSIT AND TRUST COMPANY OF BALTIMORE, TRUSTEE UNDER ITEM 6 OF WILL OF EVELYN M. B. TIFFANY, SHOWING THE ESTATE ON HAND JUNE 22, 1947, DATE OF DEATH OF FLORENCE B. B.

KNOW ALL MEN BY THESE PRESENTS: That whereas by Item Sixth of the Last Will and Testament of Evelyn May Bayly Tiffany, which Will was duly probated in the Orphans' Court of Baltimore City and is of record in the Office of the Register of Wills of said City in "Wills" Liber E.R.D. 164, folio 331, she gave to the Safe Deposit and Trust Company of Baltimore upon trust so much of her estate as might be necessary, in its opinion, to provide for the payment of the following annuities over and above all taxes (excepting income taxes) and other charges against said fund, which annuities she directed said Trustee to pay in quarterly installments, accounting from the date of her death during the life of each annuitant, apportioning same to the date of the respective deaths of said annuitants, viz:

and said Will provided upon the death of each of said annuitants, other than Florence B. B. Turlington, the annuity payable to the said annuitant so dying should be paid to the said Florence B. B. Turlington during her life, so that her annuity of $2,000. should be increased from time to time by the amount paid to the annuitants predeceasing her, and said Will further provided that if the said Florence B. B. Turlington should survive all of the other annuitants, then upon her death, the trust fund should fall into the residue of the testatrix's estate, but should she die during the life of any of said annuitants, then there should pass into the residue of the Testatrix's estate, upon the death of any annuitant, including the said Florence B. B. Turlington, so much of the principal of the trust fund as might be estimated by said Trustee to have produced the annuity paid to the annuitant so dying; and

WHEREAS by Item Seventh of said Will, the Testatrix devised and bequeathed the residue of her estate to the undersigned, with the request that it use the income for the support of Fellowships for persons from Northampton and Accomac Counties - said Fellowships to be known as "The Thomas Henry Bayly Fellowships" and "The Evelyn and Louis McLane Tiffany Fellowships" and to be in Academic, Law and Medical Schools, and should there at any time be any vacancies in said Fellowships not availed of by persons from either of said Counties in Virginia, they may be awarded to persons from other portions of Virginia, or from the State of Maryland; and

WHEREAS the said Florence B. B. Turlington died June 22, 1947, and the following annuitants who had received the following annuities, predeceased her, viz:

so that at the time of her death, the said Florence B. B. Turlington was receiving a total annuity of $6,000.; and

WHEREAS by reason of the death of the said Florence B. B. Turlington, it is now possible for the Trustee to make a distribution of a portion of the assets of said trust estate, after reserving sufficient which, in its opinion, will produce income sufficient to pay the remaining annuities; and

WHEREAS there has been submitted to and approved by the undersigned, a schedule showing the assets of the trust estate in the hands of said Trustee as of June 22, 1947, the date of death of the said Florence B. B. Turlington, the changes since, the retention of certain securities, the income from which is to be used in paying the remaining annuities, and the distribution of the balance of the estate to the undersigned; and

WHEREAS, as shown by said schedule, there were distributed to the undersigned on account of said trust estate, the following securities, viz:

which securities said Trustee has transferred and delivered to the undersigned, the receipt of which it doth hereby admit and acknowledge, and agrees to use the same in accordance with the provisions of the Will of said Testatrix above set forth; and in consideration thereof, it doth hereby Release, Acquit, Exonerate and Discharge the said Safe Deposit and Trust Company of Baltimore and its successors of and from all and every action, suit, claim, or demand which could or might possibly be brought exhibited or prosecuted against it, them, or any of them, for or on account of said securities or the payment thereof, hereby declaring itself fully satisfied, contented and paid as above specified.

IN TESTIMONY WHEREOF, the said body corporate hath caused this Release to be subscribed by the President thereof, and its corporate seal to be hereto affixed, this \_\_\_ day of \_\_\_\_\_, nineteen hundred and forty-eight.

The Inter-fraternity Council of the University of Virginia respectfully represents unto The Rector and Visitors, the following:

(1) That the Inter-fraternity Council is a voluntary association of the Greek Letter social fraternities of the University deriving its authority under and by virtue of a constitution adopted by the Greek Letter social fraternities and approved by the Dean of the University, a copy of which is now, and has been for several years past, on file in the Dean's office. A copy is also hereto attached;

(2) That Article III, Sections 1-7 of said constitution cover the powers granted to Your Petitioner or its Governing Board to control the Greek Letter social fraternities at the University, and, more specifically, to act upon cases that involve the breaking of rules governing conduct in fraternity houses;

(3) That in view of the fact that said constitution had been approved by the Dean of the University, Your Petitioner believed it was its duty to make and enforce rules governing conduct in fraternity houses, the actions of Your Petitioner, in this regard, being subject, of course, to the approval of the Administrative officers of the University and of the Rector and Visitors;

(4) That Your Petitioner recognizes the necessity of proper rules governing conduct in fraternity houses, and it is the earnest desire of Your Petitioner that proper rules be adopted to assure such conduct;

(5) Your Petitioner respectfully calls to the attention of The Rector and Visitors that the rules governing conduct in fraternity houses approved by resolution of the Board on the 12th day of December, 1947, places the duty of enforcing such rules, not upon Your Petitioner who has the power and authority by virtue of its constitution, to enforce such rules and to punish infractions thereof, but upon the officers of each fraternity who are in no position to punish infractions of such rules. This will result, in Your Petitioner's opinion, in the burden of enforcement falling upon the administrative officers of the University.

Your Petitioner further is of the opinion that the only practical and satisfactory method of enforcement of rules of conduct in fraternity houses is by self government and not through action by the administrative officers of the University and that it will constitute a step backward in student self government to take away from Your Petitioner its jurisdiction in this regard.

(6) It is further the earnest desire of Your Petitioner that rules of conduct be established that will constitute standard rules which in the main will remain unchanged from year to year and which will be susceptible of enforcement.

(7) Your Petitioner, while it realizes that The Rector and Visitors has already given careful thought and consideration to the question, believes that the Board did not have before it all of the necessary facts having to do with enforcement of rules of conduct in the past, and that the Board possibly did not foresee the unfortunate consequences that may occur as a result of the rules in their present form.

Your Petitioner therefore requests that the Board reconsider its previous action in regard to such rules of conduct and that Your Petitioner be granted the privilege of presenting to the Board its views upon jurisdiction to enforce rules of conduct and upon modification of the present rules.

The Fraternity Advisors Association, organized in September of 1947, presents its respects to the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia.

The Association was organized for the main purposes of cooperating with the University Administration and the fraternities on matters of common interest to both and, acting as a group rather than only as individuals, in advising the fraternities on matters of proper interest to all of them. The Association is composed of University Alumni, residents of Charlottesville and Albemarle County, who are members of the faculty, professional and business men, of mature age and experience. There is one representative for each fraternity and a few alternates.

We have studied with care the rules adopted by the Board on December 12, 1947, dealing specifically with visiting hours for ladies in fraternity houses. We have discussed their effect with representative undergraduates and have arrived at grave doubts as to their workability in some respects, under present conditions. On this account we beg to submit some observations and conclusions on this subject.

The provisions of section (3) and (4) of the rules as previously adopted fail to take into consideration the case of mother, wife, or sister of a member. It would seem proper that a mother, wife, or sister of a member should be allowed to visit a fraternity house at hours other than those specifically allowed, provided, of course, she is accompanied by such member.

A number of the fraternities, due to the high cost of food and the lack of a sufficient number of suitable eating places are serving meals. Colored women are employed as servants. To apply the rules as they presently exist to such servants seems unnecessary and certainly not within the real meaning of the rules.

It is therefore suggested that mothers, wives, and sisters of members, when accompanied by such member be excepted from the application of the rules and that domestic servants be excepted.

The provisions of section (5) limits the presence of women in fraternity houses to 1:00 a.m. provided chaperons approved by the Dean of Students are present. This provision fails to take into consideration the fact that some of the authorized University dances are not over until after 1:00 a.m. and that some of them may be held on nights other than Friday or Saturday. The girls from college and boarding schools who are permitted to attend these dances are allowed by their school authorities one hour after the dance ends in which to reach the place where they are staying. It would seem preferable that the girls who attend the University dances have a place to go with their escorts which will be under proper chaperonage rather than be left to the uncertainties of unchaperoned parked cars, road houses and tourist camps. It is therefore suggested that the rule limiting the time to 1:00 a.m. be slightly relaxed on nights of authorized University dances to include one hour after the dance ends, provided the Administration is assured that proper chaperonage will be maintained.

The provisions of Section (5) further limit the 1:00 a.m. time to Fridays and Saturdays.

It is pointed out that there are official University holidays such as Founders Day, Thanksgiving Day, etc., which do not necessarily fall upon a Friday or Saturday and that it would seem proper that members of a fraternity could entertain on such a holiday or upon the night preceding such a holiday. It is therefore suggested that Section (5) be further slightly modified to take care of such eventualities and for others that cannot now be foreseen by providing that on special occasions, upon application made to the Dean of Students, at least twenty-four (24) hours in advance, the Dean may extend the night hours until 1:00 a.m., provided proper chaperonage is maintained.

Section (6) provides that the officers of each fraternity shall be held responsible for enforcing the rules.

It is submitted that, with the best of intentions, the officers of a fraternity are in no position to punish any infraction of the rules and that they would have no recourse but to report infractions to the Administrative authorities. This puts these officers in an impossible position, making policemen of them for the benefit of the Administrative authorities. Such a course of action has never worked satisfactorily in any school or college and will not do so now. In the final analysis the burden of enforcement as well as of punishment will fall upon the Administrative officers of the University who, in turn, are not equipped to carry out the enforcement of these rules without the assistance and cooperation of the students.

It would seem far preferable for the rules to be enforced and infractions punished by the students themselves through a body which is sufficiently detached to punish infractions by the constituent members. The Interfraternity Council occupies this position and in years past, with the approval of the University Administrative officers, has undertaken to enforce rules of conduct and to punish infractions of them. It, therefore, seems logical that this body now be made responsible and that each fraternity, through its officers, be, in turn, responsible to the Council.

The suggested changes in the rules which have been outlined above are embodied in a set of suggested rules prepared by a committee of this Association and submitted to the Interfraternity Council for its approval.

The Association has further suggested to the Interfraternity Council that it be strengthened and its prestige increased by amending its Constitution to require that the representative of each fraternity to the Interfraternity Council be the President of such fraternity.

Much thought has been given to the rules governing conduct in fraternity houses. We feel that the suggested changes are reasonable and that the rules with these changes will be enforceable.

In view of the present situation and the fact that representatives of the fraternities are appearing before the Board on Friday, we thought it best that you be informed in some manner of the desired plans of the Student Council.

Attached is a rather rough draft of the plans which we wished to discuss with you next week. We felt that possibly these plans might have some effect on the Board's decisions.

As this is the only copy of the plan, we would appreciate its return to us.

The Student Council on behalf of the students formally protests the recent action of the Board of Visitors in forcing a group of rules upon the student body without consultation with the students.

It has been rumored that the Student Council is to be responsible for the enforcement of these rules and for the punishment of infractions. The Student Council wishes to inform the students and the administration that it has no intention of enforcing any rules in the framing of which it has had no voice. The Student Council is willing to accept the responsibility for student government if the rules to be enforced are promulgated by the Student Council in cooperation with the administration and the student groups concerned.

At a meeting of the Memphis Chapter of the University of Virginia Alumni Association, the action of the Visitors in undertaking to codify and set up specific rules to regulate the gentlemanly behavior of the Student Body was considered.

I, as the President, was directed to address this communication to the Visitors setting forth the views of the Memphis Chapter unanimously expressed as follows:

I. We feel that it would be unfortunate indeed to take away from the Student Body or in any way impair the long standing and traditional prerogatives of that Body to establish and to administer its own code of gentlemanly behavior. We believe that any current difficulties could and will be righted by the Student Governing Body.

II. We feel keenly the inappropriateness and the damage done to the University by the publicity given to the resolution of December 9th.

The Memphis Chapter, as one of the largest Chapters in the Country and the Sponsoring Chapter of more than sixty Memphis Students now at the University is prompted to this action by our pride in and our devotion to those distinctive attributes which until now have always set the University apart from and above any other institution of learning.

In view of the recent regulations passed by you concerning this chapter, it is requested that you reconsider part of section three of your resolution. The part in question states, "That the four members of the SPE fraternity directly involved or who had knowledge of the occurrence be prohibited from living in the SPE house . . ."

It is the feeling of this chapter that to permit this regulation to go unquestioned would be a betrayal of fraternal ideals which make our organization meaningful to us.

To us, this request has deeper implications than the casual reader may observe, for without the sincere spirit of brotherhood, any fraternity would soon become a meaningless gathering of people. We feel confident that you will consider this matter in the spirit in which we make this request.

The undersigned Committee, appointed by Chairman Halsey at the meeting of the Executive Committee held September 11, 1947, to investigate and report upon the best method to be employed in the handling and administration of funds obtained through the efforts of the Development Fund Campaign, respectfully advises as follows:

I. The Committee is unanimously of opinion that the Alumni Association of the University of Virginia is presently without power to constitute a new and separate Board of Trustees to hold and administer funds that may now be obtaining through the efforts of the Development Fund Campaign. Its reasons for entertaining this view are as follows:

The Society of Alumni of the University of Virginia was incorporated by an Act of the General Assembly of this State, adopted February 6, 1873. By an amendment approved March 7, 1903, the name of the Society was changed to the General Alumni Association of the University of Virginia. By Section Seven of this Act, the Association was given "power to raise an endowment fund for the use and benefit of the University, to be held by the Treasurer of the State, in Virginia registered century bonds, and all funds belonging to said Association in excess of $1,000, and all those donated for the purpose of building a public hall, shall be similarly invested and only disposed of as they may be deemed for the purposes of the Association or the University." By Section Eight of the Act the Association was given power to receive and hold property and donations passing by grant, conveyance, demise or bequest, "under the general powers of endowment created in the Seventh Section of this Act . . ."

It is thus seen that under the charter of the Association at that time in effect any endowment fund raised by it for the use and benefit of the University had to be held by "the Treasurer of the State, in Virginia registered century bonds." Your Committee is informed that when the Association interested itself in the raising of an endowment in 1907 and 1908 at least one large donor refused to give funds which would be subject to the political control of the State of Virginia. The aforementioned sections Seven and Eight of the charter of the Association were therefore amended as of December 5, 1907, so as to authorize the Association to appoint by deed of trust a Board of seven Trustees, to be known and designated as "The Alumni Board of Trustees of the University of Virginia Endowment Fund." It was provided that this "Board and its successors shall be perpetual and its duties, powers, rights, privileges and responsibilities shall be irrevocable, to hold, manage, invest and expend the funds now raised, or hereafter to be raised, or any gift or grant heretofore or hereafter made to the General Alumni Association for the use and benefit of the University of Virginia under the terms of this charter and the provisions of said deed of trust herein authorized to be executed, which deed shall define the duties, powers, rights, privileges and responsibilities of said Board."

Pursuant to the foregoing provisions of the charter of the Association, as amended, it executed on February 15, 1908, a deed to Joseph Bryan, Thomas Nelson Page, Thomas F. Ryan, Alexander P. Humphrey, Charles J. Faulkner and Williamson W. Fuller, and Edwin A. Alderman, President of the University of Virginia, ex officio, Trustees, to be known as "The Alumni Board of Trustees of the University of Virginia Endowment Fund" transferring and conveying "all gifts, funds, moneys, investments or subscriptions now made or which may hereafter be made, to the said Trustees for the use and benefit of the University of Virginia," together with "all such grants, gifts, funds, moneys, investments, interest, credit, bonds, notes, or subscriptions that may hereafter be made of every character or description whatsoever, including income, revenues, issues and profits thereof, either directly to the Trustees, parties of the second part, or to this Association for the benefit of the University of Virginia."

While the charter of the Association has since three times been amended, on August 4, 1922, January 24, 1929 and September 9, 1933, the rights, powers and duties of the Trustees and their successors, appointed by the aforesaid deed of trust of February 15, 1908, have been fully preserved, it having been expressly provided in the amendment of September 9, 1933, that -

"It (the Alumni Board) shall hold, manage, invest and expend, the funds raised or hereafter to be raised, or any gifts or grants heretofore or hereafter made by will, deed or otherwise, to it, or to the Alumni Association for the use and benefit of the said Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia under the terms of this charter."

It seems to your Committee, therefore, that title to any funds presently solicited by, or obtained as a result of the efforts of the Alumni Association of the University of Virginia would necessarily pass to "The Alumni Board of Trustees of the University of Virginia Endowment Fund" created by the deed of February 15, 1908, and their successors presently in office. The execution of a further or additional deed of trust at this time, whereby a new board of trustees would be created for the purpose of receiving title to, possession and control of funds likely to be raised in the present campaign would not, therefore, in the opinion of the Committee, be presently within the power of the Association.

II. In this situation a majority of your Committee, Messrs. Scott and Hildreth, are of opinion that a new non-profit, non-stock corporation should be organized under the provisions of Chapter 151 of the Code of Virginia, to be designated as "The University of Virginia Development Fund," that there be seven Trustees presently selected and named to manage the affairs and investments of the corporation, and that the President of the University be at all times, ex officio, a Trustee of the corporation; that the first seven Trustees be selected by this Executive Committee to serve for terms of one to seven years, respectively, the term of each Trustee to be determined by lot after their selection by the Executive Committee; that no Trustee drawing a term of more than three years shall be eligible for re-election but that any Trustee drawing a term of three years or less shall be eligible for election for one additional term of seven years; that the first seven Trustees be selected without reference to their respective ages, but that all successor Trustees shall be of the age of 57 years or less, so that upon the expiration of their respective seven year terms of service they would have attained an age of not to exceed 65 years; that all successor Trustees be nominated by a majority vote of the Trustees then in office, such nominations to receive the approval of the majority of the Board of Managers of the Alumni Association of the University of Virginia in attendance upon any meeting at which the selection of a successor Trustee shall come before the Board of Managers for consideration and action, that for each vacancy the Trustees then in office shall nominate three persons, one of whom shall be selected by the Board of Managers in the manner stated; that the charter of the corporation provide that all securities held by it shall be placed in the possession, as custodian, of some trust company or bank having trust powers, organized under the laws of the State of Virginia and/or of the United States and doing business in Virginia, with capital, surplus and undivided profits of not less than $2,000,000.00, and that the corporation may in its discretion employ the services of some corporation or individual, or duly accredited officer of the University, as investment counsel; that the corporation shall apply faithfully the principal and/or any income from any gifts or grants to the objects or purposes designated by the donor or grantor, but when no direction, condition or limitation is attached to such gifts or grants, the corporation shall hold the same with full power to invest and reinvest such principal and/or income in accordance with the discretion of its Trustees who shall employ and apply such principal and/or income to the needs of the University of Virginia after full conference with the President, Rector and Visitors of the University, and upon agreement with them as to the expenditure of all or a part of such principal and/or income, the corporation shall pay the same, or the part as to which an agreement has been reached, to the Bursar of the University, to be expended as agreed upon, but in the absence of any such agreement, all such principal and/or income shall be paid over to the Bursar to be expended as the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia may direct; that the corporation, acting through its Board of Trustees, shall have the broadest investment discretion and special care should be taken in the preparation of its charter to see that its powers are expressed in terms in conformity with modern investment practice.

If such development fund corporation is organized, Mr. Gay concurs in the statements in this report as to the manner of its creation, the selection of its director-trustees and the manner in which they and the corporation shall function, but reserves for further consideration any expression of opinion upon the question whether, in the over-all interest of the University, it is wise and expedient to create at this time a new agency for holding and administering funds procured through the conduct of the campaign presently being undertaken.
