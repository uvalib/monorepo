APPROVAL OF REVISED RETIREMENT CONTRIBUTION FORMULA
---------------------------------------------------

On motion, the meeting adjourned at 2:57 p.m.

RCB:jb

Attachment A RETIREMENT PLAN DESIGNOBJECTIVE:CURRENT FORMULAS:CONSIDERATIONS:PROPOSED FORMULA:IMPACT OF 12-1/2% FORMULA ON RETIREMENT CONTRIBUTIONS:RECOMMENDED APPROACH TO OFFSET DECREASE IN RETIREMENT CONTRIBUTIONS:ADVANTAGES OF PROPOSED FORMULA:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

155 faculty in the regular formula would receive less in retirement contributions next fiscal year than in the current fiscal year:

$167,600

370 faculty in the step formula would receive less in retirement contributions next fiscal year than in the current fiscal year (186 of the 370 faculty have a projected decrease in their retirement contributions of less than $100):

40,256

TOTAL

207,856

(Applicable to individuals whose decrease in retirement contributions is $100 or greater)

A special one-time adjustment to the contractual salary will be made to offset the decrease in retirement contributions. For twelve (12) month faculty, the adjustment will be made on July 1 and for nine (9) month faculty, the adjustment will be made on September 1. The adjustments to salary will be calculated by taking the total decrease in retirement contributions ($207,856) minus the retirement contributions generated by the salary increase ($25,892 = 12-1/2% of $207,856).
