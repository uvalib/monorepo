RESOLVED, That an appropriation of $500.00 be made for keeping the library open from 4:30 to 7:30 P. M.

In the matter of the will of Dr. Walter M. Seward:

It was stated to the Rector and Visitors that, through a Committee, consisting of Mr. Chapin Jones, Mr. J. L. Newcomb, and Mr. W. Allen Perkins, Dr. Walter M. Seward, an Alumnus of the University, who now resides in Brunswick County, Virginia, has recently executed a will whereby he gives to the University of Virginia, for the use of its School of Forestry, some one thousand acres of timber land in Brunswick County, and a valuable personal estate.

It was thereupon

Resolved, That this Board deeply appreciates Dr. Seward's generous and far-seeing action in making the University of Virginia his sole devisee and legatee. The benefits that will result to our School of Forestry and to the whole subject of Forestry in the Commonwealth are incalculable, and we, the present Rector and Visitors, strongly recommend to any succeeding Board of Visitors, upon which may fall the duty of administering this great undertaking, that they fittingly preserve the indentity of this fund in attaching to the School of Forestry, so founded, the name of its munificient donor.

The President is requested to transmit a copy of this resolution to Dr. Seward with a renewed expression of appreciation and thanks, and with best wishes to him for a long life and good health.

The Buildings and Grounds Committee submitted a report to the Board in accordance with instructions given said Committee at the June, 1927, meeting, covering certain questions which have arisen as to the University's use of water from the City's Reservoirs and the rate of payment therefor.

Accompanying said report was a brief form of contract which the Committee recommends should be executed on behalf of the University, by which 175,000 gallons of water per day is to be furnished for the University's use by the City as rental for the University's lands occupied by the City's filter plant, pipe line, etc. Said contract provides that all water in excess of said 175,000 gallons per day shall be paid for by the University at the rate of 5 &cent; for each 1000 gallons of such excess.

It was thereupon

RESOLVED that said report is hereby accepted and approved and the Rector and Secretary are hereby instructed to execute the contract aforesaid on behalf of the University.

And a copy of said report and of said contract are ordered spread upon the minutes of this meeting.

Your Committee, directed at the June, 1927, meeting to effect a settlement with the City of Charlottesville of certain questions which have arisen as to the University's use of water from the City's Reservoirs, and the of payment therefor, respectfully report—

That before any discussion was had with the City authorities Mr. Perkins, our Attorney, was requested to review the situation, going over all existing contracts and giving an opinion as to the whole situation from our own standpoint.

Mr. Perkins, under date of July 11th, 1927, rendered his opinion in the form of a letter, which was addressed to the Mayor and Council of the City of Charlottesville, and which was signed by Dr. Lambeth and delivered to Major John S. Graves, City Attorney, and by him delivered to the City Council. A copy of this letter is attached to this report.

Conferences have been held with the City Attorney, the Superintendent of Water, members of the City's Water Committee, and finally, on October 1st, with the City Council.

We have had five contracts with the City covering our right to use water, these contracts having been executed in 1885, 1891, 1892, 1900, and 1922 respectively.

Under the contract of 1885 we were required to pay the sum of $150.00 per annum towards maintaining the Old City Reservoir. Under the contract of 1900 we were required to pay $30.00 per annum towards maintenance of the Moore's Creek pumping plant, and $12.50 per month for each month said plant was in operation. These charges were carried into the contract of 1922, which is the contract under which we are now operating.

Said contract of 1922 provides, among other things, for the lease to the City for 99 years of a right of way over University grounds for a pipe line, and of some 3-1/2 acres on Observatory Mountain for the City's filter plant. In consideration of these grants the University is to receive 185,000 gallons of water per day, as rent for the land leased, and on account of our one-seventh interest in the City's original waterplant, and is to pay for all excess at a rate—"To be hereafter agreed upon by said City and University, such rate, however not to exceed five cents for each 1000 gallons of water over and above said 175,000 gallons per day".

It will be recalled that the fixing of this maximum of rent at 175,000 gallons per day was believed to have been done under a misapprehension of facts, and your Committee was requested to have this maximum increased if possible.

Upon a full investigation we have found:-

First. That while this maximum was unquestionably fixed under a mistake which was made at the time, it is not at all unreasonable and should be allowed to stand.

Second. That the charge of $150.00 per annum and the charge of $30.00 per annum, and of $12.50 per month have not been made by the City for a number of years, although under our contracts these charges might properly have been made within certain limits. The Council has agreed with us that these three charges shall be eliminated in the future.

Third. That the fixed interest charge to the City upon its water bonds amounts to 11-1/4 &cent; per 1000 gallons used, and its operating expense is 4-1/2 &cent; per 1000 gallons used, a total cost of 15-3/4 &cent; to the City for each 1000 gallons furnished us. The 175,000 gallons per day which we receive as rent therefore costs the City $27.56, a total of $826.80 permonth of thirty days, or $10,000.00 a year in round numbers. We think that we should agree with the City upon a rate of 5&cent; per 1000 gallons of excess over 175,000 gallons aday.

We have not settled on water bills since November 23rd, 1926, and we now owe a balance of $636.97 for water used from that date to September 23rd, 1927. This bill, as originally rendered, was for $809.44, but the City has agreed to a reduction of $172.47, leaving a balance of $63.97 as stated above. This is an average of $63.99 per month for our water. Our present contract with the City provides for the payment by the University of one-seventh of the annual cost of operating and maintaining the new filter plant and booster pump used in connection therewith, provided such one-seventh shall in no event exceed $900.00 per year. Taking it for granted that this charge will not be less than $900.00 per annum, or $75.00 per monty, the total average monthly cost to uss will approximate $63.99 plus $75.00, or $138.99 per month. Compared with the cost of operating and maintaining a plant of our own this sum is insignificant.

Fourth. The City will read our meters on the 1st day of each month and we would recommend that we check these readings so that no question may arise in the future as to quantities used.

Fifth. We submit herewith a short form of agreement which we thinkshould be executed on behalf of the University, and by the City. It has been submitted to the City Attorney and embodies the tentative agreements reaching in our conferences, and which are set out in this report.

Under date of April, 18th, 1922, the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, and the City of Charlottesville, entered into a contract whereby the University leased to the City, for the term of 99 years from the date thereof, a certain tract of land belonging to the University and situated on the east side of Observatory Mountain, containing 5 acres, more or less, and to be used by the City as a site for a filter plant, said acreage including certain rights of way for two 16-inch water mains from a point on the Lynchburg Road through the lands of said University to said filter plant. And said contract contains, among other things, the following clause:-

"In consideration for which the said City undertakes and agrees to furnish to said University, for use of its public buildings and grounds, and for use of Officers, Professors and employees of said University, residing on University property, a total of 175,000 gallons of water per day, for the term of the lease herein above specified, and without charge, and all water in excess of 175,000 gallons per day used as aforesaid shall be paid for by the University at a rate to be hereafter agreed upon by said City and said University, which rate, however, shall in no event exceed 5&cent; for each 1000 gallons over and above said 175,000 gallons per day."

And said contract further provides for the payment by said University to the City of $150.00 per annum in accordance with the terms of a contract between said parties of January 20th, 1885.

Also for the payment by said University to said City of $30.00 per annum under contract of May 26th, 1900, and of $12.50 per month for each and every month during which a certain pumping plant on Moore's Creek shall be in actual operation, this also in accordance with contract of May 26th, 1900.

The rate at which the University is to pay for water in excess of said 175,000 gallons per day has never been fixed, and the purposes for which the payments under said contracts of 1885 and 1900 were to be made no longer exist.

IT IS THEREFORE AGREED this 11th day of November, 1927, between The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, of the first part, and the City of Charlottesville, of the second part, that the rate at which the University shall pay for water used by it in excess of said 175,000 gallons per day shall be 5&cent; for each 1000 gallons used by said University over and above said 175,000 gallons per day.

Furthermore, said City agrees that the charge of $150.00 per annum, under contract of 1885, and the charges of $30.00 per annum and $12.50 per month, referred to in contract of 1900, shall no longer be made but said University is hereby fully discharged and acquitted for any further liability with reference therefor, either for payments thereof that may have been due in the past and still remain unpaid, or for any payments thereof in the future.

IN TESTIMONY WHEREOF The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia has caused this contract to be signed by C. Harding Walker, its Rector, and its corporate seal to be hereunto affixed and attested by E. I. Carruthers, Secretary, and the City of Charlottesville has caused its name to be signed hereto by J. Y. Brown, its Mayor, and its corporate seal to be hereunto affixed and attested by H. A. Haden, its Clerk, this 11th day of November, 1927.

The Bursar, on behalf of the Finance Committee, submitted a report on the sale of land in Colorado and Kansas, bequeathed the University by Miss Este Coffinberry for the establishment of the John W. Richard Lectureship in Religion, and the Rector and Secretary were empowered to execute and deliver deeds conveying the said property, as set forth in the following report and resolution adopted.

On behalf of the Chairman of the Finance Committee, I beg to submit the following report on sale of land in Colorado and Kansas bequeathed to the University by Miss Este Coffinberry for the establishment of the John W. Richard Lectureship in Religion.

During the month of August our agents at Crook, Colorado, and at Bennington, Kansas, submitted offers for the said land as follows:

For the 320 acres of grazing land in Colorado, $7,000, payable $1,000 cash and the remainder in annual payments over a period of 18 years, with interest on all the deferred payments.

For half of the 160 acres of agricultural land in Kansas, an offer of $60.00 per acre was submitted.

These offers were submitted to Mr. Scott, Chairman, who felt that we should dispose of all such land as speedily as possible at reasonable prices, and directed me to visit the said places and look into the situation. Upon reaching Kansas and visiting the land with the prospective purchaser it developed that a portion of the half on which the offer was submitted, which had been in wheat during the past season, had not been plowed and, hence, had grown up in sunflowers, upon, seeing which, the purchaser stated that he did not want the half on which said unplowed land lay, but would take the other half at $50.00 per acre. This half contains about 40 acres of grazing land, unsuited for agricultural purposes, and the remainder, about 40 acres, which had been plowed for wheat. I also visited our agent at Minneapolis, Kansas, who has been looking after the property for a number of years, and consulted with him with reference to the offer. (The offer came through a real estate agent at Bennington, Kansas, some 15 miles from Minneapolis. It was his opinion that we should not accept the offer as we had received a very good return from our portion of the wheat this season and from the rental of the grazing land, and stated that it was his opinion that the land would increase at least $5.00 per acre per year for the next two or three years.) Upon my return I made a full, written report to Mr. Scott who disagreed with my recommendation to decline the offer, feeling, as I have above stated, that we should dispose of the land as quickly as a reasonable offer was had, and directed the offer to be accepted, which was done. The papers are now being prepared for closing the deal.

Recently we received an offer of $60.00 cash from another party for the remaining 80 acres which Mr. Scott accepted and the sale was accordingly made. These papers are also being prepared.

This will dispose of all the Kansas land with the exception of some town lots located at Peabody, and I am trying to get them started.

As to the 320 acres tract at Crook, Colorado, I visited the land with the agent there and the purchaser. I found farming conditions better than when there two years ago; but, as our land was unimproved and was situated as to require an expenditure of considerable money to place it in condition for agricultural purposes, and, after discussing the local conditions with our agent, as well as observing them, I was of the opinon that if a sale could at something like $20.00 per acre it would be a good sale. After some dickering with the proposed purchaser agreement was reached to submit an offer of $7,000 for the tract, being $600 better than his original offer. It developed, however, that if he paid the $1000 cash he would have nothing with which to stock the property and carry forward the farming of it. He then proposed to give a deed of trust on a tract of 160 acres lying adjoining ours, for $1,000 payable $200 per year, with interest, and to secure the remainder of the purchase price on the land being purchased with a deed of trust on same; payments to be made over a period of 18 years with interest at 6%, with the privilege of anticipating any or all of the deferred notes upon 30 days notice. This would mean converting a non-income investment into a good 6% investment on $7,000. At present we are not receiving sufficient from the rental of pasture to pay the taxes and agent's fee.

I reported the matter to the Chairman who directed the offer be accepted, and the papers have been prepared to close the deal.

I may add that the purchaser of the Colorado tract was reported to be a very substantial citizen, owning 160 acres of very good land with improvements, and was in a position to carry forward the improving of it. He is the mail carrier for that route receiving a salary of from $2,400 to $3,600 per year.

RESOLVED that the action of the Finance Committee in making sale to Harold F. Jobe of the 320 acres of land situated in Logan County, Colorado, which passed to the University of Virginia under the will of Miss Este Coffinberry, be and is hereby approved, ratified and confirmed.

The terms of said sale are as follows:- The said Harold F. Jobe agrees to pay the sum of $7,000.00 for said land, of which $1,000.00 is evidenced by his five notes for $200.00 each, all dated January 1st, 1928, and payable in one, two, three, four and five years after date, respectively, with interest at 6& per annum, the privilege of anticipating any of said notes on thirty days notice to payee prior to any interest payment date being reserved, and all of said notes being secured by a deed of trust constituting a first lien upon 160 acres of land owned by said Jobe, which said 160 acres adjoins the 320 acre tract which he is purchasing from the University.

The residue of said purchase money ($6000.00) is evidenced by the eighteen notes of said Harold F. Jobe for $333.33 each, all dated October 18th, 1927, and payable on the first day of January, 1929, and each year thereafter, with interest at 6%. These notes also contain reservation by the maker of right to anticipate payment on thirty days notice before any interest date, and all of said notes are secured by a deed of trust which constitutes a first lien upon the 320 acres which is to be conveyed by the University to said Jobe.

Mr. Carruthers then presented to the Board a form of deed, drawn in accordance with Colorado practice, and by which said 320 acres is conveyed to said Harold F. Jobe, said land being described as lying and being in Logan County, Colorado, and being the "North one-half of Section 1, Township 10, north of Range 49, west of the Sixth principal meridian", and eight shares of the capital stock of Harmony Ditch Company, No. 1 is included in said conveyance.

It was thereupon further

RESOLVED that the Rector and Secretary be, and are hereby authorized and requested to execute and deliver this deed to the said Harold E. Jobe upon delivery by said Jobe of the notes and deeds of trust aforesaid.

Mr. Carruthers reported that an offer had been received from G. W. Fender of Ottawa County, Kanaas, to purchase 80 acres of the 160 acre tract of land devised to the University by Miss Este Coffinberry, and situated in Ottawa County, Kansas, at the price of $4000.00. cash.

He also presented a deed to the Board, which had been drawn in accordance with Kansas practice and which is in shape to be executed on behalf of the University.

It was thereupon

RESOLVED that The Rector and Secretary be, and are hereby requested and instructed to execute and deliver the deed in question to G. W. Fender thereby conveying to him the west one-half of Township 11, south Range 3, west, in Ottawa County, Kansas, containing 80 acres, more or less, upon payment by said Fender to E. I. Carruthers, Bursar, or to his duly authorized agent or Attorney, of the sum of $4000.00 in cash.

Mr. Carruthers also reported to the Board that he had received a tentative offer from one Charles Rake of Ottowa County, Kansas, to purchase the remaining 80 acres of the 160 acres of land in Ottawa County, Kansas, devised to the University by Miss Este Coffinberry, the offer being to pay approximately $4800.00 in cash.

Mr. Carruthers further stated that in his opinion we would do well to sell the property in question for any amount over $4650.00, and he requested that authority be given to the Rector and to himself to execute and deliver a deed to this property provided negotiations could be completed with said Charles Rake at any price above said $4650.00.

It was thereupon

RESOLVED that the Rector and Secretary, and the Finance Committee be, and are hereby requested and instructed to continue negotiations for the sale of the property in question, and they are instructed to accept the offer of $4800.00, and the Rector and Secretary are further empowered to execute and deliver a deed conveying said property upon the payment of said purchase price.

The land in question is the eastern one-half of the northwest quarter of Section 23, Township 11, South Range 3, west, of the 6th P. M., in Ottawa County, Kansas.

The Committee on New Medical Buildings submitted the following report of contracts let for the new medical buildings:

Your committee has let to contract the following contracts:

The foregoing report was received and ratified and the Special Committee was authorized to make contracts for such equipment as may be necessary for the new buildings within the limit of the sum available.

The President stated to the Board that in a conference with the Governor concerning the appropriations for the next bi-ennium he learned that tentative appropriations to the University for capital outlays had been made as follows:

The designation of the said $200,000, together with the question of making some provision for erecting a woman's building, was discussed and disposed of in the following resolution adopted;

RESOLVED, That the proposed State appropriation for capital expenditure of $200,000 be applied to the construction of an Academic Building, and

That the Governor be requested to include in the budget an additional $50,000 loan from the Literary Fund for the construction of a woman's building, upon the condition that an additional $50,000 be raised by the University for that purpose.

Petitions from certain students to be allowed to park their cars on the concrete dirveway leading to the gymnasium and also to be allowed to park behind Dawson's Row were referred to the Buildings and Grounds Committee for action and report.

The Secretary presented letters received from M. Carter Hall, Chairman of the Special Committee in the Rogers matter, and from Dr. George Floyd Rogers in reference to charges made against Professor Knight, which letter has been received since the last meeting of the Board. They were read to and considered by the Board, whereupon, on motion made and carried, it was.

RESOLVED, That this Board is convinced that no sufficient reason has been shown for re-opening the case.

Mr. Hall stated that Professor Knight was appealing to the Board to appropriate a sum to cover the attorney's fees incurred by him in defending the charges of Mr. Rogers. The Board declined to make an appropriation for the purpose, but authorized the Bursar to pay the fees of the stenographers for their services in said case.

Report of the University attorney in the Blandy matter;

At the meeting of the Board of Visitors held in April, 1927, a resolution was adopted directing the Attorney for the University to make settlement with the Estate of Graham F. Blandy, and with Mrs. Blandy, of certain accounts due to said Estate and to Mrs. Blandy by the University for work done upon the Blandy Experimental Farm by Mrs. Blandy's laborers and by the Estate of Graham F. Blandy, and for materials furnished by Mrs. Blandy and by said Estate to the Experimental Farm in the operation and maintenance of said Farm from March 25, th, 1926, the date of Mr. Blandy's death to August 1st, 1926, the date when the University took possession of the property. Said resolution directs the Attorney to make settlement of this account, providing the total of said account did not exceed the sum of $1600.00.

Your Attorney begs to report that acting pursuant to the instructions of said Resolution he made a careful audit of the account in question, and with the assistance of Mr. Reynolds arrived at the conclusion that the sum of $1533.07 was the amount actually due by the University to said Mrs. Blandy and to the Estate of Graham F. Blandy.

Settlement was therefore made with Messrs. Hunt, Hill & Betts, Attorneys for Mrs. Blandy and the said Estate, and I have the receipt of these gentlemen for said sum of $1533.07 accepted by them in full payment of the account in question.

Mr. Perkins presented to the Board a report with reference to expiration of our present leases with Mrs. Elizabeth Glinn, in her own right and as Committee of Bessie Glinn Bowe, and stated that he was requested by Dr. Hornsby to ask that authority be given for the extension of these leases for an additional term of two years from the date of their expiration, April 30th, 1928.

It is thereupon

RESOLVED, That the Rector and Secretary of this Board be, and are hereby, requested to execute new leases with Mrs. Elizabeth Glinn, in her own right and as Committee of Mrs. Bessie Glinn Bowe, so that the use of the premises which are now occupied as a nurses' Home may be secured for and additional term of one year with the privilege of renewal for one more year. It is of course understood that the new leases shall be upon terms, as to terms of payment, identical with those of the original leases under which we now occupy this property.

Mr. Rinehart, Chairman, brought up the question of petition of the G. A. A. to be permitted to use the land lying between the Ivy Road and the C. & O. Railway for athletic purposes. The matter was continued with the Buildings and Grounds Committee for further conference with the Department of Forestry which is using part of the land, and the Athletic Council.

The Bursar read a letter from the Trust Company of Norfolk, which has been a depository of the University for the B. W. Green bequest, stating that it was closing its accounts with a view to the final liquidation of the bank and the surrender of its charter, having been consolidated with the Norfolk National Bank under the title of Norfolk National Bank of Commerce and Trusts, and soliciting a continuation of the service heretofore rendered for the new institution, whereupon, on motion, duly made and seconded, it was

RESOLVED, That the service heretofore rendered by the Trust Company of Norfolk as a depository of the University for the B. W. Green bequest, which Trust Company has been consolidated with the Norfolk National Bank under the title of Norfolk National Bank of Commerce & Trusts, be transferred to the said bank, and the Finance Committee be and is hereby authorized to enter into a proper contract with said bank as a depository of the University for the said B. W. Green Fund.

RESOLVED, further, that the Bursar be and is hereby authorized to receipt to The Trust Company of Norfolk for the securities and cash belonging to the B. W. Green bequest and turn the same over to the Norfolk National Bank of Commerce & Trusts upon the execution of contract referred to in the foregoing resolution.

On motion the meeting then adjourned.

Your Committee, directed at the June, 1927, meeting to effect a settlement with the City of Charlottesville of certain questions which have arisen as to the University's use of water from the City's Reservoirs, and the of payment therefor, respectfully report—

That before any discussion was had with the City authorities Mr. Perkins, our Attorney, was requested to review the situation, going over all existing contracts and giving an opinion as to the whole situation from our own standpoint.

Mr. Perkins, under date of July 11th, 1927, rendered his opinion in the form of a letter, which was addressed to the Mayor and Council of the City of Charlottesville, and which was signed by Dr. Lambeth and delivered to Major John S. Graves, City Attorney, and by him delivered to the City Council. A copy of this letter is attached to this report.

Conferences have been held with the City Attorney, the Superintendent of Water, members of the City's Water Committee, and finally, on October 1st, with the City Council.

We have had five contracts with the City covering our right to use water, these contracts having been executed in 1885, 1891, 1892, 1900, and 1922 respectively.

Under the contract of 1885 we were required to pay the sum of $150.00 per annum towards maintaining the Old City Reservoir. Under the contract of 1900 we were required to pay $30.00 per annum towards maintenance of the Moore's Creek pumping plant, and $12.50 per month for each month said plant was in operation. These charges were carried into the contract of 1922, which is the contract under which we are now operating.

Said contract of 1922 provides, among other things, for the lease to the City for 99 years of a right of way over University grounds for a pipe line, and of some 3-1/2 acres on Observatory Mountain for the City's filter plant. In consideration of these grants the University is to receive 185,000 gallons of water per day, as rent for the land leased, and on account of our one-seventh interest in the City's original waterplant, and is to pay for all excess at a rate—"To be hereafter agreed upon by said City and University, such rate, however not to exceed five cents for each 1000 gallons of water over and above said 175,000 gallons per day".

It will be recalled that the fixing of this maximum of rent at 175,000 gallons per day was believed to have been done under a misapprehension of facts, and your Committee was requested to have this maximum increased if possible.

Upon a full investigation we have found:-

First. That while this maximum was unquestionably fixed under a mistake which was made at the time, it is not at all unreasonable and should be allowed to stand.

Second. That the charge of $150.00 per annum and the charge of $30.00 per annum, and of $12.50 per month have not been made by the City for a number of years, although under our contracts these charges might properly have been made within certain limits. The Council has agreed with us that these three charges shall be eliminated in the future.

Third. That the fixed interest charge to the City upon its water bonds amounts to 11-1/4 &cent; per 1000 gallons used, and its operating expense is 4-1/2 &cent; per 1000 gallons used, a total cost of 15-3/4 &cent; to the City for each 1000 gallons furnished us. The 175,000 gallons per day which we receive as rent therefore costs the City $27.56, a total of $826.80 permonth of thirty days, or $10,000.00 a year in round numbers. We think that we should agree with the City upon a rate of 5&cent; per 1000 gallons of excess over 175,000 gallons aday.

We have not settled on water bills since November 23rd, 1926, and we now owe a balance of $636.97 for water used from that date to September 23rd, 1927. This bill, as originally rendered, was for $809.44, but the City has agreed to a reduction of $172.47, leaving a balance of $63.97 as stated above. This is an average of $63.99 per month for our water. Our present contract with the City provides for the payment by the University of one-seventh of the annual cost of operating and maintaining the new filter plant and booster pump used in connection therewith, provided such one-seventh shall in no event exceed $900.00 per year. Taking it for granted that this charge will not be less than $900.00 per annum, or $75.00 per monty, the total average monthly cost to uss will approximate $63.99 plus $75.00, or $138.99 per month. Compared with the cost of operating and maintaining a plant of our own this sum is insignificant.

Fourth. The City will read our meters on the 1st day of each month and we would recommend that we check these readings so that no question may arise in the future as to quantities used.

Fifth. We submit herewith a short form of agreement which we thinkshould be executed on behalf of the University, and by the City. It has been submitted to the City Attorney and embodies the tentative agreements reaching in our conferences, and which are set out in this report.

On behalf of the Chairman of the Finance Committee, I beg to submit the following report on sale of land in Colorado and Kansas bequeathed to the University by Miss Este Coffinberry for the establishment of the John W. Richard Lectureship in Religion.

During the month of August our agents at Crook, Colorado, and at Bennington, Kansas, submitted offers for the said land as follows:

For the 320 acres of grazing land in Colorado, $7,000, payable $1,000 cash and the remainder in annual payments over a period of 18 years, with interest on all the deferred payments.

For half of the 160 acres of agricultural land in Kansas, an offer of $60.00 per acre was submitted.

These offers were submitted to Mr. Scott, Chairman, who felt that we should dispose of all such land as speedily as possible at reasonable prices, and directed me to visit the said places and look into the situation. Upon reaching Kansas and visiting the land with the prospective purchaser it developed that a portion of the half on which the offer was submitted, which had been in wheat during the past season, had not been plowed and, hence, had grown up in sunflowers, upon, seeing which, the purchaser stated that he did not want the half on which said unplowed land lay, but would take the other half at $50.00 per acre. This half contains about 40 acres of grazing land, unsuited for agricultural purposes, and the remainder, about 40 acres, which had been plowed for wheat. I also visited our agent at Minneapolis, Kansas, who has been looking after the property for a number of years, and consulted with him with reference to the offer. (The offer came through a real estate agent at Bennington, Kansas, some 15 miles from Minneapolis. It was his opinion that we should not accept the offer as we had received a very good return from our portion of the wheat this season and from the rental of the grazing land, and stated that it was his opinion that the land would increase at least $5.00 per acre per year for the next two or three years.) Upon my return I made a full, written report to Mr. Scott who disagreed with my recommendation to decline the offer, feeling, as I have above stated, that we should dispose of the land as quickly as a reasonable offer was had, and directed the offer to be accepted, which was done. The papers are now being prepared for closing the deal.

Recently we received an offer of $60.00 cash from another party for the remaining 80 acres which Mr. Scott accepted and the sale was accordingly made. These papers are also being prepared.

This will dispose of all the Kansas land with the exception of some town lots located at Peabody, and I am trying to get them started.

As to the 320 acres tract at Crook, Colorado, I visited the land with the agent there and the purchaser. I found farming conditions better than when there two years ago; but, as our land was unimproved and was situated as to require an expenditure of considerable money to place it in condition for agricultural purposes, and, after discussing the local conditions with our agent, as well as observing them, I was of the opinon that if a sale could at something like $20.00 per acre it would be a good sale. After some dickering with the proposed purchaser agreement was reached to submit an offer of $7,000 for the tract, being $600 better than his original offer. It developed, however, that if he paid the $1000 cash he would have nothing with which to stock the property and carry forward the farming of it. He then proposed to give a deed of trust on a tract of 160 acres lying adjoining ours, for $1,000 payable $200 per year, with interest, and to secure the remainder of the purchase price on the land being purchased with a deed of trust on same; payments to be made over a period of 18 years with interest at 6%, with the privilege of anticipating any or all of the deferred notes upon 30 days notice. This would mean converting a non-income investment into a good 6% investment on $7,000. At present we are not receiving sufficient from the rental of pasture to pay the taxes and agent's fee.

I reported the matter to the Chairman who directed the offer be accepted, and the papers have been prepared to close the deal.

I may add that the purchaser of the Colorado tract was reported to be a very substantial citizen, owning 160 acres of very good land with improvements, and was in a position to carry forward the improving of it. He is the mail carrier for that route receiving a salary of from $2,400 to $3,600 per year.

Your committee has let to contract the following contracts:

Report of Building Committee.

Your committee has let to contract the following contracts:

At the meeting of the Board of Visitors held in April, 1927, a resolution was adopted directing the Attorney for the University to make settlement with the Estate of Graham F. Blandy, and with Mrs. Blandy, of certain accounts due to said Estate and to Mrs. Blandy by the University for work done upon the Blandy Experimental Farm by Mrs. Blandy's laborers and by the Estate of Graham F. Blandy, and for materials furnished by Mrs. Blandy and by said Estate to the Experimental Farm in the operation and maintenance of said Farm from March 25, th, 1926, the date of Mr. Blandy's death to August 1st, 1926, the date when the University took possession of the property. Said resolution directs the Attorney to make settlement of this account, providing the total of said account did not exceed the sum of $1600.00.

Your Attorney begs to report that acting pursuant to the instructions of said Resolution he made a careful audit of the account in question, and with the assistance of Mr. Reynolds arrived at the conclusion that the sum of $1533.07 was the amount actually due by the University to said Mrs. Blandy and to the Estate of Graham F. Blandy.

Settlement was therefore made with Messrs. Hunt, Hill & Betts, Attorneys for Mrs. Blandy and the said Estate, and I have the receipt of these gentlemen for said sum of $1533.07 accepted by them in full payment of the account in question.
