APPROVAL OF CONTRACT FOR EXTENDED MAINTENANCE SERVICES FOR THE TELEPHONE SYSTEM NOT TO EXCEED FIVE MILLION DOLLARSTHE EXTENDED MAINTENANCE OPTION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In 1980 the University signed a contract with ROLM Corporation for maintenance of the University's owned telephone system; that agreement will expire in 1997. Per-item maintenance rates were specified for the first two years the contract was in existence, but those costs have since been subject to negotiation. Historically, maintenance fees have increased approximately 10.75% per year.

In August 1989 ROLM announced a special maintenance payment plan, the Extended Maintenance Option (EMO). The EMO offers the customer discounted per-item maintenance fees, and those rates are frozen for a period of 60 months. To take advantage of the EMO the customer must prepay his maintenance costs for the five year term, and the payment is based on the customer's equipment configuration as it exists on the date the EMO becomes effective. New equipment added during the term of the EMO will be serviced at the discounted rate.

As it was originally presented, the EMO pertained solely to ROLM's newest switch (the 9751), and only those customers having standard maintenance agreements qualified for the program. While the University does own a 9751 switch, it comprises only 1/18 of the total system. Further, the University's maintenance contract is non-standard. ROLM, however, has agreed to offer the EMO to the University, and it will apply to the entire system, not just the 9751.

The University's EMO payment will be $5,000,000 and the cost is based on the equipment configuration that will be in place as of January 1, 1990. Equipment added during the term of the EMO will be serviced at $5.52 per item per month; the current rate is $6.12. Because there are insufficient cash reserves in Voice Communications' account to fund the initial payment, it will be necessary to obtain a loan from the University's Budget Office for the referenced amount. Equipment additions will not be financed; rather, they will be funded on a "pay as you go" basis.

APPROVAL OF PROPOSED CHANGE IN CURRENT FUNDS GUIDELINES TO INCLUDE INVESTMENTS IN INTERNAL LOANS SUBJECT TO APPROVAL BY THE VICE PRESIDENT FOR BUSINESS AND FINANCEINVESTMENT GUIDELINES FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA CURRENT FUNDS PORTFOLIOInvestment ObjectivesInvestment PhilosophyInvestment PoliciesCustodyREPORT ON CONSTRUCTIONACCEPTANCE OF GIFTS, GRANTS AND CONTRACTS
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Earnings from Current Funds investments provide an important source of unrestricted revenue for the University. Funding for this program includes cash balances in the loan, endowment, plant and University restricted and unrestricted current funds beyond those required to meet the daily cash needs of the University.

The primary investment objective of the fund is to maximize investment income consistent with the need for safety of principal and liquidity. A secondary objective is to realize incremental income or principal appreciation, consistent with the primary objective, through active management of the portfolio. A target yield for the portfolio is to generate a return in excess of the 91 day U.S. Treasury Bill rate.

Portfolio management and trading will be used to achieve the objectives. Strict quality standards have been established to minimize credit risk. In order to protect against or capitalize on sharp fluctuations in interest rates, trading may be substantial at times. Although there are no maturity restrictions, emphasis will be placed on short term, highly marketable securities to insure adequate liquidity.

All securities will remain in the custody of the University of Virginia or its custodian bank except for Certificates of Deposit and Banker's Acceptances purchased from any of the banks noted in 1(c) under Investment Policies. At the option of the Office of the Treasurer these securities may remain in the custody of the bank where the security was purchased.

The President reported that the University Division has construction projects valued at $113 million, and that 30% are from general funds. The Hospital Division has projects valued at 224 million dollars, with 10% from general funds. The Clinch Valley College Division has projects valued at $5.5 million, all from general funds.

The Board voted to accept $19,503,089 in gifts for the fiscal year 1989-90. The President reported that the largest gifts went to the School of Medicine and that the College of Arts and Sciences ranked second in terms of gifts.

The program described here is a pilot program, established for a six-month period, to enhance recruiting of Registered Nurses, and retention of Registered Nurses and Licensed Practical Nurses in 6 Central and 6 West Units and Registered Nurses in the PICU unit. Continuation of this program will occur only after evaluation of program performance and assessment of need as specified in the Program Review Action Plan.

A retention stipend will be paid to Registered Nurses and Licensed Practical Nurses employed in the designated units as of the implementation date of this plan. The stipend for RN's will be $1500, with $750 paid on or about the implementation date, and the balance paid six months later. Payment is contingent upon the Registered Nurse being actively employed on the unit(s) at the scheduled time of payment. The stipend for Licensed Practical Nurses will be $500, with $250 paid on or about the implementation date, and the balance paid six months later. Payment is contingent upon the LPN being actively employed on the unit(s) at the scheduled time of payment. Part-time classified nurses working at least a 50% schedule and who are otherwise eligible will receive a pro-rate stipend. The retention stipend will be paid from the wage payroll and will not be included in the employees' base salary.

A schedule of incentive payments will be established to facilitate recruitment of Registered Nurses into the designated units from other units in the medical center, or from outside the medical center. The availability of this incentive will be advertised to Registered Nurses in the medical center prior to external recruitment.

The recruiting incentive will be $1500, and will be paid in $500 increments over 6 months. Eligibility to receive the incentive is contingent upon the Registered Nurse being actively employed in the unit at the time of the scheduled payment. The recruiting incentive will be administered as follows:

on or near date of hire$ 500three months from hire500six months from hire500---------total$1500

The recruitment incentive will be paid from the wage payroll and will not be included in the employees' base salary.

All Unit-based Registered Nurses, whether full or part time, who are floated to or volunteer to work additional hours on the designated unit(s) will receive an hourly differential of $1.50 per hour. Designated unit-based wage RN's working 20+ hours per week will be eligible for the $1.50/hour differential. This differential is not to be included in the base or overtime rate. Part-time wage RN's working additional hours in the designated units are eligible for the hourly differential, provided they do not work over 40 hours per week.

The stipend or incentive will be paid as a lump sum payment, and charged to the designated units. The Nursing Resources Department will submit Wage Forms to Classification and Compensation to initiate payment.

Concurrent with the implementation of the pilot program, a "Program Review Action Plan" will be developed. The Action Plan will be formatted to include a Retention Section and a Recruitment Section. The Action Plan should be presented in summary statement as opposed to narrative form.

The Retention Component will include 1) a strategy for organizational assessment and evaluation which should identify key issues affecting retention; and 2) an analysis of the key issues and possible solutions.

The Recruitment Component will include 1) a review of current recruiting strategies; 2) an identification of barriers/impediments to recruiting; and 3) new strategies for recruiting. Kate Fraleigh and Pam Mauck will develop the recruiting section of the Action Plan.

The Program Review Action Plan shall be submitted to the Director of Nursing and the Assistant Vice President for Personnel Administration no later than 60 days after program implementation.

Implementation of this program will be Jan. 1, 1990. RN's and LPN's employed in the designated units on January 1 will be eligible for the retention stipend; RN's beginning employment in the units on or after January 2, 1990 will be eligible for the recruiting incentive. Registered Nurses entering the unit after January 1 who receive the recruiting incentive will be eligible for a subsequent retention stipend only if the program continues beyond the duration of the employee's incentive schedule. There will be no recruiting stipend for LPN's entering the designated units.
