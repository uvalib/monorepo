STATEMENT BY MR. DANIEL A. HOFFLER
----------------------------------

Mr. Rector, I would like to disclose as a matter of public record my personal interest in the transaction referenced in the motion that has just been made. Armada-Hoffler is engaged with the University Real Estate Foundation to construct the training facility, in the event the Foundation is awarded the contract by the Federal Office of Personnel Managment. As Chairman of Armada-Hoffler, I have a personal financial interest in the company.

Although Armada-Hoffler's connection with the University Real Estate Foundation occurred before I was appointed to this Board, and the company's contract will be with the Foundation and not with the University, I want to disclose this on the public record.

I also want to make clear that I will not participate in any way or at any time in this Board's discussion or consideration of the Foundation's proposal. I am recusing myself in order to avoid any potential or appearance of a conflict of interest.

Mr. Secretary, please include this statement in the Minutes of the Board's meeting.

The Board covenants that so long as any of the Project Bonds are outstanding, the Institution will pay to the State Treasurer, not less than 30 days before each interest or principal payment date, the amount certified by the State Treasurer to be due and payable on such date as principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Project Bonds.Section 6. The Board covenants that the Institution will pay from time to time its proportionate share of all expenses incurred in connection with the sale and issuance of any series of bonds that includes Project Bonds (the "Bonds") and all expenses thereafter incurred in connection with the Bonds, including without limitation the expense of calculating any rebate to the United States of the earnings derived from the investment of gross proceeds of the Bonds, all as certified by the State Treasurer to the Institution.Section 7. The Board covenants that the Institution will not take or omit to take any action the taking or omission of which will cause the Bonds to be "arbitrage bonds" within the meaning of Section 148 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, including regulations issued pursuant thereto (the "Code"), or otherwise cause interest on the Bonds to be includable in the gross income of the owners thereof for federal income tax purposes under existing laws. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Institution will pay from time to time its proportional share of any rebate to the United States of the earnings derived from the investment of the gross proceeds of the Bonds.Section 8. The Board covenants that the Institution will proceed with due diligence to undertake and complete the Project and that the Institution will spend all of the available proceeds derived from the sale of the Project Bonds for costs associated with the Project and appropriated for the Project by the General Assembly.Section 9. The Board covenants that the Institution will not permit the proceeds of the Project bonds to be used in any manner that would result in (a) 5% or more of such proceeds being used in a trade or business carried on by any person other than a governmental unit, as provided in Section 141(b) of the Code, (b) 5% or more of such proceeds being used with respect to any output facility within the meaning of Section 141(b)(4) of the Code, or (c) 5% or more of such proceeds being used directly or indirectly to make or finance loans to any persons other than a governmental unit, as provided in Section 141(c) of the Code. The Institution need not comply with such covenants if the Institution obtains the written approval of the State Treasurer and an opinion of nationally recognized bond counsel acceptable to the Treasury Board that such covenants need not be complied with to prevent the interest on the Bonds from being includable in the gross income of the owners thereof for federal income tax purposes.Section 10. The Board covenants that for so long as any of the Bonds are outstanding, the Institution will not enter into any operating lease, management contract or similar agreement with any person or entity, other than a state or local governmental unit, for all or any portion of the Project without first obtaining the written approval of the State Treasurer and an opinion of nationally recognized bond counsel acceptable to the Treasury Board that entering into such agreement will not cause the interest on the Bonds to be included in the gross income of the owners thereof for federal income tax purposes.Section 11. The Board covenants that for so long as any of the Bonds are outstanding, the Institution will not sell or dispose of all or any part of the Project without first obtaining the written approval of the State Treasurer and an opinion of nationally recognized bond counsel acceptable to the Treasury Board that such sale or disposition will not cause interest on the Bonds to be included in the gross income of the owners thereof for federal income tax purposes.Section 12. The officers of the Institution are authorized and directed to execute and deliver all certificates and instruments and to take all such further action as may be considered necessary or desirable in connection with the sale and issuance of the Bonds.Section 13. The Board acknowledges that the Treasury Board will rely on the representations and covenants set forth herein in issuing the Bonds, that such covenants are critical to the security for the Bonds and the exclusion of the interest on the Bonds from the gross income of the owners thereof for federal income tax purposes, that the Board will not repeal, revoke, rescind or amend any of such covenants without first obtaining the written approval of the Treasury Board, and that such covenants will be binding upon the Board so long as any of the Bonds are outstanding.Section 14. This resolution shall take effect immediately.

POLICY ON UNIVERSITY-RELATED FOUNDATIONS
----------------------------------------

I. Purpose of the Policy

A. Affiliated foundations exist because of, and for, the public institutions they support and whose names they share. Looking beyond their separate corporate identities, the foundations can be depositories of substantial funds charitably donated for the benefit of public higher education institutions and their related activities. Their assets exist essentially because of public tax policy and publicly spirited donations. As a consequence, fiduciary obligations are impressed by law on the management of such funds.1 1This policy statement is drawn from the "Prologue" of the Attorney General's Memorandum dated May 20, 1983, to the Presidents of Virginia's Public Universities and Colleges. The Attorney General's Memorandum contains a comprehensive assessment of affiliated foundations, as well as recommendations regarding institutional oversight and foundation accountability. These fiduciary obligations fall primarily on the officers and directors of the foundation.

The Attorney General's Memorandum contains a comprehensive assessment of affiliated foundations, as well as recommendations regarding institutional oversight and foundation accountability.

B. The University of Virginia has a vital interest in, and recognizes the value of, University-related foundations that are established and operated to solicit funds in the University's name, to manage and invest gifts and property for the University's benefit, and/or to promote or sponsor programs in support of the University's activities.

C. The Board of Visitors is committed to providing quality support for the fundraising efforts of each University-related foundation, and to that end seeks to promote efficiency and coordination among, as well as maintain independence and integrity within, all University-related foundations.

D. To protect the University's interests, and as a condition of the foundations' use of the University's name and resources, it is the policy of the Board of Visitors that University-related foundations shall be:

(1) established and organized solely for the University's benefit;

(2) operated in accordance with generally accepted business and accountability principles; and

(3) managed in a manner consistent with the foundations' own enabling documents and the University's purpose, mission, and procedures, as specifically set forth in this Policy.

II. Establishment and Organization of Foundations

A. A University-related foundation2 2All references in this Policy of the Board of Visitors shall include subsidiaries and affiliates of University-related foundations as well as the foundations themselves. ("Foundation") is an organization that is created and operated exclusively to benefit the University or one or more of the University's units.3 3The term "unit" as used throughout this Policy encompasses schools, departments, and other components of the University. A Foundation as defined for purposes of this Policy is one which uses the University's name, consumes University resources, occupies University space, or enters into transactions with the University which require the concurrence of the University. A Foundation has as its purpose one or more of the following:

All references in this Policy of the Board of Visitors shall include subsidiaries and affiliates of University-related foundations as well as the foundations themselves.

Such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. New business ventures are considered to be any significant change from current business activities; e.g., a Foundation which has been engaged primarily in fundraising proposes to purchase and lease commercial office space.

D. A Foundation shall be organized and operated as a Virginia non-profit, non-stock corporation or association that is legally separate from the University. It shall obtain and maintain status as a tax-exempt, charitable organization under State and Federal income tax laws so contributions and bequests to it will be deductible charitable contributions as provided by Federal income tax law.
