At a meeting of the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia, called by the Rector and held thereat, in pursuance of notice, on the first day of November, 1900,-

Present:- Hon. Chas. P. Jones, Rector, and Visitors, Messrs. Downing, Harmon, Miles and Moore.

Sundry reports and petitions were received, including the Faculty's report, the Chairman's report which contained Dr. Barringer's resignation as Chairman to take effect in June, 1901; all of which having been read and considered, the following was enacted:—

Resolved that the request of the Charlottesville City and Suburban Railway be referred to a Committee consisting of Messrs. Downing, Moore and the Superintendent of Grounds and Buildings with power to act in the premises, and they are instructed to see, in case they grant said request, that the interests of the University are properly safe-guarded by proper written contract.

Resolved that an appropriation of $500.00, or so much thereof as may be needed, be and the same is hereby made out of any available funds for the purpose of relaying gas-pipes to the Rouss Laboratory, Mechanical Laboratory and Chemical Laboratory; but this resolution shall be of no effect until a contract in writing satisfactory to the Proctor shall have been made with the gas Co., by the Proctor; and, when the new pipes are laid, it shall be provided that the private consumers of gas in the University grounds shall not take their gas through the University meters.

Resolved that the report of the Committee on printing, this day made to the Board, is hereby approved and adopted; and the Chairman is directed to put the suggestions contained in said report into practical operation, as far as possible.

The report is as follows:

"To the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia.

The subject of the University publications; the establishment of \`The University of Virginia Press' and the general subject of the printing annually done for the University have been carefully considered. The printing and publication done by the faculty are the following:

"1.- Stationery, including office blanks of various kinds covering the several departments, which are now given orders independently.

"2.- Circulars, a miscellaneous series, varying in character to meet the changing needs of the work. Pointed in some measure by most of the departments.

"3.- Catalogues-

I.

(a) The General Catalogue, covering the whole subject of instruction, etc., and information usual in such a publication. About 6,000 copies.

(b) The Law Special, a reprint of the section of the general catalogue devoted to the Law Department. About 2,000 copies.

(c) The Medical Special, a reprint of the section of the general catalogue devoted to the Medical Department. About 2,000 copies.

II. A Manual of Information, a small descriptive pamphlet mailed with the catalogue; illustrated. Not printed annually, but as needed.

"4.- The Alumni Bulletin, heretofore published quarterly. The Applicants for Ph. D. are required to publish before graduation, at their own expense, a dissertation on some subject in the course.

The students publish, at their own expense, The Annual, or "Corks and Curls," The Magazine, Monthly Topics, the weekly college paper.

Some difficulty attends getting bids upon all the printing required on account of the diversity of the work that is needed, some of it being in small and varying quantities. It seems, however, that sound business principles require that the necessary contract for all printing should be under the control of one central authority, and, as far as practicable, the contract for the whole should be let at one time to the same person, and no bills for printing should be paid out of any of the appropriations made to the different departments. Something, though perhaps not much, would be saved in this way. It is therefore recommended that contracts for all printing be made through the Chairman's Office. The contract should be made to include the Doctor's Dissertations required in the Ph.D. course, the same to be paid for, of course, as at present, by the applicant for the degree, but by this means the applicant would get the benefit of the reduced cost.

The bids, moreover, should allow an option to the students to include their publications in the same contract.

All publications provided for in such contract should bear the imprint "University of Virginia Press."

"It is likely that this imprint will be gradually extended to publications of more or less variety, but it is not believed that it will be carried on any books of general circulation, indeed it would not be the part of wisdom for members of our faculty to publish their more ambitions works except with the aid of a well established publishing house having control of all the machinery essential to proper advertisement and distribution.

"It is deemed of the greatest importance that the Alumni Bulletin should be continued. By publishing three issues of the Bulletin and making the catalogue the third issue of a University series and mailing the whole as second class matter, a considerable saving in postage can be made, and it is recommended that this plan be adopted.

"It is believed that the publication of supplemental bulletins to be issued by the different departments of the University as parts of the University series of publications, can be made at small cost. A moment's consideration of this subject will show that if systematically carried out it will result in great good, not only by adding to the reputation of those members of the faculty who participate in it, but by giving to all interested, a means of information as to what the University is and what it is doing. Nothing is needed to add to its prosperity and its fame except that these facts be known.

"If the Board approves of such publications, it is recommended that it gives them the weight of its commendation.

"It is believed that if a practical effort were made and properly persisted in, a sufficient amount of advertisements, in the literary and scientific publications, could be secured to defray a considerable proportion of the cost of the publications: This plan has been adopted in similar cases elsewhere with very satisfactory results as it is said, and it is not considered that there is anything undignified or unbecoming in developing this means of reducing the expense and thereby enabling us to enlarge and improve the publications. The Chairman's office is now well equipped for good work along this line, and it is recommended that the Chairman be urged to carry it into practical operation.

Resolved that the recommendation of the faculty be adopted, and that J. T. Thornton be allowed to substitute English Liter- ature for History in his B.A. and M.A. degrees.

Resolved that the recommendation of the Faculty be adopted, that the announcement in the catalogue relative to the B.A. course in Romance Languages be changed to make it conform to the rearrangement of courses in Modern Languages.

Resolved that the Faculty be and is hereby requested to study the details of a modified plan as to the Public School Scholarships, and to put the same in force after approval by the Executive Committee, provided the same does not call for an expenditure of over $1500.00

Resolved that, in accordance with the recommendation of the Faculty, the degree of B.A. be conferred upon a student who completes ten of the B.A. courses selected from the following list, of which list one must be taken from each of the seven groups indicated, the other three being chosen at will from any of the B.A. or M.A. courses; except that, if the student elects both Latin and Greek, he is required to complete only nine B.A. courses.

I. Latin, Greek.

II. French, German.

III. English Language, English Literature.

IV. History, Logic, and Psychology.

V. Mathematics, Astronomy, Mechanics.

VI. Physics, Chemistry.

VII. Botany, Zoology, Geology.

The courses in groups No. 1 and No. 5 are double, that is, in Latin, Greek and Mathemetics graduation will be required in both "a" and "b" classes; and in Astronomy and Mechanics graduation will also be required in class "a" of Mathmetics. Economics, though not included in any of the groups, may be taken as an elective at large in the B.A. course. Spanish and Italian are incorporated in the M.A. course in Romance Languages.

Resolved that in the course of Civil Engineering the "c" class in Mathematics be replaced by Industrial Chemistry, and in the courses in Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, the "c" class in pure mathematics be replaced by a course in constructive mechanism, as recommended by the Faculty.

Resolved that the recommendation of the Faculty that Mr. E. H. Farrar, Jr., a student, be relieved from the payment of tuition fees this session for Latin and Romance Languages be adopted.

Resolved that, in accordance with the recommendation of the Faculty, Rev. H. Clinton Collins, M. D., a missionary to China at home on a furlough, be given permission to review at the University such part of the medical course as he may desire without payment of fees.

The report of Professors Echols and Page in relation to receipts and expenditures connected with the publication of the "Annals of Mathematics," showing a balance of $24.88 in their hands, is received and adopted, and they are permitted to use said sum of $24.88 in the purchase of a clock, chairs and a manifolding machine for the Mathematical lecture rooms.

Resolved that the request of A. V. Dabney, approved by Faculty, to be allowed to stand the special fall examinations in the Law Department without the expense incident to the course, be and the same is approved.

The Board proceeded to elect an Executive Committee to serve until the next annual meeting, when Visitors Harmon, Jones, Bryan, Miles and Glass were elected as such Committee.

Resolved that Messrs. John P. Pettyjohn & Son be allowed to proceed to the completion of the hospital under construction at the University of Virginia in accordance with his proposition which is as follows: that $4950.00 shall be paid now; that $4150.00 more shall be paid when the plastering, plumbing and electrical wiring are completed and accepted in accordance with the contract, and the balance of the contract price to be paid July 1st, 1901, without interest, provided the building is at that time turned over to the University and certified to by the architect as being according to the plans and specifications and free from all encumbrances.

Resolved that the application of Irenalous Shuler for return of fees, or part thereof, for last session be rejected.

Resolved that the thanks of the Board of Visitors be and are hereby tendered to Dr. & Mrs. Jas. A. Harrison for the gift to the University of Virginia of two hundred volumes bearing on Southern Literature, and that the Secretary of the Board be di- rected to convey the same in writing to the generous donors.

Resolved that Mrs. M. S. Towles, subject to the direction and approval of the Proctor and Superintendent of Grounds & Buildings, be allowed to open and put in condition for use, at her own expense, a road from the road in front of her farm to the road leading to the cemetery, and also that the road thus to be opened may at any time be closed by resolution of this Board.

Resolved, upon consideration of Prof. Thornton's letter to the Board, dated Oct. 9, 1900, that the resolution adopted at the June (1900) meeting authorizing him to expend the sum of $1500.00 to secure a temporary instructor in the School of Applied Mathematics, and also relieving him of his duties in that school during the present session, be rescinded, and that Prof. Thornton be requested to make such efforts in the interest of the University along the lines and in the manner suggested in his letter as his duties and opportunities may permit, his expenses to be paid by the Proctor.

The Committee having in charge the revision of the laws of the University made their report, which was considered by the Board and adopted as a whole; and Dr. Mallet and Mr. Harmon are requested to superintend the printing of the same, and the preparation of a suitable index.

Resolved that the application for a bath room, for use of the students on Dawson's Row and Monroe Hill, be referred to the Superintendent of Grounds and Buildings for such action as he may deem proper.

On motion, the meeting adjourned.
