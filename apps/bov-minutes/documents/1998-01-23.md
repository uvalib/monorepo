CLINICAL FACULTY REMUNERATION PLAN

For the purpose of this plan, eligible clinical faculty members are those faculty who are employed by the School of Medicine and who also provide patient care services pursuant to a contract with Health Services Foundation. The Dean of the School of Medicine has the authority to include other faculty in this compensation plan, subject to the approval of the Vice President and Provost for Health Sciences. The current sources of Clinical Faculty Remuneration include the following:

Clinical Practice Faculty Earnings (Health Services Foundation) Research Grants (School of Medicine) > Tuition (School of Medicine) State Funds for Medical Education (School of Medicine) Endowments and Gifts (School of Medicine) Hospital Clinical Revenue (Medical Center) Graduate Medical Education Funds (Medical Center)

All clinical faculty shall receive a Negotiated Salary consisting of two portions. The first portion called the Base Salary will define the institution's minimal financial responsibility to each clinical faculty member, subject to the availability of funds and further Board of Visitors' (BOV) actions. The Base Salary for each academic rank for 1997-98 is as follows:

Academic RankAmountChair $82,500Professor $65,000Associate Professor$55,000Assistant Professor$45,000Instructor$35,000

These amounts may be adjusted from time to time by the Board of Visitors upon recommendation of the President. Data from the American Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC) and American-Association of University Professors (AAUP) and the State of Virginia's recommendation for Medical School Faculty salary may be used to determine the base salary levels.

Additional salary beyond the authorized base may be paid to clinical faculty and will be designated as Variable Salary. The sum of the Base Salary and the Variable Salary will be the Negotiated Salary. Fringe benefits and retirement will be calculated on the basis of Negotiated Salary to the extent permitted by law. Each new faculty member will receive the negotiated salary stated in his or her appointment letter for 36 months while employed by the School of Medicine, subject however to availability of funding by contemplated sources, approval by the Dean and the Vice President and Provost for Health Sciences, and further Board of Visitors' action. Subsequently, the Negotiated Salary (Variable Salary portion) may be adjusted annually according to the faculty member's productivity during the prior 12 months. The Variable Salary may be unchanged, raised or lowered. Reductions in Negotiated Salary are not anticipated to exceed 10% per year, again subject to availability of funding, approval by the Dean and Vice President and Provost for Health Sciences or further Board of Visitors' action. The Negotiated Salary will not exceed the 60th percentile of the AAMC Faculty Salary Survey data by rank and speciality.

Faculty members whose annual revenues exceed their expenses may receive an incentive payment provided that their department ends the fiscal year with a positive balance, and all requirements of the 1990 Faculty Practice Plan, as it may be amended, are met.

Departmental accounting and reporting systems shall be standardized as directed by the Dean and the Vice President and Provost. Productivity, qualitative, quantitative and financial, will be documented individually per the attached Clinical Faculty Performance Report and Statement of Revenue and Expenses, as amended by the Dean and Vice President and Provost, and information regarding productivity will be provided to the faculty member, the Department Chair and the Dean annually. The Health Services Foundation will distribute monthly clinical income statements to faculty members documenting their income.

The Statement of Revenue and Expenses (see Document, Attachment B) will be a major determining factor in the Negotiated Salary for the year. The difference between all revenue and expenses including the Negotiated Salary should produce a positive balance. Chairs can attribute revenue to faculty in recognition of documented, non- revenue generating activities that are vital to the mission of the institution such as teaching, providing uncompensated indigent care, administrative duties and leadership responsibilities.

Departmental support to a faculty member for professional meetings, travel, subscriptions, dues, tuition, books and entertainment shall not exceed 5% of that faculty member's Negotiated Salary.

Final decisions on compensation will be made by the Dean and the Vice President and Provost upon recommendation by the department chairs. Nothing in this Plan is intended to create an express or implied contractual entitlement to receipt of a particular level of compensation by any faculty member. This Plan is subject to amendment at any time.
