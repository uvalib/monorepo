RESOLVED, That the thanks of the Rector and Visitors be extended to John Bassett Moore by President Alderman for his very splendid and valuable gift to the University of Virginia.

The following letter was received from Mr. John Bassett Moore in reference to his gift:

On the approach of the Centennial Celebration, and on the Founder's birthday, I desire to enter upon the execution of a long-cherished design to present to my Alma Mater a library of international law. I would begin the collection this year, and would from time to time add to it, making a final contribution, including probably a part of my own library, under my will or such indications as my family would carry out.

To this gift the principal condition I attach is that the collection shall form a part of the Law Library and shall be kept intact. Although the volumes included in it would not all be what are commonly called law-books, yet they would all have some special relation to what I have found the needs of the student, the teacher, and the practitioner of international law actually to be. Moreover, having always been accustomed to look upon the body of rules governing the intercourse of nations as a branch of law, I wish in every way to emphasize the legal nature of the subject, and particularly to empress on those who would understand the system, and above all on those who would essay to expound it, the fundamental requisite of a thorough and comprehensive education in law, private as well as public.

I should also be glad if the collection might be distinctively preserved as the John Bassett Moore Library of International Law. This request is mainly prompted by the hope that the example, with which the collection thus named would be associated, of a life largely spent in the study, the exposition and the administration of international law, might quicken in others an interest in the subject and in the public service.

Believe me to be, as always,

On behalf of the Board, Dr. Alderman wrote Mr. Moore as follows:

It was my honnor and pleasure to make known to the Rector and Visitors of the University, at their meeting on April 20, 1921, your letter setting forth your gift - the John Bassett Moore Library of International Law - to the University of Virginia. I was directed by the Board to express to you their gratitude and appreciation of this splendid service to the University. The Board is largely composed of members of the legal profession, and you may imagine their pleasure and satisfaction at the thought of such new strength will be added to that side of our University life. I was also instructed to say that your letter will be spread upon the minutes and that all of the conditions will be faithfully adhered to.

Assuring you of the appreciation of the whole University, I have the honor to remail,

The following budget for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1921 was presented by the President and adopted:

The following resolution relative to automatic increases in the salaries of full professors was adopted:

RESOLVED, That the regulation adopted by the Board May 8, 1914, concerning automatic increases in professors' salaries after six and twelve years respectively of satisfactory service, be and is hereby rescinded.

At the request of the President, the following resolution was adopted, changing the title of adjunct professor to assistant professor.

The matters in the death of L. L. Newman were discussed. Mr. W. Allan Perkins, attorney for the University, was present and went over with the Board certain questions in connection therewith. The matter was disposed of in the following resolution:

RESOLVED, That the L. L. Newman matter be referred to the Executive Committee with power to act, and that the said committee will meet at the call of the Rector.

In the matter of the McKim insurance question, the following action was had:

In the matter of the letter of the American Security and Trust Company, Trustee under the Will of the late Dr. Randolph H. McKim, under date of December 16th, 1920, requesting the release by the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, of its right to certain funds which will ultimately pass to it under Dr. McKim's will, Dr. Alderman recalled to the Board its action taken at the meeting held on February 14th, 1921, at which time the following resolution was adopted:

"RESOLVED, That in the opinion of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, they have no right to make such release, however much they may desire so to do."

Dr. Alderman further stated that since this action of the Boardhad been communicated to the Trustee under Dr. McKim's Will, he had received a letter from Mrs. McKim, and that in view of the explanation of the situation contained in the letter and certain facts with reference to Dr. McKim's wishes therein set out by Mrs. McKim, and which were not mentioned by the Trust Co. in its communication, he felt that the whole question should be reconsidered.

Mrs. McKim's letter was thereupon read to the Board by Mr. Perkins, attorney for the University, and the opinion given by him that the action desired of this Board in relinquishing the rights of the University in the fund in question was within its powers, and that such release would not be an ultra vires act.

It was thereupon

RESOLVED, That the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, earnestly desiring to respect the wishes of the late Dr. Randolph H. McKim, and being advised by Mrs. McKim that it was his desire that the whole of the proceeds of the Six Thousand Dollar policy of insurance held by him in the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York should pass to his two daughters, hereby relinquishes and assigns to the said two daughters of Dr. McKim, all right and interest in and to the proceeds of said policy of insurance which may have already vested, or which may hereafter vest, in the University of Virginia, by reason of the terms of said policy, the provision of Dr. McKim's will, or by operation of law.

And the Rector is hereby appointed a Committee of one, and is requested to convey to Mrs. McKim the knowledge of this action, and the assurance of the Board's sincere regret that in its previous consideration of the matter the full facts, so clearly set out in her letter to Dr. Alderman, were not before it.

Mr. H. S. King made application for a fifty year lease of a certain building lot between the Entrance Building and the C. & O. Railway at a rentall of $1200 per year. After a full discussion of the matter, the Board reached the unanimous opinion that it would not be to the best interest of the University to grant a lease for so long a term.

With respect to the petition of the Chamber of Commerce of Charlottesville for the transfer of a tract of University land as a site for a school for the blind, the Board decided that it had no authority to dispose of any of its land.

The following resolution relative to the lease of the Tea Room was adopted:

The following rules governing the collecting and refunding of students' fees were adopted:

Commencing with the session of 1921-22 the Bursar shall observe the following rules and regulations concerning the collecting and refunding of fees:

Collecting of Fees

When the aggregate charge for University Fee, Tuition Fee, Laboratory Fees and Room Rent does not exceed $50 for the session, the total amount shall be paid upon registration.

If said fees aggregate more than $50 but do not exceed $100, one-half thereof shall be paid upon registration and the remainder at the begining of the second term.

When the fees aggregate more than $100, payment shall be made one-third upon registration; one-third at the opening of the second term and the remainder at the opening of the third term.

If any payment remain unpaid for fifteen days after the date on which it is due, the Bursar shall immediately notify the Dean of the department in which such student is entered of the delinquency and such student shall by him be required to at once cease attending lectures, using laboratories, library, gymnasium, athletic grounds or buildings, boarding at the dining hall, and making use of any other privileges as a student until his financial relations with the University have been arranged satisfactorily with the Bursar.

Refunding of Fees

A student withdrawing within five days after registering shall have his fees refunded in full, except the sum of $5 to cover cost of registration, and his name shall be stricken from the rolls.

If he withdraw or is dropped from the rolls for any cause after the fifth day of the term and before the middle thereof, his fees shall be returned pro-rate.

If he withdraw or is dropped from the rolls for any cause after the middle of the term no refund shall be made for the respective term, except in case of sickness when the refund shall be pro-rated upon certificate of the University Physician or other reputable practitioner.

In any case a minimum charge of $5 shall be made to cover cost of registration.

Laboratory fees shall be refunded upon statement of professor in charge, except where the withdrawal is within five days after registering.

The following committee was appointed to select a site for the proposed gymnasium: Dr. Alderman, Dr. Lambeth, Dr. Warren, Thos. J. Michie, Jr., together with Visitors Bryan, Robertson and Duke.

The Rector, Chairman of the Executive Committee, submitted the following report:

February 23, 1921.

The Executive Committee of the Rector and Visitors met on this date, pursuant to call of the Chairman, in the office of Mr. Frederic W. Scott in Richmond.

There were present Chairman Bryan, and Messrs. Scott, Hatton and Hart, and Secretary E. I. Carruthers.

The following letters from Dr. Alderman to the Rector, and from Dr. Alderman to Dr. Buttrick, with reference to an application to the General Education Board for a contribution of $50,000 to be applied to salary increases, were presented:

The General Education Board is holding its mid-winter meeting on February 24th, in New York City. I have just had a visit from the fiscal agent of that Board. I am convinced that the sum of $50,000 may be obtained through that Board from the sum given by Mr. Rockefeller some years ago for salary increases in American colleges. Certain sums have already been granted to the University of North Carolina, William and Mary, and the University of Alabama, under just the same circumstances. I could not bring the matter before the Board at the other meeting because I had not then had the visit of the representative of the Board here. It is necessary for the General Board to know that I am speaking by authority of the governing body, or they would not feel inclined to make any gifts to a State institution without fore-knowledge that it would be acceptable. Mr. Carruthers will explain any details connected with the situation. I am hoping to have a wire from you by Wednesday night, Hotel Wolcott, 31st Street, New York, authorizing me to present the inclosed application. It was specifically stated that action indicating the purpose to make this application by the Executive Committee would be sufficient.

On behalf of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, I am submitting, through you, to the General Education Board, an application for an appropriation of $50,000, to be applied to salary increases of the instructional staff in the University during the academic years 1921-22, 1922-23, 1923-24. It is desired to use the sum asked for both to relieve the present salary situation as regards increases already made and to make such further increases as would tend to stabilize justly the present salary schedule and to afford relief to those manifestly underpaid. The University expects to obtain the necessary funds within the time mentioned to take the place of this grant in order that they may guarantee the permanence of the increased scale and to increase it in so far as that may appear resonable and helpful to the institution.

The fundamental reasons for this request is the inability of the University to meet the need for salary increases without serious deficit and the constantly increasing demands of the unusual influx of new students due to the same causes which are operating in all American colleges and universities.

Mr. Carruthers stated that Mr. Arnett, the fiscal expert of the General Education Board, had visited the University and had gone carefully into its financial condition with respect to its ability to make adequate increases in the salaries of its teaching staff, and finding it could not do so without crippling other departments and from the further fact that certain increases had already been made which has imposed a financial burden out of proportion to its resources, he would recommend a gift of $50,000 to cover a period of three years, from July 1, 1921 to be used in rectifying some existing inequalities in the salary list and to help carry the burden already imposed.

On motion of Mr. Hatton, the letter of application by Dr. Alderman to Dr. Buttrick, above set out, was approved and the Rector requested to wire Dr. Alderman of the action taken.

Prof. J. L. Newcomb, Chairman of the Centennial Celebration Committee, presented the tentative program with estimates of costs of same, as follows:

(Signed) J. L. Newcomb, Chairman.

Mr. Hatton then offered the following, which was adopted:

WHEREAS the Executive Committee has this day considered the estimate of expenses submitted by the Committee on Centennial Celebration, which estimate is in writing signed by the Chairman of such committee on Centennial Celebration and hereto attached, and the Executive Committee being unanimously of the opinion that the expenses shown on such estimate are necessary and reasonable, therefore be it

RESOLVED, That the sume of $37,310 is hereby appropriated to meet said expenses, the same to be expended by the Bursar upon vouchers approved by the chairman of the Committee on Centennial Celebration and countersigned by the President of the University.

The Bursar is hereby authorized to provide the funds necessary for this expenditure from any unexpended balances available and the amount so expended shall become a first charge against all moneys collected for the University of Virginia Centennial Endowment Fund.

Major A. M. Dobie, Executive Director of the Centennial Endowment Fund, was present and presented an estimate of expenses of his department incident to raising the proposed endowment fund of $3,000,000, as follows:

Pursuant to our conversation in Mr. Scott's office last Wednesday, the following is the estimate of the epxenses of the Endowment Fund campaign which I was to supply you. You will understand of course, that it is very difficult to make a close estimate, because we much be ready to meet conditions as they arise, which may call for additional and unforeseen expense:

If you deem it necessary to enlarge any on this by itemizing the expense of salaries of Crenshaw, his stenographers, and Trimmer and his stenographers, you may do so, as you have the figures available.

Mr. Hatton offered the following, which was adopted:

WHEREAS the Executive Committee has this day considered the estimate of expenses submitted by the Executive Director of the Centennial Endowment Fund, which estimate is in writing, signed by the Executive Secretary, Chas. A. McKeand, and hereto attached;

And the Executive Committee being unanimously of the opinion that the expenses shown on such estimate are necessary and reasonable, therefore be it

RESOLVED, That the sum of $33,907.54 is hereby appropriated to meet said expenses, the same to be expended by the Bursar upon vouchers approved by the Executive Director and countersigned by the Chairman of the Centennial Endowment Fund Committee.

The Bursar is hereby authorized to provide the funds necessary for the expenditure from an unexpended balances available and the amount so expended shall become a first charge against all moneys collected for the University of Virginia Centennial Endowment Fund.

With respect to the foregoing, the following resolution was adopted:

RESOLVED, That the report of the Executive Committee be approved, and the Bursar be and is hereby authorized to borrow on behalf of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia from the depositories of University funds such sums, not to exceed $70,000, as may be needed to cover the expenses of the Centennial Celebration, and of the Centennial Endowment Committee in raising the proposed endowment. This indebtedness, including interest thereon, is to become the first charge against any and all monies collected for the University of Virginia Centennial Endowment Fund.

The following matter, presented at the request of Mr. Duke, was considered, placed upon its passage and defeated:

RESOLVED, That the President be requested, at least ten days before the meeting of the Board of Visitors, to send to each member of said Board a synopsis of the business to be transacted at its next meeting.

In connection with the foregoing, the President stated that while he would gladly comply with the terms of the motion if it were possible to do so, it would be impossible, as the matters to come up at the meetings could not be put in shape frequently until the day before the date set, and, further, to give any synopsis of value to the members would require more copying than his present office force could handle.

The meeting then adjourned.

On the approach of the Centennial Celebration, and on the Founder's birthday, I desire to enter upon the execution of a long-cherished design to present to my Alma Mater a library of international law. I would begin the collection this year, and would from time to time add to it, making a final contribution, including probably a part of my own library, under my will or such indications as my family would carry out.

I should also be glad if the collection might be distinctively preserved as the John Bassett Moore Library of International Law. This request is mainly prompted by the hope that the example, with which the collection thus named would be associated, of a life largely spent in the study, the exposition and the administration of international law, might quicken in others an interest in the subject and in the public service.
