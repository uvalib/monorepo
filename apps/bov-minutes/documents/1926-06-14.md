It is my sad duty to announce to the faculty and students of the University the death of Professor Charles Hancockk in the fifty-seventh year of his age.

For nearly eighteen years Charles Hancock has been Professor of Mechanical Engineering in the University of Virginia. His death deprives the University of the services of a sound scholar, a teacher of devotion and excellence, and a high-minded gentleman, whose personality and character enriched the life and will enrich the traditions of the University. To know Professor Hancock was to love him and to honor him. During a long period of pain and suffering, he awaited death in the loftiest spirit of Christian courage, thinking only of others and never of himself. It is meet and proper that this University should cherish his name and reverence his memory.

The funeral services for Professor Hancock will take place at St. Paul's Memorial Church tomorrow, Thursday, at eleven o'clock. I declare the suspension of all exercises of the University from the hours of ten-thirty to one-thirty."

The Committee appointed to select and recommend sites for fraternity houses on grounds of the University submitted the following report which was received and adopted as follows:

The Committee appointed to select and recommend sites for fraternity houses met today and after viewing the locations, make the following recommendation:

1\. That four lots fronting on the Barracks Road in the rear of Peabody Hall, 75 X 100 ft. each, be allotted for building sites.

2\. That four lots fronting on the Towles Road 75 X 100 ft. each be allotted for building sites, as indicated on the appended map.

With respect to the foregoing allocations of building sites, the following resolution was adopted:

RESOLVED, That the locations for fraternity houses be awarded in order of priority. The awards to be subject to work being commenced within twelve months and plans to be subject to the approval of the Buildings and Grounds Committee, and all to be under standard contract of lease.

The President stated that the women students of the University had made a request for the use of the pool and gymnasium, and the Board directed that the use of the same be extended them in the descretion of the President, when and so long as the arrangement may be practiced.

President Alderman gave to the Board a full statement of the effort made by him since December 1st, 1925 to raise the sum of $1,400,000 for buildings for the medical sciences in the Department of Medicine. He spoke of the struggle within the General Education Board for a change in their policy as regards tax supported institutions. He spoke of the struggle before the General Assembly of Virginia, for their contributions of $250,000, and he read the following list of givers to the fund, reported as of June 14th:

He expressed the hope that the matter would be closed shortly by a single gift of $100,000. President Alderman referred to the fact that this task had been done without organization, without the machinery of a campaign "drive" and had fallen largely upon his shoulders. He expressed the hope that this would be the last burden of this kind he would be called upon to assume.

The President was authorized to extend the thanks and appreciation of the Board to the several donors and Messrs. Williams, Hart and Hull were appointed a special committee to prepare a resolution of appreciation to President Alderman for his services in raising the fund for the medical building.

A committee on Medical Buildings was appointed from the Board consisting of Messrs. Scott, Rinehart and McIntire to co-operate with a committee from the faculty of the Medical School.

The President advised that he had been successful in securing from the Trustees of the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial a grant of $137,500 over a period of five years, for research in social science, and presented the communication for the foundation together with his reply, which were spread upon the minutes:

At a meeting of the Board of Trustees of the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial held on May 24, 1926, the following resolution was passed on behalf of the University of Virginia:

No. 707 RESOLVED, that a sum not to exceed $137,500 be, and it hereby is, appropriated to the University of Virginia toward its program of research in social science for the period beginning July 1, 1926 and ending June 30, 1931; payments to be made as follows; $27,500 in each of the five years in the above named period; any sums paid by the memorial and unexpended for the above named purpose as of June 30, 1931 to be refunded to the Memorial.

Under this resolution the Memorial does not assume any obligation of any character beyond the period which is mentioned in the resolution. Perhaps I should point out that at the end of the five year period mentioned, any amount not expended under this resolution will lapse, but that unexpended amounts may be carried forward from year to year within the term of the appropriation.

I have this day received your communication of June 3rd containing the resolution of the Board of Trustees of the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial, wherein a sum not to exceed $137,500 was appropriated to the University of Virginia toward its program of research in the Social Sciences. I shall present this resolution to the Rector and Visitors of the University at their meeting on June 14th, and shall at that time convey their expression, as the Governing Body of the University, of their deep appreciation of this action. In the meantime, I can perhaps personally assure you of my own profound sense of obligation to you for the patient thought you have given to the matter, and I assure you that I shall want to carry out the work which this money is intended to promote, with the very highest desire to have the exact thing that the Board intends to get done in our American life.

I have written to President Chase, trying to make a tentative date for us to meet in Washington, and will let you know as soon as I hear from him.

I shall cause your letter of June 3rd to be spread upon our minutes, in order that all conditions surrounding this grant may be thoroughly understood and carried out. I shall make announcement of the whole matter on June 14th, and then we shall get to work.

The Committee appointed to prepare resolutions of appreciation to President Alderman in connection with the medical buildings fund were requested also to prepare suitable resolutions covering his services in securing the grant for the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial.

The President presented the following communication from the Richmond Alumni offering the sum of $4,000 per year for five years to support a Research Professor in the School of History:

At a meeting of the committee representing the Richmond Alumni of the University, it was unanimously voted to offer to the University the support of a Research Professor in the School of History. We expect to raise $4,000 a year for five years for the support of this Chair. We decided to specify history because we feel that it will make a stronger appeal to the Alumni. We will be in a position later in the summer to arrange the details necessary to establishing this Chair with the authorities of the University.

The Board accepted, with deep appreciation the said gift, and directed the President to express the same to the Richmond Chapter.

A petition signed by 17 women students of the University was presented praying that women during the winter session be admitted, under the same conditions of age and training now required for the professional degrees, as eligible for the cultural baccalaurate degree of this University.

Action on same was deferred until the fall meeting.

A communication was received from Dr. A. F. Voshell asking that he be permitted to erect a porch on the rear of the Fickenscher house, and that the University aid in defraying the expense of same. On motion, duly made and seconded, it was

RESOLVED, That permission be granted Dr. A. F. Voshell to erect a porch on the rear of the Fickenscher house, and that the University reimburse him for the cost of same not to exceed the sum of $100.

A committee, consisting of Messrs. Rinehart, Williams and Hull, was appointed to act with a like committee from the Alumni Association to consider an appropriate testimonial to President Alderman to be erected in or attached to the new medical buildings, in appreciation of his services in raising the funds with which to erect them.

We will be in a position later in the summer to arrange the details necessary to establishing this Chair with the authorities of the University.
