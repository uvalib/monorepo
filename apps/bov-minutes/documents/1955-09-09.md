This institution will be based on the illimitable freedom of the human mind. For here we are not afraid to follow truth wherever it may lead, nor to tolerate any error so long as reason is left free to combat it

—From the first Rector to William Roscoe, 27 December 1820

I have ever found in my progress through life that, acting for the public, if we do always what is right, the approbation denied in the beginning will surely follow us in the end. It is from posterity we are to expect remuneration for the sacrifices we are making for their service, of time, quiet and good will

The Rector announced to the Board the action of President Eisenhower in appointing Mr. Darden to represent the United States Government in the United Nations, and the approval given during the summer recess by the Executive Committee to Mr. Darden's acceptance of this high responsibility.

Mr. Mears presented the Budget Requests for the 1956-58 biennium, and, as Chairman of the Finance Committee, moved their adoption as outlined in the nine-page memorandum, "Explanatory Notes, University of Virginia Budget Requests, Biennium 1956-58", copies of which were distributed to the Board. The Rector suggested that in future an effort be made to distribute these memoranda by mail in advance, so that the Visitors could give earlier consideration to them.

The Secretary was directed to send to each Visitor the names of the members of the Governor's Advisory Board on the Budget, who will visit the University on September 23rd.

Inaugurating discussion of the proposed budget, President Darden reviewed in detail its major features, commenting at length on the junior college at Wise and the role of the community colleges in meeting the expected doubling of college enrollments in Virginia by 1965, the need of State funds for research, the training program for nurses, the new office of Provost, and the proposed editing of the papers of James Madison.

The Board adopted the following resolution.

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the University's budget requests for 1956-58 be and they are hereby adopted, as approved by the Finance Committee and outlined in the memorandum, "Explanatory Notes, University of Virginia Budget Requests, Biennium 1956-58", laid before the Board

The Rector presented a letter from The Rev. John F. Byerly, Jr., Pastor of Saint Marks Evangelical Lutheran Church, of Charlottesville, announcing the construction of a church building, and thanking the University on behalf of the Lutheran congregation for the use of the University Chapel over the past eighteen months.

President Darden reported on a discussion he had held with a group of Charlottesville citizens regarding the drainage problem on Harmon Avenue which is affected by surface water from the Scott Stadium area. The Board resolved that the President be authorized to proceed in the matter at his own discretion.

In response to a report by President Darden that the Board of Directors of the Huntington Park and Mariners' Museum, in which the University has a contingent interest, desires to have a representative of the University added to its membership, the Board resolved that President Darden be delegated to serve in that capacity.

Opening a discussion of the Institute of Public Affairs and the desirability of continuing it as a public forum under the joint sponsorship of the University and of the Thomas Jefferson Memorial Foundation, the President referred to a recent conversation between Colonel Hartfield and Mr. Frank Houston relative to support of the Institute by the Foundation. The Board resolved that a special committee be appointed to pursue this matter, and the Rector accordingly named as the committee Colonel Hartfield and Mr. Berkeley, Colonel Hartfield to serve as chairman.

The Rector read to the Board a letter written to President Darden on August 25th by Dr. Albert G. A. Balz, Corcoran Professor of Philosophy, proposing that the named professorships in the University be disassociated from the chairmanships of departments and awarded only as a mark of special distinction to professors whose scholarly attainments were deemed to reflect unusual credit upon the University.

In the discussion that followed, President Darden said that he differed from Professor Balz only in his own feeling that the distinguished professorships ought to carry additional remuneration. There were general expressions of approval of the general plan. Members pointed out that further planning should include faculty participation either by thorough consultation or by the appointment of a mixed committee of Visitors and Professors.

The Board resolved that the Rector appoint a special committee to study the proposal.

President Darden presented a letter of July 15th from Mr. Donald G. Stevens offering to sell preferred stock in the Equitable Realty Corporation of Charlottesville, owners of the Gallery Court Motor Hotel and Howard Johnson's Restaurant.

It was ordered that this proposal be referred to the Finance Committee.

The President presented a letter from The Rev. C. Warner Crumb, Pastor of the Wesley Memorial Methodist Church requesting extension of the privilege of using the University Chapel until the Congregation can complete its own church building in 1956. Mr. Crumb's letter was accompanied by a letter from Professor McCasland to the Comptroller recommending approval of the request on behalf of the Chapel Committee. The Board adopted the following resolution.

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the Comptroller be and he is hereby authorized to grant on a conditional basis the request of the Wesley Memorial Methodist Church for use of the Chapel during 1955-56, provided that the following conditions are agreed to by the Congregation: (1) The University reserves the right to cancel the arrangement at any time upon thirty days' notice, (2) The University reserves the right to cancel use of the Chapel by the Methodist Congregation on any specific day when such use may conflict with University needs, and (3) The Methodist Congregation agrees not to request any extension of the arrangement beyond the calendar year 1956, and understands that the University is not willing to grant an extension beyond that date.

President Darden presented to the Board a recent correspondence of the Comptroller, the Director of Seward Forest and Mr. C. F. Allgood, covering the application of the Mecklenburg Electric Cooperative for an easement to construct an electric line across part of the Seward Forest. Both Mr. Estes and Mr. Shea recommended approval of the request.

The Board resolved that the President either proceed with this matter at his own discretion or delegate authority to the Comptroller to do so, but not until an opinion is obtained from the University Attorney as to whether easements are included under the new legislation requiring specific approval by the Governor.

In the absence of Mr. Talbott, Chairman of the Athletics Committee, Mr. Coxe laid before the Board copies of the "Report of Receipts and Disbursements, Intercollegiate Athletics, for the Period July 1, 1954 to June 30, 1955". It was ordered that this Report should not be submitted to the Director of the Budget until it should be studied and approved by Mr. Talbott.

Mrs. Smith moved on behalf of the Committee on Buildings and Grounds that the house on McCormick Road formerly occupied by Dean Abbott be assigned to Professor George P. Wilson. The Board resolved accordingly that the house be assigned to Professor Wilson.

Mrs. Smith reported further that her Committee had acted during the summer to select brick for the new building being constructed for the Army Judge Advocate General's School

The President and Mrs. Smith commented on the progress being made on the new Rucker home.

The Board adopted the following resolution

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the resignation of Miss Lucy Timmerman, Instructor in Psychology, be and it is hereby accepted. We wish for her the highest success in her new undertaking.

The following resolution was adopted by the Board:

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the following persons be and they are hereby elected to the faculty:

Mrs. Dorothea W. Dauer, Acting Assistant Professor of German and French at Mary Washington College, at a session salary of $3,800, beginning in September, 1955.

Mrs. Elwyn Lee Means, Instructor in History at Mary Washington College and Resident Counselor, as of September 1, 1955, at a salary of $3,240.00 per session.

Miss Veronica Maz as Instructor in Sociology and Resident Counselor at Mary Washington College, as of September 1, 1955, at a salary of $3,240.00 per session.

Miss Carmen Lucila Rivera, Instructor in Spanish at Mary Washington College as of September 1, 1955, at a session salary of $3,240.

President Darden, on behalf of Mr. Howard, who was unavoidably absent, led a discussion of the Budget Requests for the 1956-58 biennium as laid before the Board and recommended for approval by the President and by the Committee on the College.

On motion of Mr. Mears, duly seconded, the Board adopted the following resolution:

RESOLVED by the Board of Visitors of The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia that the Mary Washington College Budget Requests for the 1956-58 Biennium be and they are hereby adopted as approved by the Committee on the College and laid before the Board.

The Rector reported that the Executive Committee had met during the summer to hear an appeal by a student who had been dismissed by the Honor Committee. This unfortunate matter had been settled without interferring in any way with the principle of student control of the honor system, and a record of the hearing had been placed in the files of the Board.

The Rector reported that he had received further correspondence from Mr. Fred C. Abbott, attorney for William Houchins, but he did not feel that the Board needed to give further consideration to the matter.

The Rector commented on the outstanding work accomplished during the summer by the special Committee appointed to select an executive head of the College.

Referring to the Resolution of 10 June 1955 proposing a change of title for the administrative head of the College resident in Fredericksburg, the Rector appointed the following special Committee to present this Resolution to the General Assembly:

Mr. Gray

Mr. Mears

Mr. Coxe, Chairman

Mr. McWane said that he was not yet ready to present the report of his Committee, but that the very large number of candidates considered had now been reduced to six persons, it was the plan of the Committee to hold interviews with each of these persons during the next two days, and that these interviews ought to enable the members of his Committee to narrow their choice to one man. Mr. McWane said that he would be ready to present his report at any time thereafter at the pleasure of the Board.

On motion of Judge Barksdale, duly seconded, the Board thereupon resolved to cancel the meeting scheduled for November, and to hold a special meeting on Saturday morning, September 24th, at 10:00 o'clock to receive the report of Mr. McWane's Committee and make a final decision.

On motion the meeting was then adjourned.
