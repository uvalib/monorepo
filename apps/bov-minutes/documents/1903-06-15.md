The following correspondence &c in regard to the "Henry Coalter Cabell Scholarship in English Literature" was ordered to be recorded in connection with the resolution appended thereto:

I beg to transmit to your honorable body the enclosed memorandum and letter with the information that Mrs. Claiborne and Capt. Cabell have established in the School of English Literature a scholarship to be known as the Henry Coalter Cabell scholarship. Their decision is the result of an exchange of letters between Mrs. Claiborne and myself in which she expressed their desire to provide here some memorial of their lamented Father and in which I had the privilege of proposing several plans.

Mrs. Claiborne requested that the scholarship be established in the Department of English Literature & under the conditions set forth in the memorandum and modified by her letter. I make bold to suggest that both the memorandum and the pertinent portions of her letter be recorded.

I had hoped very much to see you during the Educational Conference last week, and had I known you would return to the city from the University of Virginia, I should have made an effort to see you on Sunday; as it was, I had but a glimpse of you on the platform on Sunday night.

I enclose the memorandum you sent me some time since which entirely meets with my approval and enclose checks for twelve hundred dollars for the establishment of a scholarship. Will you kindly place them in the proper hands?

I thank you very much for all your kindness in this matter, which both my brother Captain Henry Cabell and myself very greatly appreciate.

All that you have recommended meets with our entire approval except- we would like the scholarship open to all irrespective of wealth or position and not to be confined to those young men who need financial aid.

I presume if at any future time we desire to increase the amount of this Scholarship there will be no difficulty in so doing.

With very sincere appreciation of all your kindness in aiding me in this matter,

May First - 1903.
