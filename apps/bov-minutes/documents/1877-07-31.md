At a called meeting of the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia held on this day, July 31st 1877, there were present the following members, viz. Messrs Bocock, Conrad, Goode, Marye, Randolph and Whitehead.

In the absence of the Rector, on motion, Mr. Bocock was chosen as Rector pro. tem., who thereupon called the Board to order and they proceeded to business.

On motion the following resolution was adopted:

Whereas the Board of Visitors of the University having been called together by the Rector at the instance of the Executive Committee to take into consideration special matters pertaining to the finances of the University and having met and organized in pursuance of said call- Resolved that the Secretary of the Board communicate this information to the Chairman of the Faculty with the request that he present before the Board any matter he may have for their consideration, if anything there be.

A copy of the foregoing resolution was sent to the Chairman of the Faculty who soon thereafter waited upon the Board and informed them that he had nothing to submit for their consideration at this meeting.

On motion- Resolved that the lawyers of the Board of Visitors be and are hereby appointed a Committee to consult with the Miller Board as to the best mode of obtaining the money for the ten thousand dollars of Bonds guaranteed by them.

On motion Messrs Marye, Goode and Whitehead were appointed as the Committee under the foregoing resolution- The Committee retired and after consultation and consideration submitted the following as their report:

The Committee of the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia to whom was referred the subject of raising the funds requisite to meet the engagements of the Board, in reference to the Museum of Natural History recently established at the University, have had said subject under consideration, and submit the following       Report

In view of the fact that the Board of Visitors have been entirely unable to negotiate their Bonds with the guarantee given by the Miller Board under their resolution of the       day of 1876 we do recommend that the said Board of Visitors, shall execute and deliver a mortgage on all the personal property of the University other than that held in trust by them, under the Deed from the Central College dated the 27th day of July 1818; which mortgage shall secure the payment of the principal and interest, on Eleven thousand and five hundred dollars of said Bonds- ten thousand dollars of which shall be secured to said Miller Board, if the payment thereof shall be required, under the stipulations and provisions hereinafter contained. Upon the execution and delivery of said mortgage, which this Committee deems legal and proper to be made, they recommend that the Miller Board shall purchase ten thousand dollars of said Bonds, selling if they think it proper, Bonds of the City of Richmond to raise the funds therefor- Said Sale and purchase being in the estimation of this Committee, nothing more than the Exchange of one valuable security for another equally valuable.

We further recommend that the Miller Board shall not collect the interest on said Bonds amounting to ten thousand dollars, so purchased and held by them, so long as they may cooperate with and sustain the University of Virginia, but that they will treat said interest as only a fair equivalent to the University for the benefit and advantage derived to the Miller School from the annual use of the Museum of Natural History, to which the proceeds of said Bonds are to be applied.

We also recommend that the interest on the Bonds of the Virginia Central Rail Road, held by the Miller Board, shall, as fast as the same may be collected, be applied to the redemption for the benefit of the University of the Bonds of that institution held by the Miller Board as aforesaid, unless at any time it may be agreed between the parties, that the Miller Board shall hold said Bonds as an investment, collecting interest on them yearly, in which event, the said Miller Board shall pay to the Board of Visitors, an amount of money equal to the amount of the Bonds so agreed to be held as an investment, and that the Miller Board do alter and amend its resolution of the 11th day of April 1876, so as to make it correspond with these arrangements.

And finally we recommend that the Board of Visitors do present a memorial to the Legislature of Virginia at its next session, asking for the passage of an act ratifying and approving the mortgage, stupulated herein to be executed by said Board of Visitors.

All of which is respectfully submitted. Signed

Jno L. Marye Jr
