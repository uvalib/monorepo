On motion, the report of the Committee was unanimously approved by the Board, on condition that the total expense for plans, specifications and supervision, other than that furnished by the owners, does not exceed 5% of the contract price.

The Board, on motion, decided to employ a landscape architect of approved standing to make a plat of the contemplated buildings on the University campus, locating on this plat the dormitory or dormitories and academic building.

On motion, the New Buildings Committee is authorized to employ a landscape architect and to go forward in preparations for the erection of the buildings and report to the Board its action hereunder.

Committee: Rinehart Williams Scott McIntire Hull

The request of Mr. Robert C. Taylor, donor of the Timing System now being installed in the University buildings, that said system be named the "Francis H. Smith Timing System," after the "Grand Old Man of the University," was unanimously approved.

The President submitted a report on the request of the faculty for change in payment of salaries. The same was read, and the following resolutions relating thereto were adopted:

For a number of years it has been the policy of the University to pay the salaries of its administrative officers and members of the teaching staff, above the grade of instructor, on a yearly basis in monthly installments on the first of each month. This practice arose from the payment of salaries to its professors in large part from the fees from their respective students, being made in quarterly payments. Later this was changed to five payments per session and, finally, to monthly payments in advance when students' fees were no longer allocated to professors' stipends. This policy of payments in advance was also justified by reason of the fact that the State's appropriation to the University was received in monthly allotments on the first of each month for the current month.

When the Reorganization Act became effective on March 1, 1928, the State authorities declined to continue the practice of payments of personal service in advance, basing their course on the law which prohibits the State Treasurer from making payments to persons for services rendered until the services have been actually rendered.

Upon learning of this ruling, the General Faculty, feeling that they would be seriously inconvenienced by the change in policy, met and discussed the situation, and passed a resolution requesting the President of the University to change the plan of salary payments to nine for the session instead of twelve for the fiscal year, basing their request on the grounds that they were employed for a session of nine months and that they were entitled to their pay in nine installments.

This plan was presented to the Governor and his administrative heads and was agreed to for the future. As to the remainder of the present session, an agreement was reached whereby the State Treasurer would pay four-ninths of their salaries; one-ninth on the first of March, April, May and June, respectively. And, beginning with the session of 1928-29, to pay the salaries in nine installments beginning with October 15th and continuing to June 15, 1928. The State Treasurer stated that he was prohibited from making salary payments in advance; but, that for the present session, in view of the fact that the faculty had covered, to March 1, 5-1/2 ninths of the session's work but had received only 5-1/2 twelfths of their pay, it would be agreeable to pay from the State Treasury four- ninths of said pay.

To accomplish this change in policy and, at the same time, not to exceed the State's appropriation for salaries for the fiscal year beginning March 1, 1928, the University will be required to pay from its funds to its teaching staff, for the two and one-half months from July 1, to September 15, the remainder due them for the session of 1927-28. The amount due each member of the faculty, above the grade of instructor, is 7/72nds of his salary for the session, amounting to the sum of $27,000.

As the University has no surplus funds out of which to meet this emergency expenditure, the amount will have to be carried as an addition to the existing deficit until such time as the State can be induced to make an appropriation to clear it from our books, or until it can be cared for by some other means.

I beg to submit the accompanying resolutions to dispose of the several matters referred to.

That the action of the President in changing the salary installments to members of the faculty from twelve for the fiscal year to nine for the academic year, for the remainder of the session of 1927-28, be, and is, hereby approved.

That the President be, and is, hereby authorized to pay the remaining 7/72nds of the salaries due the members of the faculty for the session of 1927-28, from July 1, to September 15th in three equal installments, July 1, August 1, and September 1st, respectively; and, that to meet this emergency expenditure the sum of approximately $27,000 is authorized to be carried as an addition to the existing deficit until such time as funds may be available from State appropriation, or other sources, to cancel the same.

That the salaries of the members of the teaching staff, beginning with the session of 1928-29, be paid in nine installments; the first to be paid on October 15th, and the last on June 15th, in each session.

The request of Dean Page that the regulations concerning payment of \`students' fees, General Catalogue, page 129, be amended by the insertion of the following, was adopted:

"The above regulation will also apply in the case of any student, who owes a fine to the University Library and who permits the fine to remain unpaid for fifteen days."

The request of T. J. McLaughlin, with respect to placing a memorial window in a church in West Roxbury, Mass., by the University of Virginia as a memorial to his late wife, Mary Austin McLaughlin, was considered, but it was not deemed wise to establish such a memorial. The matter of a suitable memorial was left with the President.

The New Buildings Committee submitted a report, showing the financial situation with respect to the new medical group, the contracts that had been let, the work in progress, etc., which was read and ordered filed.

It was stated to the Board that the Virginia Teachers Association desired to defer to next fall, not later than October 1, paying the remainder due on its pledge toward the construction of the Preventorium at the University. The delaying of said payment was agreed to by the Board.

The following action was taken in the matter of lease of the Tea Room in the Entrance Building of the University:

RESOLVED, That the proposed contract for the rental of the University Tea Room to Mrs. W. V. Nance for a period of five years, beginning March 1, 1928, at $165.00 per month, be and is hereby approved, and the Rector is authorized to sign the same on behalf of the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia.

The Rector stated to the Board that a compilation of all the Statute Law Of Virginia, affecting the University, has been completed by Mr. Berkeley Minor and Mr. James Fontaine Minor, both of whom are Alumni of the University, and presented by them to the University, which compilation has been heretofore ordered printed by this Board, and is now in the hands of the printer.

It was thereupon

RESOLVED, That the labor performed by Mr. Berkeley Minor and Mr. James Fontaine Minor for their Alma Mater, involving the examination of all Acts of Assembly from 1802 down to and including the Extra Session of 1927, and the transcription of all relevant matter, is of the greatest value to the University, to its Officers and to this Board. Through their painstaking efforts the records of the University have been richly added to, and the Rector and Visitors now desire to record their appreciation and express their sincere thanks to these gentlemen for their generous gifts.

A request was presented to the Board on behalf of Farmington, Incorporated, by which said Company asked to be allowed to lay and maintain a six-inch pipe line from the City main at Dawson's Row, across aportion of the University's grounds, and to locate upon said pipe line a small booster pump, as shown upon the plat of Lee H. Williamson, Consulting Engineer, attached to said petition.

It was also shown to the Board that this request had been investigated and approved by the Committee on Buildings and Grounds, and by Dr. W. A. Lambeth, Superintendent of Buildings and Grounds. It was thereupon

RESOLVED, That said Farmington, Incorporated, be, and is hereby, granted the privilege of construction and maintaining the pipe line and pump upon the location shown upon said plat, upon the distinct condition, however, that said pipe line and pump shall be removed, or relocated, by said Farmington, Incorporated, its successors or assigns, at any time in the future upon the request of this Board.

In other words, the right so granted is a mere license and shall not be construed as creating an easement or vested in said Farmington, Incorporated, its successors or assigns.

(Mr. Rinehart was excused from voting on the foregoing as he is a member of the Board of Directors of the said corporation.)

Mr. W. Allan Perkins, Attorney for the University, stated to the Board that two former patients of the Hospital, Clarence Twitty and B. W. Humphries were asserting claims for personal injuries received while patients of said Hospital, and asked for instructions in the matter, whereupon the following resolution was adopted:

RESOLVED, That all questions arising out of the claims of Clarence Twitty and B. W. Humphries against the University Hospital be and are hereby referred to a Committee composed of the President, the Attorney for the Board, Mr. Rinehart and Mr. McIntire, which Committee is hereby given full power to act.

The question of whether or not it may be more economical to produce the electric current used by the University or to purchase same from the Virginia Western Power Company, was brought up, and, on motion, the following was adopted:

RESOLVED, That the Engineering Department of the University be requested to make a study of the question of producing or purchasing electric current and report to this Board with a statement of comparative costs of same.

The President presented the budget for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1928, which was considered by the Board by items and by sections, and approved in following resolutions, which were unanimously adopted:

RESOLVED, That the budget for the University of Virginia for the fiscal year 1928-29, presented by the President, be and the same is hereby approved, and the increases in salaries as shown therein are recommended to the Governor for his approval in accordance with the provision of the Act of the Legislature of the session of 1926.

That the appropriations therein contained for personal services shall be payable as follows:

For officers of administration and administrative employees, deans and directors of departments, the appropriations are for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1928, and shall be paid in twelve monthly installments beginning July 31, 1928:

For the members of the teaching staff of the regular session, the appropriations are for the session beginning September 15, 1928 and ending June 15, 1929, and their salaries shall be paid in nine equal installments; the first of such payments to be made on October 15, 1928:

For the members of the teaching staff of the Summer Quarter, the appropriations are for the quarter commencing June 19, and ending September 1, 1928, and the same shall be paid at the close of each of the terms of the said Quarter:

In order that the appropriations made for contractual services, supplies, materials, equipment, etc., to the several departments and laboratories may conform to those made in the State budget, in so far, as may be practicable, the same shall be for the State's appropriation year, beginning March 1, 1928 and ending February 28, 1929, and any balances that may have been either to the credit or debit of such laboratories as of March 1, 1928, shall be cleared from the said accounts.

Note: for 1928-29

On motion the meeting then adjourned.

For a number of years it has been the policy of the University to pay the salaries of its administrative officers and members of the teaching staff, above the grade of instructor, on a yearly basis in monthly installments on the first of each month. This practice arose from the payment of salaries to its professors in large part from the fees from their respective students, being made in quarterly payments. Later this was changed to five payments per session and, finally, to monthly payments in advance when students' fees were no longer allocated to professors' stipends. This policy of payments in advance was also justified by reason of the fact that the State's appropriation to the University was received in monthly allotments on the first of each month for the current month.

When the Reorganization Act became effective on March 1, 1928, the State authorities declined to continue the practice of payments of personal service in advance, basing their course on the law which prohibits the State Treasurer from making payments to persons for services rendered until the services have been actually rendered.

Upon learning of this ruling, the General Faculty, feeling that they would be seriously inconvenienced by the change in policy, met and discussed the situation, and passed a resolution requesting the President of the University to change the plan of salary payments to nine for the session instead of twelve for the fiscal year, basing their request on the grounds that they were employed for a session of nine months and that they were entitled to their pay in nine installments.

This plan was presented to the Governor and his administrative heads and was agreed to for the future. As to the remainder of the present session, an agreement was reached whereby the State Treasurer would pay four-ninths of their salaries; one-ninth on the first of March, April, May and June, respectively. And, beginning with the session of 1928-29, to pay the salaries in nine installments beginning with October 15th and continuing to June 15, 1928. The State Treasurer stated that he was prohibited from making salary payments in advance; but, that for the present session, in view of the fact that the faculty had covered, to March 1, 5-1/2 ninths of the session's work but had received only 5-1/2 twelfths of their pay, it would be agreeable to pay from the State Treasury four- ninths of said pay.

To accomplish this change in policy and, at the same time, not to exceed the State's appropriation for salaries for the fiscal year beginning March 1, 1928, the University will be required to pay from its funds to its teaching staff, for the two and one-half months from July 1, to September 15, the remainder due them for the session of 1927-28. The amount due each member of the faculty, above the grade of instructor, is 7/72nds of his salary for the session, amounting to the sum of $27,000.

As the University has no surplus funds out of which to meet this emergency expenditure, the amount will have to be carried as an addition to the existing deficit until such time as the State can be induced to make an appropriation to clear it from our books, or until it can be cared for by some other means.

I beg to submit the accompanying resolutions to dispose of the several matters referred to.
